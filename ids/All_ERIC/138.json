        "author":["Lane, Frederick S."],
        "description":"This report considers the tenure system and its relation to academic freedom and focuses on Florida and the University of Florida. Role conflicts between faculty and administrators are presented including a discussion of viewpoints over budget allocations. An overview is given of the position or role attributes, status, and functions of the departmental chairman and an examination is undertaken of attitudes toward tenure and the tenure process. The paper concludes with a two part discussion covering: (1) recognition by the chairman about the nature of disagreement over departmental management as related to the tenure process; and (2) an analysis of role conflict resolution in decisions on academic tenure.

        "description":"This paper considers the needs and operations of the &quot;interaction sciences,&quot; areas of study that attempt to investigate the relationship of basic fields of knowledge to specific environments, in contrast to the &quot;knowledge sciences.&quot; The differences in goals, facilitating environments, and provisions for service are discussed. The knowledge sciences are seen as essentially increasing the basic systems of knowledge in a laboratory setting, while the interaction sciences increase the conceptual systems by providing a field for interaction of the knowledge fields and the environmental circumstances where there is constant interaction with the environment. The problems faced by researchers in the two &quot;science&quot; areas and the major role of interaction sciences in higher education are  also presented. These include: (1) the development of tools that can be adopted by the more basic sciences for their own use in furthering research; and (2) focusing on problems that need research for a more complete evolution of the basic sciences. The paper concludes with a discussion of the problems that need solution before an effective environment for educational research can be realized. (AF)",

        "author":["Brannon, Gerard M."],
        "description":"This paper explores some questions about the use of income for determining repayment of educational loans. The plans generally call for a level of repayment to cover the initial advances, plus interest for a college graduate with average income, but would require less than full repayment for the students with low income, and over full repayment for students with high income. The recommendations from the Zacharias Report are reviewed, one of which is a buy-out feature whereby the successful student can minimize excess payments by opting at any time for repayment on a straight loan, 6% compound interest, basis. The question that must be answered is: where on the continuum of loan plans, from the straight bank loan to the pure contingency loan, do we want to be? To address this  problem, the question of income as a good measure of liability is examined, including that of nonworking wives with education loans, and the conclusion is reached that an income tax on successful borrowers, as a means of covering losses of the loan fund, appears less fair than a general tax. Some implications of a contingency loan fund are examined in terms of the size of the loans, and some questions are asked that must be answered before a definite policy decision is made. (AF)",

        "author":["Sherriffs, Alex C."],
        "description":"The author feels the public's confidence in higher education is at a low ebb, a big change from 6 years ago when higher education had universal respect. The problems and upheavals that have plagued the campuses in the last few years can be traced to at least five causes. First, the presence of a majority of the public who were silent, confused, and went along with the minority of highly motivated, hostile, articulate, and irresponsible students and faculty members who created much of the problems. Second, the presence on many campuses of irresponsible and influential faculty members, who have the administration cowed, and who have used their power to further their own ends. Third, the background of many administrators who are often ex-faculty members and are not management  oriented. Fourth, the presence of coercive groups on campus whose aim is to produce conflict. And fifth, the myths that circulate in society about the campus, such as rampant sexual promiscuity, the generation gap, and student approval of violence as a means to bring about change. These problems have to be faced: students should be respected, but not pampered; the administration should be more responsive to the overwhelming majority of non-militant faculty members; and coercive groups should be controlled so that they don't interfere with the rights of others.

        "description":"This report presents the results of the Fall 1969 statewide survey of the post-high school plans of Florida high school seniors. The students were asked to fill out the instrument: Plans Beyond High School, which requested information of college bound students on the type of institution they planned to attend, whether they planned to go to an in-state or out-of-state institution and their main reason for attending college. Students not planning to attend college were asked their main reason for not doing so, their plans after high school, and whether they planned to attend college later. Those undecided about college were asked their main reason for being undecided. College bound students were also asked to mark the institution they planned to attend. In addition to presenting  all the statistical results, this report discusses post-secondary enrollment trends in the state, and analyzes the results in terms of total population, race, sex, 1968 results, intended plans versus actual courses of action, and the non-college bound students and the undecided ones. The final section of the report compares performance on the Florida Twelfth Grade Test of students planning to attend an in-state institution with students planning to attend an out-of-state institution.

University or college administrators must recognize the search for identity among black students as real and vital, that the black students need their Afro-American Societies and their Black Student Unions. It is recommended that black students be provided with facilities, advisors, financial support, and the opportunity to have meaningful dialogue with both faculty and administration. Furthermore, it is felt they need an education more suited to their needs and professors capable of teaching material relevant to blacks. The  author feels that black students cannot be categorized with \"white revolutionaries,\" because, unlike them, the black student desires to participate constructively to solve the many problems facing his community and the nation.

        "author":["Tetlow, William L., Jr."],
        "description":"There are variables in existing grading systems that limit their effectiveness as generalized indicators of academic performance. For example: (1) the multiplicity of grading systems now in use create interpretive dilemmas for educators and students alike; (2) attempts to standardize encounter resistance, which hinders a common approach; (3) present numerical and quality-point averaging systems fail to account for substantial grading differences that exist among the various departments of an institution; and (4) rank-order academic standings of heterogeneous student groups, based upon grade-point or quality point averages, often give a misleading index of student achievement. The Standardized Transformation of Academic Grades (STAG) approach attempts to solve these difficulties  by converting existing quality-point or numeric averages into a normalized and standardized scale. A conversion equation is devised for a particular reference group based upon actual grade distribution data obtained from class rank lists. The resulting &quot;transformed&quot; grade has the advantage of standard degrees of mean value and variability, permitting a more valid interdepartmental comparison. Since the conversion is accomplished post-facto, the necessity to enforce any pre-set grading standard is avoided. (AF)",

The main idea was to put together an analysis of educational resources and demographic characteristics as one additional way of judging how higher education serves the population. Chapter 1 discusses the new meaning of equal opportunity and the developments of the 1960's that affected college admissions. Chapter 2 describes the procedure with which the degree of accessibility of all colleges was rated with respect to selectivity and cost, and how each free-access college with an appropriate commuting  radius was plotted on detailed state maps. Chapter 3 is concerned with the colleges themselves -- how many and what types there are at each level of accessibility and where they are located. Chapter 4 describes the populations living within commuting distance of the free-access colleges. Chapter 5 describes the accessibility of higher education in each state, and the implication of the state profiles are discussed in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 considers the problem of relevance and suggests a framework for improving relevant educational opportunity. The final chapter summarizes the study. (AF)",

Some of the major findings were: The performance of transfer students prior to their transfer and the 2-year cumulative GPA of Hofstra natives were almost the same; however, both in the 3rd and 4th year, the GPA of the transfers from 2-year colleges was significantly lower than the GPA of the two other groups. The GPA of the transfers from 4-year colleges and that  of the Hofstra natives did not differ significantly in the 3rd and 4th year, and their 4th-year GPA also tended to be much higher than their cumulative 2-year GPA's. The 3rd-year GPA of 2-year school transfers tended to be lower than their 2-year cumulative GPA, while their 4th-year GPA tended to be similar to their cumulative GPA. A higher percentage of the 4-year school transfers and Hofstra natives tended to graduate than the 2-year school transfers.

        "description":"One of the essential factors in the economic development of nations is the attainment of a manpower mix which is strategically suited to current development problems, and which will also provide a catalyst for improvement and change. A review of the literature indicates that, although education per se is important, individual countries must practice different strategies of manpower development at different stages in their economic development. The thesis of this report is that for Southeast Asian and developing nations in general, middle manpower development, and the kinds of institutions needed for such development (technical colleges, junior colleges, post-secondary vocational schools, business colleges, nursing schools, etc.) should be given top priority in the decade ahead.  In this report the importance of middle manpower is discussed in general and in Southeast Asia in particular. A brief overview is given of economic development in Malaysia, followed by a look at Malaysia's economy. Malaysia's present manpower mix is discussed in detail, as well as the country's educational system and its commitment to manpower development. The report concludes with a proposal for the establishment of a system of comprehensive junior colleges designed to meet Malaysia's manpower needs. (AF)",

Comparisons are made on the net gain or loss for men and women in six departments: Education, English, Speech, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics between the years 1955 to 1956 and 1968 to 1970. Men gained in all 6 departments, women in 1: Education, and lost in the other 5. It appears that in not one single department do women equal or outnumber men in the senior ranks. In the rank of associate professorships in some departments women equal or outnumber men, but  they seem to be unable to break through to the level of full professorships. (AF)",

The keynote speaker, whose remarks are included, addressed himself to the nature of the urban revolution with emphasis on the plight of the individual in seeking self-identity. Following this speech, participants broke up into 10 groups that concentrated on certain problem areas. Some concerns of these workshops, all of which are listed here with some of their recommendations, included how the junior college can provide a climate of freedom with responsibility, how it can aid the urban student, how it can create innovations in curriculum, and how it can improve human relations. Workshop recommendations were sent to  appropriate groups at Los Angeles City College. A progress report on the school's reactions to these recommendations is a part of the report. From remarks of conference speakers, it can be concluded (1) that one of the major characteristics of the urban revolution is a reaction against the increasing complexity of occupational and status interrelations and (2) that all members of the junior college community should make an effort to understand the nature of the urban revolution and act accordingly.

Once the idea of designing such a program has been accepted, planning in terms of what media and equipment to use, what facilities and personnel are available, and how to finance and maintain the program are important considerations. Another factor in constructing a multi-media program is the writing of the lessons. The fourth section of this paper includes case studies of existing multi-media programs in shorthand and typing, mathematics, biology, and English.

To elicit the desired data, the Instructor Behavior Questionnaire was administered to 315 students and instructors in an Oregon community college. The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Two-Sample Test was then applied to the data to determine the level of significance of difference in reactions of the six groups included in this study. Mean response scores were also computed to measure the intensity of reaction to the role norm statements on the questionnaire. Analysis of these data  indicates that both students and faculty had the most intense feelings on the &quot;Personal Relationships&quot; section of the questionnaire. On the basis of this finding, the author suggests that further research in this area should concentrate on variables to identify personal relationships between instructors and students.

Because of this commitment, the college decided to examine student attrition in the business program. A general review of the literature suggests that remedying certain problem areas in community colleges might reduce their high attrition rates. With these possibilities in view, Nassau Community College proceeded to identify the reasons for dropouts from various business programs. Data were collected from school records and a questionnaire (included in an appendix) and interviews were conducted with the heads of business departments at eight other community  colleges. Combining these data, the authors present findings, conclusions, and recommendations for such questions as admission criteria for business students as compared with other freshmen, performance of students with or without business courses in high school, reasons for going to college, schools to which business students transferred, and job placement after attending Nassau.

Communications, humanities, social science, natural science, career planning, and reading were the six study areas that were approached through interdisciplinary courses. Instructional teams of six (one from each study area) were responsible for a group of 100 students. Three such groups composed vertical teams; they used block scheduling. Courses emphasized the student's knowing himself, his environment, and his place in future society. Field trips, guest speakers, and team activities  were facilitated by block scheduling. The program attempted to provide the student with a total environment. General conclusions show that Basic Studies students persist in college at a higher rate than do students with similar characteristics attempting the traditional remedial approach. Tables and figures are used to explain findings and reports of the three vertical teams are included.

The state of Florida excludes junior colleges both from public school education and from higher education. New York state also provides for junior colleges, but without specifically describing their functions. California includes junior colleges in the category of secondary education, a term more broadly applied than in the traditional sense, for technical schools, adult schools, and junior colleges are included in  this category. Besides state legislation, several court decisions showing the interpretation of this legislation are also presented. Many of these decisions represent an attempt by the courts to apply an innovative concept to a traditional frame of reference.

To begin with, most reported uses of the typical achievement or aptitude test appear to ignore such critical elements as: (1) factors influencing the size of the validity coefficient, (2) descriptors of the sample used for correlations, (3) the standard error of estimate, and (4) standardized regression coefficients (betas) in the actual regression equations. In addition, past research has demonstrated that little can be meaningfully added to high school GPA as a predictor of college success. A more appropriate alternative  is to determine entry-level skills required by a particular course or curriculum, and to develop procedures that permit evaluation of these skills. This encourages course and curricular admission criteria to be related as closely as possible to course content, rather than to a construct called academic aptitude (a construct whose only operational definition is a test score). Such an approach can be implemented through counseling and encouraging students to attempt only those courses for which they have a high probability of success. (JO)",

The objectives of this program focused on familiarizing the individual with the college environment, fostering independence in program participants, and creating a desire in participants to continue their education beyond the programs conducted by Miami-Dade Junior College. This, the Second Annual Career College Report, analyzes activities and programs in which 82 high school dropouts participated. Several of the remedial courses taught in this program are outlined and evaluated. Programs such as Upward Bound, the Guthrie Job Corps, and the Illinois Curriculum Teaching Social Studies, designed to help students from low-income families acquire a  college education, are evaluated. Seminars and conferences on various aspects of education are also discussed and analyzed. Student scores on the Kuder Occupational Interest Survey are presented in tabular form and analyzed. Surveys and questionnaires used to elicit both student and teacher opinion on certain aspects of the Career College are included in the appendices. See ERIC document ED 038 119 for a report of the first year operation of Career College. [Because of marginal reproducibility of original, this document is not available in hard copy.] (RC)",

        "description":"Differences between 20 transfer program persisters (p) and 23 non-persisters (np) on five measures were investigated to identify elements that might characterize persistence. The subjects consisted of freshmen enrolled in the transfer program at Crowder College (Missouri) during the fall of 1967. A comparison of each group's composite School and College Ability Test performance shows similar percentages scoring between 71-80, but a clearly greater percentage of persisters scoring between 51-70. Results on the Survey of Interpersonal Values suggest that the groups are more alike than different, with most scores clustering around the &quot;average&quot; category on five of the six values. Both groups scored somewhat lower in the leadership category. Subsequent enrollment in a 4-year college  or university was reported for half the non-persisters and three-fourths of the persisters. Seventy-five per cent of the persisters' mothers and 82 per cent of the non-persisters' mothers completed high school. Most subjects in each group (p--80 per cent; np--56 per cent) wanted to attend college and were supported in this decision by both parents; however, 17 per cent of the non-persisters did not want to attend, but were encouraged to do so by at least one parent. While generalizations about indicative characteristics are limited because of the small sample size, the nature of the results suggests that replication of the study on a larger level would be valuable.

The purpose of this comparison was to differentiate between the two groups through questionnaire responses indicating general characteristics, reasons for attending the junior college, appraisal of services offered by the college, and attitude toward the college environment. The sample consisted of two groups--100 male students in each--who entered the college in the fall of 1968. Response rates of 76 and 49 per cent were recorded for persisters and non-persisters, respectively. Chi-square tests for significance at the .05 level were applied to questionnaire responses. On general information items, no significant response differences were noted.  The group of persisters differed significantly from non-persisters in selecting more often &quot;preparation for a better paying job&quot; and &quot;encouragement by people outside the college&quot; as reasons for attending a junior college. Appraisals of the college's services and environment showed persisters significantly more negative about a required general orientation course and significantly more positive about instructor assistance, campus recreational facilities, and emphasis on cultural and intellectual pursuits outside the class. The two reasons most often selected for leaving the college were &quot;that another school would offer more of what I was interested in,&quot; and a general feeling of &quot;not getting anywhere.&quot; (JO)",

This somewhat oversimplified basic approach is taken in order to avoid the confusing terminology and jargon which seem to haunt this field. The source can be any data source, including a computer system, which is transmitting data through a medium to a data sink. The medium is everything between the source and sink. The sink is often assumed to be a computer system but this is not necessarily true, since it can be a paper tape, punched cards or a central processor. The evolution of each of these three basic elements within the 10-year  time frame is discussed in detail in the most elementary terms and graphically shown by figures and diagrams.

A test of TEXT-PAC as a data base for full text searching capability was conducted, and the limiting factors of the TEXT-PAC system were explored. Because of its large data base and full text processing capability, the COMPENDEX system performance is  reasonable.

The two major postwar social changes that have most directly affected libraries are: (1) population changes in growth, distribution and quality; and (2) increased investment in scientific research and development. Four postwar developments in communications have had major effects on libraries: (1) the creation and widespread distribution of paperbound books, (2) the growth of newsmagazines as the dominant printed news medium, (3) the rise of television, and (4) the development of new technology in information storage, retrieval and dissemination. Two important ways in which libraries will be able to meet the challenges of the future  are by the use of computers to automate the library's acquisitions, cataloging, circulation, inventory and statistical work and by going out, both psychologically and physically into the community which is to be served and learning to operate in terms meaningful to those they are trying to reach. It is the librarian's responsibility to use the new technology whenever it is useful, to raise and broaden professional standards, to develop broad and imaginative patterns of national cooperation, and to express a keen and pervasive sense of the library's enlarged social commitment.

The conclusions of the study, which can serve as a model for public libraries throughout Indiana, indicate that the public library has little relevance to the information needs of the adult population. The well-educated housewife is the major user, few men make use of the library and the library is  not meeting the self-education or reference functions set as its major reason for existence.

To facilitate presentation and analysis of the data in this report, 14 state planning regions were used. The relevant geographic regions section defines Indiana's economic regions, discusses administering Indiana's libraries on a regional basis, and the feasible regions for public libraries in Indiana. This is followed by a discussion of the library and information services now available in Indiana's public, school, institutional and business libraries. A look at the future demand for library services precedes the equating of present and future demand for library services. Appendix B states the equation  used to predict future circulation. (NH)",

Also, 75% of the respondents indicated they experienced no difficulty with the network's operational procedures. Since 6% of the institutions using KOMRML's document delivery service  accounted for almost 60% of all transactions, the policy of &quot;free&quot; interlibrary loan service becomes questionable.

The study makes a marketing and systems approach to the problem of measuring and projecting the demand for library services, and of developing recommendations as to facilities and capital costs required, and thus permits application of some new methods and measures. Among the innovative features are the development of the measure, &quot;user-visits&quot; to quantify library usage on a uniform basis for each library and branch; and the measure, &quot;index of space utilization,&quot; to evaluate the intensity of usage relative to  public space available in each library; and the classification of library visitors by census tracts of their home residences to define the &quot;Primary Service Area&quot; of each library and branch. It is hoped that the methodology here developed, with ensuing refinements, will contribute significantly to library planning in the future. (Author)",

Each of thirty-five disadvantaged Negro children (31 in nursery classes and 4 in elementary classes) was pair-matched with a middle class child. In the disadvantaged group, 17 children were attending nursery classes for the first time. Pre- and posttests were made of cognitive ability, on the Stanford-Binet, Piaget tests of length conservation, and sociometric features. Also, children were rated by testers on performance and by teachers rated classroom behaviors. Data from previous years on some of the children were used in reference to long term change. Part I  (nursery school) test results show that neither first nor second-year children significantly increased their I.Q. scores. Both disadvantaged and middle class children scored similarly on task orientation. Middle class children showed more friendship choices forming across social-class lines. Part II (elementary school) results present limited support for the theory that children who continue in Montessori, rather than public, school will show better school achievement. Data included school records of more than 30 children. A future study will investigate diffusion effects on mothers and younger siblings, and testing with measures more directly relevant to Montessori curriculum. (NH)",

The middle class child, compared to the lower class child, generally exhibits: (1) better language comprehension and expression, (2) richer schema development, involving mental preparation for the unusual, (3) stronger attachment to the mother, making him more receptive to adoption of her values and prohibitions, (4) less impulsive action, (5) a better sense of his potential effectiveness, (6) more motivation for school defined tasks, and (7) greater exceptation of success at intellectual problems. Data from two studies are offered in support of some of these hypotheses. One, a longitudinal study of 140 white, middle and lower class involved observations of their reactions at 4, 8,  13, and 27 months of age to masks with scrambled facial features. The other, a cross sectional study of 60 white, 10-month-old middle and lower class infants involved home observations of mother and child behaviors and laboratory observations of children's reactions to meaningful and non-meaningful speech, and to mothers' and strangers' voices. To bring about improved developmental patterns, it is important that lower class mothers be shown how they can become effective change agents in their children's lives. (NH)",

Subjects were 72 rural white disadvantaged and advantaged children and their parents who were assigned to three treatment groups: developmental language, structured language, and placebo (workshop). Mothers met in 12 weekly 2-hour instructional sessions with teachers, using specific materials developed in teacher-directed workshops. (These meterials were not used in the Head Start program during the experimental period.) Pre- and posttests on a variety of measuring instruments evaluated children's intellectual, linguistic and self concept performance. Also evaluated was the quality of mother-child interaction and the mother's storytelling ability. Results of  the study support the major hypotheses which predicted improvement in language performance, intellectual performance, self concept development, and mother child interaction, as a result of a differentiated parent education language program. No program approach was clearly superior but mothers in the specific content oriented intervention program increased their own verbal and linguistic skills as well as the quality of interaction with their children. Children whose parents work with them appear to have a learning advantage. Appendixes comprise more than 1/3 of the document. (NH)",

Failure avoidance would be shown in CD children because of expectancy for and tolerance of failure in response to early environmental conditions which lack achievement motivation, with the opposite true of NCD children. Subjects were 24 NCD and 20 CD first graders. The NCD children were enrolled in a private school attended by upper middle class children, and the CD children were enrolled in a public school attended by lower class children. Each  group included two Negro children. Each subject was individually given two puzzles to assemble within certain time limits. Failure was experimentally induced on one puzzle experience because the experimenter announced the time was up before puzzle completion, but success was allowed on the other puzzle experience because as much time was given as was needed for completion. After an interim period, the subject was asked which puzzle he would like to make again. An analysis of the repetition choice data upheld the original hypothesis and concomitant statement. (NH)",

Answers to two questions of practical importance were sought. Given that the training program developed by Sigel and associates positively modified the cognitive skills of lower class children, could the materials be adapted for younger children without losing the character of the training? Also, could the program be carried out by Head Start teachers rather than research project personnel? Two classrooms in each of two independent programs (Detroit and Pontiac, Michigan) administered classification training and matching placebo (language  training) along with attention training and its placebo (perceptual motor training). In each location, one classroom was used as a pure control. Teachers were selected from a well qualified volunteer group. A total of ten teachers and 160 children participated in this field test. A core battery of measures employed by the 1968 national Head Start evaluation model was given and supplemented by measures critical to this program design. A typical pre- and posttest research design was used. See companion paper PS 003 428 which discusses the actual training inputs and PS 003 430 which presents the statistical analysis and results.

Two additional programs, stressing cognitive skills were designed to increase proficiency in such areas as verbal fluency, following instructions, manipulative activities, and classification. Cuisenaire rods were used in the arithmetic program,  scheduled daily for one-half hour. Three major areas of skills (intelligence, language and pre-reading, and social maturity) were assessed by a battery of pre- and posttests. Significant gains were shown in the areas of language, speech, pre-reading and arithmetic, and in the ability to handle abstract concepts. Children will be assessed again at the end of first grade to find out if gains are being maintained. Results of tests assessing social maturity were inconclusive. (NH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to test training techniques designed (1) to induce conservation of discontinuous quantity in children, and (2) to induce ability to take different social roles. Also tested was this hypothesis: successfully training children in conservation will improve their ability to take different social roles, and conversely, successfully training children to take different social roles will induce conservation in them. A heterogeneous sample population of 103 children (aged 45 to 64 months) was given a battery of tests to measure grasp of correspondence, conservation, physical perspective, and social role play. Children were placed in 8 heterogeneous groups. Each of seven of these groups was given a 6-week training program involving a different combination of  three basic conditions: reversibility-reciprocity, physical perspective-taking, and social role-play. The eighth group (control) was given no training. Subjects were posttested on the pretest battery. Results indicate that reversibility-reciprocity training does induce conservation of discontinuous quantities in children, and that improvement in children's social role-taking ability is more closely associated with reversibility-reciprocity training than with other kinds of training.

        "description":"One hundred and sixty first grade boys and girls of normal intelligence were tested for ability to conserve multiple space relations. The criterion task apparatus was a wooden T with a model of schoolhouse attached and centered above the point of contact of the horizontal and vertical axis. The T had a track running the length of both its axes along which a small car could be manually directed. The child was asked to reproduce the space relations represented by the examiner's configuration by directing the car and/or rotating the T. An analysis of task-related errors supported Piaget's notion of representational space and the importance of particular field configurations. A figure's relative position was highly important to successful performance whereas absolute orientation was  a secondary factor. More difficulty in reproducing space relations was experienced by the children on a 180 degree transformed field than in 90 degree right and 90 degree left rotations. An explanation for the manner in which reversals of symmetrical figures may occur was also presented. Results suggest that the ability to form and retain a flexible and reversible memory image may be of paramount importance in the acquisition of a horizontal-vertical system. (Author/WY)",

Of the 24 factors used in prediction, exclusive of age and sex, the total raw score of the MRT (which can be given to groups of eight or ten children) administered at the end of kindergarten appeared to be the most practical predictor of performance as measured by  the Stanford Achievement Test at the end of the first primary year. Only slight improvement in prediction was gained by using combinations of tests in the Complete Assessment Battery, with MRT subtests. (Author/NH)",

A complete assessment battery (ITPA, PPVT and tests of auditory discrimination, visual-motor integration and motor coordination) was given individually to 103 boys and girls before they entered kindergarten. The children were identified as excellent, good, or average achievers by a tabulation of grade equivalent scores on the Stanford Achievement Test given at the end of the first primary year. Analysis indicates that ITPA-3 which measures ability to complete verbal analogies,  differentiates between achievers in 11 of 12 comparisons. There appears to be a threshold in certain reading and arithmetic skills which separates the excellent and good achievers from the average, and for which sex differences are shown. More developmental skills tests differentiated the three groups of achievers in arithmetic than in reading, and differentiated among boys more than girls. Girls who rated average in one aspect of achievement tended to maintain an average level in other aspects of achievement. (Author/NH)",

The research effort began in 1963 upon receipt of a three-year Ford Foundation Grant. As a first step, a survey was conducted among teachers to identify problems of major concern. Learning problems of children proved to be a high priority item. Research literature related to the learning problems of children affecting development of skills in motor, multi-sensory, visual, cognitive, and language areas was intensely examined between 1963 and 1965. In 1966, a grant from the federal government made possible the establishment of experimental prekindergartens for 100 four-year-olds in two  consecutive years. Discussed in this report are: early local research findings: interim end of year findings; resulting program impact; prediction of achievement and logical reasoning to strengthen learning; Teachers' interest in research; and discussion. References, two bibliographies, and an appendix highlight background source material. (WY)",

        "description":"In this study of the professional image of 21 preschool teachers in a single urban community, participants were first observed in program settings and later interviewed. Study findings are based on interview results. Teachers worked in six different types of programs (representing half day and full day care) and public and private nursery schools. All teachers were female, 19 to 66 years of age; educational level ranged from completion of ninth grade to master's degree level. Subjects were asked to name traits associated with being a \"professional\" and all but six referred to these four: adequate training, accreditation, work as a vocation, autonomy in decision making. Most teachers defined their occupational group as professional, and almost half the group described themselves  as full professionals. Professional self image seemed directly attributable to the amount of education attained. A lack of teacher agreement on the ranking of basic goals in preschool teaching reflected the fundamental disagreement among leaders in the field. Lack of confirmation of the importance of shared values and norms appears to handicap development of a professional image. Findings suggest that development of a professional self image occurs relatively early in the process of professionalization. (NH)",

All children were presented a three-part successive discrimination task; original learning, presentation of incidental stimuli, and a test of recongition and recall of the incidental material. One-third of the subjects at each age level learned the original task (intentional learning) under one of three reinforcement conditions; Right-blank, Right-Wrong, or Wrong-blank. Contrary to prediction, there were no age differences in incidental recognition or recall (previous studies had found a curvilinear relation between age and incidental learning.) Although the main effect of reinforcement condition was not significant for trails to  criterion on intentional learning, children of all ages who learned the original discrimination under the Wrong-blank condition showed significantly higher incidental recognition and recall than subjects tested under the Right-Wrong and Wrong-blank conditions. Results were discussed in terms of the effects of a Wrong-blank reinforcement procedure on the child's attention to the task. (Author)",

The wide range of educational and occupational levels of people working in the field of early childhood education necessitates different treatments of the same message. Moreover, there is a need for more feedback between the researcher and the practitioner to direct research to the salient problems and to make the results of research more useable. The ERIC Clearinghouse on Early Childhood Education (ERIC/ECE) is an information analysis center which serves as a synergistic information link between resources and the users of resources. The  role of ERIC/ECE as a disseminator of new idea, new research, and new products is discussed in relation to the overall goal of providing better education for children.

The children in the experimental group participated in daily half-hour group sessions for a period of seven weeks during which they were given systematic language training, based on reinforcement principles. The children in the control group continued to participate in the regular Head Start program. Upon conclusion of the training period, all children were re-tested, with the measures used in the pre-test. Significant improvements in scores on the part of the experimental  group were found for decrease-in-verb-omission on the Story Telling Test and for the vocal-encoding sub-test of the ITPA. Pronounced sex differences were apparent. Girls in both groups showed improvement for decrease-in-verb omission and for vocal-encoding. Among the boys, only those in the experimental group improved; those in the control group showed some decrease in scores. Discussion of results suggests the possibility of a cross-sex effect.

This mixed history of accomplishment and failure has not been satisfactorily explained by traditional analyses. The solution of regional problems requires earnest and careful study and the development of programs suited to the particular conditions in each case. The important objectives of a regional development program should be (1) investment of those public facilities which are most likely to promote private investment and thereby employment in the region and (2) utilization of general and vocational education in manpower development programs.  The appropriateness of recommendations will vary from one subarea of Appalachia to another since priorities within a given area are determined by its prospects for industrial development. The intention of general recommendations is to cut across industry lines and specify public activities which are generally useful in making areas attractive to public employers.

Data for the report were from 2 separate sources: a survey conducted by the Training Center with the assistance of the Mille Lacs community action program (1967) and an attitudinal survey conducted by Victoria Holbert during 1969. The 1967 survey included 68 adult Indians in the sample, while the 1969 survey included 26. The socioeconomic and attitudinal data reviewed in the 2 surveys point to a &quot;typical reservation of backwardness and mainstream isolation.&quot; The surveys reveal that Indians stand no chance of individual or group development unless the inequities of education, occupation, income, and related variables are erased.

        "description":"In a secondary analysis of longitudinal data for white, originally second-parity couples resident in 7 large Standard Metropolitan Areas in 1957 (Princeton Fertility Study), the processes of educational, occupational, and economic achievements of a subset of 715 males are considered. Of primary concern is the extent of rearing in farm or rural as opposed to urban residential contexts as these influence educational attainment up to the initial interviews in 1957 and the successive socioeconomic achievement during the followup interval, 1957-67. For metropolitan males with farm or rural contexts of rearing, an educational handicap is incurred to their occupational and economic careers which men of urban backgrounds do not suffer. The fewer years of schooling attained by urban males  of nonurban backgrounds is explicable in part by the relatively larger sizes of their families of origin. Moreover, when father's occupational status, size of the family of origin, and years of schooling completed are controlled statistically, the residential variable has no direct net effects on successive occupational and income career achievements. These findings are generated from regression and path analytical models of the process of stratification. Supplementary analyses within background residential categories consider potential effects of differential fertility on the socioeconomic achievements and potential interaction effects. (Author/EL)",

Some basic conclusions were that widowers are more  isolated and less self-sufficient than widows; that 9 out of 10 widows live on a money income of less than $2,000 per year and thus must rely on additional outside monetary assistance; and that the widow is more active in church participation than the widower.

In addition, a non-Indian control group consisted of 168 youths (92 males, 76 females). The working hypothesis was that the scores for the 2 instruments for each Indian student would correlate highly. A coefficient of reliability was computed by the split-half method for each instrument. For the purpose of assessing the  validity of the instruments, the original split-half reliability estimates were used. It appeared that while the 2 instruments could not be said to have measured exactly the same theoretical construct (i.e., phenomenal self), they did appear to have measured aspects of the same constructs.

Interviews and group discussions with members of each organization comprising the CCRD were accomplished in addition to other generalized data-collection and analysis activities. Specific topics studied included problems in rural development, how CCRD member organizations are working toward a solution to these problems, objectives of rural development programs, methods for implementing the programs, the  Agricultural Rural Development Act (ARDA) and rural development, and the role of the CCRD. The study attempts to show the basic organizational approaches to the solution of nationwide problems related to fostering improvements in Canada's vast rural areas.

        "author":["Havighurst, Robert J."],
        "description":"As a part of the National Study of American Indian Education, the self-image of the Indian student was evaluated with the Semantic Differential (SD) in terms of attitudes toward self as well as toward other persons or institutions. Study groups were expected to describe themselves in favorable, neutral, or derogatory terms. The SD used in the study was partially identical with a form used with teenagers in Chicago, Buenos Aires, Kansas City, and Puerto Rico, thus allowing for comparison of non-Indian boys and girls of the same ages in Chicago and elsewhere. The instrument, as noted, asked for a rating of several concepts including Myself, My Future, Teachers, This School, Indians, Indian Way of Life, and White People's Way of Life; it also included several pairs of adjective  scales which included Good-Bad, Happy-Unhappy, Strong-Weak, and Active-Lazy. It was believed that if Indian youth were severely alienated and if they were antagonistic toward teachers and schools, the SD would reveal these differences. The study concluded that, given a like socioeconomic status, Indians have about the same level of self-evaluation as non-Indians. Some evidence indicated that Indian girls are slightly more self-critical than Indian boys. A list of the various tribes included in the study from Alaska to North Carolina is given, along with the number of participants and scores derived from each correlation. Tables of statistics are appended. (EL)",

        "description":"There are an estimated 10 million Spanish-speaking Americans who constitute the second largest minority group in the nation. Included in this group are Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Life styles of the Spanish-speaking Americans, who were here before the Pilgrims, did not change significantly with the arrival of the Northern European cultures. However, the conflict which developed between the cultures has severely affected the social conditions of the Mexican American, his descendents, and the recent Mexican migrant. The Mexican American is looked upon as the remnant of an alien culture and an interloper on what had once been his ancestors' soil. Statistics and attitudes poignantly reflect the nation's social and political neglect of the Mexican American and other  Spanish-speaking people. In 1969, the Federal Government created an inter-agency committee on Mexican American affairs: the Cabinet Committee on Opportunities for Spanish Speaking People (CCOSS). Activities of CCOSS are concerned with manpower and equal employment opportunity, economic development, housing, community and neighborhood development, education, comprehensive social and rehabilitative services, public affairs, and research.

The program was designed to offer art instruction from a master teacher to students enrolled in high schools with limited financial resources. Instruction in art was provided by joining a number of widely separated small rural high schools into a conference situation in which all units of the system, including the instructor, were served by a common, 2-way-communication, amplified telephone service. The necessary telephone lines were leased at a special conference service rate for 50 minutes per week. In accordance with a prearranged schedule, the telephone conference operator initiated the necessary line signals to  bring all participating schools and a master teacher into a joined, open-line communication setting. Each school was equipped with a telephone amplified receiver and transmitter so that students in any area of their classroom could hear all conversation and could also initiate oral responses. In addition to the amplified telephone equipment, each participating school was equipped with an overhead projector, 35-mm slide projector, tape recorder, and projection screen. The program operated for 2 years and was considered a pioneering success for the Western States Small Schools Project. Eight appendices are included. (AL)",

Companion objectives of the project were (1) to endeavor to integrate the publications into curricula and other educational processes of schools, (2) to reverse the self-fulfilling tendencies of low expectations for Mexican American students by enhancing self-esteem, (3) to make it possible for the teacher to understand the culture the child  brings to the school, (4) to disseminate the publications and films to the general public, and (5) to evaluate an ongoing basis the impact of the materials on various audiences and to suggest directions for future efforts. According to the document, one can conclude that the purposes were accomplished. More important, however, the project has pointed out how little those people who work with the Mexican American know about his culture, his heritage, and the obstacles he faces. (EJ)",

Proposals which have been written on bilingual programs were examined in terms of staff development, and additional information was gathered by a questionnaire which was sent to each bilingual project in California. Correlations are given between size of grant awarded in funded programs and the amount allocated for staff development. Additionally, information  made available by various program proposals and data obtained by the study questionnaire indicated that more work should be done in the areas of linguistics, evaluation, and human relations. It was also concluded that there seemed to be a positive correlation in the size of grant awarded and the amount expended from the grant for staff development.

The project--carried out in the County of Lacombe in Alberta, Canada--made 2 aides available to all teachers on a first-come-first-serve basis. Due to such constraints as a short life-span of the project, a small number of observed teachers, and a possible lack of consistency in observers' recordings, conclusions are not put forward; however, trends are noted. Teachers appeared to have spent less time in school after aides were introduced; teachers varied in ability and willingness to make use of the aides' services; and teachers appeared  to allocate less time to clerical tasks after the aides were introduced. Students perceived that teachers were better prepared after the aides were introduced and felt that the aides were more understanding of students than were teachers. Community members were generally supportive of the program but expressed a need for more school-to-home communication. This report is not intended to show correct or incorrect ways of utilizing aides but should be viewed as being feedback which will assist the teachers concerned in any modifications deemed desirable.

Some 750 adult students were selected from 10 communities in New Mexico. Information was gathered with the use of 2 forms. One form was filled in by the students and consisted of open-end questions designed to get answers on goals, needs, motivation, and student characteristics. The second form consisted of attendance charts kept by the teacher for 12 weeks. Results of this study showed that the students could be grouped into 1 of 3 goals categories: (1) the student who wishes to learn how to speak, read, and write  in the English language; (2) the student who wishes to obtain better employment opportunities; and (3) the student who wishes to pass the General Educational Development examination. Findings indicated that attendance and motivation were high in categories 1 and 3 but extremely low in category 2. This led to the conclusion that attendance and high motivation are directly proportional to the nearness or achievability of one's goal. (Author/LS)",

Findings indicated the following: (1) the length of the total passage must be considered; (2) sequential constraint did not differ for modern and traditional mathematics books; (3) sequential constraint varied between topics, which implies that no value of sequential constraint can be assigned to ME; (4) an inverse relationship existed between sequential constraint and grade level; (5) there was more constraint in the deductive style of writing; and (6)  there was an inverse relationship between sequential constraint and reading comprehension of ME. Implications for teaching would place greater emphasis on topics having high constraint since such topics were associated with lower reading scores, and topics having low constraint might be developed in greater depth since they were associated with higher reading comprehension scores.

With the development of many new materials and devices, problems relative to meeting the needs of each child may be compounded. There is danger that the child may become isolated from what should be a community of learners. Reading as a social process is developed through social context. This includes a need for relevancy. Instead of enclosing learning within the four walls of the classroom, the outside world--the child's real world--can be brought in through the use of newspapers, film-making, research, current magazines, and other activities and materials. Whether a language-experience approach or a basal reader approach is used, reading materials can be selected which have  meaning for the student. For learning to take place most effectively, it is necessary that the teacher and student together organize and structure a student-centered environment. Two important qualities of the teacher who can encourage this type of structure are (1) creativity and (2) the ability to develop a questioning attitude in her students which will lead to their making decisions and choice.

When proper names, onomatopoeic words, and easily recognizable inflected forms and compounds were omitted, there were only 3,220 different words in all of these books. A frequency count of these different words revealed that just 10 words account for almost one-fourth of all running words, 25 words account for over one-third of all running words, and 188 words account for almost seven out of 10 of all running words. It was suggested that  systematic teaching of these high-frequency words would help insure that children have the background needed to read library materials of their own choosing at an early age.

IPI is characterized by continuous progress, skill mastery, subject matter achievement, programed or computerized instruction, systems analysis, and behavioral objectives; IRP is characterized by discovery learning, learning to learn, personal growth, self direction, individual productivity, and self selection. The difference is not one of structure (prescribed) versus unstructure (personal) but rather one of the nature of structure. The second major concept, a delineation of the structure needed to succeed in IRP,  consumes the balance of the presentation. There are six identifiable steps in IRP which, when followed successfully, will lead to productive reading. These six steps are discussed and include (1) classroom environment, (2) silent or quiet reading time, (3) instructional guidance, (4) book talks and conference time, (5) skills development (uninterrupted sustained silent reading), and (6) record keeping and evaluation for the benefit of the learner.

Error patterns of children were also analyzed. After presenting some characteristics of the language and reviewing previous studies, the methodology was described. The sample size ranged from 407 to 461 children who were matched for age, sex, and academic performance. The 1,851 different symbols or characters compiled from survey returns were incorporated into 30 prose passages of 100 characters each (with about 40 percent recurring characters) and recorded on tape. Taped explanations of the passage content preceded three repetitions of the passage during which the children listened, transcribed, and  reviewed. From the accumulation of correct and incorrect responses, a facility index was derived for each of the 1,851 characters. It was concluded (1) that 719 characters were reproduced by at least 70 percent of the children and should be regarded as the minimum core of written vocabulary at this level and (2) that the mean number of strokes for characters of median difficulty was 14. Further research in auditory reception of language and encoding of the symbols received is recommended. References are included. (CL)",

They were given prototypic passages about the making of aluminum as rewritten by typical fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders and skilled adults, exhibiting syntactic characteristics of the average performance at each age level. Every fifth word was deleted, and no paragraphs contained the first or last words deleted. The test was given without verbal  instructions or assistance, and no time limit was set. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that grades 4, 10, and 11 differed significantly between the four levels of writing. Fourth, fifth, and sixth graders read fourth-grade writing best; eleventh graders read it with least facility.

(3) Practical solutions include the use of a variety of materials, instruction by a well-informed teacher with a knowledge of the developmental and sequential nature of the reading process, and provisions for adequate practice. (4) To be successful, the teacher must be aware of how ethnic group  membership shapes the child's world. (5) Two key concepts of language to be developed in the child are an acceptance of the facts that there are a variety of language systems in our society and that standard English is the universal dialect in the child. (6) The successful reading program is dependent upon the interaction between the teacher, student, and materials. References are included. (WB)",

Because of the similar reading-disability syndrome at all grade levels in the urban school, the following general guidelines were recommended. (1) The reading teacher must know the life style of his students and respect and use it  as an instructional base. (2) He should know the basic pedagogy for teaching reading while remaining openminded and experiment-minded. (3) Sympathy and empathy for the personal and group needs of the students are necessary. (4) He must be in attunement with the present needs and future aspirations of the community. (CL)",

The teaching procedure was based on the Mills Learning Methods Test and was carried out by the researcher in a laboratory situation. Twenty-four hours later, a test of retention was given. As expected, good readers took significantly fewer trials to master nonsense syllables and retained more nonsense syllables than the poor readers did. However, no single mode of learning resulted in significantly superior  acquisition or retention of nonsense syllables for either good or poor readers as a group.

At the end of the 1968-69 school year, 56 kindergarteners, 31 first graders, 24 second graders, and four fourth graders were tested on their ability to conceptualize the sequential relationships of phonemes in both nonsyllabic and syllabic patterns. An auditory conceptualization test involving colored blocks to encode or represent the auditory patterns in three categories was developed by the investigators. Color was used to denote a repetition within a given pattern. The ability to judge sameness and difference and the concept of number to 4 were testing prerequisites. The categories tested were related to the nonsyllabic, simple syllable, and complex syllable levels. A descriptive analysis  of the findings was presented. A wide range of scores was found for kindergarten, grade 1, and grade 2, and the problem of auditory perceptual function continued into grade 4.

The subjects were 137 pupils in six first-grade classes in a middle-class suburban community in central New Jersey. Pretests of readiness and intelligence indicated no significant differences between groups before training. One group received 6 weeks of readiness training and 10 weeks of reading instruction; the other group received 16 weeks of reading instruction in basal readers and no readiness training. The students were given as post-tests the reading subtests of the Stanford Achievement Tests and the Metropolitan  Readiness Tests. It was concluded that omitting traditional reading readiness materials from the first-grade instructional program did not decrease reading achievement and may, in fact, have increased reading achievement. Therefore, it was suggested that first-grade reading instruction begin with formal reading lessons. A bibliography is included. (Author/NH)",

The Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the California Reading Test, and an informal cloze test were the measuring devices. There were no significant differences in the mean test scores at each grade level, and no significant trends were noted. Although girls and boys had similar average annual reading growth rates, the latter grew more sporadically. Product-moment correlations between tests showed the boys to be  more consistent than the girls. Significant differences in reading ability existed between students in South Brunswick from grades 4 through 8 and those who moved into the community. The boys who entered after the beginning of grade 4 were significantly inferior in reading to the students already there.

Present day pollution control methods utilizing primary and secondary waste treatment plants, lagoons, and septic tanks are described, illustrated, and evaluated. Eight categories of pollutants affecting our waters are given accompanied by the effect each has on man and the environment. Water renovation techniques involving coagulation-sedimentation, absorption, electrodialysis, and the blending of treated water are discussed. In addition, new challenges for waste treatment including reverse osmosis, methods of chemical oxidation, and the use of polymers are investigated.  Throughout, problems of water pollution control and waste disposal are presented to illustrate the need for planning, financing, and buidling facilities to meet governmental water quality standards. A glossary of common sewage treatment terms is included. (BL)",

The subjects for the study were 160 second grade children in the 90 to 110 IQ range from Northeast Louisiana. They were subgrouped by race and social class (lower-lower, upper-lower, lower-middle, and upper-middle) and were given the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), Revised Edition. Analysis of data resulting from this test indicates that: (a) Race and social class were significant factors in the pattern of psycholinguistic abilities. (b) Significant differences existed between the subsets of the test for the total sample, for races, for social classes, and for races by social classes. (c) The interaction of  race and social class was significant in the general test and by subtest. (d) The interaction of social class and subtests was not significant. (d) The interaction of race, social class, and the ITPA subtests was not significant. Based on the findings of the study, teachers should examine their teaching methods and materials to determine if they are appropriate to the patterns of psycholinguistic abilities of children in the classroom.

The scholars stated their photodocumentary needs in teaching and research, their methods of using photodocuments, and their difficulties and frustrations in finding the required materials. In addition, 29 test sets of slides from the Islamic Archives in Washington, D.C. were sent to professors in 12 colleges and universities for classroom use. Their written responses explain how a set of slides on a specific subject was used and what the  classroom results were. Representatives from three U.S. Government agencies also examined test sets and described their need for photodocuments. There was an &quot;overwhelming consensus&quot; that appropriate photodocuments are essential in teaching Near/Middle Eastern studies, that more and better photodocuments are needed, and that commercial sources are generally unsatisfactory. A limited investigation indicated that tourists and scholars would be willing to allow their slides and photographs to be duplicated and placed in a central repository. (Author/JD)",

Three different methods for measuring the quality of translations are examined: back-translation, knowledge testing, and performance. Translation costs and means of writing translatable English are also reviewed. It is concluded that: 400 words per hour is a reasonable speech expectation for technical material; quality of translation significantly affects performance, and  quality may be sampled by any of the means tested; costs can be reduced by several methods but seventy dollars per thousand words is a reasonable estimate.

Another problem is determining just what a language is. Appell's &quot;isoglot&quot; may be a better method of distinguishing different languages than &quot;mutual intelligibility.&quot; The Oceanic area is &quot;arbitrarily&quot; defined here to include the Australian, Papuan, and Austronesian languages. The number of languages in aboriginal Australia is over 200. All appear to be related, with approximately two-thirds of the continent originally occupied by languages of a single sub-group, Pama-Nyungan. The remaining sub-groups are in the northwestern part of the continent. No language relationships outside Australia have been established. Greenberg has  presented a detailed argument for a genetic grouping of the Papuan languages (noted for their great diversity), including the languages of the Andaman Islands, the extinct languages of Tasmania, and at least most of the Papuan languages. The Austronesian family is distributed among a considerable number of different political entities. There is still no general agreement on the earliest branching of Proto-Austronesian. The author comments on some typical features of these language groups. (These Working Papers constitute progress reports and are preliminary in nature.) (AMM)",

The use of duplex oscillograms, rather than sound spectrograms, permits faster production (real time) at less expense (adding machine paper may be used). The speech signal can be more spread out on a duplex oscillogram than on a sound spectrogram, increasing ease of segmentation; duplex oscillograms provide equally clear displays for speech of high- or low-fundamental frequency. Segmentation criteria are developed for /p, b, s, z/ occurring in initial and final position from the sound spectrogram segmentation criteria reported by Peterson and Lehiste (1960). Vowel duration measurements segmented from 64 sound spectrograms and  64 duplex oscillograms of the same CVC utterances are compared. The two sets of measures correlate .97, indicating that the criteria for the segmentation of vowels on duplex oscillograms presented in this paper are reliable. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"This document reports on a current project of the Institute of Education at the Uppsala School of Education, designed to evaluate the effects of extending English instruction in Swedish schools into the initial school years. Swedish schools presently offer an average of 3.5 hours per week of English in school years 4 to 9, a total average of 21 hours per week over the primary school years. The project here described aims to study the effects of (1) distributing these 21 hours among school years 1 to 9, and (2) increasing the total number of hours markedly (to about 30), concentrating these additional hours on the lower school years, especially the second and third. It is intended to measure the effects of such a program in terms of cognitive, psychomotor and affective functions  in English and other subjects, especially Swedish and Mathematics. The present progress report concentrates on the selection of the experimental groups, the tests used to measure the effects of the language program, and project plans for the immediate future.

An alternate approach, pragmatics, defined as \"the correspondence of linguistic forms to situational settings,\" is then presented. This approach, which stresses that language derives its value from its use alone, attempts to go beyond the sentence as an abstraction to the study of linguistic entities in a broader context. The implications of this approach for language teaching are briefly outlined. (FWB)",

Results of a series of studies aimed at a systematic investigation of college student satisfaction are described. A measure was designed and used to investigate the relationships between student satisfaction and other aspects of student life. Four hundred and sixty-three Iowa State University students were administered the College Student Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSSQ) which measures six dimensions of student satisfaction: (1) policies and procedures; (2) working conditions; (3) compensation; (4) quality of education; (5) social life; and (6) recognition. From the initial 139-item instrument administration and analysis, a 92-item revised form  was developed.

A sample of 310 male theological students served as a sample during the developmental stages. Ten dimensions, plus a check scale, were ultimately selected for inclusion. In anticipation of counselors' probable reactions, several questions were considered: (1) what about the IRAI's conceptual validity; (2)  how well will it differentiate among various occupational groupings; and (3) how valid and useful is it for working with groups other than males employed in church-related activities (which was the group used in establishing conceptual validity).

Major goals of the groups were: (1) to decrease isolation and separation between the races, thereby reducing distorted interracial conceptions; and (2) to help group members feel accepted as fellow human beings by members of both races. Group structure is considered on the basis of the author's experience. Such facets as recruitment, consistency, duration and content are included. The paper describes some of the major processes which occur in these complex groups. Among these are: (1) resistance to personal involvement; (2) dealing with the realities of community prejudice; (3) using personality differences as a means of undercutting racial separateness; (4)  physical activity; and (5) the value of racial identity in the evolution of group. cohesiveness. The role of the group leader during various stages of the group was closely scrutinized. The paper concluded hopefully that what is learned in such groups might be extended to the community at large.

Consequently, the roles of citizen groups as participants and collaborators have taken on increased significance. These citizens are asking, \"How much influence will they be allowed to exert in planning and implementing community mental health programs?\" This paper illustrates the issue by discussing the experiences and problems faced by legally authorized citizen area boards in Massachusetts since 1967 when a law reorganizing the Department of Mental Health went into effect to provide more effective comprehensive mental health and mental retardation services across the state. The composition of the boards is described and legal provisions concerning their  duties and powers are elaborated. The findings of a study conducted by the Department of Mental Health to ascertain area board involvement and concomitant problems and goals are discussed. Questions raised by the survey relate to: (1) power; (2) leadership; (3) community control; (4) money; (5) intergroup reconciliation; (6) planning; and (7) philosophies of service delivery versus community and social change. A discussion about the future of citizen area boards in Massachusetts concludes the paper. (TL)",

Specific problems in all three areas are described and the results of a program, initiated to offer meaningful solutions, are discussed. The Young Mothers Educational Development (YMED) program was set up to provide intensive medical, psychological services for low income, pregnant adolescents and their infants. All services were combined under one roof in an effort to provide a comprehensive, meaningful, yet non-clinic type, program. Obstetrical, social and educational data was collected. An effort was made to assess infants' behavioral style and mother-child interaction. General results in all areas were encouraging:  (1) incidence of premature and small-for-dates infants was reduced; (2) the educational success rate was high; and (3) social service data, were favorable. The infant and mother-infant interaction data were viewed as baselines for future investigations into developmental problems.

The material presented in this handbook focused on procedures used to prepare trainees for tasks previously identified as appropriate for support personnel. The paper emphasizes the need for systematically organizing the learning experiences of the trainees and delineates five \"sub-systems\" from which instructional units can be devised: (1) orientation and readiness; (2) standardized testing program;  (3) referral and child study; (4) small group and classroom guidance; and (5) cooperative activities with counselors. All five sub-systems are explained in terms of their purpose, training procedures, behavioral objectives and performance expectations.

This study attempts to determine the number and nature of factors which account for students' perceptions of teacher effectiveness. The Teacher Image Questionnaire, used by Western Michigan University's Educator Feedback Center, was sent to 1,427 teachers representing all academic fields in grades 7-12 from a five-state midwestern area. This procedure yielded 42,810 student responses which were factor analyzed. A single factor,  labeled teacher charisma, was found to account for 61.5% of the variance in test items. Five other factors accounted for the balance. It was concluded that teacher charisma is probably a function of teacher effectiveness, but that student ratings would best be used as only one part of a total evaluation package which measured additional variables. The limitations, strengths, and meaning of student reactions to teachers are discussed. A brief description of the work of the Educator Feedback Center is included. (TL)",

        "description":"The author initially cites the associationistic position of Spiker and the perceptual learning position of E. Gibson and concludes that the existing data does not clearly support either hypothesis. He describes a new approach designed to test these explanations of the role of verbal pretraining on subsequent discrimination learning. It consists of verbal repetition (satiation) of the names previously learned to the objects. Fifty-one white middle-class preschoolers were subjects. The procedure was extensively outlined and included three phases: (1) Discrimination Training; (2) Satiation; and (3) Criterion Task. The data collected was clearly in accord with the predictions from perceptual learning theory and contrary to those of associationism. The author concludes, however,  although Gibson's position was supported, it lacks a specificity of mechanism which seems, at present, to preclude a very direct test of it.

Drawing from the behavioral sciences made it possible to conceptualize higher education as a developmental community with available \"power factors\" for promoting desirable changes in students. The necessary information to construct and revitalize such a community is outlined and leads to a general model of behavioral intervention. The central unit of the community would be an \"operational research\" unit called a Center for Student Development. Three kinds of staff would be included: (1) behavioral scientists; (2) staff skilled in behavioral intervention; and (3) staff concerned with interpreting the accumulating knowledge to the college.

Five adjacent rural school district superintendents proposed a project to determine the feasibility of providing psychological and social work services in a sparsely populated area. Planning Phase 1 sought to answer questions concerning: (1) the extent of the need; (2) current services and their adequacy; and (3) the level of community understanding of problem children. It was decided to provide: (1) diagnosis and treatment of children with problems; and (2) an in-service training program for teachers regarding mental health concepts in the classroom. Additional objectives emerged during Planning Phase 2. Staff procurement and constitution and  budgetary allotments are included for all phases. The actual operational years, with their numerous objectives based on the findings of the planning phases are fully discussed. Implications and suggestions for the future of rural school psychology are offered. The research reported herein was funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. (TL)",

The strengths and weaknesses of the innovative program are clearly indicated. Because the project was not designed  as a research experiment, and because of the subtle nature of success, evaluation was viewed as exceedingly complex.

The role of the counselor is first considered, should the counselor exert influence over clients? In any interpersonal relationship, people influence and control one another, counseling relationships are no different. The basic issues of counseling are: (1) a counselor's right to intervene in the life of another; (2) the counselor's responsibility to do all he can to accomplish the goals set up for his client; and (3) the counselor's right to a role which is appropriate for each client, rather than being the same for all clients. The necessity of engaging in action-oriented activities to influence client's behavior so that the client resolves  his problems is the underlying rationale for behavioral counseling. The basic tenent is that behavior is a function of its antecedents. The counselor helps the client change the way in which he responds to certain situations which elicit his unwanted behavior so that the client may function in the effective manner he desires. (KJ)",

        "description":"A laboratory study was performed with four levels of discovery and two levels on an overlearning factor. An improved experimental paradigm was chosen so as to avoid a number of confusions which have obscured previous research. An operational definition was developed for discovery and guided discovery and discovery teaching, and inquiry learning. The results of the study show that overlearning has a considerably more powerful effect on transfer than does discovery. Over-learning seems to be an important condition for the transfer of a discovered principle, not because the principle is apt to be discovered during overlearning but because a certain amount of practice is necessary to make the discovered principle available for transfer.

A total of 10 students were taken from the total fifth and sixth grade population who had been tested. These 10 were assigned to each of six groups: (1) one led by a white counselor; (2) one by a black counselor; (3) one by a black and a white counselor; (4) three control groups of the same composition. At the end of eight weeks, these subjects were post-tested on  the same instruments as before. Findings include: (1) no differences in the mean gains in intergroup attitudes among the six groups; (2) no differences in gains in attitude between the counseled groups and control groups; (3) no differences in the mean gains in attitudes between any of the three experimental groups. The study produced no significant findings that would show group counseling to be an effective means of alleviating racial attitudes. (Author/KJ)",

Technique is the impediment to creativity in counseling. The person who functions as an effective counselor functions from within, relying on the same resources from which flows creation. Since this process is not intellectual, or cognitive, the process of creation is intimately involved with risk-taking. In group experiences, the counselor must be a part of the group himself. The emergence of group activities has been directed at providing personal growth experiences, and the counselor must take up the task of creating a situation where these goals might be achieved. The Problem-Reactive Approach is presented as the  looking for a problem and then reacting to it. Most counseling centers operate on the \"repair\" basis. The proactive approach involves everyone, its primary function being to aid the development of more fully functioning whole persons. Counselors must take this responsibility and become an integral part of education, dedicated to the development of competent and complete human beings. (KJ)",

As Maslow points out, basic needs come first; drastic changes in the school are necessary. What is the role of PPS in this change? Decisions must be made as to role, goals, power base. \"The PPS Administrator as an Agent of Change\" presents a discussion of the problems that lie ahead in PPS. Among these are the developing of a total climate conducive to mental health in the total school. The great increase in knowledge in the PPS area is another problem. PPS are  good, but must be better. Better management and coordination are essential, particularly with the possible use of computer technology. Unless the PPS director does take an active role as an agent of change, he will be bypassed and possibly eliminated along with the service he is supposed to administer. (KJ)",

The article concludes with a brief discussion of the external system of employers, and the internal system within the counselors own agency. In both cases, the counselor must be aware of changes that are necessary. In the article \"The Employment Counselor and Humanistic Psychology\", two points are brought out: (1) optimism is needed; (2) approaches and programs should be developed geared toward working with people in terms of where they are and what they need. Humanistic psychology needs to shed its idealism and behaviorism needs to shed its conceit so that from the two,  problems may be solved which are now facing employment counselors. \"A Social Engineering Approach to Employment Counseling\" explains that employment counselors to be effective must concern themselves with the total personality function of their clients and must also be adept at creating and maintaining an effective counseling relationship. To do this, they must go beyond typical procedures and become actively involved in social engineering in order to meet the needs of their unique clientele. (KJ)",

There are costs and risks, as well as potential gains in greater student participation. There are also costs and risks to denying student participation. While defending the prerogatives of the faculty with regard to curriculum planning in the fields of specialized, preprofessional training, students should be involved in working out effective ways of accomplishing the real objectives of liberal education. Reasons for student involvement include: (1) faculty often solve curriculum problems by adding  courses; (2) often faculty have no skills for curriculum development; and (3) the experience and insights gained by these students who do help plan will become part of the student culture. Problems that are possible with student planning include: (1) many students feel they cannot change anything around them; (2) students become entrapped in their own organizational patterns; (3) students are anxious for adult approval; and (4) a sense of impermanence hovers over student groups.

Consistent with earlier studies such nonintellective, nongraded outcomes of the educational experience cannot be predicted from the measures currently used to predict college scores. In another approach to the problem, a group of 46 males and 32 females who entered the University of Washington in the fall of 1968 as part of a special minority group program were compared with a matched group of 49 males and 34 females. Although admitted  through normal procedures their performance on the WPC had indicated they were high-risk. After three semesters their scholastic performance was compared. Those in the special minority program did far better than their WPC scores had predicted while the matched group did as expected. However, the achievement of the minority group covered a wide range and suggested that the effects of the program may be highly variable in terms of individual students. (Author/KH)",

The present volume deals with family background factors and abilities as they relate to a variety of personality characteristics, behaviors, and plans for the future. The population is derived from the initial sample of 2,200 tenth grade boys. The chapters concern the following areas: Chapter One presents an overview of the research design, sample, and procedures; Chapter Two defines eight major family background dimensions; Chapter Three presents the interrelations among them; and Chapter Four relates them to intelligence and other ability dimensions. Chapters Five through Ten present a series of analyses in which the eight family background dimensions plus intelligence are related to  a large number of criterion dimensions. Finally, Chapter 11 summarizes the findings by taking each predictor dimension in turn and looking at its effects on the criteria. (Author/EK)",

Subjects were grade school children in a metropolitan area of southwestern Michigan. Estimates of the information processing rate were obtained by tachistocopically presenting two stimuli to the subject. The interval between the stimuli required by the subject to process the first stimulus was that subject's information processing rate. Social class was quantified using Duncan's \"Socioeconomic Index\". Data analysis involved use of the Pearson correlation, multiple regression technique and analysis of variance. Results indicated that disadvantaged children do  process visual information more slowly than advantaged children. The development curves for the two groups tend to converge as they proceed through school. (Author/CJ)",

Factors studied were color codability, verbal cueing, type of question, stimulus silhouettes, and prompting. These factors were included in stimulus scenes for study via two 16mm motion picture films. Color silhouettes, included in the films, were presented for testing. Subjects responded to color names in one film and to color patches in the other. High and low codable colored stimuli were included with the simple object and geometric shape silhouettes. Half the items asked color questions while the other half asked position questions. Subjects scores were analyzed by a multifactor ANOVA with repeated measures. Results indicated that higher  scores were achieved with high codable colored stimuli than with low, color names were not always easier to remember than color patches, higher scores were achieved with position items than with color items and with simple object stimuli rather than geometric shape stimuli. Differences appear to exist between colors as they interact in instructional materials. (Author/CJ)",

The teacher would also have a greater awareness of student talents and would facilitate student performance on tests. The sample consisted of a random sampling of seventh grade students. Necessary data from test records were placed in interpretable form for feedback to students and teachers. Treatment groups were designated according to the recipient of appraisal data and were: Teachers Only, Students Only, Students and Teachers, and Control. The study employed a pretest-posttest control group experiemental design and utilized an analysis of covariance technique. Results suggest that providing students and teachers with  appraisal information has little effect upon test scores, while providing such information to teachers alone tends to have an inimical effect on student test scores.

Bennett looks at contemporary societal changes and pressures which shape values and concludes that, in spite of them, many students maintain values similar to past generations. What is new is their openness about their problems and values, and the speed with which they desire changes. He views orientation as the optimal time for colleges to begin helping students think about and define their values in relationship to the college life upon which they are embarking. H. Tyler Combs reports on the methods which the University of South Carolina's orientation program utilizes to deal with student values. He shows why the University  feels that, based on the student enrollment, value discussions must be an important part of orientation. Robert Squatriglia stresses the need for research and evaluation of innovations in student personnel work, and describes the research conducted thus far at the University of South Carolina which found that some changes in student values resulted from on-going orientation programs. A more comprehensive listing of the innovations concludes the presentations. (TL)",

Richard L.

The new concept of the middle school (grades 6-8) is viewed as effectively meeting the particular needs of today's youth, who mature physically, emotionally, intellectually, and socially much earlier than did their counterparts at the turn of the century when the junior high school (grades 7-9) was introduced.

The authors have developed a behavioral model that retains the rigor of the classical model while providing for a latitude of realism.

A vast body of research exists on the effect of organizational differentiation, especially the effects of grouping according to ability. No coherent pattern of results emerges from this research. It is argued in this paper that the inconclusiveness o f the research is due not only to methodological problems, but also to the theoretical meagerness of the research. An attempt is made, therefore, to specify the crucial dimensions of the organizational differentiation. This conceptual framework is then used in the formulation of a set of mechanisms that may account for a relationship between  organizational differentiation and student behavior. The set of hypotheses arrived at are used to reevaluate the existing research. Most propositions deal with the effect of organizational differentiation on student aspirations and beliefs, on between-classroom variation in achievement, and on the influence of family background on academic accomplishment.

Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 50 administrators in school districts throughout New York State. Of the 36 districts responding, many were currently involved in developing Title III proposals. The most frequently mentioned sources of help in writing proposals were Title III regional center consultants and State education department consultants. Over 50 percent of the respondents strongly agreed that Title III is basically sound, and over 60 percent agreed that a number of valid innovations have emerged. (MLF)",

The synoptic model defines all possible alternatives and provides a basis for choosing that alternative which maximizes expected utility. The more pragmatic or realistic behavioral model is based on a recursive programing paradigm, in which the decision maker has knowledge only of the state of the organization and its movement toward a selected goal. The two codeterminate aspects of this behavioral model are (1) the technology, plan, or curriculum; and (2) the management of that technology, the implementation of the plan, or the teacher's use of the curriculum. The model is  illustrated by use of computer assisted instruction (CAI) and individually prescribed instruction (IPI). Program monitoring requires both a behavioral decision model and a conceptual framework, allowing the decision maker to distinguish between the plan and its implementation.

Most of the time, pupils in the experimental unit were grouped heterogeneously for special presentations such as lectures, films, and panels. Otherwise, students were grouped homogeneously accoring to their individual needs and the purposes of instruction. In 1968, all seventh grade students were centralized in a separate wing, providing the opportunity for more specialized instruction to incoming students. Team teaching and a \"swing teacher\" assigned to each team were special features of this seventh grade school. Data analysis from a student  opinion poll confirmed a major hypothesis that students with differing abilities, grouped heterogeneously in a program of planned team teaching, will develop significantly better attitudes than students grouped homogeneously in a program of traditional teaching.

A case study is then considered which generates the data systems required by the model. The model provides outputs, whose utility for the decision maker is discussed.  The sensitivity of model outputs to various changes in the decision maker's value system is also explored.

Several versions of project management were identified and studied, but only two of the more flexible systems were selected for their potential contribution to educational administration. Ten New Jersey administrators were trained by a management consultant firm to determine which problems seemed more relevant to project management techniques. During the study period of almost a year, the presentation was changed according to feedback received from the field. Another project management approach was used in a 2-day training seminar for administrators from several Pennsylvania school districts. The overall findings of this study suggest that project management techniques are  applicable to special types of situations and for selected problems. The training will continue to be modified as field staff observe resulting changes in school district management techniques. A related document is EA 002 949. (Author)",

Both the survey and the prior traditional process results reached the same conclusions regarding parental involvement in decision making -- particularly on issues of hiring and firing teachers. In addition, the survey established parental attitudes on school in general, as well as on discipline, curriculum, facilities, and communication with staff. More information was obtained in less time and with less cost by the survey than by the traditional method. This report demonstrates the utility of survey research not only in providing sound  information, but also in accomplishing the task with meaningful savings in time and cost. (Author)",

Evaluation is used in schools to produce information that helps decision makers choose among alternative courses of action. Purpose, rather than methodology, distinguishes evaluation from research. The need for care, precision, and logical thought, however, is common to both. One set of major problems is technical and involves such things as measurement and choice of appropriate analysis techniques. A second set revolves around the need for decision makers to follow a rational approach and to avoid reverting to \"gut\" feelings in every stress situation. Finally, evaluators must produce pertinent information, in the most useful format, at key  points in time. (Author)",

To test a number of hypotheses bearing on this relationship, a sample population of 707 teachers and administrators was drawn from a random selection of public elementary schools in metropolitan Vancouver. The position is developed that organizations do in fact influence individual value systems although the influence is bifid and interactional. The empirical research suggests a theory of \"organizational value\" which can be outlined in brief. The exploration of the values/organization relationship is especially pertinent to education considered as a value-propagating institution. (Author/MLF)",

Specifically, the discussion focuses on the proposal, passage, and implementation of a legislatively mandated program for the Statewide assessment of education in Michigan. The analytical framework utilized in the analysis depicts the policy-making process as taking place along a continuum wherein societal forces gradually merge into formal or informal activities and movements, which in turn lead to political action, and finally to formal enactment. Utilizing such a framework, the paper investigates (1) the socioeconomic, intellectual, and political forces behind the assessment movement; (2) the subsequent expression of individual and group values regarding  the need for reliable performance indicators in education; (3) the resultant political activity generated by these individual and group expressions; and (4) the passage and eventual implementation of the program.

The model also makes it possible to define levels of financial support given to different schools, and to correlate these findings with student and family characteristics. The model would permit exploration of the interrelationship between various outcomes and inputs, such as student achievement and per pupil expenditures.

Consequently, many new innovative programs have been designed and implemented for preschool children. However, it has become apparent that a change in evaluation instruments and techniques is also needed. Observational techniques of evaluation over varying periods of time -- as opposed to formal or standardized testing -- are proving to be effective in program development and evaluation. Some evaluative implications were made from data gathered via a checklist of behavioral symptoms of young children. A prereading inventory of eight behavioral symptoms examined the  readiness and progress of learning in a preprimary language arts program. Subjects used in this 2-year study were 3-to-6-year-old children in a southeastern suburban area representatively selected with respect to socioeconomic status and level of intelligence. (Author)",

Teams then returned to their districts where they conducted inquiry training classes with at least one group of gifted elementary or junior high students. Provisions were made for visitors to attend classes, for special demonstrations, and for additional dissemination. Conclusions were that the teams stimulated interest within various school districts  and gained experience in conducting inquiry sessions; they also aroused public approval as parents and others requested the continuation of the programs. Most of the districts have continued the training and many have reshaped their programs.

The children were subdivided into three disability groupings (physically disabled, educable mentally retarded, and emotionally disturbed), each of which was further divided into experimentals (E's) and comparisons (C's). The E's received vocational service from three private agencies with workshops 2 days per week during 2 school years. All children were assessed at the start and end of the program and followed up 12 months later. Results indicated that the disability groupings differed markedly in demographic and personal characteristics, in the nature of presenting problems, in their school careers, and in outcomes. The physically disabled benefitted  most from the services with the E's having higher potential for employment than the C's; the mentally retarded gained in socialization and interpersonal adjustment, but not necessarily in employability; and the emotionally disturbed did not benefit significantly from the services, except the E's remained in school substantially longer than the C's. Additional findings were that ethnic and socioeconomic status were important determiners of both progress and outcome; the services were least effective with children in the poverty subculture.

A computer instructional program was used to impart immediate reinforcement for subject's responses, to show that his behavior, over which he has direct control, determines his success or failure. Underachievers were identified, and 16 were randomly assigned to a tutorial group, 16 to a study skill group, and 17 to the computer group for an eight-week period. It was found that sex and class level are important in determining the external expectancy tendency of underachievers. All three experimental approaches  resulted in increased internality, without significant differences among the groups. Also, none of the approaches resulted in a significant change in grades earned by the underachievers. Rotter's internal-external (I-E) scale is included. (KW)",

Two institutions were judged to be ineffective as residents appeared to be not happy or self-sufficient, showed little intellectual growth (or were rarely, if ever, retested), had many stereotyped behaviors, and manifested excessive needs for social reinforcement. One institution emerged as clearly effective and one as moderately so. In five of six institutions, other ward residents were the greatest source of interpersonal contacts; in only one institution did attendants and other nonretarded adults interact as frequently with residents. Between one third and one half of the time of severely retarded residents of the  typical institution was spent in doing nothing. The attitudes of attendants at the different institutions showed remarkable consistency. While verbal and psychological attitudes of parents did not differentiate between effective and ineffective institutions, parents of children in an effective residence visited children more frequently. Additional research results and implications are presented, and schedules of a typical day at each institution are included. (RJ)",

Sixteen primary school children of approximately equal ability were selected and paired to form the control and experimental groups and attend one-half hour daily labs. The control lab provided intensive language training in an informal situation, and attempted to motivate children through experience. The experimental or thinking lab, which was non-verbal, worked in the preoperational and concrete operational stages of development. The child's experiences were used as foundations of all logical thought and concept building with various thought  games being employed (e.g. Concentration). Children in both groups were tested in September and May of the school year and will be retested. A careful comparison of test results should provide much information about deaf thinking, and hopefully, a new method of teaching. (GD)",

Summative evaluation refers to an over-all final evaluation of the product with the purpose of producing information useful to the ultimate consumers. Formative evaluation procedures described include pre- and posttesting of student political attitudes, objective testing of performance, open-ended teacher questionnaires, criticism of the course by outside readers, teacher de-briefing sessions,  teaching one class by course developers, and site visits to pilot classes. Three instruments were constructed to provide a summative evaluation of the course: a political knowledge test, a political science skills test, and an attitude test. The report describes the plans for administering these tests as well as plans for evaluating the trained versus the untrained teachers and checking teacher and student response to the proposed instructional materials.

Computer hardware and software by themselves should not be expected to accomplish educational miracles. One way of viewing Computer-Administered Instruction (CAI) is as a simulation. The teacher, qua instructional agent, can be reduced to recurring cycles of decisions about information to be displayed to the student. A randomly operating teacher is totally unresponsive to the student's requirements as an information processing and assimilating agent. The ideal agent is optimally adaptive to the  requirements of the student. To serve these purposes the man computer man communication channel must be of adequate capacity and relatively free of constraining filters. Issues are discussed in the context of an ongoing CAI systems development project (IMPACT). (Author)",

The systems approach uses the tools of task analysis and behavioral objective statements to design an individualized instructional strategy. A consideration of national and  regional manpower requirements, combined with content analysis of a total curriculum is but one approach to developing a dynamic curriculum.

It is possible that there are advantages to color television which are unmeasured or unmeasurable, but the current claims for color; that it heightens realism, is more appealing, and is \"expected\"; cannot be supported. Color television is realistic only under the most perfect conditions of transmission and reception. Maintenance on color equipment is both more frequent and more costly. Thus the average color program is not realistic or appealing. A sharp black-and-white picture is more effective than the commonly seen smudgy color picture. People have become used to color from motion pictures  and still photography. The technology of color television will undoubtedly develop in the coming years to the point where the medium is both reliable and inexpensive, but at the present time it is well to remember that the motivation of the learner and proper sequencing of learning objectives is more important than any aspect of the instructional media used.

In addition to student performance on learning frames, criterion frames, and quiz items, the study was concerned with additional learning variables such as latencies for each of the above measures, and the subject's confidence of his response on the criterion of quiz questions. The relationship of these variables to quiz and final examination performance was investigated through correctional analysis. Based on the results of correlation and regression analyses with the quizzes and final exam as the dependent measures, the relevant variables were incorporated into the decision model. The decision model was implemented and validated with an  independent group of students. It was shown to be effective in identifying those trainees who needed remedial instruction. A reference list, samples of material used to gather data, and equations developed to analyze data are appended. (Author/JY)",

The educational functions of the laboratories are discussed. The second part of the paper explores the potential of the laboratory as a teaching machine. Individualized instruction is seen as the basis for the new pedagogy. The author elaborates on five areas in which he feels the language laboratory can be more effective than a single professor.

In the initial experiment, which contrasts French and French-Acadian linguistic habits, the authors limit themselves to conceptual categories reflected in concrete nouns representing the naming or labeling of things, groups of things, and observable actions. An overview of the contents includes: (1) delimiting the problem, (2) coding conceptual categories, (3) variations in time and space, (4) indices of diversity, (5) indices of intensity, (6) selecting conceptual fields, (7) sampling the population, (8) recording measurable responses, (9) analyzing and computing the data, and (10) appraising the results. Some 3,000  persons contributed more than four million word-token responses for analysis. Tables and graphs illustrate findings. (Author/RL)",

In Chapter 1, Dimensions of Graduate Education, some of the salient features of institutional demography are presented, including: the number of graduate institutions, their types, locations, and transformations; the distribution of graduate enrollment; the number and types of degrees awarded; and representative projections to 1980-81. Chapter 2, Correlates of Quality, reviews a number of factors that appear to be generally associated with quality either of institutions or departments, including: magnitude of  graduate program, institutional funding, baccalaureate origins of doctorates, freshman admission selectivity, selection of institution by graduate fellowship recipients, doctoral awards per faculty member and per student, faculty compensation and structure, student-faculty ratio, and minimum size. In Chapter 3, Financial Perspectives, financial patterns and trends in universities are examined. Particular emphasis is placed on the research role in graduate education, essential characteristics of academic accounting practice, and the inherent cost of graduate education in relation to higher education as a whole.

Subsequent statements by the project coordinators emphasized related concepts. One of these dealt with the  need for college administrators and educators to perceive and react to differences in the problems, backgrounds, and motivation of black and white students in order to make the college experience successful for both. Another concept concerned the development of administrative leadership able to organize the school and to gain enough personal commitment at the school and community levels to provide successful programs for the disadvantaged student. Third, the role of the counselor in relating to and providing helpful guidance for the black student was outlined. Finally, institutional approaches to the problem of equal educational opportunity, and suggestions for solving the problem were reviewed. (JO)",

Early in 1968 the Assistant State Librarian conferred with institutional administrators and library Advisory Council members for Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), Title IV-A on the priority needs within each of Oregon's eleven institutional libraries. These expressions of extreme need were the basis for Oregon's fiscal 1968 spending. The apportionment of monies for the particular institutions and the amounts allocated to them are presented in a table. For each type of institutional library, specific standards for library personnel, materials, services and facilities were developed  as a guide for the administrators responsible for these activities. Basic considerations necessary for adequate library services are: (1) finance, (2) services or personnel, (3) materials, (4) facilities, (5) services and (6) in-service training. Recommendations are: (1) establishment of a new division of Institutional Library Services in the State Library, (2) development of definite goals and target dates for bringing the library program at all major institutions under professional direction and (3) the State Library upgrade holdings and resources in areas of responsibility of institutions related to the culturally disadvantaged and handicapped.

Details of the study design and procedures are contained in the abbreviated Annual Progress Report for 1968-1969 (PS 003 034). Treatment (program) dimensions were assessed by in-class monitoring of teachers and children using a time-sampling procedure, and by video-tape monitoring of teachers in their classrooms. Significant differences were found among the four curricula on a number of dimensions of behavior for both teachers and children, most of these differences being in predicted directions. Treatment effects were assessed by use of a variety of  cognitive, social, motivational, perceptual, and achievement measures. Programs had significantly different effects on the children with respect to a number of variables measured, such as curiosity, initiative, arithmetic, and verbal participation. Preliminary regression analyses on the relationship between teaching techniques monitored in class and dependent variables have produced multiple R's between .229 and .419 and partial R's between - .293 and .307. No interpretation has been made, pending the inclusion of variables from the video-tape monitoring. (Author/NH)",

Sources of financial support have been federal programs, the public schools, and private owners. New to the field are corporate franchise and chain operations which have inherent dangers: use of standardized curriculum and procedure; the possibility that profit motive may cut costs at the expense of the children; and the freedom to be racially restrictive. Benefits may be innovativeness and independence from  political pressure. The Kerner Commission recommendation that more preschool compensatory education programs be provided in black ghetto areas seems designed to make black children behave more like white, middle class children. The identification of the problem as being in the child is a confortable concept of disadvantagement for white group members. However, the problem may be in public school attitudes, which tend to perpetuate disadvantagement by providing inadequate educational experiences and by viewing the child through a negative set of expectations.

        "description":"This study attempted to develop a diagnostic-prescriptive curriculum program to improve the school readiness of disadvantaged preschoolers. The language development patterns of 32 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds were diagnosed by use of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA). Teachers were trained to use this information to provide an instructional program based on a curriculum developed around the subtests of the ITPA. Stratified sampling based on intelligence test scores was used to assign 16 subjects to the experimental and 16 to the control group. Both groups were pre- and posttested on the Caldwell Preschool Inventory (CPI). The ITPA was used to test the language abilities of the experimental subjects who for four months received a special hour-a-day lesson based on  individual language needs. Teachers were free to adjust or alter lesson plans. Posttest CPI scores indicated that the diagnostic-prescriptive program significantly improved the school readiness of the experimental subjects. Appendixes A and B list classroom deficiencies and language activities related to ITPA subtests. (MH)",

The 111 children who filled these categories were given a 48-item problem solving test, with six problems from each of the eight types presented in a randomized sequence. Half of the children in each ability group were randomly assigned to the condition of no manipulatable objects, while  the other half were provided with manipulatable objects referred to in the problems and were allowed to use them any way they wanted to help solve the problems. Analysis of the data revealed that IQ was not a significant factor, that Problem Condition was significant, that there was a significant interaction due to Quantitative Comparisons and Problem Conditions for one problem type, and that there were significant main effects due to Problem Conditions for the remaining seven problem types. There was also a significant main effect due to Quantitative Comparisons for one of the remaining seven problem types. (MH)",

The San Antonio Urban Educational Development Center (SAUEDC) preschool program (N=16) uses an instructional program built on four structural components: (1) concept-affect formation, (2) development of sensory motor skills, (3) development of language skills, and (4) development of thinking processes. The second program (N=15) is a special Parent-School-Community Involvement project intended to encourage parental action to foster child development. Finally, three San Antonio Day Care Centers (N=14) funded as Head Start programs were examined. The subjects were all 3-year-old Mexican-American children. Each group was  pre- and posttested on the Leiter International Performance Scale, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (FORM A) in English, and Peabody (FORM B) in Spanish. Analysis of the test-generated data revealed that (as predicted) at pretest all the subjects scored substantially below national norms on instruments that required language in test administration and approximately at national norms on instruments that didn't require language in test administration. Furthermore, children in the SAUEDC program achieved significantly greater gains in I.Q. scores than children in either of the other groups. (MH)",

This study investigates the effects of that program on the perceptual development and academic readiness of a group of 76 such children. The exercises, derived from the Kephart developmental program, were used for half of each school day, over a period of seven months. A control group (N=26) participated in a conventional kindergarten program. All the children were pre- and posttested on the Slosson Intelligence Test, and posttested on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests Form A, Frostig's Developmental Test of Visual Perception, and Kephart's Purdue Perceptual-Motor Survey. Results uncovered no significant gain score differences  between groups on the SIT. Mean posttest differences on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were significant, favoring the experimental group. The Kephart Survey revealed no significant between-group differences. These results were interpreted as suggesting that the program was more effective at improving fine motor behaviors than gross motor behaviors. Fine motor behaviors correlate highly with successful reading and writing activities. Intensive exposure to verbal concepts, paired with concrete examples and movement, may have been a major program effect. (MH)",

The project used &quot;readimobiles&quot; to determine the effectiveness of a structured, psycholinguistically-based preschool curriculum on black, disadvantaged children. There were three treatment groups: (1) advantaged white children receiving a general enrichment program, (2) disadvantaged black children receiving three months of lessons from the Peabody Language Development Kit, and (3) disadvantaged black children receiving nine months of the Peabody program. Each child in these treatment groups was matched to a control child by age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Both groups were posttested twice (to determine reliability)  on the Stanford-Binet, the Caldwell Preschool Inventory and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. The results showed that the experimental subjects were superior to the control subjects on all measures. The treatment groups also differed significantly from one another.

A total of 147 children attending preschool classes were pre- and posttested on the Day Language Screen and the Brown, Fraser, Bellugi Test of Grammatical Contrasts. Data were also collected concerning the language program in each of the classrooms and the demography of the subjects. The results indicate that there are status-race differences in the development of language skills in  4-year-olds, with the higher status white group scoring significantly higher in all three categories on the pre- and posttests. However, the two lower status groups had significantly greater gain scores, indicating that the remedial language program used in their classes improved their proficiency in standard American English and raised their level of language maturity. It is suggested that direct instruction in language skills be given to the lower status preschool child, in an effort to avoid later reading difficulty. (Author/NH)",

It was not possible to find the study samples called for in the original plan, i.e. a child-readiness program of the Bereiter-Engelmann type, and a child development program that was a suitable example. A compromise selection of two Head Start centers included one that was child development-oriented, and one that had a modified Montessori program. A comparison sample was selected from a middle class child development-oriented private nursery school. The children were pre- and posttested on measures of cognitive skills, curiosity, self-concept, and spontaneous language.  Individual child observations were also made. However, the original data collection plan was severely curtailed because of lack of time and testing space. The results of the study are not definitive but indicate that the middle class children were more able to benefit in demonstrable ways from a year of preschool education. However, the private program was judged to be of much better quality than the Head Start programs in the study. (NH)",

This analytical framework differentiates 6 kinds of counties, ranging from most urban-oriented (group 1) to least urban-oriented (group 6). With this framework, it can be seen that the economic well-being of county residents varies with the urban orientation of their county. Between 1950 and 1960, county population growth also varied with urban orientation. But in the following 6 years (1960-66), population growth slowed considerably in group 1 counties and moderately in groups 2 and 3 but accelerated in groups 4 and 5. In group 6, the decline was arrested. The quickening growth in the less urban-oriented counties promises to help bring  prosperity to many rural areas that were formerly cut off from the mainstream of American economic life. But many of the people who live in these areas are elderly and disabled or lack the education, training, and experience to compete effectively in urban labor markets. Consequently, these people would benefit from training programs and other programs to improve their nutrition, health care, and education. (Author/AL)",

However, before a workable educational program could be developed, the status quo of severely disadvantaged rural families had to be ascertained. In order to do this, the &quot;Minnesota Survey of Opinion&quot; was given to a random sample of 31 heads of household identified as being socially or economically disadvantaged and to 82 heads of households representing a cross-section of the population in a southern Illinois county. Scores were obtained on general adjustment (degree to which a person has adjusted to his environment) and total morale (assessment including attitudes toward personal inferiority, family, law, conservatism, and  education). A general adjustment score was arrived at by comparing the negative and positive responses of the other 2 variables. Results indicated that the severely disadvantaged families had a significantly lower morale and poorer general adjustment than did the sample of the total population of families in the same geographic area.

It is noted that the problems of injustice in education of Mexican American children in Arizona are related to dropout problems and causes; failure of schools to increase Mexican American employability and provide more than social promotions to those who remain in school; and inadequately informed school staff about the cultural background of Mexican American children. Problem categories discussed include failure to (1) allow for cultural differences, (2) understand the unique language-learning problems, (3) recruit and encourage professional growth  of Mexican American educators, and (4) relate to Mexican American parents and other adults. Needed compensatory services are described, and it is concluded that without careful planning, organizing, and implementing of sound educational programs, and without providing him educational services, the Mexican American child can never hope to keep up with his age peers -- and each year of accumulating regression carries with it a growing indifference to learning.

Significant differences (.05) were obtained between kindergarten and grade-3 children on perceptual discrimination tasks. Kindergarten children tended to choose color as a basis for similarity over form or size. Also, results  indicated a preference of form over size and direction over nondirection.

The research was concerned with the applicability of a hierarchically ordered achievement test to the diagnosis and assessment of listening and reading skills. Performance objectives were derived from 11 language comprehension skills and arranged in a hierarchical structure through the use of an heuristic procedural analysis. The design of the test was based on the theoretical constructs of Gagne. Paired items were scored on a yes/no basis and a percentage of probable response calculated. Correlations for paired test-retest listening scores  ranged from .86 to .99 for the 11 skills. Paired test-retest reading score correlations ranged from .80 to .96.

The second was from a village school in a farming community in northern Indiana. All were from upper-lower and lower-middle class backgrounds. The children were given reading and arithmetic tests, and the correlation coefficients were computed. In each instance, the total reading and problem-solving achievement scores were converted to percentile ranks. A positive  relationship between problem solving in arithmetic and reading was found for both groups, but it was not judged to be of sufficient magnitude to be an accurate predictor of performance of one variable from the other.

Instruction focused on how to read in each subject rather than on the course content of that subject. Continuity of learning in the different disciplines was provided by the instructor who combined work in the different subject areas into an interrelated meaningful whole. It was found that reading, math, and language growth as measured by a pretest versus post-test comparison averaged better than 7 months' growth for the  5-month semester.

Also, it is suggested that in \"knowing the learner\" the teacher must identify the stage of language development of the child, the emulative home models he might have, his motivation, the effectiveness of his sensory modalities, and other outside factors which affect his school performance. Five sequential steps in the reading process are listed. However, the distinction between the basic reading  act and its application to situations requiring one's ability to think is made, and it is suggested that competent diagnosis would reveal that not further instruction in the process of reading but more pertinent learning experience in the development of concepts is needed.

This system is a logic system for use by the teacher as a thinking and creative person; it allows him to plan educational objectives and to make educational decisions.

One problem in the program was to identify the reading curriculum needs of the 34 elementary, 11 junior high, and 3 high schools with a total enrollment of 25,000 students. There were 1,000 students 2 or more years below their expected level who had an IQ of 90 and above in grades 4 through 9. These criteria were used for selecting students for the remedial program. A clinic was designed with a professional interdisciplinary staff to provide diagnostic services for severely disabled readers. Through cooperation with a local university, 25 teachers received training as reading teachers under a 3-year program and returned to their classrooms. In order to achieve adequate local  funding, parent groups, school staff members, central administration, and the board of education were made aware of the services offered and the results. The role of the reading consultant in public schools was viewed as that of administrator and subject specialist. Some of his activities included providing instructional procedures, inservice teacher training, and instructional materials; evaluating teacher performance; and working with public and school officials.

If everyone is to be able to read in the 70's, teachers must become more innovative and responsible as they develop the skills and attitudes for change within the schools of the times. Flexibility, creativity, and resourcefulness must be part of each teacher's makeup. The solutions to problems in the schools lie in a close examination of the complex nature of the reading process, reflecting an interdisciplinary approach and including an analysis of materials and methods useful for diagnostic and immediate followup activities. A description of a preservice education model for secondary reading teachers is divided into three  areas: How does a reading teacher help secondary teachers understand what reading is all about? How does the reading teacher help his teachers know about the different abilities of students? And what methods and materials can be used by secondary school teachers to provide for the many differences in their classes? References are included. (NH)",

Several sources of research and discussions on reading and its relation to content areas are cited. It is pointed out that required reading skills generally fall into the areas of comprehension, vocabulary, and study skills. Operationalizing definitions of skills is discussed and the conclusion reached is that to effect application of research findings to classroom practices, teachers must be involved in researching ideas to be applied in the classroom. A five-step applicative research model is described. The underlying  concept in applicative research is explained as adapting a research idea to a limited and/or unique setting.

The investigator first used the Consistency Ratio method to quantitatively assess the transfer relationships for each set of dependency relationships in the hierarchy of RMS items. Consistency ratios for six test problems were calculated. The results indicated that the responses of the subjects as a whole validated most of the dependency relationships within the hierarchies and that in most segments of the hierarchies the students probably were required to use the same problem solving skills and procedures on the RMC and free-response  problems. The pattern analysis technique was also used to analyze the responses for the complete hierarchy on a subject by subject basis. Indices of agreement for the six RMC problems were calculated. They revealed the amount of similarity between sequences of physical and mathematical concepts used in solving a problem in the RMC and free-response formats. Bibliography. (LC)",

Mathematics teachers can readily examine the educational problems of today in their classrooms since learning progress in mathematics can easily be measured and evaluated. Since mathematics teachers have learned to think in quantitative terms and make decisions based on logical thinking, they can provide the best quantitative thinking about our educational problems. There is a need for people who think quantitatively and objectively and apply their thinking to meet the needs of all people. Examples of problems related to such topics as space exploration, environmental pollution, and the cost of living are used to illustrate how mathematics teachers can explore these problems with  their students in a quantitative and logical manner.

While lecture-discussions were essentially the same for both experimental and control groups, the laboratory sessions and written assignments were different. In the experimental group laboratory, creativity-training activities including (1) brainstorming, (2) inquiry development, (3) morphological analysis of problems, and (4) invitation to creative thinking were used. Pretest and posttest scores of fluency, flexibility, originality of idea production, and achievement were gathered for both groups. Two researcher-constructed instruments to provide data  on students' ratings of (1) their achievement and (2) the course were administered. The experimental group was found superior to the control group in gains in fluency, flexibility, and originality. No difference was found between groups in achievement scores. There were no significant differences between groups in self-ratings of achievement of cognitive course objectives. The findings suggest that creativity can be improved. (LC)",

A group of five or six high school juniors or seniors served as instructors in an elementary school science class, with each high school student, called a learning assistant, working closely with about five elementary students. The learning assistants taught forty minutes per session and three sessions per week for 13 weeks. The basic design of the study included comparison of classes which had teams of learning assistants with classes involving only the regular teacher. Eight intermediate level classes using science units developed by the Elementary Science Study were  involved. The results of the study indicated that (1) the three major factors of school, teacher, and learning assistant influence student outcomes, and (2) there is an interaction between the factors of school and learning assistant.

Instead it is a problem of quality and safety in our physical and social surroundings. Further population increase may increase the discords in our social environment caused by race prejudice, poverty, drug addiction, and crime, or make their reduction more difficult. Population growth contributes to a loss of freedom because the larger, more complex, and more crowded a society is, the more numerous and restrictive are the laws and regulations required for its governance. Today, any attempt to coerce the regulation of family size would be opposed by an overwhelming majority of Americans. A convergence of personal self-interest in economic  terms and the broader social interest may bring about a profound change in U.S. attitudes and mores regarding birth control, and this can be accomplished in part by introducing the entire subject of population growth into the curricula of schools and colleges.

The public schools in a suburban county provided the instructional setting.

Eighteen classes consisting of 430 students comprised the sample. The students were divided into four randomly assigned treatment groups for each level. Tests were given before a teaching session of five to six weeks, again directly following the teaching period, and once more as retention tests seven weeks after the conclusion of the teaching period. Equal arithmetic reasoning group mean scores were achieved by all groups on the posttest. The non-decimal groups of both grades had significantly higher group means on the retention test. Retention was greater among sixth graders than among fourth graders but this knowledge did not improve  students' ability to answer questions on place value. Non-decimal group test scores on the posttest showed significant correlations with arithmetic reasoning and computation test scores. The recommendation is made that this topic should be taught in the upper elementary grades and that place value and the relation to the decimal system should be stressed. (Author/FL)",

For each unit, the teachers selected for training received a teacher's guide and specific training for the unit. The teachers not selected for training received only a teacher's guide. Some classrooms received sufficient laboratory instructional aids to allow students to work in small groups of two to four students; others received minimal equipment so that their lessons included demonstrations rather than maximal interaction of children with materials.  Pupils were given individual oral tests to assess subject matter achievement. Additional equipment resulted in significantly greater achievement only at the first grade level, but all pupils expressed a preference for additional aids. Specific teacher training for the unit did not produce significant differences in pupil achievement. Additional data regarding the effects of sex, I.Q., and family occupation on pupil achievement and pupil preferences are reported. (EB)",

Phase I was to determine which of four programing methods was most effective for the attainment of science achievement at three levels, knowledge, application, and relationship. Subjects were fourth and fifth grade students randomly assigned to the four treatments. Results indicated that the developmental presentations, Skinnerian and Ruleg, were more effective at the three achievement levels than the textual presentations. In phase II of the study, a flexible multi-variable computerized approach was developed to (1) determine the readability and (2) guide in the writing and revision of self-instructional materials.  The definition and evaluation of three remedial branching conditions derived from the automated readability model was the focus of phase III. Forty-three fourth grade students were randomly assigned to the three treatments. A multi-variate analysis was used to evaluate the three treatments. Levels of achievement, error rate, time, intelligence, sex and experimental treatments were defined as predictor variables. Science achievement, at three conceptual levels, was defined as the criterion. The report contains also a reference section, a bibliography, and an appendix of data tables. (LC)",

Selected teachers were used to adopt innovations and to extend the innovations within their schools. Subjects were drawn from 1,205 elementary teachers teaching in 112 elementary schools in western Pennsylvania. Sociometric measures were administered to identify the science opinion leader and non-leader in each school. Twenty science opinion leaders and twenty-one non-leaders, each representing a different school, were randomly selected to attend an inservice program. These teachers were administered the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale and The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory. A questionnaire was administered pre-and post-to all teachers in the schools  involved to measure changes in science teaching. The findings of the study indicated that neither adoption nor diffusion is facilitated by concentrating efforts on teachers identified as science opinion leaders. Dogmatism scores were significantly related to the adoption of innovations, with low dogmatic teachers showing greater changes. The Minnesota Teacher Attitudes Inventory proved of little value in identifying teachers likely to adopt innovations. (EB)",

Fifty-two participants received training during the three-day program. Participants were primarily college and university professors involved in training future research workers. Training sessions were of two kinds: work sessions were led by leaders in specific research areas; problem sessions were led by senior participants for the purpose of examining ways in which skills taught in work sessions could be applied to specific research problems in science education.  Evaluation by the session leaders and the participants indicated that the program was successful in imparting new research competencies and suggesting promising areas for future research.

Each classroom establishes a government modeled after a common form of city government and sends representatives to a constitutional convention. There students write a constitution establishing a federal system of school government to handle those areas not covered by school policy. Chapter I is a checklist for teachers to use in evaluating student attitudes: dignity and worth of the individual, belief in the value of  self-government, understanding of democracy's privileges and responsibilities, and the use of intelligence to solve problems. Other chapters give objectives, purposes, procedures, and activities for establishing the need for government, classroom organization, national government, elections, and campaigns.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop evaluation procedures and to test the evidence of concept learning at various cognitive levels in an experimental social studies curriculum. A number of social science concepts relating to the use of natural resources were identified for use with Curriculum Model #1 on the Quabbin Reservoir system. A preliminary form of a concept development test was prepared, using the general approach developed by Kropp and Stoker (1966). This approach was appropriate because curriculum objectives had been identified according to Bloom's taxonomy, and major concepts had been identified and structured. The problem questions were designed to test student performance on analysis, sythesis, and evaluation, in realistic problem situations related to the  curriculum. Students (120) from four of the experimental classes, grades 3, 4 and 5, were tested. In conclusion, the concepts were acquired at a rather high rate of success with mean scores for the group ranging from 65-76% concept achievement; the differences between grade levels were small; and, the difference in achievement between the experimental and control groups was significant (p.&lt;0.001). All of these results seem to validate the effectiveness of the curriculum design and the teaching strategies (see SO 000 068). Other related documents are SO 000 069 and SO 000 070. (SBE)",

        "description":"A general systems approach to education is proposed. A general system is thought of not so much as a body of doctrine, but as a way of looking at things which permits the perception of the world as a totality and fosters communication among the specialized disciplines. In social science education the comparative study of relatively stable cultures is necessary. Once the idea has been established that there are stabilities in social systems, then we can go on to dynamics and developmental systems, and into concepts of economic and political development and idiological change. All real systems are dynamic, having four types of patterns in a space-time continuum: perceptible stable relationships, life cycle, evolution and learning, and the decision-making system. In this context,  people should know: a little about the order of magnitude of the factual world; where to find information and how to use it; facts about the shape of the space-time continuum --the history and geography of the world; the nature and necessity of investigation; and a distrust of purely personal experience, or an awareness of cultural bias and generalization. All of these things are necessary to avoid what Veblen called \"trained incapacity\", an inability to live in the world as it really exists. (SBE)",

The objectives of the new social science teacher education program are to develop the ability of prospective teachers to: 1) analyze social problems; 2) handle the analytical tools of the social sciences; 3) relate the analytical tools to history, and to geography; 4) apply these tools with increasing depth throughout the elementary grades; and, 5) keep up with new ideas in the social sciences and translate them into the curriculum. The comprehensive one-year program requires the cooperation of the faculties of education and the social sciences  --economics, political, sociology, anthropology, history, and geography. The year is broken down into alternating periods: three weeks of presentation on the structure of knowledge of each discipline; followed by a five week laboratory where the structure is applied to real life situations, problem situations, and to classroom situations from kindergarten to sixth grade. This interdisciplinary program will end with a dissemination conference. (SBE)",

A number of crucial factors interact with the teacher's efforts to provide learning opportunities and to stimulate interest in curriculum resources. In creating an effective learning situation the teacher must consider: 1) learner participation in the development of learning goals and norms; 2) the peer power structure; 3) the distibution of acceptance and influence in the classroom; 4) opening channels of communication between himself and students, and between students, to identify and work on learning problems; 5) adapting learning opportunities and tasks to the individual; 6) the child's  relationships with his teachers and other socialization agents; and 7) involving parents in the learning objectives of their children, and achieving collaboration between teachers and parents. Various types of training to develop learning readiness are critical to the educational enterprise: 1) attitude and communication skill development through sensitivity training; 2) cross-age teaching; 3) value education; 4) inquiry for problem solving and decision-making; 5) resource utilization; and, 6) self-reward.

        "description":"This report analyzes data on the current (1965-67) production of, and future need for, M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the social sciences in Illinois. While in 1966-67 Illinois produced approximately 8% of all such degrees nationwide, in 1965-66 60% of its M.A.'s and 75% of its Ph.D.'s were graduates of nonpublic institutions, primarily the Univ. of Chicago and Northwestern Univ. The need for M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s will double between 1965 and 1980, but it is anticipated that the nonpublic universities will only be able to provide for a 33% increase. This means that existing and proposed public universities must increase their production by a factor of 3 to 4. Complicating the problem is the fact that the level of fellowship support for students in the social sciences has been and is  significantly less than for students in the natural sciences. Among the recommendations to the Illinois Board of Higher Education made by Committee R is the establishment of an Institute for Social Science Research which would assist in the development and expansion of M.A. Programs in the developing universities, as well as aid in developing new Ph.D. programs and assist in achieving rapid expansion of existing Ph.D. programs.

The data are drawn from several sources: published literature dealing with simulation games, descriptions of games in use, communications with people who use games, and personal experience with the design and use of games for education. The independent variables that seem likely to be related to the costs and benefits of simulation are delineated: 1) purpose; and, 2) structure including a discussion of goals, rules, team system, internal structure of the teams, and participants. These dependent variables are also discussed: 1) learning motivation; 2) the discovery, verification or inculcation of  social facts and principles; and, 3) the development of skills or discovery of hypotheses regarding decision-making, manipulative skills, and interactive behavior. The disparity between the positive and negative evaluations of simulation in terms of these variables is explained as resulting from a lack of empirical or objective research, and the perception of the weaknesses of simulation games --lack of teacher control over learning, scheduling difficulty, and cost.

Early sections examine the relationship between civil and military authority as developed in colonial America and written into the Constitution. The second half of the unit invites consideration of the relevance and workability of the earlier tradition of civil supremacy in a modern world of total war, technological complexity, and enormous military budgets. Students deal with the controversy over civilian control of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Truman-MacArthur clash, the right to conscientious objection, the possibilities for a military take-over in the United States, and current problems of both the legislative and executive branches in dealing with military power.

Subjects were pre- and post tested in the fall and spring of the 1967-68 school year with three tests: Citizenship Attitude Scale, Citizenship Knowledge Test, and Behavioural Situation Test. Tests of statistical significance were made of mean  scores and percents of change. Gains and differences were most significant in knowledge of government processes. All data are reported and summarized in tables. Participating and non-participating teachers and administrators of the district office and schools were also surveyed. Responses were generally favorable toward continuation of the student government-social studies program in all schools. (DJB)",

This position grows out of: 1) the examination of the social science literature dealing with contemporary political and social changes (Volume II); 2) studies of student perceptions of democratic dilemmas in the high schools --a cross-sectional comparison, urban-suburban  comparison, comparison among high schools with black students, and the development of the interpersonal aspect of political socialization (chapters 2-7); 3) the analysis of student unrest as documented in local newspapers throughout the nation; and, 4) case studies of particular high schools where there was serious confrontation and conflict.

Some generalizations based on integration of available studies are presented first, followed by a discussion of the difficulties involved in conceptualizing and measuring \"impact\". Next, the various orientations used in predicting the nature and direction of impacts are analyzed. They are actuarial, avowed goals and functions of higher education, personality development, life-cycle movement within the general social system, and distinctive social organizational structures and pressures. Ways of measuring college environments and inferring their impacts are then discussed. Finally,  some future research topics are suggested along with an analysis of alternative research methodologies. The comparative analysis of research methodologies for college impact studies is an extended and integrative treatment of this topic. The appropriateness of the various methods now used is evaluated and the need to learn the conditions and dynamics of college effects is emphasized. (Author)",

        "description":"Far too many teacher training programs fail to prepare teachers properly to translate theory and beliefs concerning teaching effectiveness into practice at the classroom level. To improve this situation, professors of education need to be innovative and to take purposeful steps to develop new programs with fresh approaches that will succeed in bridging the theory-practice gap. One technique which shows promise is systematic observation and a number of programs for training teachers in its use have been developed. However, the majority of these make use of only a single system. The practice called multidimensionality uses several systems simultaneously to view the same classroom situation and shows promise of being more effective than the use of a single system. Programs  incorporating the multidimensional-systematic observational approach by their very nature tend to be more laboratory-oriented than lecture-oriented. The student is frequently involved in data collection activities both under simulated and actual conditions. He learns to observe and to be observed. He experiments with his own behavior and he observes his peers as they experiment with their behavior. The intended final outcome is that the student will begin to see his role more clearly and that he will perceive the teaching act to be more predictable than uncontrollable. (Author/MBM)",

The PIT Model was developed as a communication framework for use in identifying classroom communication events by their function. Each event is classified as \"institutional (I),\"\"task oriented (T),\"\"personal (P),\" or \"mixed (M)\"; then each is further identified as \"individual\" or \"group\" and its duration recorded. Videotapes of 36 lessons (three class periods by each of 12 junior high teachers) were coded using the PIT Model  and then the IDER system (French and Gallagher) which utilizes the 10 verbal categories of the Flanders interaction analysis system, adding appropriate nonverbal dimensions for each. Data treatment included plotting both IDER and PIT data into one matrix as well as separate analyses for IDER and PIT data for individual teachers and lessons, for males and females, and for all subjects. Findings include these: 1) nonverbal behavior cannot be ignored; 2) the PIT Model is both meaningful and useful; 3) in these classrooms there is lack of emphasis on personalized communication and more focus on the group than the individual; 4) use of more than one instrument in observing and analyzing the same classroom behavior is valuable.

        "description":"This paper contains a review of related literature and an exploratory study of public school district programs aimed at altering negative staff attitudes toward racial integration. An introductory section notes the significance of \"social attitudes\" in relationship to the problem and discusses what is involved in changing attitudes. The three sections of the literature review focus on studies of 1) teachers--their attitude and role in school desegregation problems; 2) administrators--their attitudes and role, particularly in school-community relations relations; and 3) institutes--their role in providing new techniques and practices and attitude change for meeting the problems of integration. The exploratory study is reported which involved 1) field visits to seven public school  districts (Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco) and 2) questionnaires (41 percent returned) mailed to the 75 school districts listed in \"Racial Isolation in the Public Schools.\" The findings reported include information on the types of inservice training programs conducted, kinds of activities they involved, rationale behind them, and results. The summary section draws concluding implications regarding the types of programs most likely to be effective in bringing about positive attitude change on the part of all school personnel involved in the problems of integrated schools.

The four types of evaluation, described by the purpose a teacher has for determining, valuing, describing, or classifying some aspects of student behavior, are 1) placement evaluation used to place students according to prior achievement or personal characteristics, at the most appropriate point in an instructional sequence, in a unique instructional strategy, or with a suitable teacher; 2) formative evaluation used to provide the student and teacher with feedback on the student's progress toward  mastery of relatively small units of learning to provide information that will direct subsequent teaching or study; 3) diagnostic evaluation for the identification of students whose learning or classroom behavior is being adversely affected by factors not directly related to instructional practices; 4) summative evaluation used principally to certify, assign a grade, or to attest to the student's successful completion of a relatively large unit of instruction.

Subjects were 71 student teachers each of whom was observed for 20 minutes during the latter half of his student teaching by a team of four trained and reliable observers, each using a different observation system. The four systems were 1) the Reciprocal Category System (RCS), a modification of the Flanders system of verbal interaction analysis; 2) the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior (FTCB), an operationalized modification of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Cognitive Domain; 3) the Teacher Practices Observation Record (TPOR) measuring teacher  experimental and nonexperimental behavior; and 4) the Taxonomy of Imagery Provocation (TIP) to assess teacher behavior on a concrete to abstract imagery-related continuum. Data was treated by a principal components factor analysis program with varimax rotation; the rotated factor matrix was analyzed to identify clusters of classroom behavior that tend to group together on the basis of a common dimension or factor. Findings revealed 11 such factors. Several strong relationships were found within one or more of the four instruments as well as between pairs of instruments. (Findings are discussed.

It was hypothesized that sensitivity on the part of the teacher would be more telling than strength, and the creativity of the pupil more telling than intelligence. Pupil subjects were selected from the fourth, fifth and sixth grades of a private elementary school, and the total of 32 was divided into four categories of high IQ-creative, average IQ-creative, high IQ-low creative, and average IQ-low creative. A group of 16 student teachers were divided into four categories, of strong-sensitive, weak-sensitive, strong-insensitive, weak-insensitive. In a  balanced incomplete box design, all pupils were taught by all four types of teachers on a rotating basis, and responses were coded utilizing primarily the Aschner-Gallagher category of divergent thinking. A four-factor analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data. The results strongly support the impact of pupil attributes of creativity and intelligence on divergent production, and the greater salience of creativity is exhibited in the significant trend analysis. The findings suggest that achievement may be too inclusive a term, and identification of discrete differences in performance between groups of varying cognitive styles would be of value. (MBM)",

It was expected that students who were informed of the behavioral objectives of an activity would perform higher on achievement and retention posttests. Nine null hypotheses were tested, using 88 elementary education majors divided into four groups. Students were classified according to their ability levels and each group received different information concerning the use of the self-instructional text material. Posttests were administered immediately on completion of  the unit to compare the degree of learning, and after 2 weeks to compare the rate of forgetting. Analysis of variance was used in evaluating the data, and results showed that of the nine hypotheses formulated, the data supported two--that the four treatments result in different rates of forgetting, and that the differences in over-all performance scores resulting from the four treatments are not identically reflected at each ability level. A further study is being prepared in a typical classroom situation without the use of self-instructional materials. (MBM)",

        "description":"This study investigated the influence of the feedback a teacher expects to receive after teaching on his preference for expository or discovery teaching styles. The subjects were 88 undergraduate educational psychology students at the University of Texas at Austin. Each completed a three-part questionnaire, the Teaching Style Inventory (TSI), indicating preference for teaching styles. Microteaching sessions were followed by four reactions: feedback on appropriateness, learning, or interest, or no feedback. After the lessons, the subjects' preferences were assessed again, using part one of the TSI. An analysis of covariance showed that the differences among the mean preferences for the four groups were significant, and that preference for teaching styles shifted most from  discovery to expository in the group receiving appropriateness feedback. The study demonstrated that preference for a teaching style can be influenced by the type of feedback the teacher expects to receive, but expected feedback about appropriate use of style can cause a shift toward a more familiar set of behaviors, even though the style is perceived as less effective for student learning or interest. The expectation of this type of feedback in a teaching laboratory or student teaching situation can hinder attempts to encourage teachers to experiment with less familiar instructional patterns.

Such a method would add information concerning intra-class variation in teacher-pupil interaction patterns. Treatment of the studied are properly conceptualized as interactions between the teacher and the class as a group; and (2) teachers are consistent across students in their classroom behavior so that individual differences within a classroom are of little or no importance relative to intra-class differences. In fact many coding categories are most properly conceptualized as interactions between teacher and individual student. Within-class group and individual differences of considerable  importance are regularly found when investigators look for them. Use of the individual student as the unit of analysis constitutes a more powerful method of examining the relationship between previously studied teacher behavior variables and student performance measures. It also allows interaction analysis techniques to be used on problems and variables not previously studied. Practical application of the improved method has been achieved in a study designed to identify and measure the behavioral mechanisms underlying the transmission of teacher expectancies for children's performance.

Teachers ranked children in the class in order of their achievement. Two observers using an interaction analysis system recorded interactions between each teacher and each of three boys and three girls high on her list and three boys and three girls low on her list. Differential teacher expectations for different children were associated with a variety of interaction measures, although many of these relationships are attributable to objective differences in the behavior of the children. However, other differential teacher behavior was  observed which is not attributable to objective differences among the children and which is consistent with the hypothesis that differential teacher expectations function as self-fulfilling prophecies. The teachers demanded better performance from those children for whom they had higher expectations and were more likely to praise such performance when it was elicited. In contrast, they were more likely to accept poor performance from students for whom they held low expectations and were less likely to praise good performance from these students when it occurred, even though it occurred less frequently.

One systematic way of looking at classroom communication involves the distinction between the nature of communication behaviors--\" substance\"--and the shifts from one kind of behavior to another another--\"transitions.\" Further dimensions of the \"substance\" of verbal communication are 1) institutional events, which relate to managing of the classroom and meeting the expectations of the school; 2) task events, which focus on the teaching and learning of subject matter content; and 3) personal events, in which personal goals, needs, or  emotions provide the central focus. Further breakdowns can be made, e.g., in the substance of content communication, of classroom questions, and of teacher appraisal behaviors. At times events are \"mixed,\" as when the teacher considers an event a task event while students perceive it as an institutional event. Communication is facilitated when a congruence of the interpretation of the event exists between the communicators. \"Transitions\" in communication behaviors are as yet a very little explored subject. Teachers employ them of various kinds and complexity for effective explanation of content, management and control, appraisal of student behavior, and other purposes. (JS)",

Originally used to analyze teaching behavior observed in elementary school classrooms where &quot;Science--A Process Approach&quot; was being taught, IAST was later found to be applicable as a research tool and supervisory aid in other curriculum areas and at other levels. Part 1, a 26-category system based on the 10-category Flanders system, includes 10 student, 14 teacher, and two new categories.

Since the validity of the Scott coefficient PI, the customary statistic for calculating observer reliability, appears to decrease as the number of categories in a system increases, a standardized, nationally available recording of teaching behavior (the Suchman recording of an inquiry session available from Science Research Associates) was used in estimating reliability of observers, demonstrating the possibility of establishing a universal reference for estimates of observer reliability.

The summer workshop began with a 3-day encounter session which built group rapport and facilitated a program of self-awareness and innovative teaching methods. Activities in the workshop sessions (22 days throughout the year) dealt with peer dynamics, self-evaluation, video-tape techniques, and such improved teacher-student techniques as individualized instruction and problemsolving. The approach was one of dialogue, demonstration, and interaction. Each of nine staff members worked throughout the year as consultants in a specific  area (e.g., elementary education, psychology, administration, and business). The 20 teachers then worked in their five schools as leadership teams during 20 days of released-time inservice training sessions involving the entire staffs of their buildings. Project evaluation included comparison of participating teachers with a control group using instruments to measure attitude, personality, peer relationships, and classroom climate. Project objectives were met to a statistically proven degree. Significant outcomes included attitude improvement, reduction of anxiety, increased self-knowledge, implementation of new teaching methods, and establishment of a teacher sharing program. (JS)",

A standard procedure was followed with all subjects, and permission to tape-record the interviews was granted in all but one instance. The interviews were constructed with open-end inquiries, beginning with broad questions and progressively narrowing to specifics; one interview schedule was designed for teachers and one for non-teachers. The analysis of the data obtained has not yet been completed, but results so far obtained indicate that 61 percent of the subjects had taught and planned to continue, 8 percent had left the profession, and 31 percent had indefinite plans,  including a significantly higher proportion of secondary than elementary education majors. The goals of the PTETB project were to increase the number of promising candidates who continued teaching and to increase the number of unsuitable candidates who left. The interviews indicated that there seemed to be a general tendency for those rated higher as student teachers to be more committed to a teaching career; the tendency of the highest rated teachers to teach and the lowest rated teachers to quit was slightly increased after feedback given during the project on their student teaching performance, but this was not significant.

The research was carried out in four first-grade classrooms in a small Texas school district; in each class three girls and three boys rated high in achievement by their teacher, and three girls and three boys rated low were observed. A special coded system was constructed to record differential teacher behaviors, the quality of the child's response, and the type of feedback provided by the teacher. Approximately 4 hours of reading instruction were observed in each classroom. The results showed that teachers extend equal treatment to boys and girls, with high-achievement students of both  sexes receiving preferential treatment in some instances. However, boys did receive more teacher criticism over all areas of classroom life because of their more frequent disruptive behavior. Students' impressions were that boys received more negative comments from teachers during reading instruction, probably due to a generalized halo effect distorting their perception of what happens in the reading group. The fact that girls learn to read faster than boys cannot be traced to teacher behavior during reading groups, and the educational significance of this difference does not seem to be important.

Treatment groups of audiotape playback (AP) and videotape playback (BP) were scheduled for immediate playback after the counseling sessions were completed and for delayed playback 2 days later. The subjects were 30 male college seniors enrolled in a teacher education program. The counseling project was conducted for the 5 weeks prior to their student teaching experience and an identical counseling outline was used for all groups. One counselor conducted the four groups. A modified Butler-Haigh Q-sort (1954) and the Survey of  Interpersonal Values (SIV) (Gordon, 1960) were administered both before and after the counseling project. An analysis of variance design was applied. The results showed that delayed playback increased interpersonal support scores significantly more than immediate playback.

The project was based on the hypotheses that students with academic difficulties could be made more academically successful, their grade-point averages could be significantly raised, their attitudes toward higher education, professors, study, and teaching the disadvantaged would become more positive, and that faculty members could be encouraged to modify existing courses and develop innovative approaches. Approximately 50 students, volunteers from a large group of probationary or \"dropped\" students, were involved during the 1968-1969 academic year, and approximately 100 during the 1969 summer  session. Data on three control groups was also collected. The results of the second year's research are set out in detail. The process of assimilating project components into the main teacher education program was begun during the third year, so that the effect of the program on larger numbers of teacher education and non-teacher education students can be evaluated. It is recommended that other schools of the University and other institutions of higher education should be encouraged to continue experiments with the project components, and that related or replicative research activities in the areas with which the project has been concerned should be supported locally, at state level, and through Federally sponsored programs.

The project provided 1) different emphases in academic concentration and individualized, imaginative teaching of the course sections in which the students were enrolled; 2) academic standards which were realistic in terms of the student at the time they were applied, with appropriate assistance in remediation  when needed; 3) more concern for such essentials of teaching success as ability to communicate, appropriate attitudes, real concern for the individual and individual differences, imagination, and creativeness; 4) a strong professional orientation toward teaching the academically disadvantaged. The pilot activities included personal development seminars, group counseling, learning center activities, and paraprofessional work experience. Results showed that project pilot students achieved consistently higher grades than matched groups of non-project students. Curriculum details are included in volumes 2 and 3.

Findings indicate the R & I Unit did offer an organizational climate which facilitated the use of research and development information for instructional improvement. Further testing is required, however, to determine the optimum amount of released time required, the optimum type of research and development training required by an R & I Unit team, and the cost-effectiveness of the R & I Unit structure in comparison with alternative arrangements.

The study was conducted with ten recorders who observed five teachers through a one-way mirror and rated them on an observational schedule. The SUTEC (School University Teacher Education Center) Observational Schedule was used. (A copy is attached to the document.) Items observed included teacher mobility, the involvement of the children, materials present, materials in use, irrelevant behavior by the children, directed  behavior, and spontaneous behavior. Analysis of variance was applied to the data obtained.

(See also ED037422 for analytic summaries of the models' specifications). The models are not yet operational realities and although their practical feasibility has not been tested, it can be predicted with some degree of certainty in terms of the five major categories in the accreditation standards: 1) curricula for basic programs; 2) faculty; 3) students; 4) resources and facilities; and 5) evaluation, program review and planning. Each of these areas is  considered in some detail in the report. The conclusion suggests that, in general, the standards provide a useful mechanism for evaluating the models. Although the ten models have been considered as a group, there are wide differences between them, which will become clear through operation, and the directions indicated will become increasingly useful and will demonstrate the necessity for continued upgrading and improving of standards for accreditation.

Three basic research studies and one applied research investigation were begun during the 1967-68 school year, with a streamlined version of Mark I placed in classrooms throughout SWCEL's four-state service area for field-testing in 87 classrooms. An inservice network training program was prepared to make maximum use of both Laboratory  and qualified local personnel, or \"master teachers.\" A 2-week institute of master teachers was held in the summer of 1968 to train them to install Mark I and to prepare other teachers in the program. As the result of a further 150 field tests, an outline was prepared for Mark II, including a diagnostic test to assess the needs of the target population, and the model was completed by September 1969. A further modification, Mark II, is planned to contain all the present elements while reflecting needed refinements and supplementary materials. Quality control mechanism will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. (See also SP 004 099). (MBM)",

The process involves four phases: 1) determining objectives and appropriate teaching methods; 2) making the video tape; 3) observing the tape and recording the information on a coding card; and 4) analyzing the information. The system has produced a marked increase in teacher awareness, an improvement in teacher morale, an improvement in methods of instruction, and a significant increase in student achievement. The nine levels of objectives used are based on Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, with three in the affective category and six in the cognitive. The methods used are either closed--lecture, demonstration, direction, question,  mastery, and problemsolving--or open--clarification, inquiry, and dialogue. The teacher's expressions are divided into seven verbal and seven nonverbal categories of support, helping, receptive, routine, inattentive, unresponsive, and disapproval. The document includes transcripts and analyses of training tapes for four elementary sessions in social studies, arithmetic, reading, and science, and five secondary sessions in English, algebra, French, chemistry, and American problems. Four appendixes give TSA observation terms and definitions, ground rules for coding, suggested readings and resources, and brief information on computer analysis. (MBM)",

The oral language responses of 150 elementary school children and 30 kindergartners (selected at random) to two silent, animated films of Aesop's \"Fables\" were transcribed and segmented into syntatic units for linguistic analysis. Among the findings of the analysis are (1) that the length of compositions, the length of minimal terminable syntactic units (T-units), and the number of sentence-combining transformations per T-unit increase with advance in grade, particularly during grades 1 and 5, signifying important stages in the development of language complexity, (2) that nominal constructions  containing adjectives, participles, and prepositional phrases show significant increments in the rate of occurence at each advance in grade level, and (3) that boys surpass girls, except in grade 5, in length of compositions and of T-units, and in the use of nominal and coordinate constructions. (Included are nine tables to indicate such data as mean number of words used per T-unit and compostion, and structural patterns of main clauses and of grammatically incomplete constructions in boys' and girls' speech at six grade levels.)

For all 14 passages, each word was typed on a radio-mat slide in preparation for projector presentation with an exposure interval for each word of .5 seconds. The subjects, introductory psychology students assigned to individual treatment on a random basis (except for sex, numerical, and inter-item balance), were presented with the learning material after a brief  explanation. Basic learning data were scored in four ways: the number of trials to criterion, the number of words recalled (not necessarily correctly) on each trial, the number of three-word sequences identical with the original recalled on each trial, and the number of intrusions in each recall of each subject. Results of the research rejected the total-time hypothesis. (Lengthy appendices contain the learning material and data on the number of trials to criterion, followed by the quantitative and organizational factors, and the results for intrusions.) (JMC)",

Jackson examines some possible sets of objectives for a language arts program--e.g., development through language of creative and reasoning faculties, awareness of language characteristics and of writing models useful in contemporary society, achievement of expected terminal and intermediate behavioral goals, and development of the componential parts of particular language arts skills, such as reading for comprehension. He also offers thoughts on setting up programs to highlight critical language areas. J. Tosh describes an approach to language and grammar that involves teachers in three stages: (1) determining whether children can recognize various uses of language; (2) determining whether the students were able  or could be taught to describe the uses; and (3) encouraging students to produce varieties of language appropriate to certain purposes. M. Cook and D. Valentine describe their experience using a children's novel, \"Carrigmore Castle,\" as a basis for class discussion, composition, dramatic interpretation, and supplementary reading.

Multiple choice questions probed such areas as teacher attitudes toward use of media, present use of media instruction, school availability of audiovisual tools, and extent of teacher-produced materials. Other items elicited information on the teacher's relationship to the person in charge of audiovisual facilities, teacher acquaintance with the school's audiovisual facilities, types of teacher-produced media materials, and teacher opinion on the place of non-print media in English classes. Some findings of the survey were that (1) less than  one-fourth of the respondents had taken audiovisual courses as undergraduates, (2) teachers desired to learn more about the equipment which they were already using, (3) teachers seldom or never used media as a means of individualizing instruction, and (4) the only tool in nearly every classroom was the bulletin board, although such aids as tape recorders and overhead projectors were listed as generally available.

Disagreement between English teachers and professional theatre personnel about the best methods of preparing students to attend dramatic productions led to a 6-month study that involved 52 teachers and more than 1300 students. Study materials were supplied to students in conjunction with their classroom discussions and the viewing of two plays. Independent variables considered for each play were (1) intensity of study of the background, (2) intensity of study of the text, (3) timing of the classroom treatment, and (4)  content of the classroom treatment. Fifteen dependent measures were used. Results from 11 tests indicated that few significant effects were achieved through manipulation of the variables, and that the positions taken either by the educators or the theatre people about the effects of classroom practices were not supported.

        "description":"Using methods derived from sensitivity training, teachers can help students to \"feel involved\" with works of art and make works \"come alive for them.\" Current humanities instruction is said to be impersonal, overly intellectual, poorly taught, and irrelevant. Sensitivity training emphasizes the individual and his capacities for self-awareness; it attempts to rehabilitate the emotions as a way of knowing; and it emphasizes the individual's participation in a small group. As the student becomes aware of his own feelings, he becomes more sensitive to what he reads. In addition, through such training the teacher can become more sensitive to the atmosphere of the class and to the learning that takes place. Sensitivity techniques which are valuable in the classroom are (1) acting out  the reading, (2) placing oneself in the position of someone else, (3) fantasy trips, (4) trials, (5) contemporizing to connect the work read with the present, and (6) drawing. When such techniques are used, students make discoveries about themselves through involvement with the questions raised in the readings examined. (LH)",

To obtain an estimate of what children learn, over 3,000 students in grades 4-7 were administered a Melodic Listening Survey (structured into nine subtests) by tape recording under the direction of their own teachers. Children in each grade level were divided randomly into two groups--one that listened with the use of notation and one that listened without notation--to provide an evaluation of the auditory and visual perception factor in listening development. Results supported the use of auditory-visual discrimination as a factor in listening development, and revealed, despite generally low test scores, an increase in achievement with increasing  grade level. Some areas of melodic listening measured by the Survey were grasped, but some were unfamiliar concepts to the students. Achievement scores on the Survey and the teachers' ratings of instruction revealed no relationship The need for rating scales for instruction was in evidence. (Included are the Melodic Listening Survey with teacher directions; raw test scores; and music curriculum questionnaires for the music supervisor and classroom teacher.) (Author/JMC)",

        "description":"A norm distribution consisting of test scores received by 810 college students on a 150 item dichotomously-scored four-alternative multiple-choice test was empirically estimated through several item-examinee sampling procedures. The post mortem item-sampling investigation was specifically designed to manipulate systematically the variables of number of subtests, number of items per subtest, and number of examinees responding to each subtest. Defining one observation as the score received by one examinee on one item, the results suggest that as the number of observations increases beyond 1.23 per cent of the data base all procedures produce stochastically equivalent results. The results of this investigation indicate that, in estimating a norm distribution by item-sampling, the  variable of importance is not the item-sampling procedure per se but is instead the number of observations obtained by the procedure. It should be noted, however, that in this investigation the test score norm distribution was approximately symmetrical and the possibility should not be overlooked that item-sampling as a procedure may be robust for symmetrical norm distributions.

Test data was of little use in identifying problems or in suggesting revisions in curriculum, but questionnaire information was useful in rating the effectiveness of the material. There are four critical stages in this evaluation strategy: the organizational stage, (identification of the key elements); the criteria stage (questionnaires on interest, effectiveness, significance, clarity, and sufficiency); interpretation (when judgments must be made about levels of positive response); and, finally, directive reporting of the results that makes clear the changes needed in the materials. Although the effectiveness of this strategy can be assessed by  obtaining positiveness scores on a revised unit, a more significant possibility would be the development of norms by which to interpret questionnaire responses. However, the first method has indicated gains in student interest on 14 activities, all but 3 being significant. (PR)",

To obtain the goals it sets for reliability and validity, CAM employs two modern measurement techniques, item sampling and longitudinal testing. It tests achievement on every objective of a course at frequent test administrations throughout that course. CAM yields more information of superior quality than do the other models, due to systematic pretests and measures of retention of objectives, and also allows for  comprehensive feedback.

A synergistic relation, on the other hand, can produce greater student learning than either teacher or evaluation can produce alone. Evaluation is more useful to teachers if it is focused on teacher concerns about current curriculum, about students, and about class achievement. Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM) accomplishes the goal of such a synergistic relation by leading the teacher to decisions which define the curriculum and set priorities for information collection. Repeated estimates of students' achievement before instruction, immediately post-instruction,  and retention on all major behavioral objectives for a course are provided. Hence enough quick and useful information is available to be used in curriculum revision. Five applications based on such evaluative reporting are noted. (ES)",

A rationale for variable selection, the statistical methodology employed, and the procedural limitations are presented. The rationale emphasizes the strong relationship of pupil background (socioeconomic status, attitudes and aspirations) and school resource variables (human and financial) to each other and to student performance. The methodology emphasizes simple and easily comprehensible reporting, but includes multivariate analysis of the  data; and program's limits include problems of defining and measuring the complexities of an educational system.

If, however, one desires to assess the efficiency of some treatment, the researcher is interested in the performance of groups of students who received the treatment rather than in the performance of any one individual. In such cases statistics based on individual performance do not constitute a proper basis for item selection and for interpretation of test results. In this context, therefore, the discrimination power of an item should be conceived as its capacity to discriminate among classes and not among individuals. This approach is not only logically sound, but also increases the quantity and quality of the information available. Three new parameters are  introduced: item-test correlation based on class data, item standard deviation based on class data, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of an item. An item analysis of a fourth grade arithmetic test is used as an example. Other class data parameters are suggested for future research. (DG)",

Later, a standardized test consisting of a timed written response to a drawing was instituted for grades 1-8. Results from this evaluation procedure suggest that emphasis on many writing experiences, evaluated in terms of the clarity and interest of the content rather than the mechanics, should continue and that the standardized test is a reliable instrument for such evaluation.

Subjects were 229 engineers who were administered the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) in 1935 as college freshmen (1935 FR) and again in 1966, and 210 freshmen who completed the SVIB in 1966 and had persisted in an engineering curriculum for two years (1966 FR). Two MDFA analyses were conducted and cross-validated. Statistically significant profile differences were found. 1935 FR preferred occupations which involved the technical application of knowledge. In 1966, their preferences included managerial endeavors. 1966 FR responses were congruent with those of men in occupations requiring sophisticated quantitative and research skills. They  exhibited more interest in management and business than did their predecessors as freshmen. These findings provided a basis for career counseling inferences with prospective engineers and attested to the value of MDFA for research of this type. (Author)",

Data is gathered on four constructs: objectives, organization of the material (scope and sequence), methodology, and evaluation. Questions elicit a mixture of yes-no, check list, and summary rating scale answers with open ended responses permitted where an exception to the listed approaches is encountered. The rater progresses through an atomistic analysis of the material to a numerical summary rating of the construct. In this study twenty-five graduate students rated two instructional packages, a reading package and a science package. Ratings were done individually and by groups. Individual responses showed agreement in 56 of 64 responses. Some of the  limitations of the questions and the few disparities between individual and team evaluations are discussed. Inter-rater reliability scores both for each of the ratings on the constructs and the overall score were greater than .9. Inter-item reliability estimates were: objectives .38, organization of material .37, methodology .77, evaluation .99, and overall .55. A follow-up study with teachers after they have assessed materials with the instrument is suggested. Finally, general issues in instructional design are discussed. The instrument and a comprehensive glossary are included. (Author/GS)",

Consequently, it was necessary to assess the possibility of faking. An earlier study indicated that when under instructions to do so, individuals can increase their scores by faking. There was, however, no significant tendency to fake among applicants who were retested as freshmen, thus suggesting that either faking does not occur under selection conditions, or that it was present at both administrations. The present study sought to further evaluate these possibilities by comparing SVIBs completed by applicants in routine non-Navy administrations with those they completed under NROTC selection  conditions. There was no significant or consistent tendency for applicants to increase their selection scores. The results suggest first, that simulated faking designs do not parallel what actually occurs in selection, rather they indicate only that a scale can be faked; and second, that faking is not a significant problem in the use of the SVIB in NROTC selection.

Five major schools visited were selected for control studies. Descriptive analyses were made of the  administration of the various aspects and departments of the program. Through interview information, the attitudes of supervisory personnel in city departments to the program were assessed; in 1964, this was effected by means of a questionnaire Student attitudes were evaluated through a questionnaire relating to work experiences and school learning.

In the Union County Regional High School District No. 1, New Jersey, 15 percent of students were found to be &quot;educationally disadvantaged.&quot; Preliminary steps in the mobilization program were inservice teacher training and curriculum writing projects in the summers of 1967, 1968, and 1969. The program was instituted for grade 9 in 1967, for grade 10 in 1968, and for the junior level in 1969. For all three of the grade levels, a social studies and English curriculum was developed utilizing the multi media approach--games, puzzles, poll taking, and participating in community activities. The summer projects  were followed by monthly inservice sessions, which were held to be so successful that a project for grade 12 is to be held in the summer of 1970. The dropout rate since the project began fell to under 1 percent, and students averaged a 1.2 grade level increase in reading. The greatest strengths of the program are considered to have been the preparation of teachers to meet the needs of the educationally disadvantaged and the construction of relevant topics to promote motivation, while reinforcing and introducing needed skills for achievement in high school.

The project was conducted in an inner city elementary school whose population was 85 percent black, ten percent Puerto Rican, and five percent white, the subjects being from five second grade classes. In experimental and control classes, data were collected by observation of the children for 20 minutes per day, five days per week. Five one-hour workshops were conducted for the teachers and  paraprofessionals to introduce a motivational and behavioral management program, and to teach a contingency management system. Further training was provided by bi-weekly meetings to discuss progress and problems. Results showed an increase in the experimental classrooms of the average percentage of children working on their programed reading books, compared to no increases in the control classroom.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to test some of the controversial issues raised by researchers studying the performances of children of middle class and low socioeconomic status (SES). In addition to studying the effects of SES and levels of intelligence on rote learning and more complex reasoning processes, the effects on reading achievement of different combinations of learning skills and environmental factors were examined. The subjects were 35 children in each of the three groups low, middle, and high SES, chosen at random from grade 1 classes in three school areas. All of the children were approximately six years in age. In a pre-grade 1 battery of psychological tests, the children had been examined for ratings in the Sprigle School Readiness Screening Test and the  Stanford-Binet Test. Raven's Progressive Matrices and a word recognition list were presented when the children had been in Grade 1 for four months. To investigate more specifically the effects of intelligence and SES, four criterion groups of twelve children were selected and a 2 x 2 factorial analysis of variance was applied to the test results of the 48 children. Results indicated that rote skills and more complex reasoning processes do not seem to be differentially distributed among SES classes. It is held, however, that SES undoubtedly is a highly significant factor where scholastic achievement is concerned. (RJ)",

Negro Americans educated in white institutions are turned against their own people; they become advocates for oppression of blacks, not advocates against their oppression. Education for humanism is far more relevant than intergrated education, or even separatist education. Integrated education has largely been a subterfuge; little systematic effort has been undertaken to help black and white students relate as equals. Looking at events of the recent past, it is clear that decentralized systems tend to replicate centralized ones except for size; the effective decisions continue to be made centrally. Students  both black and white, are agitating for the right to identify decisions about their lives which no one can make for them. Such decision-making should be along cultural lines. A multicultural institution cannot exist without multicultural control. Finally, there is need to deliberately work out a meaningful linkage between the school and the community. The content of the in-school curriculum should draw heavily upon the content of the community experience. (RJ)",

Fresh thought should be characterized by a pluralistic approach to curriculum development and management, and institutional governance. Before Black Studies can earn the status of an academic discipline, white institutions must recognize their inability to so accredit them. They need to, among others mentioned earlier, replace \"scientific colonialism\"  with \"scietific humanism,\" and develop a systematic and transmittable body of knowledge about the black condition before being in a position to institute Black Stuides as an academic discipline.

A research and evaluation program planned as an intrinsic part of the experimental project encompassed a pre-test and post-test control-group design to provide analyses of test score changes as well as of comparisons with scores of other students. The test battery included: (1) questionnaire measures of demographic variables, family background, and attitudes toward college and the PSDS program, and (2) standardized and experimental measures of  personality and motivational variables such as self esteem, social adjustment, interests, expectations, and values. A success rate of over 50% of PSDS students was claimed as a result of examination of general data on success. The attitudes, values, and personality traits of PSDA students were shown to be remarkably similar to those of more advantaged &quot;typical&quot; Claremont College students, and the ability of the former students to compete successfully with the latter was also held to be equally remarkable.

After 1-3 years integration for the various groups, results were analyzed by comparison of 1966-68 post-integration data with 1966 pre-integration cross-sectional data for primary and intermediate grades. Interpretation of these analyses supports the Coleman Report conclussion only partially: Anglo achievement was not reduced, but black and Mexican-American achievement was not improved due to integration.  Determinants other than physical integration--very likely psychological and social integration--have to be considered for this continuing disparity in academic achievement. Plans and future research, based on differential input for attaining equal output, are aimed in this direction in the University of California--school district cooperative teacher education and research programs. When these plans become operative, then a test of consequence of a more sophisticated type of integration on the achievement and adjustment of Anglos, blacks, and Mexican-Americans would be available.

The paper deals specifically with the socioeconomic differences observed for the psychological and reading measures and reports some of the relationships found between the pre-school measures and the criterion-reading measures. The groups studied were kindergarten samples from four different urban schools. Tests administered included the: Stanford-Binet, Bender Gestalt, Hooper Visual-Organization, Draw-a-Person, kinesthetic perception, Copp-Clark Reading Series, Schonell Word Recognition, and McGahan's  Early Detection Inventory. Implications of the test results are considered to indicate the socioeconomic variable would be considerably important in any study attempting isolation of predictors for reading problems. It is also held that socioeconomic groups would have to be analyzed separately to determine the best differentiating measures for that group. (RJ)",

This report is an evaluation of Operation Wordpower, utilizing information already available in the files of each of the four Center sites for a total of 372 students. Two questionnaires, one to determine student opinion and attitudes toward the program and the other  to validate student attitudes by using staff responses, were respectively administered to students and staff. These data were used to review student characteristics and attitudes, to determine why students drop out, and to evaluate program effectiveness. Findings indicate that the program is effecting an important function in the area of reading improvement, but that it must be made more cost effective by moving to more locations and by instituting a more effective recruitment and motivational program.

The plan for desegregation entails two parts: (1) recommendations to be put into effect by September, 1970 -- the institution of two Early Childhood Centers, eight elementary schools generally clustered together to include grades 3-6,  one intermediate school for grades 7-8, two comprehensive four -year high schools, and provision for special education; and (2) recommendations to be implemented between 1971 and 1974--construction of a unified Education Plaza for grades 3-8, reorganization of the elementary schools, creation of science, liberal arts, and humanities focuses in high schools, and development of college-high school cooperation.

A comparison of OEO Head Start with DHEW Title I preschool programs indicated that: (1) Title I funds at local level are spent on programs enrolling a lower percentage of the poor; (2) more than three fourths of Head Start participants seemed to be receiving medical and dental examinations; (3) Head Start classes are approximately half Title I class size and involve a larger number of operating personnel per class; and, (4) Head Start offers a variety of preschool services and is more costly than Title I. A comparison of OEO and  DHEW Adult Basic Education programs revealed that in general the OEO program was more expensive and more employment-oriented than the DHEW program. Relating to the effectiveness of Upward Bound, it appeared that most students selected were underachievers who meet income qualifications, that college admission rates and retention rates among enrollees indicate marked program success, and that the program ranks as one of the more successful anti-poverty efforts.

The second section deals more extensively with the role of the local administrator (principal) in building and maintaining good intergroup relations within the school. Suggested administrative techniques are described for working with professional staff, with the students, and with the community, and these  are a composite of the techniques that various schools across the nation have used in establishing effective human relations programs. Every administrator would not necessarily need to employ all the techniques and activities described. The nature of the school concerned and the nature of the community in which it exists will determine which specific techniques would be most desirable. (RJ)",

The purpose of the program is to assist and motivate California high school students who are members of culturally disadvantaged groups and who have demonstrated intellectual promise. Under the 1960 California master plan for public higher education, some four percent of entering and transfering students are admissible by special provision, and it is this &quot;four percent rule&quot; that is used for recruitment of EOP students. Risk applicants must submit three to five letters of recommendation from teachers and counselors. Admissions standards are, however, flexible enough to accommodate those  who are academically deficient but promising. Examination of the profiles of former EOP students indicates that EOP serves a cross-section of the disadvantaged. Major sources of financial aid for EOP students are federal grants and loans, private gifts, University registration fees, and special Regents' appropriations. The Berkeley EOP has been successful as evidenced by an independent evaluation by the Southern Educational Foundation. (RJ)",

The burden of responsibility is placed on the learner in the kind of open educational system envisaged therein. A guidance system where teachers, community people, and professional guidance personnel would participate and cooperate would lead to self-direction in learning. The aim of this type of curriculum is to put the Model Neighborhood resident into a series of life situations that will constitute quality education. Education will thus have to be carried out in nonschool  settings within the community where work will not be contrived but real. Relating to teacher education problems, the University of South Florida is delegated with identification of problems and production of capable teachers. Physical facilities for education is thought of in terms of a centrally located megastructure provided with space for every imaginable facility. The activities of the education and health component are considered to be worthy of consolidation in this structure. (RJ)",

Services were also furnished to those children who were mentally retarded, or visually or acoustically handicapped. Specific objectives related to the characteristics of those children were to improve classroom performance in reading beyond usual expectations, to improve self-image, to increase expectations of school success, and to improve average daily attendance. Evaluation procedures of the project included examination of school records, interviews with school administrators, attendance of speech therapy and remedial instruction classes, and interviews with project supervisors and with parents of enrollees.  Findings of the study are considered to justify the conclusion that all project objectives have been advanced to the extent possible within the limits of the operational period. Recommendations included: continuance and recycling of the project on a full-year program basis, institution of a follow-up study, recruitment of personnel with a background of handling the handicapped, continuance of education of parents about the program, and continuance of use of personnel from disadvantaged areas.

The evaluation attempts assessment of any long-range effects of this program on disadvantaged high school students in four representative high schools. The study focuses on the effect, if any, that the student transfer program had on academic achievement, drop-out rate, and attitude toward school of these disadvantaged youth. Study data were collected by conferences with principals and administrators, and also by gathering information on the ethnic census of the school, integration efforts, special services, student attendance, lateness, and truancy for two samples--1965 grade  9 entrants and 1966 grade 10 entrants. Questionnaires were administered to guidance counselors and classroom teachers. Recommendations include the need to both intensify and extend existing services, the need for intensive studies of the total range of remedial and compensatory programs, and the accompaniment of organization changes (such as the grade 9 transfer programs) by massive and sustained infusion of other services including remediation, guidance, teacher training, and the like.

The two major difficulties appear to be the creation of independent schools or districts under local community control, and the development of adequate funding resources once independence is established. All of the private community schools are facing financial crisis--Federal funds, though a source of potential support, are insufficient to satisfy expansion. Legislation in several states allowing state aid to private schools may ultimately provide the largest potential source. Both groups of community school activists--those who seek change in the system, and those who have abandoned the system--have  been faced with great adversity in their cause; there is, though, a mounting commitment to the movement. The movement seriously questioned whether public school systems are effective. The movement fosters an attitude of public accountability for professional performance. Various groups no longer accept an arrangement whereby schools function isolated from the public, oblivious to its needs and demands. From the experience of community control schools, there exists only one of several possible future options--only city-wide total system reform offers a viable alternative. (RJ)",

The test materials were small samples of mother-child pairs from New York City--one from West Harlem (with a middle and lower class subsample), and the other from Washington Square (white upper middle class). The empirical findings of the study were as follows: (1) the general pattern of mother-child interaction was a responsive one--a give and take interaction which was not balanced, but at the same time not markedly  one-sided; (2) changes in interaction with age appeared to be partly due to the child's cognitive development, increase of explanations, and increased grammatical complexity for example; (3) the differences between the West Harlem and the Washington Square samples, as well as the difference between the lower and middle class West Harlem sample appeared to be small; and, (4) commonly held stereotypes of the family interaction of Harlem children were not supported by any of the data of the study.

Ultimately, the student confronts the dilemma that the riots pose for American values and institutions, and is asked to articulate his personal role in meeting this challenge.

In this 1968-69 program, 1,422 teachers supplemented by 485 special teachers, 138 professionals, and a large number of paraprofessionals were deployed to teach 16,456 pupils living in New York City disadvantaged areas. The major objective of the program was to raise the academic achievement of the students by means of promising modern methods of teaching under optimum conditions with a staff of able, enthusiastic teachers and clinical teams. The program also included plans for selecting schools so as to  achieve maximum integration, use of educational facilities after school hours, establishment of close relations with local colleges and universities, and increased community involvement in school matters. Findings of the study indicated that: the program's major objective was realized to a considerable degree--but many teachers through lack of training or experience seemed unable to make the most of opportunities presented; neither improved integration nor closer relations with colleges and universities was achieved; school facilities were used but not to the extent envisaged; and, most of the schools developed strong ties with the community.

However, there are those, such as prison inmates, who have difficulty using language in this manner. Realizing that prison inmates are not always able to communicate effectively through standard patterns of speech and thus are hampered in their rehabilitation efforts, this project focused on the modification of their substandard speech habits . Subjects were 21 Draper inmates matched on the basis of pre-oral usage test and divided into two control groups and one experimental group. Measures were taken and percentage change scores from pre- to posttreatment were employed as the units for analytical processing. A major finding was that all experimental inmates  showed increments that averaged 36 percent while a majority of the control inmates showed slight to moderate decrements averaging 6 percent. In concluding it was noted that the speech intervention drills and discussions were directly effective in modifying oral usage and indirectly effective by way of generalization of training in similar and dissimilar behavioral areas.

From this analysis, the 10 entry-level occupations of ambulance attendant, dental assistant, dietary aide, medical assistant, medical laboratory assistant, medical record clerk, nurse aide, surgical technician, visiting home health aide, and ward clerk were selected for curriculum development. Core performance elements as well as performance elements unique to each occupation were identified, and an 8-unit Health Development Career course was built upon the core performance elements. In lieu of a live  situation, the model was field tested in a hypothetical situation in which the health facilities and typical experiences were identified. To assist in planning the course, guidelines for development and implementation as well as activities and instructional aids for each unit are included.

Discussions followed the presentations, and participants made short-and long-range policy recommendations to help alleviate problems. Short-range  recommendations were made concerning the Job Corps, work-study programs, private educational alternatives, union and business involvement, Neighborhood Youth Corps, and girls' problems, while long-range recommendations were made for foreign experience, compulsory school attendance or work, delinquency and public policy, and the labor market.

In 1966 there were 1,020 institutions with two-thirds solely involved in 2-year postsecondary programs. There is great variation among states in the amount of cost to the  student as well as in the extent to which state, local, and private sources of financial assistance are available. Also, there is not a consistent national pattern of the availability of job placement services. Students entering postsecondary occupational programs come from high schools, colleges, and industry. Variations in the systems need to be examined in order to determine if some programs are superior, and more complete data are needed on the demographic and social characteristics and academic backgrounds of students.

Elements of the model include individual attributes, needs of society, vocational education goals and objectives, operational procedures, material and human resources, and actual outcomes or products of the program. Evaluation may be in terms of an appraisal of the process, or it may be directed toward an appraisal of the outcomes. The decision-maker is responsible for administrative functions, such as allocating resources and ordering objectives into a hierarchy, while the  program evaluator is responsible for the management system. This model, which may be used at any level, illustrates the information that must be provided by the program administrator to the decision-maker if appropriate alternatives are to be selected, objectives attained, and goals realized.

Analysis revealed that more positive attitudes were held by members of urban districts and Boards of Cooperative Educational Services than those in suburban or rural districts, probably because they have had more experience with occupational programs. Older board members and those with a number of years of service tend to have a more positive attitude.

This means we must assure equal employment opportunity for all in the industry, increase productivity through vocational training, adopt innovative techniques, and reduce seasonality, and make special arrangements in the construction industry for returning Vietnam veterans. People must be provided with the skills needed to take advantage of opportunities and bring supply more nearly into line with demand. Skilled construction labor has been in disturbingly short supply. The present Department of Labor Programs of Apprenticeship, Veterans' Training, Supplementary Training, Federal Construction Projects, and Equal Employment Opportunity have all been directed to  expand training for construction skills by 50 percent, increasing this pace over the next 5 years. In so doing, one of the Nation's most pressing needs can be met: the need to open up new job opportunities for millions of working men and women. This is vitally important to bring the supply and demand of labor into better balance. (GR)",

Results support conclusions that residential vocational education is not only desirable but necessary. Generally, residential schools have the typical secondary school commitment to prepare students for traditional postsecondary education. Few students can graduate from this type of school with a readily marketable vocational skill. It was suggested that age 16 should be the lower limit of  acceptance rather than 14 and that the school site should be within commuting distance to metropolitan areas. Student selection criteria appeared to be a critical problem area, with schools having no admission policies encountering numerous problems. In addition to study results, position papers by vocational technical education specialists are included. Data tables and the study proposal and questionnaires are appended. (Author/SB)",

Conventional instruction in typewriting has tended to focus on manipulative factors whereas relatively recent research has shown that cognitive factors (decision making processes) bearing on attractive placement of materials on the page are substantially more important in accounting for skill at realistic typing tasks above the level of simple copying. In view of the need for new instructional materials emphasizing the decision making processes, a 541-frame programed instruction unit was prepared. The program is divided into 14 sections covering horizontal and vertical centering, simple and advanced table typing,  business letters, and report typing. The program can be used by anyone who wishes to acquire or upgrade the cognitive skills taught by this program and can be used as a self-instructing unit. (Author/JS)",

The hospitality Education Curriculum Development Project sought to expand employment opportunities via the Initiation of new programs in local school settings and to secure by means of monitoring local clinical programs, a reservoir of experience and information from which to generate guidelines for the above. The ultimate objective of the project was to extend opportunities for occupational preparation to high school students. The major outcomes from this project are the materials prepared and used in the activities,  the educational growth experience by project participants, and the benefit to be derived by future projects by this type.

However, such a system has been developed and field tested over the past 3 years in two counties and six school districts in Pennsylvania. Key concepts used in the system include forecasting, indicators, the status report, and project alternatives. These concepts have been modified and adopted for the recommended New Jersey Vocational Educational Planning system. The system is primarily concerned with planning decisions and only secondarily with management and operations decision processes. It provides a formalized, sequential process, functioning continuously during the planning cycle and incorporates planning subsystem procedures, indicator sets,  forecast procedures, and data files and report generation procedures.

        "description":"To trace the process whereby Americans enter the labor force, work and education histories were collected from a random sample of about 1,600 Americans, with blacks oversampled. The two variables examined most closely were race and social class. The level of entry into the labor force as measured by occupational prestige was found to be strongly affected by the race and educational attainment of the individual; for whites it was also affected by pre-entry work experience. Social class had little effect. When subsequent jobs were examined, the process of entry was shown to have a continuing and significant effect on occupational attainment; while the effect of educational attainment quickly diminished, that of previous jobs increased, particularly for blacks. Controlling for  educational experience and family background status, blacks are clearly disadvantaged. They are successively worse off compared to whites at each stage of their occupational histories; the more schooling they receive, the greater the gap. These last findings are taken as evidence of institutional racism in the American labor market. (Author/BH)",

        "description":"Programs in pursuit of national goals can be expected to lead to rapid growth in job openings in the skilled construction crafts during the coming decade by creating an average of nearly 300,000 job openings a year. Compared to the 68,000 people completing training for these occupations in 1966, there is a definite lack of an adequate supply of trained manpower which in turn may complicate the attainment of national objectives. This rapidly growing demand for construction manpower, coupled with a slowly increasing supply, has two principal implications for planning in vocational education. First, rapid expansion in construction means parallel expansion in a broad spectrum of needs for skilled labor. Secondly, it implies an expanding base of job opportunities for individuals in  the \"left out\" groups in American society. An enlarged role for vocational education in the construction field would further the broad objectives of national policy, and would serve to implement the purposes of the 1968 amendments.

Sources of the data were: (1) Registrar's records; (2) psychiatric records; and (3) questionnaires yielding follow-up information sent to each of the sample who had failed to return to Harvard by September 1963. Some of the major findings were: (1) 24% of each class withdraws during its 4 years in college; (2) more than 43% of the sample left for psychiatric reasons; (3) more than 700 of the students who withdrew failed to get a degree from Harvard, and 420 of these failed to get a  degree from any college; (4) the majority of students gave personal or medical reasons as the primary cause for dropping out; (5) although the dropouts had high academic potential, their academic performance at the time of leaving college was poor; and (6) American blacks had a higher dropout rate than the average undergraduate.

Program content is focused on the study of four periods of crisis and change in western civilization. Students and faculty will read from primary sources, holding discussions in small seminars; faculty will respond to assigned papers either in written comments or in individual meetings with the students. Grades and examinations were eliminated. This research reports investigation of the personality development experienced by participating students compared to that of non-participating students attending more structured courses. The primary objectives of the study are to determine (1) personality  characteristics of students selecting each of these programs; (2) nature of students' development in one or another of these educational structures, (3) whether particular characteristics of students and of the college experience tend to facilitate development, and (4) various ways young people develop while they are students in college. Secondary objectives include study of dropout rate from the experimental program, and of the effect of the possible \"hot-house\" atmosphere of the experimental program on the students. (DS)",

Challenges to higher adult education include: public responsbility (encouraging young people to enter local government service and inventing new forms of helping professions); urban strategies (how far should the university go?); profision of conferences at which laymen may learn to understand the goals of academic freedom and excellence  and scholars learn to reconcile learning resources with public need; and mastery of educational technology.

The purpose was to provide clinical pastoral education within the clergtman's home community where he could learn to work cooperatively with mental health resources. Administrative centers were set up in Fort Wayne, Muncie, New Castle, Lafayette, southeast Indianapolis, and Columbus (Indiana); each area provided urban, rural, and semi-rural communities. The fall-to-summer period was selected and community resources were mobilized to select enrollees (78 clergtmen and 18 others) and to continue local interdisciplinary relations and education after the program.  A week spent at Indiana University Medical Center provided a core curriculum; it was followed by a series of tri-weekly seminars at which current pastoral cases were discussed and a second week at the Medical Center which focused on material current within the community. A followup was scheduled about six months after the curriculum phase. It was concluded that the clinical method is adaptable to continuing education for the clergy but it was recommended that a residential training center was necessary for continutiy. (EB)",

Institutional provisions are many and varied--theological schools, universities and colleges, conference and study centers, institutes, interseminary centers, denominational boards, and interdenominational organizations. The question of who has responsibility for providing it is debatable; a strong case can be made for seminaries but it might be a peripheral interest and a financial strain. It has been suggested that an interseminary approach--already undertaken with some success--seems better; residential study has advantages over other programs, as shown by the \"Tower Room Scholars\" (Union Theological Seminary  in Richmond), the \"Seabury Fellows\" (Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, Evanston), and others; there should be some association with, or in the setting of, a good university. A minister may be motivated by a career or identity crisis or by the authority of hierarchical jurisdictions. Denominational or interdenominational boards should publicize evaluative criteria for judging programs, provide financial support, and act as intermediary between the agencies and the ministers.

Interviews were held with a 5% random sample of members and a like number of nonmembers with similar characteristics and interests. Questionnaires were mailed to extension agents in the 116 counties with the program. Findings varied widely among the areas but the typical club member was found as likely to live in an urban area as on a farm, to be 45-64 years of age, to have completed high school but not usually college. She is married and not likely to be divorced or separated  as the average Kentucky woman. Her husband's most frequent occupation is farming. She tends not to have dependent children. She is not likely to be employed outside the home; if employed, it is usually part-time clerical work. She has been a member of the club for 10 or more years.

No strong correlation appeared between status, location, age, and course choice or number of registrations.

The purpose was to assess the feasibility of teaching illiterate adults the 85 lessons of the primer in an intensive course and to see if it was then possible to teach them how to keep simple farm and household records and accounts as the basis for a follow-on program. A longitudinal study was made of the new literates six months after the course. The purpose was to determine if the newly acquired literacy had become &quot;functional&quot; through the keeping of records under the supervision of the local agricultural demonstrator, if literacy had been retained (or to what extent), and if literacy was related to individual &quot;modernization&quot; level as seen in adoption of improved  practices. The general impression from limited test results is that those who completed the primer managed to maintain but not improve reading and writing skills and that literacy input and the adoption of improved crop and home economics practices were positively related. The full-time approach seems feasible and offers definite advantages compared with the organization of part-time classes in rural areas. (EB)",

As for the most pressing community needs, 97% of respondents mentioned industry and jobs; 49% named recreation; 8%, street improvement; and 6%, sewer improvements. Survey results received wide mass media publicity. In terms of useful information obtained, broadly based community  participation, attitude changes toward the community, such tangible improvements as new industry and a municipal swimming pool during the period 1963-68, and other outcomes, the survey was judged a success. (The document includes the questionnaires and a critical review of community development principles as applied throughout the survey project.) (LY)",

Goals of the programs are the improvement of health care of patients suffering from heart disease, cancer, stroke and related diseases and improvement in the practice of health professionals. The first step in evaluation is the development of objectives--both immediate and long range. The second phase is the selection or design of measuring instruments or the design of other procedures to collect data that will lead to evidence for evaluation. Next comes the collection of data--from the health professional as a participant in a learning experience and as practitioner, and also from society. The fourth phase is  analysis of the data; then judgment is made of how well objectives have been met. (A checklist is included; an appendix gives examples of decisions and modification.) (PT)",

The third phase of the project compared the effectiveness of radio farm forums and adult literacy classes for communicating information. The two villages using radio farm forums showed significantly more progress then either the two villages with literacy classes or the two control villages. There was some tendency for literacy villages to show more progress than control villages, but differences were usually not statistically significant. It was concluded that a well-run radio farm forum should result in rather immediate accelerated development, and that literacy  programs should be considered either as a long-term investment in development or as a social welfare measure.

The basic design was a modified case study method in which a sample of individual records were examined. Differences between this sample and national samples were tested by Chi Square. The Fisher Exact Method was used to test relationships between rejectee characteristics. Four fifths of the rejectees were IV-F. The Fisher test revealed that: (1) the relationship between the rejectee's educational level and that of his parents approached significance; (2) there is a strong relationship between high school program and dropping out; (3) no significant relationships were found between educational level and  social behavior, educational level and race, and educational program and social behavior. Socioeconomic factors were highly related to rejection as suggested by the high correlation between rejection and the number of Negroes examined, the number of households with income below $5000 and per-pupil expenditure in the schools. It is recommended that Delaware revise its public school curriculum so as to emphasize special help to disadvantaged groups and the racial minorities. (DM)",

Attention was also given to relationships between selected student characteristics and measured improvement in reading abilities, component parts of the adult literacy systems and the relative effectiveness of components as judged in observations of student reactions and progress. Pretest and posttest measures of selected primary reading skills were given to 42 Spanish speaking, functionally illiterate adults who were learning English as a second language. Qualified ABE instructors were obtained who were not acquainted with or biased toward either  the Mott or the Sullivan system, and who would teach them as independent and separate treatments. The Mott and the Sullivan system both proved effective in teaching the subject English as a second language. Motivation to learn, and initial speaking ability in English, were also highly significant to success.

Shorthand and typing courses, the Communications Clinic, and other curriculum elements were designed to correct deficiencies in basic educational and social skills and occupational information, as well as to provide placement services and personal and vocational counseling. Enrollees (516 in all, largely women) were recruited mainly through neighborhood centers and the Youth Opportunity Center. Trainees were evaluated on standardized tests of intelligence and educational achievement, employee selection instruments used locally, and vocational maturity scales. Innovative practices  included hiring by personal interviews instead of written tests, and the use of programed instruction and immediate reinforcement. In terms of placement in meaningful jobs, encouragement of realistic aspirations, successful use of teachers with both work and teaching experience, impact of the Communications Clinic on verbal and nonverbal performance, and changes in local employment practices after businessmen had used the Tampa learning centers for interviewing, testing, and hiring, the project seemed to be particularly effective.

        "description":"This work examined the origins of Title 1, Higher Education Act of 1965; and evaluated the status of its continuing education and community service programs as seen (1969) by administrators and others active in the program. The struggle for Federal aid to higher general education began with a general extension bill introduced into Congress in 1940. Title 1 finally emerged in 1965, not as general extension, but as a plan to solve community problems by strengthening continuing education and extension methods. Most survey respondents' general reactions to Title 1 were favorable, but half thought the program would have trouble surviving. About 2/3 cited increased institution community involvement as a major outcome; over half felt Title 1 had helped solve some acute community  problems. However, interpretations of Title 1 varied widely, and the act itself was unclear as to who should set program priorities. Special problems in funding, advising, and administration were also noted.

Perceived problems were analyzed by county, community size, and respondents' length of  residence in South Carolina. Results gave housing, youth opportunity, education, and recreation as major felt needs, with poverty, land use, employment, health, government, and transportation as significant but lesser concerns. (Included are the questionnaire, five tables, the Fiscal Year 1971 amendment to the Title 1 state plan for community services and continuing education programs, and a summary of selected Federal programs having related concerns.)

The \"synchronic fallacy\" is defined here as the belief that one can describe a language as if at any one point in time its code were stable. The author first considers the implications of \"synchronic fallacy\" to see how it relates to the distinction between integration and interference. He then studies the possible ways of measuring integration and analyzes the quantitative relationship between integration and availability with sample measurements. While the author does not feel that this may be the only way out of the  dilemma, he hazards the following general conclusions on the analysis of integration as distinct from interference: (1) conventional synchronic analysis is unsuited to the description of mixed and rapidly changing codes; (2) code integration is relative; (3) its relativity can be measured; and (4) interference can be stated in terms of this relative integration.

It is felt that perceptual theory cannot adequately explain phonological development, e.g. three-year-olds produce certain sounds which they will not accurately perceive until much later and vice versa. Three psychological scaling tests are described in which adults were asked to designate certain phonemes as harder or easier to produce. These judgments were compared with the phonemes acquired by three-year-olds. A highly significant correlation between the adult ratings and children's phoneme acquisition was found. Featural analysis tended to  support the hypothesis, and further confirmation was seen in the patterning of articulatory errors among children. The author stresses that these findings do not negate the importance of perceptual factors, emphasizing that he is trying to explain not the dynamics of phoneme acquisition but rather the schedule which it follows. It is, however, emphasized that there is no compelling evidence for perceptual theory, and certain observations which either militate against perceptual theory or encourage alternative speculation are discussed.

These principles are discussed with reference to the medium of presentation (teaching machines, book programs, tape-recorders, group teaching devices, visual aids, etc.) and to the subject matter. The subject matter has to be closely analyzed and a general theory and programing procedure to be developed which allows for the greater multiplicity of language, the greater multiplicity of specific learning purposes and the greater shortage of money in developing  countries. The lack of task analysis and the universal cult of perfectionism in European language instruction are criticised. Methods for making the programs shorter and cheaper are proposed. The special problems of programmed instruction in a language which is to be used as a medium of instruction are discussed as well as the programing of vocabulary and the problems of dialect speakers who have to learn the related standard language for specific purposes.

The main thrust of the work was to ask what kind of automaton a person can become. Various kinds of automata were considered, predictions were made from them, and these predictions were then tested against data from a learning experiment in order to distinguish between the models. Experimental material was a sub-domain of the set of arithmetic sentence in Japanese, because it was felt that work with a small limited system of language would enable the formulation of precise theories capable of being tested precisely. Syntax learning was felt to be the most important focus of the study; other factors looked  for were the influence of semantic practice on syntax learning, and semantic learning. Results of the experiment suggest that a finite automation is not the appropriate representation for the subjects in the experiments; results on semantics suggest that studies of syntax learning that do not include a semantic model may be losing an important component of syntax learning.

What has to be done is to decide what construction to focus on and what types to recognize as exemplifying that construction. The author and his colleagues have worked out such breakdowns for three sorts of constructions: finite verb phrases, noun phrases, and classical components, and tallied the occurrences of each of these three sorts of constructions for samples of speech collected from 30 children each (age 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 13). For all three sets of construction types there are definite increases with age in the 5-13 year span. It is clear that the  older children have to do more selecting when they produce the obvious English syntactic categories of verb phrase, noun phrase, and sentence frame. The author regards the best grammar for a child as that which generates the highest H's (the measure of average surprise value of selections from sets of entities with different probabilities of occurrence) and relative H's for his produced speech.

For the college level, statistics on the number of students with Portuguese as major or minor subject on all degree levels are given, as well as figures on the number of persons involved in teaching Portuguese and some information on their language backgrounds. The problem of the lack of a college entrance examination (CEEB test)  for Portuguese and the effect which this has on high school enrollment is dealt with in some detail. Also discussed are: teaching methods, teacher needs, the question of whether Peninsular or Brazilian Portuguese should be taught, and the possibilities for bilingual education programs in Portuguese and English. The author feels that despite seeming gains, the overall outlook for Portuguese teaching is not particularly positive. The closing of the summer institute at Vanderbilt University is seen as an especially discouraging occurrence. (FWB)",

To meet the problem of student \"nomadism\" at home and abroad, there should be certification of all transfers in terms of generally accepted standards of content and proficiency. The entire gamut of facilities in Chinese from high school through college and into graduate years and including summer sessions and full-time programs should be studied to determine the most effective calendars for acquiring the needed language tools. In the interest of teaching efficiency and the promotion of interest in study, newer techniques and gadgets should be appropriately  introduced into the academic program. Group action is needed in these four areas.

The author views the goal of the study of uncommonly taught languages at the understanding of other peoples and states that: \"Uncommon languages offer the best area for the testing of hypotheses regarding semantic universals and for the development of constructs to handle the bundling of semantic motifs. In these areas lie our hopes for laying the bases for inter-cultural understanding.\" In considering existing materials for these languages, the author expresses his view that, although individual materials may be inadequate, the totality of  materials contain information which could be quite useful if properly utilized, and suggests how the more effective use of materials could be achieved through a centralized self-correcting data bank. Also discussed are difficulties involved in the production of reference grammars and the study of language relationships and language history with regard to the uncommonly taught languages. (FWB)",

Basic to the discussion is the concept that language usage conveys important social information and is therefore not a matter of choice but must be rule-governed. The initial section differentiates linguistic competence (ability to produce grammatically correct sentences) from communicative competence (ability to select appropriate forms from the totality of grammatically correct expressions available). Techniques for eliciting communicative competence are then discussed and compared; all methods are seen to depend on the investigator's knowledge of the cultural make up of the group  concerned. With regard to the analysis of elicited conversational material, Labov's notion of sociolinguistic variables and the concept of \"background expectation\" are discussed, among others. Research dealing with social origin and communicative ability is also reviewed. The author concludes that the basic understandings achieved in the studies considered can aid the study of problem solving in small group studies by giving the researcher insights into basic communication processes, thus improving the validity of his own field work both cross culturally and within his own society.

Sections I through IV present a review of previous studies in the field, discuss the usefulness of the concept of \"innateness,\" discriminate between phonetic and phonological ability, and discuss the concept of discrete units in language and its relationship to language learning. Section V then presents a \"Preliminary Outline of Phonology Acquisition\" based on the theory that the acquisiton of phonology involves a large number of interrelated stages which cannot be strictly isolated from one another. The idea of a \"prelinguistic\" stage is rejected, it being assumed that the child's linguistic development begins soon after birth. The child's development  through the babbling stage and his acquisition of the concepts of sentence, syllable, segment and distinctive feature are then traced. Because the syllable is considered the first elementary unit of a child's speech and therefore of importance as the source of other units, the lengthy final section of the paper is devoted to the acquistion of syllable structure.

Whereas previous studies of code switching have, however, concentrated on instances in which code alternation can be correlated with a change in social occasion, this paper uses examples from the speech of Mexican-American and Afro-American bilinguals to focus on those instances in which seemingly random language mixture is found in informal situations in which the minority language is considered normal. The author argues that such switching is not random but serves definite and clearly understandable communicative ends. Underlying this phenomenon is seen to be the process of foregrounding (the highlighting of a word or a syntactical of phonological form by using its outside of its normal context), and the  various contextual meaning derived through such alternation are discussed in some detail. The author concludes that an understanding of the extent to which minority groups use code alternations as a verbal strategy in everyday interaction and of the extent to which such groups are sensitive to the relationship between language and context is more important to the success of programs aiming at biculturalism and bilingualism than a knowledge of the ways in which nonstandard dialects differ grammatically and phonologically from Standard English.

Performance on production and discrimination tests indicated a striking superiority for the subjects who received systematic training in the production of exotic sounds as opposed to those subjects who received only discrimination training in listening to these sounds. The results of this study suggest that what is effective in the teaching of sound production and discrimination is the systematic development by small steps from known articulatory postures and movements to new and unknown ones. The possession of a scientific knowledge of articulatory phonetics by the teacher was shown to be extremely successful in leading students to the correct production of  foreign sounds and thereafter to facilitate the discrimination of these sounds. The latter finding was taken as support for some carry-over from productive competence to auditory discriminatory competence. (Author/FWB)",

The major thrust of the program entailed the employment of former addicts who met with health education teachers from the target schools in a series of workshops and participated in diverse ways in classroom presentations regarding drugs. It was hoped that the program would reduce experimentation with drugs and check such involvement when it had already been established. In addition there were a number of secondary aims to the program. Statistical measures indicated the value of the program in increasing knowledge regarding narcotics and in changing attitudes in desired directions. It must be stressed however that given the plethora of statistical, observational, and  interpretive information and a conglomerate range of goals no single evaluative measure can comprehend the value of a program as complicated as this. Ultimate judgments therefore must rest with the reader willing to balance consequences with his own particular values. (RSM/Author)",

These were selected from a review of the pertinent literature and formed the basis for developing a scale of social attitudes. Two hundred and forty-five fourth, fifth and sixth grade students comprised the sample to which the scale was administered. Significant differences in attitude scores were sought by isolating the children's sex, I.Q., achievement level and grade level as independent variables. Achievement level was found to be  significant, with high achievers showing higher favorable attitude scores. Of all five areas probed, independent thinking was consistently the lowest positive attitude score.

Two speakers took an objective look at the program and center, defining their concern with \"normal\" youth, and discussing such aspects as: (1) accessibility of the service; (2) locations of the centers; (3) the use of vocational aides; (4) the proper use of testing; (5) record keeping; and (6) research. Three speakers addressed themselves to the topic of the relationship between church affiliated and public school guidance programs. Their general thrust was that church programs are conceived as supplementing, rather than supplanting, the public school programs. The vast needs of youth and the available guidance services both  nationally and, more specifically, in North Carolina, were reviewed; The disparity between need and existing services precluded, in the minds of the discussants, any redundancy of services. Other speakers considered the future expansion of the program services. One reviewed the area of testing and measurement and described the advantages of biographical inventories over more traditional methods of predicting success in vocational placements. The conference concluded with a review of the consultation and a group discussion of \"final considerations.\" (TL)",

        "description":"The theoretical concept of the double bind and the possibilities for researching it are discussed. The author has observed that theory and research, which should be reciprocal and mutually beneficial, have been working, as concerns the double bind, at odds with one another. Two approaches to empirically investigating the concept are considered via a review of the pertinent literature. The first is concerned with translating the phenomena into a valid operational form which can be studied; and the second is concerned with determining if schizophrenics are less able to discriminate double bind messages than other individuals. The author concludes that, generally, the reviewed studies have not provided a good test of the double bind. He does, however, note the two most significant  among them, viz.: (1) Mehrabian and Weiner; and (2) Ringuette and Kennedy. He stresses the immediate need for further research which would help limit, clarify and operationalize the tenets of the theory and, resultantly, make it capable of empirical validation. (TL)",

The laboratory movement has developed some power procedures for facilitating human change. To date some of the problems in the use of these techniques and processes have not been clearly specified and dealt with. The many issues and problems related to this movement should be analyzed and evaluated. Any positive results from a program of systematic evaluation could form the basis for firmly developed institutional and professionalized position for the  implementation of the laboratory method. Until this is done, serious reservations must be held regarding the use of sensitivity group sessions with young children, adolescents, and adults. (Author/KJ)",

He means many things to many people. If we are dedicated to helping all students succeed optimally, it behooves us to understand the characteristics of the pushout. This necessitates that we see him through his own eyes: (1) he has a poor self-image; (2) he sees himself as a failure. In order to help him to acquire a better self-image, answers must be found to several questions: (1) how can we avoid alienating these students? (2) what makes an educated person? and (3) how can we enhance the self-concept of academic ability of the pushout? The challenge to educators  is to create a new image of the pushout, an image which hopefully results in a self-concept of adequacy. (KJ)",

Problems of dropouts included in the discussion are: (1) lack of vocational maturity; (2) an impaired family relationship; (3) problems in school; and (4) inadequate motivation. Some of the barriers to counseling the dropout are: (1) the dropout's feeling of inadequacy; (2) communication barriers; (3) the  dropout's physical appearance and mode of dress; and (4) counselor prejudices. The following recommendations are made to employment counselors in the counseling process: (1) their responsibility is more than job placement; (2) they should provide help in those areas in which the dropout is willing to accept assistance; and (3) they should help the dropout develop realistic goals.

Computer assisted guidance and counseling supports and supplements what the counselor does. However, some problems may arise due to the use of computers: (1) impersonal feelings; (2) high cost; (3) the system needs to be tailor made for each local area; and (4) the negative attitudes of teachers toward such technology in education.

It was predicted that high A-State students given MS would make fewer errors than high A-State students given no memory support (NMS). Low A-State students were expected to perform equally as well with or without MS. Sixty male undergraduates were randomly assigned to MS or NMS conditions. All students received the same learning materials. The MS group was allowed to see their previous incorrect responses to each problem before attempting it again, whereas this information was not available to the NMS group. There were no significant effects of memory support on A-State as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. However, the predicted  memory support x A-State interaction was found for errors. These findings were compared with the results of previous research on anxiety and memory support. (Author)",

The patients were of dubious employability. The design was a series of sequential stages through which the 98 workshop participants passed, with attrition taking place at each stage. The program lasted for eight weeks and provided work adjustment rather than specific skill training. It consisted of a highly individualized, focused rehabilitation plan for each client, which centered around work assignments in the shop, but included counseling on a regular basis. Future plans were arranged for each client. A total of two follow-up studies were done. Results include: (1) graduation from the workshop greatly increased a client's  probability of vocational rehabilitation; and (2) many patients, while adjusting to the workshop and later employment, experienced major difficulties in other spheres of community adjustment.

Over a period of seven semesters 52 male and female clients were treated in a living unit on two corridors of a large university dormitory. Approximately the same number of volunteer students lived in the unit and a group of students who were nominated but did not participate served as clinical controls. Results indicated that severely emotionally disturbed students can be  provided satisfactory care in a rehabilitation living unit in a regular university dormitory without remarkable stigma or high risk to themselves or others.

Students were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on scales developed to measure attitudes and opinions on politics, citizenship, and knowledge of political news media. Parents were asked their party affiliation and political activities. Results indicate that the intensity and variety of political experiences the young have in their home determine their ability to perceive and internalize the various messages and stimuli received from the school, community, peers, teachers, mass media, political events, and public personalities. Therefore, the political socialization  process is a conserving system which does not drastically alter political behavior, beliefs, or attitudes of the adolescent. When change or cynicism does occur, it is probably the result of direct, purposeful experience. (KJ)",

To investigate this hypothesis, sibling-sex-status and ordinal position effects were analyzed separately for females who were highly committed to sport and females who were less committed to sport. It was also hypothesized that females with sisters as opposed to brothers would be underrepresented in the physical education group. This latter hypothesis was partially supported since females with younger sisters, not older sisters, were underrepresented in the physical education group. Although no significant sibling-sex-status or ordinal position differences  were found, these variables interacted significantly on one of the two measures of sport participation and on one of the two femininity scales.

Spelling aloud 2-, 3-, and 4-letter words during the motor response controlled the PFB from spelling and prevented overt counting. Eighty-four 11-14 year old boys were given immediate KR, the lapsed time for the motor response, for 50 or 60 trials according to the design. Only the condition reducing PFB to a minimum, no movement and no spelling, prevented accurate estimates, but above a minimal level accuracy, consistency and rapidity of learning increased with increasing PFB.

Principal comparisons throughout are between the black and nonblack samples, and within each sample, between migrants and nonmigrants. The extent to which geographical mobility takes place is documented and indications are that nonblacks tend to move further and more frequently than blacks, with the blacks showing a northward trend throughout history. Those with greater personal resources and skills, specifically education, are also more likely to migrate, except where individuals would be forced to enter low status and low income occupations by remaining. In this latter case, individuals with little education tend to move. In regard to  actual benefits which accrue as a result of migration, data suggest that those whose status was high in a given locale are likely to make lower gains by moving than those whose status was low. Information obtained on household compositions indicates that, overall, kin relationships beyond the immediate family group play a more important part in the black household than in that of the nonblack. Changes in migrant households are more pronounced than changes in nonmigrant households. Several extensive data appendices are included. (Author/CJ)",

Chapter I is concerned with theoretical implications, applications, and a survey of computer based guidance systems. Chapter II summarizes many new models and techniques for guidance which view vocational behavior as a developmental process rather than as an event. The material in Chapter III deals with career development conferences and Chapter IV describes  examples of programs designed to realize the ultimate criteria of a vocationally mature individual. Chapter V discusses career exploration achieved vicariously via games, simulation practices and guidance kits which encourage student activity and involvement. The intent of Chapter VI is to summarize recently developed instrucments for measuring vocational behavior and Chapter VII illustrates the preponderance of approaches for providing occupational information and orientation.

Cognitive category width, defined as the score obtained on the Pettigrew Category Width Scale, was found to be functionally related to certain types of mental tasks, but not to others. Stimulus generalization, either perceptually or through verbal mediation, was not found significantly related to width of categorization. A second study found broad categorizers to be somewhat more field independent in a Rod and Frame Test. There was, however, a significant interaction between sex and category  width, with males who were broad categorizers superior to those who were narrow categorizers, the reverse being true for females. The third area of investigation found highly significant differences between broad and narrow categorizers in the learning of multiattribute paired associates. Conclusions suggest that performance in a simple perception task does not appear to be a significant function of category width per se. Generalizations regarding relationships between category width and field dependence remain inconclusive. (Author/CJ)",

The problem of this study was to determine the influence of specific internal and situational factors on the amount of information demanded prior to making risky decisions. Factors studied were category width, need to achieve, fear of failure, utility of reward and payoff. Measures employed were the Category Width Scale, the Mandler Sarason Test Anxiety Questionnaire, a group form of the TAT, a Preference for Risks test, and the Numerical Ability subtest of the Differential Aptitude Tests. Subjects were 186 male students who were high school juniors. Results indicate that, in general, when there was no reward or incentive, the motives\"fear of failure\" and \"the need to achieve\" were not elicited to differentiate subjects' strategies in decision making. Under conditions in which there are no specific goals, subjects do seem to employ a consistent cognitive strategy in the amount of information needed prior to decision making. This was seen as unrelated to intelligence. A logical followup of this study would be an examination of differences in information demand when individuals are given feedback. (Author/CJ)",

In an experimental test, 100 subjects were assigned randomly to four conditions, where they received either postive or negative evaluations from an evaluator possessing either higher or lower status than they.

The results show that cumulative achievement is significantly higher for residence hall students compared to randomly assigned nonresidence hall students. The potential of tutors is emphasized only when dealing with average ability students. The percentage of withdrawing or transferring freshmen did not differ significantly between the experimental and the control group. Study habit changes suggest that freshmen feel less confident in personal life and more  conscious of academic difficulties. In general the results indicate that homogeneous housing and tutoring is one way to positively influence achievement and that the freshmen year affects a student's attitude about his academic skills and study habits, but this does not seem related to living environment.

Predicted were that greater amounts of verbal and behavioral aggression would be shown by: (1) emotionally disturbed subjects in special education classes than for normal subjects; (2) subjects under conditions of frustration than for subjects in non-frustration conditions; and (3) subjects with measured low self concept than for subjects with high measured self concept. Subjects were 32 emotionally disturbed and 32 normal male children, ages nine or ten. Results show that: (1) a) verbal aggression depends upon an individual's adjustment status, b) direct behavioral expression of aggression is unrelated to an individual's  adjustment status; (2) a) verbal aggression shows an inverse association with the experimental treatment conditions, b) differences with respect to behavioral aggression are unrelated to treatment conditions; (3) there is no significant difference in verbal or behavioral aggression for high or low self concept children following frustration; (4) no significant interactions occur on the adjustment status, frustration and self concept level; and (5) children manifesting one type of aggressive response tend not to use the other.

The need for computers is a result of increasing complexity which is defined as: (1) an exponential increase of information; (2) an exponential increase in dissemination capabilities; and (3) an accelerating curve of change. Listed are five functions of the computer in guidance: (1) data gathering; (2) storage; (3) manipulation; (4) retrieval; and (5) dissemination. Computer technology and information is extremely useful for good decision making. Computer based counseling gives equal treatment to all students and eliminates the student's need for role playing (usually necessary when interacting with people of importance, such as counselors). However, the system does not fulfill all the  student's needs and institutional guidance will remain. Therefore, the document implies that new skills will be required of the guidance specialist which in turn necessitates changes in counselor training programs. (MC/Author)",

Plans one and two both equalize the educational services of all districts in a State at some level. Under plan one the State provides all funds for educational services. Under plan two the State adds to funds raised locally up to the point of equalization. Plan three calls for States to provide matching grants to locally raised revenue.

These differentials result in lower per-pupil funds for urban and rural districts even though these districts are taxing to the maximum allowable. Defendants admit inequalities, but assert that courts have neither the powers nor the skills needed to equalize education. To date, no court has found these financing inequalities to be unconstitutional. (JF)",

In modern fiscal arrangements, States and localities extract resources from their citizens in some combination of sales, income, or wealth taxes. Any tax reform juggles the relative contribution of each source, but the total amount extracted is still the same. For those who wish tax reform, the issue is not the system of taxation, but the system of tax allocation. For example, this society must decide how much education is desirable relative to needs for roads or armies. Education should provide a foundation for political literacy. Because education invests in human capital, it should be pushed to the point at which investment in people yields the same return as investment in things.  (RA)",

However, Federal funds are encumbered by a plethora of restrictions, riders, rebates, and redundancies, and as it now exists, Federal aid bypasses what is perhaps the most important element in education -- the classroom teacher. The NEA supports Federal legislation, such as the General Federal Assistance Act, that would provide general aid to States. This bill distributes to the States $100 per school child, half of which sum must be allocated to increasing teacher salaries. Such a plan preserves local control in education and puts Federal aid where it is needed most -- in the general operating budget. (RA)",

This crisis exists because cities cannot support educational services with available tax resources, because urban educational costs are higher than those in the suburbs, and because cities function in more restrictive and less rewarding legal frameworks than do suburban and rural areas. In addition, cities provide other services -- sanitation, welfare, and public housing -- and have greater and more diverse financial commitments than do suburban communities. Early in this century, education-aid formulas were designed to compensate for existing disparities between wealthy cities and poorer outlying areas. Now, however, the  relative fiscal positions are reversed, although the same formulas apply. Tables present comparative data on 37 metropolitan areas and their suburbs. (RA)",

The model asserts that a curriculum project functions mainly to transform an initially vague, unsystematic, but strongly held vision of the educationally desirable into a concrete educational program. This transformation is accomplished first by attaining agreement on a platform -- a body of shared beliefs about curriculum. Then, using this platform, the project staff develops a plan of work, the completion of which requires discussion, debate, argument, or deliberation on  crucial issues, and finally, the production of curriculum materials.

The discussion specifies objectives behaviorally, quantifies variables in the decision-making process, and  determines the appropriate units of measure for certain qualitative variables.

An effort is made to affect a logical reapprochement of Ardrey's territorial thesis with specific organizational conflict theories such as those of Argyris, Corwin, and Gross, suggesting possible linkage between territoriality and some established organizational concepts including authority, power, role conflict, zone of acceptance, span of control, hierarchy, chain of command, and boundary maintenance.

This report describes a research project studying the relationship between work values and college majors, after a brief review of the literature. During the academic year 1969-70, a random sample of 180 males representing Holland's 6 categories of vocational choice (realistic, intellectual, social, conventional, enterprising, and artistic) were administered the Work Values Inventory. The 6 groups varied significantly on 9 of the eighteen values: social welfare,  freedom in work, satisfactory supervision, creativity, variety, material esteem, status, family esteem, and religious esteem. The results of the study seem to indicate that vocational counseling should take these differences into account. (AF)",

It suggests that many of the instructional systems within the university structure may be legitimately characterized as closed systems; that one trait of such systems is their limited use of external and internal feedback messages; that educational evaluation, whether formative or summative, must be characterized by the developer as part of a process that will lead to change; and that the initiation of this process occurs with the development of the client-problem statement. A heuristic model designed to assist the course developer who is employing an evaluative  process within a closed, instructional system is then outlined to facilitate with this set of verbal generalizations the formation of the substantive problem statement.

This is followed by a definition of the aims of the reforms and a brief outline of the history of the reform process. Part II, The Specific Problems of Innovation, discusses the past, present, and future positions of the following problems: coping with increased numbers, equality of opportunity, content and structure of studies, specialization of the institutions,  organizational structures, institutional autonomy, recruitment and status of teachers, teaching and research, organization and methods of teaching, teacher-student relations, role and status of students, higher education and the outside world, evaluation and planning, and cost and financing.

        "description":"Despite the faith felt in 1965 in the power of educational research to effect immediate educational improvement, no sweeping reforms have resulted from research and development activities to date. This is partly due to lack of funds and to the fact that Schools of Education have emphasized their roles as socializers and distributors of credentials rather than as catalysts for change. Though educational research is carried out successfully by agencies other than universities, the latter, because of their contact with almost every aspect of society and their unequalled pool of scholarship and expertise, should remain at the heart of educational research and development. This paper is concerned with how the university can best fulfill its research function and discusses first, the  importance of basic research; second, the characteristics and needs of mission-oriented research, which include an overall plan and commitment, team approaches to problemsolving, attention not only to actual problems but also to models and theories on the one hand and practical field testing on the other; and third, mission-oriented research in education and the need for cooperation and planning.

Yet, if the University is to remain a center of learning and free inquiry, it will be easier to preserve this function with the support of a dedicated board of lay trustees. One responsibility a Baord serves is as an interpreter of the University, to defend the academy to the alumni and public, and to convey public sentiment to the academy. It also has the responsibility to anticipate grievances regarding broad policies and to act upon those to prevent disruptive action, to review and pass upon basic policies, and to assure that the necessary research has been done, and consultations made before decisions are reached. A Board  of Trustees makes a mistake if it enters into administrative detail, instead of dealing with broad policy questions; if it interferes with the curriuculum, or personnel problems; if it thinks that it stands in loco parentis; if it is a house divided; if a member makes extreme statements to please a part of the public; if it allows leading politicians to be ex officio members; or if it thinks that the university can be operated like any other business. Since many of these abuses do occur, reforms for the future are essential. (AF)",

The attainment of this culture and civilization is a demanding and painful process. We live in a time of curious anti-intellectualism in which knowledge is being distorted and where these distortions are spread by the means of communication. The quality of education is neglected at all levels, and this situation has been aggravated by lumping all the levels together when the problems are different. An interlocking among the levels is desirable, but not at the cost of obscuring the qualities and values of each level or of concealing the fact that fewer institutions and persons can qualify at the later  levels if excellence is to carry any meaning. Our present system of higher education is top-heavy and maldistributed, often the result of previous support from the federal government, which has been eager to provide funds for immediately felt needs and fads, but not for the maintenance of quality.

The ratings of graduate programs are based upon responses to questionnaires distributed to faculty members: respondents were asked to give their opinion on graduate faculty quality using the classifications: Distinguished, Strong, Good, Adequate, Marginal, and not sufficient for doctoral training. The respondent was instructed not to rate more than 5 departments as Distinguished. This paper examines: (1) the differences between the 1964 and 1969 surveys; (2) the changes in evaluations of departments at the University of Chicago; (3) the number of top-ranked departments in 1964 and 1969; and (4) the changes in rankings between 1964 and  1969. Comparisons are also made based on the departments ranked in the top 10 and the top 15. On the basis of this survey, Berkeley and Harvard were first, followed by Yale, Chicago, Stanford, and Princeton.

        "description":"There are many barriers to equal access in higher education: finances, selective admissions policies, race, and geography. Though some intensive efforts have been made to recruit minority students, the situation is not much better now than it was 20 years ago. The American higher education system has grown rapidly, but the demands on education have increased even faster. Most institutions have become more selective, and this has produced sharp stratification between levels. Much of the increase in minority group enrollment is accounted for in community colleges, the minority share among freshmen being much higher than among upper classmen. The future of governmental support for minority student programs is in doubt, and there is some uncertainty whether recent trends really  reflect net enrollment change or simply describe the reallocation of a static student population, i.e. more blacks in previously all-white schools and more whites in previously all-black schools. Geography is becoming a barrier with private, prestigious institutions seeking national distribution of student populations, and the public schools limiting out-of-state enrollment. Financial considerations may force the private institutions to accept the in-state student with a state scholarship over the out-of-state student who needs financial support from the college. Legal considerations may force the public institutions to eliminate the quotas on out-of-state students. (AF)",

Three groups, or attitudinal types: radicalized students, tolerant, but somewhat conservative adults, and intolerant adults, emerged factor-analytically through a Q technique analysis of 228 respondents. Their sentiments were segmented into 3 groupings: (1) those supporting students, (2) those intolerantly opposing them, and (3) those who were tolerant, but nonsupporting. This study considered the characteristics of these groups and their relation to one another. The second study is an intensive analysis  of the perceptual worlds of 6 radical and 6 moderate Kent State students, in which images of figures in their personal and political worlds were examined factor-analytically for evidence bearing on the ways in which students related to the Kent State situation.

Public support for higher education is decreasing at a time when the cry for universal higher education has been taken up by the public and university community alike. One of the major causes for this widening rift is that for too long some basic premises of higher education have remained unexamined. These include the premise: (1) that voluntary accreditation is necessary and that it should be controlled by the institutions being accredited; (2) that this country needs a dual-track system of higher education; (3) that the university has no accountability to the public as to its efficiency and effectiveness; and (4) that there are certain  educational verities such as the value of liberal arts, boundless academic freedom, and ever increasing needs for more space and more buildings.

One thousand seniors were randomly selected from among the public school system in Region III. They completed a questionnaire detailing their qualification for college admission and preference for college characteristics. This information was matched with a computerized college data bank and 10 schools most closely approximating the student's interest and abilities were identified. In addition, each cooperating counselor completed a questionnaire that presented information on the counselor's \"level of satisfaction\" with each student's college selections as determined by the computer. The study also developed comparative statistics about the preferences and  trends of the sample.

Chapter 1 defines the terms used and presents a preliminary sketch of the argument. Chapter 2 focuses on the effects of socioeconomic background on an individual's college career. Chapter 3 discusses the effects of federal aid on social mobility and college attendance. Chapter 4 examines historical trends in educational attainment and opportunity and compares these to historical trends in social mobility and equality in the societal structure. Chapter 5 examines whether the gap is closing between white and black levels of income, occupation, and education, with special reference  to higher education. Chapter 6 examines the relationship between education and income and concludes that expansion of federal aid to higher education is likely to help reduce racial inequality but probably not class inequality. Chapter 7 discusses the effect of student aid on black educational attainment.

Knowledge of hydraulics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, law enforcement, and business education is as important to the modern fire fighter as is knowledge of the ropes and ladders. The number of 2-year colleges offering programs in fire service has increased 50 per cent in the past five years. The 2-year college can offer occupational and technical education, semi-professional training, and personal counseling. Such programs attract in-service fire fighter students, attending mostly evening courses, as  well as people from such fire-related fields as oil and chemical corporations and insurance companies. There are suggested curriculum patterns for Fire Science Associate Degree and Fire Science Certification programs. The International Fire Administration Institute provides assistance to the nation's fire departments and to the colleges. Other similar organizations are listed.

Currently approximately 250 2-year colleges offer programs inlaw enforcement, police science, or police administration education. The President's Crime Commission reports that present training programs of local law agencies are incapable of meeting the minimum training needed for long-range programs, and therefore recommends an increased affiliation with 2-year colleges. The junior college's local autonomy is acceptable and considered advantageous to local law agency requirements and philosophy. The American Association of Junior College guidelines on law enforcement education emphasize recruitment and in-service occupational and  technical courses as well as courses in the sociological composition and psychological needs of the community. Program needs depend on national and regional needs, the changing patterns of control, and incentives for professional development. The impact of program training can be seen in the development of the police officer's image, career development, and financial incentives.

MAC is housed in a modified mobile home, 28 feet long and eight feet wide, containing four counseling cubicles, lounge, small library, and bath. The author discusses the background, implementation, findings, and future of the program. MAC's effectiveness is directly proportional to: (1) geographical area covered by: MAC; (2) amount of time MAC is in a given area; (3) number and quality of personnel working on MAC; (4) frequency of visits to each designated target community; and (5) extent of dissemination to the residents of information that  could come only from a program like MAC. MAC diminishes dependency on chance and word-of-mouth communication and brings the college catalog to the community. Counseling is available to those who otherwise would not have the opportunity to discuss educational and vocational goals. MAC provides an important paraprofessional career service to those who man it. Several recommendations were made: (1) MAC and its funding should be continued and expanded into other service areas; (2) program details should be reviewed; (3) MAC should be integrated into other campus activities; and (4) it should communicate with similar out-reach agencies.

CALCOP provided simulated case problems for cadets that reinforced learning, broadened perspectives, and provided a mock field experience.

Beginning as small liberal arts colleges, the 2-year colleges were limited in growth until 1961, when the concept of &quot;comprehensive curricula&quot; was officially recognized through state legislation. In 1963, 2-year college funds and accounting were separated from the public school system and, by 1967, the state legislature created an independent system of community colleges. Today, responsibility for community college education in the 22 separate districts can be found at two different levels. Statewide concerns such as the establishment, location, finance, and central administrative practices of the junior colleges are handled by the  state board. A local board of trustees is responsible for operating the colleges in its district, and has authority to determine curriculum, award degrees, and establish administrative rules and regulations. Organizational structures at both state and district levels recognize the need for flexibility in responding to local problems, and coordination is achieved through a system of advisory committees made up of district and state personnel. The general goals and specific operating objectives of the system emphasize open-door admissions, school and community cooperation, and the involvement of all concerned groups in formulating the policies that will affect them.

Most of those attending are transfer-oriented; three out of ten enroll in occupational programs. Examples of the progress toward major system goals (outlined in volume 1) follow. Nearly 90 per cent of the state's population is now within one-half hour's commuting time of a community college program. To make the opportunities offered by the colleges known to the community, innovations such as mobile counseling centers have been  initiated. The year 1969 saw responsibility for adult education transferred from local school districts to the 2-year college districts. Institutional research and instructional improvement are receiving more attention in the budget, while closer relationships with the community have resulted from increased use of local expertise in the development, design, and conduct of present and future programs. Along with increasing emphasis on individually-paced instruction and continuous enrollment, a systems approach to instruction has been adopted.

Anyone 18 years of age or older is considered a potential consumer of the programs. Because the percentage of the population falling into this category is steadily increasing, and more of them are availing themselves of community college programs, a comprehensive, up-to-date system must be maintained to meet the demand. It is anticipated that growth in state community college enrollment will more than double from 52,700 FTE's in 1969 to 117,300 by 1980. While the college districts have been able to hold down overall costs through serving more students with equivalent resources and deferring  some construction expenditures, increases in operating funds will be required to sustain and improve the current level of service. The increasing demand for educational services makes necessary additional instructional and support facilities, whether on campus or in the community. Minimum guidelines for capital construction, developed by the state board, are based on a combination of utilization rates for instructional space and of space per station.

Topics for negotiation at Massasoit Community College were: association and faculty members' rights, rights of the board, professional behavior, deduction of professional dues, conditions of employment, faculty benefits, faculty participation in the selection process, grievance procedures, and contracts, evaluation, and  non-reappointment. The implications of the contract are that: system-wide negotiations may occur; new bargaining units will develop as new communities of interest become apparent; in the immediate future, the board may use the association to pressure the legislature to speed up growth of the community college system; the contract as a faculty protective device seems to limit improving education; the board may be forced to negotiate on matters of wages; to have to voice in affairs, students may have to organize and negotiate; and there will be future interactions between the association and the board to redefine roles.

        "description":"This report describes several action programs to illustrate innovative procedures that show promise of increasing the enrollment of black students and providing programs of such distinct value as to keep them in school. An effective program of recruitment requires cooperation between admissions and counseling personnel of the college and high schools. Recruiting will be more effective when representatives of the college visit the high schools and black high school students visit the colleges. Recruitment should reach into the community through public schools as well as other channels. Effective recuiting requires community-wide moral and financial support. Special services should be made available to black students between the time of application and actual entrance into  classwork. The admission of culturally disadvataged students calls for adaptations in curricular offerings to meet student needs. An increase in the number of black students in a junior college should be accompanied by a study of career opportunities and manpower needs and by the addition of new instructional programs to prepare students for these opportunities. The junior college drop-out rate may be reduced by expansion and innovations in the area of special student counseling services. Action by the state of Florida is cited as an example of statewide planning that may improve higher educational opportunities for blacks. (Author/CA)",

A descriptive method was used in the study of existing procedures in similar organizations and the procedures were cross-compared with those used in the L.A. Community College District. Interviews were conducted with a representative sample of college placement officers who supply L.A. certificated personnel. It was found that methods used by modern organizations in recruitment of qualified personnel applicants can be applied in the community college area. Other findings and the resulting conclusions and recommendations are presented in this report. A general recommendation is for a  board of trustees to make an official policy statement on the recruitment and selection of certified personnel and for this statement to include the philosophy of the merit system and the principles of hiring the most qualified available instructor regardless of national origin, race, religion, sex, color, or creed. This report includes the following three documents: &quot;A proposed selection procedure for junior college instructors;&quot;&quot;Staff study: Teacher recruitment policy and practice;&quot; and &quot;Third year survey results/An analysis of the characteristics of new full-time faculty in California Community Colleges.&quot; [Because of marginal reproducibility of original, this document is not avilable in hard copy.] (CA)",

The first section of the report presents the presidents' attitudes, illustrated in part by their own statements. The second section presents a selected number of presidents' formal responses to the black students' demands. A formal response pattern evolved in which replies followed the same format as the demands that were presented. The relative success of black activists is due to: (1) the administrators' fear of violence; (2) the possibility that violence might lead to race riots; and (3) the willingness of black students to resort to violence to obtain concessions. Most of the black junior college presidents who have  been appointed in the last five years might be considered the beneficiaries of activism. While they have as little control as white presidents over the major social forces contributing to the unrest among blacks, they can bring to the college a greater sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of black students.

Sixty-four (79 per cent) of the colleges that enroll foreign students levy a tuition charge; 49 of these colleges charge foreign students out-of-state fee tuitions.

Based on the results of a differential value profile, 47 students were placed in 11 discussion groups to discuss one of the following six value topics: aesthetic, material, power, intellectual, humanitarian, and religious. The members of each group had a similar hierarchy of values. In phase one, five groups chose topics corresponding to their value hierarchy. The aesthetics were the only value groups not to choose a corresponding topic. Only three of the groups chose  discussion leaders whose value hierarchy was the highest for the group. In phase two, the groups were reorganized with a \"plant\" in each group. Nine of the groups chose the \"plant\" as discussion leader. The study thus indicates that (1) personal value structures become a factor in student behavior only when aligned with an issue and when value conflicts arise between individuals and the issue; and (2) when an opposing issue is presented to a group, the person whose value hierarchy was congruent to the issue is perceived by the group as best able to cope with the issue. It is recommended that counselors working with students experiencing value conflicts try to identify the underlying issues. (CA)",

No values are associated with internality or externality. Approximately 800 students, grouped by sex and race, were tested in spring 1971. White male, academically successful, high educational aspirants were found to be more internal on personal control than were academically unsuccessful, low aspirants. Among black males, those high aspirants to non-traditional occupations were more external on the individual-system blame dimension than were low aspirants. Most analyses reveal no contrasts on I-E tests  within separate sex-by-race groups. The conclusion shows that I-E offers little help in explaining differences between urban community college students when levels of aspiration and academic success are defined by absolute criteria.

The number of faculty, courses, and degrees in various fields were classified into six types--Realistic, Intellectual, Social, Conventional, Artistic, and Enterprising--based on Holland's theory of vocational choice. The resulting profiles were analyzed in terms of three components: elevation, scatter, and shape. The faculty and curriculum profile are closely tied to psychological theory, are independent of student characteristics, appear to reveal differences among colleges in relative emphasis on subject matter areas, and are meaningfully related to other measures of the college environment. Therefore, such profiles appear promising for the study of 2-year college environments, and  provide a common framework for studying 2-year and 4-year colleges. (Author/CA)",

Three of the five concepts tested--Community Involvement in Planning Library Programs, The Urban Poor, and Library Institutes as Educational Devices, underwent statistically significant changes as a result of the five-day institute. Comparing the post-test scores of participants and the control group reveals that participants' opinions of four of the five issues moved in the opposite direction from the  views of their colleagues. A discussion of two competing theories of why attitudes change in institute settings--interpersonal context versus ideational content follows, with hypotheses for testing their relative influence.

        "description":"Two questionnaires were sent to individual and institutional subscribers to the American Psychological Association's Experimental Publication System (EPS) to investigate types of manuscripts and lengths of information units needed to support different job-related tasks. Basic findings from the questionnaire sent to individuals were that review or summary articles were most frequently judged useful, while theoretical articles were judged least useful. Also, almost all of the respondents selected abstracts or short versions to support their job-related tasks, but very few selected citations or complete text. With regard to the relationship between types of articles selected and work settings, those involved in basic research or training and education indicated the need for a  greater range of types of articles than did those involved in applied research or management. Findings from the questionnaire sent to institutions were that descriptors used by academic institutions to characterize their subject matter requirements were more abstract and more discipline- and content-oriented, while those used by non-academic organizations were less abstract and more problem- and specialty-oriented. These findings have implications for designing EPS to better meet individual and institutional information needs. (Author)",

Two other papers dealt with the library's regular users, the suburban housewife and the high school student, but treated them in a different context thereby raising fundamentally different questions about library services to them. The final paper considers the radical right in relation to what  is known about the psychology of the authoritarian personality and demonstrates why a public library responsive to the needs and ideals of a democratic society will inevitably attract the censure of the radical right.

On November 14th this report was submitted to the Institute's House of Society Representatives which unanimously adopted a resolution accepting and endorsing the principles and recommendations of the Concept. The Concept is a philosophical statement of the Committee's concern with information transfer in the geosciences; as such, it does not contain a  discussion of specific operations or assignments of responsibility for implementation in any area. However, it should serve as a basis for more detailed planning and for development of a comprehensive geoscience information system.

The twenty-six communities surveyed represent four categories: (1) those over 10,000 population, (2) those between 2,500 and 10,000 population, (3) those under 2,500 population, and (4) those served by bookmobile. Two scales were generated: an attitude scale and a readership scale. Librarians in each community surveyed were  sent a brief questionnaire so that the respondents' replies could be compared to those of the librarians. Appendix B contains a sample of each questionnaire used. The tables and materials presented orally on August 6 were the highlights from the data generated in the survey and are included in this report in expanded form.

Problems of change and growth encompass: (1) changes in information flow and availability, (2) personnel growth, (3) applications, (4) cost, and (5) new employees.

The model permits the computation of unit costs for component subsystems of circulation systems. Cost data is summarized and reviewed, and the cost reporting form is included for use by other libraries. A bibliography of 304 references surveyed for cost data is included. (AB)",

However, it was immediately apparent that the basic problem was less one of overlapping function between these two &quot;co-ordinate&quot; agencies then one of coordination and direction of the State Library's historical-archival activities and functions. Intimately involved in the problem of coordinating historical activities is the privately supported Indiana Historical Society whose programs, in some measure, parallal and overlap activities of the State Library and the Historical Bureau. While this study focuses most directly on the  State Library's historical and archival activities, it deals with the programs of the Historical Bureau and the Indiana Historical Society as they affect the welfare of a well-coordinated and broadly-based historical agency program in Indiana. The study states its sources of information, gathered by personal interviews and explains the organization and status of archival and historical programs in Indiana. A summary of findings and recommendations are included. (Other reports in this series are available as ED 044 131 through 044 145.) (Author/SG)",

The Hampshire Interlibrary Center (HILC) is a jointly owned library of research material, supplementing the resources of the individual participants. Each participant pays an equal share of the operating budget. HILC owns its collections, which are loaned to the participants. The operation, facilities, costs, and services of each of these libraries are explored in order to determine which features might be suitable for British Columbia where, within a  decade, the three university libraries will have grown beyond the capacity of present and projected library buildings.

During the interpolated interval, repeated presentations of another, different stimulus were shown to subjects in the Retroactive Inhibition Condition, while those in the Control Condition were given auditory stimulation. Analyses of visual fixation scores indicated that habituation occurred to the standard stimulus and that response within conditions to this stimulus in the test phase was in directions predicted by the interference theory of forgetting. Visual responses of subjects  in the Retroactive Inhibition Condition appeared to have been dishabituated by presentations of a stimulus during the retention interval, whereas those of subjects in the Control Condition evidenced continued habituation to the standard.

The Education Development Center Follow Through Program, inspired by an 8-year association with the revolution in English primary schools, formulated these objectives: (1) to help schools create classroom environments responsive to the individual needs of children as well as to the talents and styles of the teachers; and (2) to develop the advisory concept to facilitate growth and change in schools. The key elements of this approach are the open classroom; the teacher as researcher-experimenter rather than authority figure; and the advisory service. Advisors are experienced educators who work in unthreatening ways with schools and teachers  to help them realize their potentials and to make change self-sustaining. The three major functions of the advisory are to support research and development; to maintain a workshop and resource center; and to facilitate communications between classrooms and teachers. In 1969-70, twelve EDC advisors served nine school districts in eight widely-scattered states. Plans are being formulated to establish local advisory groups in school districts. (AJ)",

Recent research contributes some information applicable to the analysis of teacher-child relations and identifies issues for further study. Teacher functions or duties may depend, in part, upon the teacher's background and the demands of her program. Although four types of functions are defined (maternal, therapeutic, facilitator, instructional), no research has yet been done to investigate teachers' time distribution among these role functions. While the characteristics of teachers can be examined in two broad classes, attributes and behaviors, the research is difficult to synthesize and summarize. However, it provides indications that  teachers may need help in developing skills to extend the information processing abilities of pupils and to build more constructive classroom climates. These skills need to be clearly identified. Research involving larger sample sizes is needed to support studies assessing the predictability of teacher behavior from the specifications of curriculum models. Few studies deal with the effects of teachers on children. Welcome additions to the existing body of concepts are expected from the Planned Variation Experiment with Head Start curriculum.

        "description":"Most compensatory early childhood programs are based on an assumption of linguistic and cognitive deficits which must be remedied if the Negro child is to succeed in school, but much collected data questions this assumption. The language of many lower class Negro children has been shown to be well-ordered and highly structured, although the dialect differs from standard English. A body of literature has appeared which terms the Negro mother inadequate, but newer insight, illustrated by the work of Virginia Heyer Young, recognizes that the Negro has a culture and life style which is meaningful and well-defined. Culture and race are too often used interchangeably, and early intervention programs have been created which are ethnocentric and lack cross-cultural perspective.  Suggestions are given for ways in which the school needs to be restructured to take advantage of these observed cultural differences, particularly in regard to language and reading. Intervention is seen as necessary, but it should assume a culture conflict, rather than a culture deficit, viewpoint. (NH)",

Home interviews gathered information on family characteristics and physical accommodations. Children's achievement data was obtained by achievement tests and teacher ratings. It was hypothesized that achievement would vary directly with better quality of housing and provision of suitable study space, and that it would vary inversely with measures of crowding and noise. Two-way analysis of variance tables were computed, with physical and social factors (sharing of homework room, housing type, amount of noise, etc.) as independent variables, and achievement data as dependent variables. The hypothesis proved true, with the  exception of one physical variable, overcrowding of persons per room of the dwelling unit. Conclusions are tentative due to certain limitations of the study. It may be that, within reasonable limits, it is not the number of people who occupy a dwelling that influences study and retention, but rather the way the available space is divided and used. (NH)",

It presents the statistical analysis and design of an investigation conducted in ten classrooms in two sites (Henderson, North Carolina and Vero Beach, Florida). The core of the programs was the Buchanan Readiness in Language Arts program with four combinations of supplements. A monitored and an unmonitored control group were used in each site. It was hypothesized that the experimental classes would outrank the controls in a predetermined order. Although significant differences were found on several subtest measures, the data did not support the hypothesis.

It was hypothesized that: (a) the ability to classify increases with age (b) CD children would score lower on talks of classification than children in MC groups (c) the range of differences between the two special groups would be greater for the second grade than for the kindergarten children (d) there is a difference in the justification scores favoring the advantaged over the deprived groups. Eighty subjects, in four groups of twenty each, participated. Four classification tasks of Piaget were used (Changing Criteria, Classification, Class Inclusion, and Matrices). Subjects were individually  interviewed, asked the same questions and presented the four tasks in sequence. Findings supported the hypothesis that the ability to classify increases with age. They also pointed to a significant difference between the performance and the justification scores of the two social groups. Findings from this study indicated an almost parallel development between the two grade levels of the two social classes. It might be profitable to repeat this study with a wider range of age levels and with a larger sample to ascertain the presence or absence of social class differences in classificatory performance.

Active dialogue between parents, teachers and the Boston University Head Start Evaluation and Research Center (BUER) was considered a primary purpose and encouraged by BUER training, research and service activities. An ethical code evolved which committed university researchers to a non-traditional research program, open to community involvement and criticism. The need for institutional change was perceived as more critical than any particular curricular content, and the program was closely involved with community problems. Program components discussed are: parent involvement in decision making; inservice training; observation and feedback; diagnostic and follow-up  work; and development of a new research tool, the Classroom Behavior Form. The complex nature of evaluation is discussed, and the use of I.Q. gains to measure the success of intervention programs is questioned. Political, social, and economic goals of Head Start programs are cited as more important to the needs of the people served than the education per se of young children. Head Start evaluation studies should, therefore, include evaluation of these goals. (NH)",

        "description":"A Piagetian preschool emphasizes the child's active construction of mental images rather than passive association of words and pictures with real objects. The role of the teacher is neither to dictate good behavior nor to transmit ready-made predigested knowledge. Her role is to help the child to control his own behavior and to find things out as a result of his own curiosity and exploration. The child builds knowledge through his own actions on objects, using object feedback and his own reasoning processes. To accomplish this task, the teacher selects a variety of objects to give a range of possible activities from which the child can choose. The teacher diagnostically picks up on the child's interests by making suggestions and asking questions. Piaget's distinction among  physical, social, and logico-mathematical knowledge and representation guides the teacher in deciding when to answer a child's specific questions and when to leave the question open for the child to find the answer. The basic principle to keep in mind is that play is the most powerful ally on the teacher's side. A curriculum which reflects an understanding of the nature of intelligence from Piaget's biological perspective will define its long-term goals first and then proceed to conceptualize its short-term goals.

Five groups of 3- and 4-year-olds participated in the program or served as controls. The project served as a source of data for research on different types of preschool intervention and as a center for dissemination of information to teachers, administrators, and researchers in education. The curricula included: (1) a cognitively oreiented curriculum based primarily on Piaget's principles of cognitive development, the principles of sociodramatic play and impulse control suggested by Smilansky, and some specially developed language techniques; (2) a  language training curriculum emphasizing learning of academic skills including arithmetic and reading; and (3) a unit-based curriculum emphasizing the social-emotional development goals of the traditional nursery school programs. The preschool sessions were supplemented with home visits. The results for the first two years of operation (1967-69) demonstrated that children may profit from any structured curriculum which offers a wide range of experience and individual student attention.

The rocking device was a cradle that could be manipulated to produce side-to-side rocking similar to a commercial cradle or up-and-down rocking. In its up-and-down mode, the cradle was moved through a 4-inch vertical excursion. Each subject received one mode of rocking in one daily session and the other mode on the following day. The subject's activity was independently rated on a 6-point scale every 30 seconds by two observers, and by an Electro-Craft Movement Transducer placed under the mattress of the cradle. Each day the infant received two 5-minute periods of rocking preceded and followed by a 5-minute  observation period. Scores showed that activity during rocking decreased; but with termination of rocking, activity returned to the baseline level following the first rocking period. Activity after the second rocking period did not rise to the initial level. The up-and-down mode was more effective as a soother than the side-to-side mode. Transducer scores were in agreement with observer scores. (Author/AJ)",

Thirteen girls, 13 boys, and eight teachers, in two middle class nursery schools were observed on a rotated time and program area schedule. Verbatim recordings were made of child-teacher-child interactions and coded to permit systematic comparisons of the form, function, and content of the children's questions and the teachers' responses. Results are presented in two parts: (1) methodological problems and (2) patterns of  relationships between acts of instigation, acts of teaching, and child response. Major findings include a delineation of differences by sex in the kinds of questions asked, differences evoked in structured and unstructured situations, different response patterns used by teachers for initial questions rather than reciprocal questions and different response patterns used for answers to typically boy or girl questions. The study suggests that teachers reinforce their position as a prime verbal source of information and that they need to increase their skill in helping children learn how to learn by helping them pose relevant questions in a more orderly sequence.

In the study, home interviews were conducted and children were also examined clinically. The high level of voluntary participation of families reflected great interest in the health status of their children. Limited socioeconomic information was obtained on the participant families but, generally, living conditions were at the poverty or near-poverty level. It is noted that 36 of the children were enrolled in Head Start and received a  portion of their food intake there.

To compare the programs of both institutions, a set of observational categories guided description of activities for 21 classrooms. Statistical evidence indicates that performance of pupils in the  University School program was significantly (.01) higher for all three curricular areas. An analysis of the classroom observations reveals a number of areas of gross difference between the two programs which appear to be related to differences found in pupil performance.

Of the 9,240 children enrolled 49% were Negro and 40% were Spanish-speaking. For program evaluation, questionnaires were completed by pre-kindergarten teachers and paraprofessionals, by kindergarten teachers, and by parents. Sample pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classes were observed and tested, to determine whether children who had attended pre-kindergarten differed from others, and how well the kindergartens  build upon children's earlier learning experiences. Special evaluative instruments, the Pre-Kindergarten Inventory and the Kindergarten Inventory, were developed. The most significant result of the program was the pupils' success in learning basic concepts and fundamental discriminations helpful in later school work. It is recommended that the program be continued and extended to more children in poverty areas. (NH)",

The first time the model won and disposed of prize marbles in one of three ways. The second time the subject won and was free to dispose of or save prize marbles. The subjects' subsequent sharing with the model, sharing with Mental Health or a Toys for Tots charity, or their refusal to share was observed through a one-way mirror in the test van. Subjects also responded to a questionnaire designed to assess the salience of a norm of  altruism. Both specific and generalized imitation of altruism were found and salience of sharing appeared to be strongly related to actual sharing and weakly related to experimental conditions. (Author/WY)",

The Experimental (E) group (N=23) had attended the Syracuse University Children's Center for a minimum of 32 months; a Control (C) group (N=23) with limited or no preschool experience was used for matched control comparisons. The E group scored consistently higher than the C group on the measures used, and an examination of qualitative differences showed the E group to be functioning at  levels which were at, or above, their chronological ages. The emphasis which the Children's Center places on language and cognitive developments can account for these results, and suggests that long term attendance in such a program is desirable.

The general goals for Head Start are summarized and expanded to include objectives unique to this survey. Specifically, the Kirschner project hoped to illuminate the general question of how to achieve changes in local institutions utilizing a nationwide educational innovation as the intervention strategy. Field work in 42 communities representing high, medium, low, and no levels of Head Start activity identified four kinds of changes consistent with Head Start programs and policies. The 1,496 changes, when pinpointed, could be distributed into four categories: (1) increased  decision-making, (2) greater employment, (3) greater educational emphasis, and (4) modification of health services. Although institutional changes took place in a complex social environment, Head Start did seem to have a generally positive influence in modifying local institutions so they became more responsive to the needs and desires of the poor.

A wide variety of health, social, and economic variables were examined in the hope of developing output criteria for the evaluation of poverty programs. The subjects were children entering kindergarten for the first time. Interviews with parents gave medical histories of the children and parental attitudes toward cost of living and income. Examinations given the children included a routine physical, dental examination, vision and hearing screening, and a kindergarten readiness test. Children of poor families more frequently demonstrated dental  disease; skin, tonsil, and ear infections; and poor school performance. Their families were characterized by family disruption, unemployment, frequent changes in residence, and lower level of education and occupation. The families from more affluent socioeconomic groups manifested different attitudes toward education. More than one-half the document consists of tables and graphs. (AJ)",

First, it presents data about aspects of the world into which American children are born, such as population, urbanization, income levels, incidence of disease, divorce and death rates, and pollution levels. It then deals in successive sections with four major stages of child development through age 3: the prenatal period, the first year of life, the preschool years between ages one and six, and the school years. Because the child is treated as an entity, the most important aspects of each age grouping, such as health, education, and family life are presented together in each section. Many three-color  charts and graphs illustrate the text. Illustrations are cross-referenced to an appendix (comprising more than half the book) of detailed tables of the data on which the text and charts are based. It is noted that there are some unavoidable gaps in the statistics with regard to minority groups such as Spanish-Americans, Orientals, and American Indians. Improvements in data collection will, hopefully, make such information available to future Conferences. (Author/NH)",

Some major obstacles to the emergence of healthy identities include a variety of widely held cultural assumptions contrary to present-day evidence concerning the nature of child development. These assumptions, typical behaviors fostered by them, and their identity outcomes are listed in Appendix A. Forum 2 participants recommend (1) the initiation of a \"Sesame Street\" type of TV program for  parents, which would teach child development principles and give practical suggestions for daily child care; and (2) the establishment of child-oriented environmental commissions on national and local levels, which would help plan, inspect, and improve projects which try to meet the needs of children.

(2) An Environmental Planning Commission, composed of persons trained in design and child development, who could help direct city planning to make the city a better place for children to live, to play, and to learn. (3) The Gatekeeper or Second Family, a helping family or person to whom children can turn for help in problem solving when the parent is inappropriate or unavailable.  (4) The Artist-Teacher in the School, a program which would involve community artists in the educational system, making the creative process an integral part of learning. (5) Support for Cross-Age Tutoring Programs, which help both the older and the younger youths involved, in learning and identity formation. The underlying philosophy of the recommendations of this forum is that what is needed is not more available activities, but more genuine ways of being and of relating to other people. (Author/NH)",

To achieve these goals, general recommendations are made concerning family, media, school, religion,  research, and the role of government.

There has been too little acceptance of advanced practices. Federally funded experimental schools must be initiated as alternatives to present learning modes and for the development of exemplar models of philosophy and practice. Learning must become an end in itself, an individual choice, implying an individual definition of success. Modern technology will be implemented for flexible scheduling and progress rates. Acknowledging the growing emphasis on television in the home, the forum suggests each home could house computers and microfilm libraries. \"School\" will focus on human interaction and the ability to know oneself. Teachers  will be engaged in preparing computerized lessons, evaluating programs, and counseling; therefore, funds must be allocated for redesign of teacher education. The achievement of this program means commitment backed by resources and action. The report recommends massive expenditures of federal funds for the development of forward-looking practices and learning options and suggests that the nation's 200th birthday, 1976, be made an occasion for nationwide dialogue about our whole learning situation.

Forum members urgently advocate alternatives to the traditional public school approach. Since the idea that there is \"one best way\" to educate is one of the myths, reform must be fluid enough to accommodate individual student style, attitude, and readiness. This report proposes such reform and includes: (1) a brief analysis of the content of several myths considered; (2) an explanation of the educational consequences of maintaining the status quo based on those false assumptions; (3) a look at the evidence which undermines the myth's validity; and in some cases (4) consideration of possible alternatives. Encouraging a variety of alternative educational models, the forum recommends new  public school systems independent of state and local regulations, open education approaches, open enrollment policies, and cross-age classroom patterns. With parents and teachers joining together, existing regulations and requirements must be suspended to provide sufficient autonomy for experimentation. The report includes an appendix of the myths discussed and an extensive bibliography of references used. (Author/AJ)",

Several population groups in our country are subject to unusual health hazards and have particular need for health care. Poor children, expectant mothers, young infants, handicapped and emotionally disturbed children, and children of migrant workers are the especially vulnerable groups. The social pathology of narcotic addiction, prejudice, understimulation, violence, and indifference to human needs constitutes other pressing problems that threaten the  quality of physical and emotional health in our society. A high priority should be set on the development and delivery of needed services to insure immediate access to decent care for the most vulnerable groups. Other recommendations call for acceptance of national standards for preventive health services, manpower augmentation, research in the health sciences, adequate income, good nutrition, improved housing, and a reinstitutionalization reconstruction of the systems for delivering human services as a national commitment.

        "description":"This report examines the current status of child health services in the United States and identifies priorities for an improved health care program for mothers and children. Its recommendations are designed as guidelines for constructive discussion by participants in the 1970 White House Conference on Children. A major thesis of the report is that the existing child health system in the United States is costly but cumbersome, well-intentioned but deplorably piecemeal, a system which muddles along rather than moving forthrightly ahead. In the 1970's, we shall be responsible for meeting the health needs of an anticipated 100 million young people at various stages of development. The Forum members have concluded that nothing less than a rationally planned and soundly supported  maternal and child health program can be expected to correct current inequities and inadequacies. Specifically recommended are: (1) a federally-financed national child health care program, (2) augmentation of illness prevention and health promotion services, (3) revitalization of certain existing child health program, (4) the establishment of a unified child health unit within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, under a newly created Deputy Assistant Secretary, and (5) ongoing advocacy of child health programs, through a presidential council. Two papers are attached which compare various proposals for national health insurance. (Author/NH)",

First, the traditional definition of injury should be expanded to include psychological, sociological, and environmental factors leading to children's injuries. Second, approaches to preventing and treating injuries cannot be separated from the environments with which children constantly interact. Third, children must be given higher priority, both by government and private enterprise, at all levels throughout the nation. The following recommendations are made: (1) that governmental units closest to the neighborhood select persons to be trained in problem-solving techniques and informed about available resources related to children's injuries; (2) that governments, aided by private and volunteer  organizations, develop programs of training and ongoing consultation for those community workers; (3) that a cabinet level position with major responsibility for children and youth be considered; and (4) that Congress establish a permanent staff to study problems related to children and their environments.

        "description":"Forum 14 advocates the development of flexible policies for variant family forms and legislative programs which are responsive to family needs whether the family is a single parent, nuclear family, or some other form. Human service systems must be built around people; families should not be expected to fit into mass produced formal systems based on the principle of least cost and on the presumed expertise of the professional. A family's main tasks are to develop capacities to socialize children, to enhance the competence of family members to cope with the demands of bureaucratic organizations, to use these organizations and to provide satisfactions and a mentally healthy environment. The forum recommends the initiation of an \"Institute for the Study of the Family\" to conduct  research into family needs and to create marriage and family living institutes at universities to increase the effectiveness of specialists and professionals. The forum further advocates the examination and reordering of current systems and legislation, including a review every five years evaluating HEW on the inter-agency level to insure quality child care.

In regard to these fundamental issues, four challenges to the seventies emerge: (1) achievement of more equitable distribution of family income, (2) helping children and their families understand the full meaning of human sexuality and family planning in their lives, (3) making family planning services available to all Americans by 1974 and (4) stabilization of a population figure for our nation. Before any of the forum recommendations can become a reality, two fundamental  shifts in economic direction must occur (reallocation of national expenditures from military uses and restructuring the distribution of government income from federal to state levels). Only then can federally financed and administered systems of income support, supportive human services, family planning services, and a population stabilization figure be realized. (Author/WY)",

To respond to the changes in our national life style, we must develop a network of supplementary child care facilities readily available to all families with children flexible enough to be part of a family's life, and good enough to promote full development of our nation's children. As a start toward such a system, this forum recommends establishing and allocating the total of financial commitment needed for day care, developing a preventive approach to children's needs and problems, mobilizing  continuing public support for day care, and coordinating operational procedures at federal, state, and local levels.

Children of a minority or poor group are directly affected because they are likely to suffer hunger, poor health and housing, and inadequate schools. White, middle class children are affected in ways which are less obvious, but just as damaging. In trying to resolve the conflict between what institutions preach about the brotherhood of man, and what these same institutions teach by example through violating concepts of love and justice, these children may develop unhealthy and undesirable attitudes and behavior patterns. Minority races and poor people are not the only targets of prejudice. The physically and mentally handicapped, members of minority religions, females, and the  aged suffer as well. Forum 18 views these prejudicial attitudes as a serious threat to our society, whose strength depends upon full opportunity for all.

They need an environment that gives them many kinds of experiences, that provides both privacy and opportunities to form social bonds, and that is enriched by beauty. To provide such an environment for our children, we must also provide it for adults. Unfortunately, our public policies and programs have shaped a world which is inhospitable to both. Policies for land use, transportation, taxation, zoning, and housing have limited opportunities for cooperation among groups segregated by these policies. One of our major national goals should focus on planning and providing for an environment that is good in every sense for the creative growth of both children and adults. We  recommend the establishment of a standing Commission for the Coming Generation. The Commission would take a broad view of national policies and programs--not only those specifically directed toward children--and act as an advocate for the young in all fields. (Author/WY)",

We, as a nation, have failed to emphasize the importance of leisure experiences upon the individual. The prime obstacles have been two prejudicial attitudes: (1) that leisure is intrinsically less worthy than work, and (2) that survival skills are more worthy than those activities enjoyed for their own sake. A variety of leisure options should exist in the home, at school, and in the community. Our country has provided, at best, an uncoordinated patchwork of public, private, commercial, and voluntary programs that may neglect the less affluent child. One basic national goal should be to design a total leisure climate to facilitate growth in  every child. Specific recommendations to accomplish this goal include having the government initiate policies to plan and deliver leisure opportunities for children, making more effective use of mobile and portable units to extend cultural and recreational opportunities into rural and urban environments, having universities develop proper attitudes concerning leisure and leisure proficiencies in their students, and expanding research and development endeavors in the area.

Behavior modification, or operant conditioning, is an example of a technique which has been widely used because, when properly applied in the classroom, it \"works.\" However, the application of a technique should be carefully thought through in terms of the meaning of the behavior in question. For example, three children may exhibit the same disruptive behavior, or phenotype. Yet the geneses, or genotypes, of the behavior may be very different. The child may have learned this behavior through reinforcement at home or at school; the behavior may be an expression of an emotional injury; it may indicate a lack of social skill or knowledge of alternative ways of response; or there may be other causes. For all genotypes,  behavior modification may be successful in changing undesirable behavior, but it does not always address itself to the underlying cause of behavior.

The measure of vicarious conditioning was the children's rate of response to the conditioned stimulus and a controlled stimulus in several operant situations after watching the film. In Experiments 1 and 2, fear responses were vicariously conditioned; after viewing the film, the children rated lower in operant responses to the fear stimulus than to the control stimulus. In Experiments 3 and 4, after viewing a positive film, the children showed a higher rate of operant response to the positive emotional stimulus than to the control stimulus. The experiments show that human operant responses can be  affected by both vicarious fear conditioning and vicarious positive emotional conditioning. In all experiments the conditioning effect was short term and easily neutralized. Further research suggested includes: consideration of the age factor; use of live models rather than films; and reduction of experimenter bias, expectations, and generalization by employment of automated apparatus and maximally different test stimuli.

Maternal attitudes were not related.

        "description":"Heart rate change was used as the index of the orienting response (OR) of 102 kindergarten children. Heart rate change was measured by recording heart rate upon the presentation of tones. 15 similar tones followed by a different, 16th tone, were used. From this data the children were divided into high, medium, or low orientors. Following the &quot;OR&quot; testing session, 96 subjects received two pictorial analogues of verbal discrimination tasks. Subsequently, 65 subjects received a paired-associate (P-A) task. Learning on these tasks, when related to &quot;OR&quot; classification, showed that low &quot;OR&quot; males and medium &quot;OR&quot; females performed best, while medium &quot;OR&quot; males and low &quot;OR&quot; females performed worst. This finding was significant for the P-A task, indicating a relationship between &quot;OR&quot;  classification and learning performance on this particular P-A task. It is difficult to explain the fact that performance was reversed between the sexes. (WD)",

Seven groups of children ages 3-5 were studied. Two groups were exposed to two ten-week successive summer sessions of training prior to entry into kindergarten. Their program emphasized cognitively structured small group experiences with 4-5 children in each group. Group leaders were local Mexican-American high school students working under the supervision of experienced primary teachers. The other five groups were comparison groups; two were from outside the geographical area and three were from the school attendance area of the training groups.  Seven hypotheses were tested through gathering and processing psychometric data from school-related achievement ability tests. Results were compared longitudinally across groups to determine the early advantage of specific cognitive training. All groups were tested at regular intervals and evaluations of in-school performance were made through kindergarten, first and second grades. In general, there were short-term gains but later, few differences existed between the training and comparison groups. An appendix provides samples of the training lessons plus information about project matters. (WY)",

Only patients from 18 sparsely populated eastern Montana counties who had been returned to those counties for at least 30 days of residence were included in the sample. Research definitions and procedures were modified since interviewing was not all first-hand but entailed some &quot;recall&quot; on the part of the patient. A suitable correspondent or the patient himself was available to provide information on each of the 113 people included in the study. The  study revealed such factors as deficits of services in sparsely populated areas, a strikingly imbalanced sex ratio (i.e. many more adult males than females), low educational level, and low income level.

Population samples were extracted on the basis of 1,736 tests administered to individuals, aged 8 through 47 years, residing in Alaska. Specific data treated in the study were from students (aged 9-16 years) in 8 schools representing 4 ethnic groups: Caucasian, Negro, Eskimo (Inupik), and Indian (Athabascan). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) that Alaskan Natives (Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians) possess greater ability than the dominant Caucasian culture to perform tasks associated with perception and visual memory and this greater skill can be measured and interpreted for  application to enhance formal learning of students and (2) that the &quot;Squiggle Test&quot; can be administered successfully in the group or classroom setting for the purpose of rapidly identifying individuals with subtle impairments to learning which may otherwise remain undetected and untreated. Support was obtained for both hypotheses tested. Included in the document are conclusions, recommendations for further research, a copy of the Squiggle Test, and statistical tables. (EJ)",

        "description":"The document describes how outdoor education in the Bloomfield Hills School District of Michigan can be traced to 1957, when elementary school students participated in a resident outdoor school experience for a week. In 1968, a committee on outdoor education was formally organized. The committee developed a rationale and objectives for outdoor education for the Bloomfield Hills schools. The broad objective topics which provide the rationale are: (1) an appreciation of natural resources; (2) improved instruction in science, language, arts, social studies; (3) development of recreational skills in the outdoors; (4) social experience; (5) community service; and (6) aesthetic awareness. In the document, it is noted that the outdoor/conservation education program and facilities are  essential to this community, since the city has no public parks or recreation areas, and the school sites must serve as neighborhood parks. Future plans relate to youth involvement in the development of facilities, the development of a school garden-farm program, and informing patrons of the school district as to program progress. (AN)",

A fact sheet on schools operated by the BIA is also provided. As pointed out in the document, the BIA had direct responsibility for 56,238 Indian children enrolled in Federal schools and housed in  Federal dormitories and had partial financial responsibility for approximately two-thirds of those enrolled in public schools during 1970. Statistics show that there were 185,587 Indian students 5 to 18 years of age enrolled in Federal, private, and mission schools during 1970. (EL)",

The sample comprised 200 rural subjects: 110 students and 90 adults. Two adult groups (the experimental groups) either had received home  construction training or had had their houses improved, while 2 adult control groups were similar in significant characteristics but had not participated in house renovation programs. The 2 groups of students resided in the homes of these adults. Instruments used in the study were Haller's \"Occupational Aspiration Scale,\" Michigan State University's \"Work Beliefs Check-List,\" and 2 scales devised by the investigator.

        "description":"South Dakota is the home of a small religious group known as the Hutterite Brethren. The members of this sect live in small cooperative colonies in the northern United States and in several provinces in Canada. The Hutterites are unique in that, while using modern agricultural technology, they have isolated themselves from the main current of Western civilization. The boundary maintenance of their social system has enabled them to retain many characteristics of their culture developed during the Protestant Reformation. The most distinctive feature of the Hutterite way of life is a pattern of communal living which is practiced in connection with their agricultural enterprises. Since 1950, students and scientists representing specialized disciplines have been adding to the  ever-increasing volume of information on the Hutterite Brethren. A large number of published works contain findings of field studies and surveys on the culture, intergroup relations, social organization, agriculture, and the mental and physical health of the Hutterites. Journalists have made available through their reports in the press a record of events experienced by the Hutterites which provide a running account of the adjustments the Hutterites are making to a rapidly changing world. It is the objective of this 332-item bibliography to bring together these scattered sources of information published since 1875 and to describe each item so the end product will be a useful tool for the acquisition of knowledge.

Data were gathered in 951 personal interviews--which were generally with female heads of households--in a random sample survey in each of 4 communities. Some findings related to use of services were that (1) 9 out of 10 families had used a doctor during the survey year; (2) hospitalization was experienced by one-quarter of the families; and (3) the use of services in  the area did not appear to differ greatly from national figures for populations of similar residential characteristics. Some findings related to use of different types of practitioners are that use of full-time specialists increased with age of family and income level and that use of osteopathic doctors was indistinguishable from use of medical doctors in terms of clientele. Yet, chiropractors did not appear to be used for selected self-diagnosed ailments. In examining the pattern of medical services, most families reported having a family doctor; however, families with and without family doctors did not differ appreciably on socioeconomic indices.

The center, a project of the Department of Education of Central Washington College, is located on an Indian reservation in the Yakima Valley in the central part of the state. The extensive truck farming and fruit crops in the area provide seasonal employment for the migrants, thus making an ideal location for the center. As stated, the purposes of the center are (1) to help assure children of migrant farm workers and American Indians pride in their cultural heritage and (2) to assist in the educational training so vital to the future well-being of these children. Among the components of the center are a media  library, a curriculum development project wherein materials are geared to the cultural and language needs of migrant and Indian children, and a project of teacher and teacher-aide training.

It is noted that the physical geography of the Asian region as a whole and the social conditions which prevail therein make up a panorama of variety and complexity which taxes the imagination and the ingenuity of those who seek to bring the benefits of education to Asian young people. The review analyzes, as far as is possible with the limited data available, the quantitative and qualitative educational attainment in rural areas of the region. Individual articles deal with ungraded lower primary education in India, history of rural education in Japan, education in the rural environment in Laos, sociology of rural education in Laos, educational development in  rural areas of Malaysia, rural education in Nepal, rural education in the Philippines, the 4-H education program in Taiwan, rural teacher training in Thailand, and education in rural areas in the Republic of Viet-Nam. A final article deals with 2 prime factors in striving for quality in rural education in general--teacher training and the primary school curriculum--and discusses the concept of the rural school as a community center.

An ad hoc committee formed by the Canadian Teachers' Federation (CTF) asked the member organizations to undertake observational studies following 1 of 2 main types of designs: (1) an observational study of 2 contrasting schools, 1 serving a poor segment of the population, 1 an affluent segment, with special emphasis on classroom interaction and (2) a shadow study of 2 students, 1 from a poor home, 1 from an affluent home, with emphasis on their school experiences. Eight member organizations of the CTF agreed to participate in the project. Of these, 4 undertook observational studies of contrasting elementary schools, 1 a  shadow study in a junior high school, and 1 a case study of 2 poor families. The 2 remaining studies did not take this form but did record representative conversations with a number of students. The studies included in this volume were done between January and March of 1970. As noted, they provided fresh data on actual schools, teachers, and students in Canada. Studies were undertaken in different parts of the country, in both urban and rural settings, and by observers who differed in background and training. (EL)",

Aims of the Nelson County program were to raise the level of student aspiration for higher education; to provide experiences that students would not normally encounter which would broaden their range of cultural interest and aid them in related academic achievements; and to provide experiences in fine arts for 9th graders, natural science for 10th graders, and critical thinking and independent study in the humanities for 11th graders. The evaluation design included  observers, testing, the Delphi Method utilizing the interdisciplinary team, interviews, and questionnaires. All evaluation techniques contributed positively to the program evaluation with the exception of the testing. It was determined that special tests geared to the specific group of students and their environment should have been developed. Although the stated objectives of Project Opportunity could not be measured in the terms in which they were stated, it was concluded that administrative problems did not outweigh the inspired teaching and active participation of students in new experiences.

Approximately 4,000 interviews, which covered \"adequate samples of people in the schools and communities\" that were studied, were deemed valid as a source of accurate data. The rating scales devised by various field centers to analyze these interviews were used (1) to evaluate a particular school or school system of a particular community, (2) to compare schools and communities singly and in various combinations, and (3) to compare perceptions and attitudes of parents with students, parents with teachers, teachers with students, etc. The document provides an explanation of the components  that make up the rating scales and the results. Reliability of the instruments used and the procedures used to study reliability are also discussed. It is concluded that reliability of the ratings from the various field centers was high enough to allow for comparisons between various schools or communities and between various types of respondents to the interview.

        "description":"The National Study of American Indian Education has documented a broad consensus among parents, students, teachers, and influential persons that the most important role of the schools is to prepare Indian students for employment in the dominant economy and for successful lives in the sociocultural mainstream. With occasional exceptions, curriculum for Indian children in both Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and in public schools parallels the curriculum provided to non-Indian students in the public schools. There is virtually no quarrel with the principle that the curriculum for Indian youth should include the very best curriculum provided non-Indian youth, but several major areas stand out as issues of concern. Among these are the inclusion of tribal culture and history in  school instruction, language instruction, vocational emphasis, and attention to the dignity of Indian identity. Whatever curriculum developments take place in American education, it is unlikely that Indian parents will want anything less for their children than the same curriculum offered to other Americans. The most outstanding difference, however, is that Indian parents would like the schools to give recognition to Indian identity. (JH)",

The increases were typically small, however. Also, a comparison of the study counties with a group of comparable counties which had no new industry added during the study period showed no significant differences between the two groups of counties in terms of changes in local governmental revenue or expenditures due to any secondary effects of new industry in the study counties.

The primary objective of the project is to provide necessary facilities and services to the migrant and his dependents at no charge. An advisory committee, composed of migrants and representatives of the Henderson County Migrant Council, assists the project director. Family medical clinics are held 3 nights each week in a temporary building. Each patient is examined, and necessary drugs are prescribed by the clinician. Field visits by nurses follow clinical examinations. Referrals to hospitals or to private physicians' offices are made in  difficult cases. The health educator works directly under the project director to try new approaches to meet the needs of health education. In the document, along with a textual summary, tables provide statistics (from June 1 through November 15, 1970) on number of migrants served, their conditions or diseases, and the types of services provided.

Eight families with 19 children attending the summer school program formed the population for the research project. Heads of families were interviewed about the social and psychological effects of the food program on the family and home environment. A closed-end questionnaire on demographic information,  development of social skills, and school attitudes was administered using an interview technique to teachers, teacher aides, and the school nurse. &quot;On the basis of tentative analysis, there appears to be a definite correlation and interrelationship between feeding families and the sociological and psychological attitudes that exist within the family home environment, the work performed in harvest fields, and the attitudes of the children attending school.&quot; (JH)",

The guide expresses the belief that the use of the Indianness of the child is the most important part of environmental education for American Indian students. A section on \"The Indian Side of Environmental Education\" expands this concept, and suggested activities are given for implementation. Potential for developing a strong self-image in Indian students is inherent in the program. Relating the contemporary need for people throughout the world to learn to live in harmony with their  surroundings to examples of this balance achieved historically by Indians throughout the Americas is the primary aspect of the program. The program approach calls for involvement of local Indian people in achieving a truly effective educational experience.

Such a perspective implies recognizing diverse theories about educational processes and human development and analyzing them, creating a balance among the cognitive and emotional components of reading. To achieve balance involves first accepting the notion that reading is a tool to be learned and then to be used to widen an individual's range of intellectual pursuit. Teachers who are sincerely interested in their work will teach the tool and, more important, will instill in their students an enjoyment of its use. Research into cognitive aspects of reading should provide insights into how the process works which  will in turn make teaching the tool more precise and teaching the enjoyment more vital.

Categorial grammars were written for comparison with noun-phrase and verb-phrase grammars. A quantitative method for evaluating linguistic grammars, developed from the analyses, provided a theoretical framework for accounting for various kinds of utterances. Chi-square analysis showed the grammars to be well-suited to both series, with the verbal modifier and statements without verbs providing the best fits. The categorial grammars were approximately equivalent to the  phrase-structure grammars, making them possibly more useful for further study since they require fewer manipulations of the text. It was concluded that the method developed would be useful in further analysis of reading materials.

In a linguistic sense, rebuses are symbols which represent entire words or parts of words; whereas, by contrast, letters represent sounds. A rebus may be pictorial, geometric, or even completely abstract. To investigate the hypothesis that pupils learning to read with rebuses would do significantly better than pupils presented the same instructional material in traditional orthography (T.O.), two samples of five preschool nonreaders each were exposed to a learning-to-read situation. The results of the study demonstrated that  learning to read rebuses was markedly easier than learning to read T.O. Furthermore, the differences became even more disparate as the complexity of the vocabulary and sentences increased. The results implied that learning to read derives its problems and difficulties primarily from the abstract nature of T.O. as a symbol system, not from the nature of the reading process itself. It was suggested that rebuses should be more widely used in beginning reading materials to reduce the learning load on the child. Tables and references are included. (Author/DH)",

Too often a teacher's own shortcomings and inadequacies hinder him from being truly effective with his students. In general our educational system is based on negative contingencies rather than positive ones. Ways in which a teacher can be more effective in behavior modification include using positive approaches to the reinforcement of desirable behaviors, employing selective attention as a reinforcement, reinforcing the behavior immediately and consistently at first and infrequently after the habit has been established, avoiding inappropriate punishment, and using the principle of shaping to increase by small increments the incidence or strength of a certain desirable behavior.

        "description":"How linguistic principles can be incorporated into reading instruction was shown by examining the interrelationships of certain linguistics ideas to learning to read. First, the acquisition of oral language was discussed as to the developmental stages: phonological, morphological-lexical, and syntactic. It was suggested that reading instruction should follow the same sequencing: that is, learning letters of the alphabet, blending letters or letter clusters into whole words, and learning syntactical and semantic elements. Second, the relationship of oral language to printed language was illustrated by a graph depicting the various stages, layers, or strands of spoken and printed language. However, it was noted that many elements of speech cannot be replicated in our printed  language. Finally, a graph based on principles advocated by linguists for teaching reading delineated the scope and sequence of decoding reading skills considered to be mechanical in nature. It was noted that the order of skills shown by the second graph parallels the sequence of language layers in the first graph. Tables and references are included. (DH)",

At the end of the first year there appeared to be a rather clear advantage in favor of i.t.a., a trend which continued to the end of the second year but not the third. Third-year results indicated some definite advantages of WIC for boys. There appeared to be definite disadvantages for boys who participated in the Phonetic Keys program. For the girls, none of the four programs was markedly superior. In a replication and extension study done at the first-year level in 1968-69,  Lippincott Basic Reading and Sullivan Programmed method groups were added, and Phonetic Keys was no longer included. The replication found that i.t.a. and Lippincott ranked highest, WIC ranked second, while the remaining methods tended to rank low. A questionnaire of student attitudes found that the children responded with positive feelings about reading, school, and their competency 72 percent of the time.

The introduction of private industry into education as seen in TV offerings such as Sesame Street, in the purchase of book companies by major corporations, and in the performance contracts guaranteeing a level of achievement is of concern to the author, who sees such introductions as threats to programs based on student involvement. His major contention is that teachers who really plan with their students as the object of their programs will involve the students in the program development and will experience gratifying results. Two experiments involving the core curriculum concept in which students  created their own materials and assisted in developing an integrated curriculum plan are described. One of the projects was with Blackfeet Indians in northwestern Montana; the other involved adolescent school dropouts in Boston. The author concludes that unless students are considered as the objectives of reading programs, the future may well be bleak. (MS)",

As a child's attempted solutions approximate more closely the reality of each aspect of the reading process, as he gains in understanding of the nature of the task, he achieves more cognitive clarity. This cognitive clarity is correlated highly with reading success, while its opposite, cognitive confusion, can be regarded as a symptom of reading failure. Pertinent evidence from studies of reading disability and from studies which relate reading achievement to various intellectual abilities are cited in support of the author's theory. He  concludes that understanding of differences between spoken and written forms, knowledge of letter-sound correspondences, and ability to categorize words contribute to cognitive clarity, while auditory and visual discrimination and letter-name knowledge do not. A summary list of findings from studies which explore factors related to the proposed cognitive clarity theory of reading concludes the presentation. References are included. (MS)",

(2) The media to which youth are attuned involve light, color, sound, and movement with a deemphasis on reading. (3) To make reading relevant and necessary for youth, it must be taught as a  means of achieving goals which are concerned with their attitudes and values. (4) The content-area teacher is in the most favorable position for teaching both content and process whereby the material is treated in depth and reading skills are applied immediately in context.

Essentially a learning center consists of designated areas within the classroom where children may go to do a specific activity related to concept development or skill reinforcement. Learning centers are based on four concepts: self-selection, self-motivation, self-pacing, and self-correction. While some children must be directed toward certain needed activities, all students may decide at times when to do required and optional work. Creative and colorful centers and use of manipulative materials greatly aid in motivating the child. With some children working more slowly than others, activities must be left up long enough for everyone to  complete all of the required and much of the optional work. Several steps to take in initiating a learning center are as follows: (1) use interest centers after completion of seatwork activities, (2) expand interest centers to include activities to reinforce skills in subject areas, and (3) introduce a sheet of required and optional activities as a guide to the centers each week. Evaluation is made through checking work folders, teacher-pupil conferences, and class discussions. Sample worksheets, activities, and organizational charts are included. (DH)",

        "description":"National estimates based on the findings from the Health Examination Survey in 1963 to 1965 of uncorrected monocular and binocular visual-acuity levels of children were studied. A nationwide sample of 7,417 children was selected to represent the approximately 24 million noninstitutionalized American children between ages 6 and 11 years. Testing was done with the Master Ortho-Rater, a commercial instrument, on all children who could read letters. Those who could not read were tested using Landolt ring charts. Nearly three-fourths of the subjects were found to have at least \"normal\" (20/20 or better) binocular distance vision. The proportion with defective binocular distance vision showed a remarkably consistent increase with age. At age 6, less than 1 percent tested no better than  20/100, while by age 11, the percentage had increased to nearly 8. Boys were found to have significantly better binocular visual acuity at both distance and near than girls. Binocular vision tended to exceed monocular vision at both distance and near. Finally, closer agreement was found between binocular and better monocular acuity than between the acuities for the two eyes. Tables, figures, and references are given. (Author/DE)",

The papers chosen for this volume discuss (1) the relevance of reading in the face of social and technological revolution, (2) some specific means of meeting the reading needs of society through two kinds of reading programs--paraprofessional instructors (Women's Talent Corps) and industrial reading improvement programs (General Motors), and (3) some possible directions which reading might be expected to take with increasing societal change.  Reactions to several of the papers by those attending the conference are included immediately following the papers, and the volume ends with some concluding remarks which summarize the conference.

The first asks what influence dialect has on acquiring reading ability; the second asks what solutions have been suggested and explored; and the third asks what other solutions might there be which have not been attempted. The author discusses three basic alternatives which have been suggested: (1) to write initial reading materials in dialect, (2) to teach standard spoken dialect before teaching reading, and (3) to use standard materials but to accept nonstandard rendering of these materials. He then recommends as superior  a fourth alternative, the language experience approach. Through such an approach, children would tell stories and the teacher would write them in dialect. This would insure that no divergence would exist between child language and materials. As facility is acquired in reading dialect materials, so would facility in reading standard materials be increased. References are included. (MS)",

Four groups were selected for study: good and poor readers who were of average ability, and good and poor readers who were mentally handicapped. Approximately 160 subjects were identified for testing, and the final population was composed of 127 subjects with mental ages of about 9 years. Tests were given in the following areas: auditory discrimination, visual word discrimination, reading, visual perception, learning aptitude, visual-motor integration, associative learning, lateral dominance, and visual-motor retention. The results indicated that good and poor readers were often differentiated on measures of reading; they were  infrequently differentiated on measures of psychomotor characteristics. Poor reading retarded children were substantially inferior to the other groups on measures of reading skills.

Three media which bring oral language to the young are radio, television, and record players. Teachers should plan oral language experiences utilizing these media, which have such tremendous influence on young people, rather than forcing a dichotomy between the kinds of language met in school and in other places. The acceptance by teachers of dialect, modes of expression, and particular vocabulary will put students at ease with school materials, making enjoyment of them much more likely and creating motivation toward further  acquaintance with books and reading.

Such a program would allow teachers to do a more realistic and efficient job of teaching reading to adults and would allow adults to receive instruction at levels commensurate with their needs.

In the first study, Bormuth's cloze-test criteria were compared with the results of the Fry and Dale-Chall readability formulae. A total of 133 students in grades 4 to 8 were required to read a 250-word passage with every fifth word deleted. The results indicated a fairly close correspondence between Bormuth's 44 percent criterion for cloze readability analysis and the readability formulae. In the second study, a method devised by the writer was used. The Informal Cloze Readability Inventory (ICRI) uses materials of unknown difficulty to be read by readers of known reading ability in order to evaluate the readability of a book. The ICRI and the  Paragraph Meaning subtest of the Stanford Reading Achievement Test were given to groups of six average readers in grades 4 to 6. When cloze instructional levels were analyzed, they did not appear to be very different from the readability levels as measured by the readability formulae. It was concluded that valid readability assessments can be made using the ICRI based on a small number of subjects. References are included. (DH)",

Two ways of providing for individual differences according to the materials used are described. (1) If a common textbook is used, it is suggested that the children be separated into three ability groups and the class period be sectioned to allow for working with the slow group, supervision of the other two groups, and whole class discussions. (2) For utilizing a variety of materials, suggestions are given for organization of the materials and the class and activities involved in the steps of recognizing background information, identifying the problem, collecting information, organizing information, and sharing information. A consideration of whose responsibility it is to teach content  reading skills--the subject teacher or the reading teacher--concludes that the reading teacher is primarily responsible because the task involves reading learnings rather than science, mathematics, or social studies learnings. The subject-area teacher is thus freed to plan her strategies for accomplishing her task which is to help the child get the information. (DH)",

The predominant speech pattern at one school was Southern Negro dialect; at the other school, Standard English. The Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test as recorded by a dialect speaker and a Standard English speaker was administered. The results indicated a significant relationship between auditory discrimination and age and between auditory discrimination and reading ability. The subjects who were exposed primarily to Standard English had significantly fewer errors in discriminating word pairs pronounced in Standard English  as well as those pronounced in Southern Negro dialect.

The Zaslow Concept Formation Test was administered to all 64 subjects individually over a 4-day period. The results indicated the following: (1) There was no difference between the upper and lower groups in their ability to understand the continuum on Phase A of the Zaslow test; there was some difference between the two groups when comprehension of the continuum was related to task structure. (2) There was a  significant positive relationship between reading achievement and error scores as well as between IQ and error scores on the Zaslow test. (3) There was no measurable relationship between reading achievement scores and width and consistency of concepts.

The Reading Comprehension Test; Test of Critical Thinking, Form G; Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Form A; Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests, Form A; and Florida Statewide Twelfth Grade Tests were administered to twelfth-grade students in Robinson High School, Hillsborough County, Florida. Critical reading and critical thinking correlated low when verbal intelligence was partialled out, and moderately when IQ total, reading vocabulary, reading total, reading index, respectively were partialled out. When both intelligence and reading were removed in second-order partials, the correlations between critical  reading and critical thinking were low. The canonical correlations were all in excess of .67 between four sets of subtests: critical reading, critical thinking, reading, and reading and verbal and achievement. It was concluded that critical reading/critical thinking may exist as a thinking activity, but that critical reading/critical thinking overlaps strongly with verbal ability to such an extent that verbal ability may account for critical reading/critical thinking.

        "description":"Deficiencies in spelling ability are present in varying degrees among elementary and secondary school students. Often these deficiencies are accompanied by related reading difficulties. As a means of combating spelling difficulties and thereby also of combating reading difficulties, it is suggested that the visual-auditory-kinesthetic-tactile (VAKT) approach be used in learning to spell. Originally designed by Grace Fernald, the method provides multimedia exposure through sight, hearing, and touching. Six steps to be followed in using the VAKT method are (1) inspect the whole word to be learned, (2) pronounce or enunciate the whole word, (3) write the whole word while pronouncing each syllable, (4) dot the \"i's\" and cross the \"t's\" in the left to right sequence, (5) pronounce  each syllable and underline it, and (6) pronounce the whole word again. Reports of the use of the VAKT method seem to indicate that it is a valuable means of learning to spell and that its value might well transfer to other reading skills. References are included. (MS)",

Traditional IRI's, however, based on random selection of passages from texts, tend to give inaccurate placements for children. This happens because the text pages do not always contain enough new words to sample the child's ability to handle that grade level's vocabulary. Therefore, a new method of devising an IRI is suggested in which new words are taken from the text and incorporated into an original paragraph. To discover the usefulness of this procedure, a traditional IRI and one based on the new method were administered to 10 second graders and 10 fourth graders. The Gray Oral Reading Test was also given. The results indicated that the  new IRI (1) presented fewer total number of words per selection, with more new words in each; (2) required fewer selections to be read; and (3) gave an instructional-level score in 10 cases lower than the traditional IRI. Both inventories gave lower instructional scores than did the Gray Oral Reading Test. The issue that still remains for further investigation is the accuracy of placement.

The over-all themes and ideas of physics receive the major emphasis, with little stress placed on mathematical manipulation. The style of presentation is mainly a combination of the axiomatic and the historical. This mode of writing, as well as organization and selection of topics, was based on the author's estimation of what would most enhance student interest and understanding. The five chapters in order of presentation are Introduction, Kinematical Preliminaries, Dynamical Principles, Force, and Motion Under the Influence of Gravitational Forces. (PR)",

Based on the principal point of view that the problems faced in Central America are dynamic and their importance transcends local significance, an attempt was made to evaluate the problems within the scope of the next 25 years. Multiple factors were considered including the complex social structure, geographic variations, economic organization, levels of  education, availability of resources, and broad diversification in the field of agriculture.

Another article in this classification focuses on a teacher preparation course in which the future teachers experience the learning activities of the students. The second group of articles is categorized \"instruction-techniques.\" These articles focus on the techniques of teaching units in informal geometry using mirrors, models, toys, and Mobius bands. The third  type of article is termed \"instruction-rationale.\" This type of article gives reasons why geometry should be taught in the elementary grades and tells what parts of geometry should be taught.

The ECCP approach is to work from an actual problem to the solution framework and then to the concepts. Course content, laboratory work, and behavioral objectives are described. The second article discusses  science-society issues and secondary school teachers; what is the role of secondary schools in the matching of men and technology, and how can secondary school teachers be prepared? Two issues, control of the noise environment and automated health examinations, are presented for examples. Regarding teacher preparation, five possibilities on how today's programs might evolve gradually into an educational program more directly related to these issues are explored. (BL)",

It does not deal with what should be taught about man and his environment, nor does it suggest how teachers should teach. Its purpose is to describe ways to build miniature environments for living things, using low cost materials and equipment. Through construction of aquaria and terraria the miniature environments for the living worlds of land and water are developed. Well detailed as to the background, construction, content, and use of such enclosed environments, the booklet continuously emphasizes the basic elements and processes of nature which  are vital to all ecosystems.

He then describes programs for individualization now in existence. These include Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI), Westinghouse's Project PLAN, Individualized Mathematics Teaching (IMV) in Sweden, and programs in the following locations; Dade County, Florida, Nova H.S. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Hopkins, Minnesota. Problems of implementation of programs, and evaluative  research results are discussed.

The guides vary somewhat according to the grade level, however, they all follow the same general pattern. A table of contents lists a number of basic concepts or &quot;Big Ideas&quot; appropriate to the particular grade. These are expanded upon in the guide and accompanied by teaching activities, lists of books and other resources, and suggestions for evaluating student understanding of the material. All the guides include a brief section on &quot;Major Ideas and Sub-Ideas of Modern Economics&quot;; some include appendices with statistical or other information. Two basic concepts from this grade 8 guide are: 1) our country's record of  economic growth began in the Colonial Period; and, 2) the American Revolution helped to substitute a relatively free economy for the rightly controlled Mercantile system. SO 000 631 through SO 000 635 represent guides for grades 2 through 5. The guides for grades 6, 7, and 9 will be available in the near future. A &quot;Package Economics Course,&quot; offered through the Oregon Board of Education, Division of Continuing Education, is available for in-service training to be used in conjunction with the guides.

        "description":"There is increasing evidence that what we call civic education embraces only a part of the influences operating on a people, and may well be among the less important. There are a number of practical obstacles to the success of civic education in political socialization. The multifunctionality that allows schools to have so many favorable effects, for example, also assures that many instructional effects will inevitably be seen by some as a drag on progress. The loose and highly complex interconnections among the educational, political, and other components of a developing society suggest that caution must be exercised in proposals for new programs of instruction. One can expect that civics lessons will focus more upon symbols of nationhood than with behavior that would strengthen  an individual citizen's responsibility for their share of the tasks of development. There are difficulties in rooting an effective system of political instruction, as well as ambiguities and dilemmas arising in its implementation: the tension between tradition and modernity; multilingualism; gulfs between leaders and masses; pedagogic effects of a one-party government; needs for and effects of practical schooling; lack of well-prepared teachers; and the relationship of education and opportunities for mobility.

In the process a number of questions were raised: 1) Just which of these projects are used locally? 2) Which school districts are using them? 3) At what grade levels are they being used? 4) What has reaction been to the use of any of these projects? In order to answer these questions, a survey was begun during the summer of 1970 in which questionnaires were sent to each superintendent and then to each social studies department chairman in the two counties. Certain observations were then made through an analysis of the responses: 1) all but three  of the twenty-six projects were reported as being used locally; 2) utilization was higher at the secondary school level than at the elementary level; and, 3) all but two projects were reported as being used at the general grade level or levels for which they were originally intended. Qualifying comments were indicated on many questionnaires: 1) Several projects were merely under review; 2) single units had been used experimentally; and, 3) materials had been adapted, modified, used only in part, and used as sources in curriculum development.

It is a skeletal structure which teachers can incorporate into a continuous social studies curriculum, and other appropriate studies. The main purpose of economic education is to develop the problem-solving ability of children as it relates to personal and social problems. To accomplish this it is necessary to: 1) develop the child's ability to think analytically; 2) to help the child to relate his everyday experiences to the economic world; and, 3) develop sufficient knowledge of the basic structure of the subject so that a frame of reference can be established. A core of developmental concepts has been  selected that can be extended through environmental, chronological, and logical sequences in line with grade progression. The topical areas are: the problem of scarcity, the economic goals of the nation, productive resources, the market economy of the United States, financial institutions, the circular flow, resource extenders, interdependence and trade, and economic analysis. Materials already in use in Arkansas have been drawn upon heavily: Parts I and II of the Joint Council's Developmental Economic Education Program (DEEP). (SBE)",

Most of the actual administration of educational matters is the responsibility of three appointed national government agencies operating under the overall jurisdiction of the Minister of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs --National Board of Education, Board of Institutes of Technology, Office of the Chancellor of Universities. Most types of schools are operated by local school committees. Financing of education comes from the National Government and the Municipalities. Compulsory schooling begins at the age of seven and lasts for seven years. Because a number of types of older secondary schools exist, there are  several paths open to the student --upper secondary schools, vocational schools, or art and music schools. Sweden has four universities, two higher technological institutions, and fifteen special institutions of higher education. As far as teacher education is concerned, students usually begin teacher training midway through secondary school. Folk High Schools are the chief means of carrying on adult education activities. Special education is also an integral part of the educational system. (SBE)",

In the final chapter, the author criticizes some phases of educational policy, educational philosophy,  or the lack of carefully thought-out and balanced educational philosophy.

Chapters 3 through 8 discuss each level with regards to: administration, organization, enrollment, finance, schedules, courses of study, admissions, grading and testing, teacher qualifications, and criticisms and problems. Chapter  9 concerns Chile's teachers --their preparation, their working conditions, and their problems. Finally, numerous government, quasi-government, and private agencies sponsor educational and related services.

        "description":"Triple T, a graduate project to educate (train) teacher trainers, allows participants to view the schools as a total system and gives educators a means of training people to change that system. It offers an opportunity to develop an alternative means for graduate education. An important element in this program is parity. While parity is more a feeling of having equal power in the decision making process than a result of organizational design, it is essential that the structure not hinder attempts at this power, and that some mechanisms for achieving parity exist. The concern here is with how parity exists between individuals in the university. One major problem is the role of the graduate student--he is thought of as a full member of the university by everyone except the faculty.  In any TTT project, this relationship must be altered if the concept of parity is to have any meaning. If TTT is successful, institutional change will follow. Suggested elements of an organizational structure which would allow parity are: 1) New graduate students should select graduate committee from people sympathetic to TTT objectives, but not presently active in it; 2) No course work, for grades, should be taken from any professor he is currently working with on the project; and, 3) No credit should be &quot;earned&quot; in a TTT program. If it seems important that a student receive credit, it should be given. (JLB)",

        "description":"Much of the responsibility for poor teaching of history at the secondary level lies with those who teach college history rather than those who teach teachers. One approach to new methods of history instruction is the development and use of inquiry models. Crucial to this approach is the involvement of students and teacher in model building--an element frequently lacking in \"packaged inquiry\" materials, which often stifle the opportunity for self-generated questions and pre-define the scope of investigation. The most difficult task of model building is getting students to understand the process and ask the kinds of questions which will enable them to gather the data needed to accomplish the goals--in the example used here--determining the causes of the American Revolution. Once  this is accomplished, it is time to begin actual model building, which consists of 3 steps: 1) determine area of investigation, 2) establish requirements for solving problem, and 3) gather data. The model has several uses--for investigation, as shown here, for evaluating historical interpretations, and hypothesis testing. Finally, to determine whether students can build inquiry models, one can use individual models, or devise an exam which tests this ability. (\"Steps in Model Building\" and \"Inquiry Model for the Causes of the American Revolution\" are appended.) (JLB)",

Consideration is given to establishing instructional objectives and creating the necessary climate conducive to teaching and learning. Each teacher must develop his own course content based on the needs and interests of his students, but four interrelated, broad topics with introductory concepts are suggested here: 1) the consumer as an individual; 2) the consumer as a  member of society; 3) his alternatives in the marketplace; and, 4) his rights and responsibilities. Each topic area includes samples of various types of learning activities divided into grades of K-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12. Noting that curriculum development in consumer education requires the assistance and support of many, the roles played by various agents are discussed--the administrator, teacher, federal government, and consumer organizations.

        "description":"Students of urban, commuter universities frequently make unlikely candidates for a team teaching situation in a black elementary school. Methods teachers at the University of Toledo, therefore, decided to hold classes at a multi-unit school in the Toledo ghetto. The objectives were twofold: to teach undergraduates how to team teach social studies, and provide an opportunity to teach black children. Students were formed into nine teaching teams, about two per grade level. All members of a team received the same grade. Teams were given the responsibility for planning a social studies curriculum unit which they would then teach to a group of 6 to 12 black children two afternoons per week for five weeks. Lectures, which later became discussion sessions, and evaluation and planning  time accompanied the teaching experience. As the students got to know the children, they made progressively fewer presentations and used more techniques to get the children involved in the learning process. The objectives were achieved, largely because: the ratio of child to teacher was small; the team concept allowed differing levels of creativity to be equalized; topics chosen by the undergraduates were relevant; and the availability of planning time encouraged the students to be flexible.

The central theme of the Population Curriculum Study is: MAN IS PART OF A NATURAL SYSTEM, AND IS ULTIMATELY SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS OF THE SYSTEM. We are thinking of population education not merely as training to bring about a decline in the population growth rate but rather as the central theme of the entire educational enterprise, encompassing the needs and behavior of man, his population and his environment, and the interactions of these forces. Using this definition, many aspects of population education can already be identified in existing school programs. Existing curricula have a good deal of content that is  related both directly and indirectly to population-environment studies, which can be used without disruption of existing programs. To prepare a population-environment education program under these circumstances the first need is a conceptual scheme outlining the concepts needed to understand population-environment problems. The program built on this conceptual scheme should be K-12, multidisciplinary, and problem-solving in approach. Obviously, we cannot solve our population problems in the schools, but the schools can help students to attain concepts of the natural systems, for democratic decisions. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"A 55-item test, \"The Political Knowledge Test,\" was developed to measure student performance in terms of knowledge objectives of the American Political Behavior (APB) course. The test was administered in May 1970 to secondary school students in experimental (E) and control (C) groups in nine communities in various parts of the country. Students in E groups performed significantly better than C groups on the test; there was a small difference among the mean scores of the nine E groups, and a great difference between the mean scores of E and C groups in each community. Evidence in this study indicates that the course is likely to have an impact on the \"political knowledge\" of students. For example, students in the E groups, unlike those in C groups, are aware of: 1) the  relationships between socioeconomic status and political behavior; 2) the conflict and compromise inherent in the political process; and 3) fundamental legalistic aspects of the political process. Limitations of the study were that: 1) there was only a rough random quality to the assignment of students to groups; 2) experimental group teachers volunteered to teach the APB course; and 3) test performance of E group students, though impressive, reveals that several students did not achieve many of the basic knowledge objectives of the course.

The objective of this research was to assess the interrelationships between level of moral judgment maturity and several other sectors of development. A moral judgment situation (appearing in the appendix) was presented to 60 children, ages 5 through 8, while measurements of cognitive ability, personality, socialization, and creativity were obtained. Results support the contentions of Piaget and Kohlberg that there are definitely both social and cognitive aspects of major importance in the development of moral judgment and reasoning. Data indicate that the stage of development tapped in this  research was the transition phase between constraint and autonomy--that phase during which rules and commands are being internalized and generalized. Kohlberg's comment that cognitive maturity is necessary but not sufficient for moral judgment maturity, as well as his and Piaget's ideas concerning the relatively increasing importance of socialization for the later stages of development, appear to be borne out.

Organized on a topical approach, the course centers about four sociological domains--socialization, institutionalization, stratification, and social change. Wide ranging methods of presentation are used in the four parts, from narrowly defined problems and clearly stated variables, to data presented in a literary form. There are several distinctive features of the course: 1) Though deductive aspects of reasoning are included, the emphasis is  on learning major concepts and generalizations through indictive methods and inquiry; 2) Students are actively involved in a wide range of activities and materials; 3) An elaborate Instructor's Guide is an integral part of the course; and 4) Teachers and sociologists collaborate in developing the materials. The course has undergone national classroom evaluation and subsequent revision. Unfortunately, it will not be available until January 1, 1972, when Allyn and Bacon expect to publish it.

The purpose of the program is to prepare liberal arts graduates to be secondary school teachers in urban areas. The recruiting of the interns took place mostly at black colleges and universities and among Peace Corpsmen and Vista Volunteers. The 46 interns with whom the program began in June 1970 were almost evenly divided between blacks and whites. Social science majors predominated. During the summer phase the interns worked with community and school groups in the cities in which they would be teaching. This practical work experience was supplemented with seminars on contemporary urban culture and the adolescent  subculture therein. The interns in Newark worked with a Catholic Church group in the central ward on a tutorial and recreational program for high school and elementary school students. In the fall 1970 semester the interns did supervised half-day teaching in the school systems. In addition, they took four graduate courses at Rutgers consisting of: 1) a practicum in urban schools and communities; 2) a practicum in the teaching of the subject specialty to urban students; 3) a research and theory course on urban education; and, 4) a course in the intern's subject major.

The focus in the past has been on the production of goods for sale, very little on the welfare of the consumer, not at all on what happens after the consumer has discarded a product. But there is increasing awareness that unlimited and uninhibited personal consumption is simply incompatible with preservation of resources and environmental quality. American people will be forced to decide how much of a trade-off they want to make between environmental quality and consumption. Pollution exists not as a result of the evil actions of  one or a few polluters, but as part of a large and complex production and consumption structure. Fundamental changes in this whole production-consumption-residual cycle will have to be made and, although individual action has a role in this change, this role is limited. Greater social-legal controls over individual action will be a necessary force in bringing about this change. Despite the loss to the individual of certain specific freedoms, a reasonable curbing of uninhibited action may actually increase freedom for all. (JLB)",

These inadequacies are the result of depoliticization in the school board-community relationship and professionalization in the administration-parent relationship. When school-controlled channels became closed to other than supportive participation, dissent was forced into the externally controlled channels. This led to school board and superintendency turnover which brought about more responsive leadership resulting in the creation of new  channels which integrated the school system and the community by increasing visibility of issues and legitimating dissent. The strength of \"local\" interests and relative weakness of school interests and the unequal balance of power in the parent-administration relationship suggest the need for additional structural provisions for the promotion of sustained involvement and the mediation of conflicting interests.

Numerous supporting ideas are used to develop an understanding of the following fundamental concepts: 1) people in a community need goods and services; 2) someone must produce the goods and services a community needs; 3) there is a circular flow of money from families to businesses and government and back to families again; 4) we must have resources in order to produce. If we use our resources for one thing, we cannot use them for another. Because of this, we must make choices: 5) prices help us decide how to use our resources; and, 6) money can be lent and borrowed. Activities are suggested for each concept and  lists of resources are provided which include fiction and non-fiction books, films, records, etc. Methods for evaluating instructional outcomes are detailed. &quot;Major Ideas and Sub-Ideas of Modern Economics&quot;, an appendix, defines the boundaries of the economic discipline and acts as a guide to the things teachers should cover or emphasize.

In response to this need, a workshop of college economists at Carnegie-Mellon University developed an experimental &quot;Survey of Opinion on Economic Issues (SOEI)&quot;. (Copies are available from the author, Room 637 East Building, New York University, 239 Green Street, New York, New York 10003.) This paper reports results of a study which compared pre- and posttest responses of two groups of education students, one class made up of students preparing to teach social studies, the other secondary business  courses. Each group was enrolled in separate economics courses, with different instructors, who also took the SOEI. In addition to differences between the two groups, also reported are differences within the groups before and after their courses. A further comparison is made between the groups and a heterogeneous sample of students from a midwestern college. Most of the paper is devoted to speculation about the interpretation of responses. Since the SOEI is experimental, the author is seeking reports by other educators who have used the test. (DJB)",

Data analysis techniques included Pearson r correlation, univariate analysis of variance, and chi-square. Findings indicate that psychological deprivation is highly related (p&lt;.001) to democratic socialization and cognitive closure (p&lt;.001) and suggest that democratic value teaching will not produce a democratic personality unless preceded by an environment which gratifies the basic needs of the child.

The population consisted of two different sections of a required methods course, each  comprising 25 social studies student teachers, one group having participated in the training, the other not. Thirty-three tapes were obtained of initial teaching efforts; thirty-two of these were re-taped during the last week of student teaching. The first two hypotheses were confirmed; the latter two were not. The lack of significant results on the fourth hypothesis, however, was felt to be at least partially attributable to an uncontrolled variable. The data strongly suggest that videotaped microteaching can be an effective innovation in teacher preparation. (JLB)",

The subjects received various paragraphs of information about certain U.S. Presidents, and evaluated them on general statesmanship. This evaluation requires the subjects to combine or integrate the information in the various paragraphs into a unitary attitude. Integration theory makes some straightforward predictions about how the information is integrated. Remarkably good results were obtained. Experiment I provided an initial test of the parallelism prediction of integration theory. It may be concluded that the information paragraphs were integrated into an overall attitude by a simple algebraic rule. Experiment II  provided a more extensive test of the parallelism prediction. The results eliminated the adding hypothesis and supported the averaging hypothesis. The averaging effect seems fairly conclusive and should resolve the theoretical controversy centered on averaging-versus-adding. A very important methodological product of this work is the set of president paragraphs. Favorableness values are given for each president included. These should be useful in the general study of attitude development. Finally, integration theory leads to a new view of the relation between attitude change and learning theory. (Author/SLD)",

Since there is a lack of information concerning cognitive processes in the classroom and the effects of cognitive instruction with pre-service students in teacher education programs, this study concerned itself with these issues. Stated in the null form the hypotheses tested in this investigation were: (1) There will be no difference between the observed cognitive behavior of student teachers trained in cognitive instruction and those not so trained; and, (2) There will be no difference between the observed cognitive behavior of the pupils of student  teachers trained in cognitive instruction and the pupils of those student teachers not so trained. A total of thirty-three subjects, an experimental group of seventeen and a control group of sixteen, were randomly drawn from a stratified sample and controlled on age, sex, and grade point average. Cognitive instruction was provided for the experimental group. Both hypotheses were rejected at the .001 level of significance. It seems appropriate to conclude that cognitive instruction can increase cognitive behavior in the classroom. (Author/SLD)",

During the latter half of his student teaching, each subject (40 secondary and 22 elementary student teachers) was observed for a 20-minute period by a team of four trained and reliable observers, each using a different observation system: 1) Reciprocal Category System (RCS), 2) Teacher Practices Observation Record (TPOR), 3) Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior (FTCB), and 4) Taxonomy of Imagery Provocation (TIP). Findings revealed that for elementary student teachers: 1) The primary verbal pattern is a teacher questions/student responds behavior with both teachers and  student initiating but teacher directing. 2) In cognitive functioning, knowledge level is most common for both teacher and students with translation and interpretation second and third. 3) Teachers are approaching but have not attained experimentalism, the greatest deficits being differentiation of tasks to meet varied needs of children on an individual basis. 4) Teachers employ imagery provoking behavior in approximately two-thirds of the observed behavior, about half of the imagery abstract. Correlations among behaviors were those logically expected. Behavior descriptions appear similar to that of a traditional classroom, lacking the variety of behaviors included in the training on campus. (JS)",

        "description":"In this paper on research into teacher behavior, the author considers first the current status of such research and the fact that the problem is so complex that no one knows or agrees what a competent teacher is. The difficulties of identifying and measuring teacher behaviors are discussed. The four broad areas of measurement (observation, student behavior and achievement, ratings based on recall, and personality tests) are considered in detail, together with additional problems including the noncumulative nature of earlier research; the problem of distinguishing, control and analysis of the variables; the rapid sequence of classroom events; the non-scientific nature of teaching; and teachers' lack of enthusiasm for researchers, particularly in inner-city situations. In an  attempt to improve this situation, twenty-seven recommendations for future research are listed. The paper is based on Chapter 3 of the author's unpublished doctoral dissertation, Selected Teacher Behavior Attributes Rated as Desirable by Ninth-Grade Disadvantaged Students and Ninth-Grade Teachers of the Disadvantaged.

Questionnaires were sent to all available individuals who received the Ed.D. or Ph.D. in education between 1956 and 1958. Responses were received from 78.5 percent of the persons polled. Respondents represented 91 institutions which award the doctorate in education. The purpose was to develop hypotheses. Chi square analysis and rank correlation were used. Tabulations were made across all items (the mass data), across major fields, across degrees, and across institutions. Findings revealed information  regarding circumstances and events leading up to doctoral study, pursuit of the degree, attitudes toward selected situations encountered during the program and period of residency, and since the degree. Six critical factors were identified which underlie conditions affecting pursuit of the doctoral degree in education: sociological facts relative to the individual in the sample, age of the graduates, length of the doctoral program, financial factors, the occupational sources of students and the kinds of positions taken after receipt of the doctorate, and institutional control of factors affecting pursuit of the degree.

Questionnaire data was collected to investigate 5-year career development and job satisfaction plus ability and achievement (as measured by high school graduating class rank, intelligence test scores, and mathematics-science GPA). Conclusions were drawn from findings related to 13 specific questions: Concern over superiority of one degree or the other is not fully warranted. The imagined superiority of doctoral incumbants in certain types of positions within the profession is questionable. Certain types of employing organizations and certain types of colleges do not necessarily attract graduates with greater ability or achievement.  Speculation as to superiority of those in certain major subject areas is not entirely supported. Areas outside education attract only 5 percent of the degree holders, the majority seeking employment in a college or university. The group is quite mobile and generally satisfied with economic, position, and achievement conditions. Recipients devote much time to administration as contrasted with teaching, counseling, and research. Degree holders enjoy considerably higher earning power than is often thought. The doctorate has been very influential in enhancement of status role. (Complete findings are included. Related documents are SP 004 599-SP 004 602, and ED 010 188.) (JS)",

In a case study approach, four teachers were selected on the grounds of their divergent styles and background. Procedures included observation of teachers' styles (using Beller scales to determine the sensitivity of the teacher to the psychological and interpersonal needs of children in the classroom) and interviews with teachers and observers on the nature of interaction between teachers and observers. Conclusions drawn from the four case studies: Each  teacher resisted the activities of the observer and established barriers to the utilization of the observers as a source of information about the classroom. In her own way, each teacher was able to so vastly delimit the activities of the observer that few meaningful interactions between teacher and observer occurred. Unaware of the issues which their presence raised for teachers, observers were at a disadvantage in their capacity to contribute to the educational issues of the classroom. By retaining her authority over the classroom, the teacher was able to determine the conditions which could not be challenged, changed, or expanded by the observer. (Author/JS)",

The first component, Community Orientation and Study, involves a 6-week living experience in the inner city while working for the Young Great Society, a Black community organization. Evaluation of this component, according to questionnaires filled out by participating students, indicated that most objectives were met. The second component, a 1-semester microteaching course, was evaluated by questionnaires and interaction analysis of videotapes. Again, most objectives were achieved.

The first phase, an administrative workshop combined with the collection and feedback of data, was completed in December 1969. The second phase was not implemented beyond the introductory stage because funding was not available. The project's long run impact cannot be effectively assessed unless follow-up studies are conducted in the near future. The objectives of the project were 1) to develop and strengthen the interdependence of members of the school's staff; 2) to develop a collaborative process of working on the problems facing individual schools; 3) to develop a continuing personal and team commitment to growth and organizational development; and 4) to  develop the necessary skills within the school team to be able to carry on the process of organizational renewal. The document gives details of the planning, resources, participants and staff, administrative workshops, change seminar, and change-team activities, followed by a summary and conclusions. Extensive appendixes document the three workshops and seminar, and include the various instruments employed and the questionnaires used for evaluation. (MBM)",

This led to the development of three treatment conditions which may be labeled \"rating\" (rehearsal of key discriminations), \"observation\" vicarious reinforcement), and \"direct practice.\" Specific predictions were that increases in the response strength of probing (the dependent variable) would be greatest for the Direct Practice Group, next the Observer Group, and finally the Rater Group, and that within groups, Rater subjects would demonstrate the most significant within-repertoire shifts of sub-skills. Forty undergraduate teacher trainees were randomly assigned to three experimental and one control group.  All were pre- and posttested in 5-minute video taped lessons which they taught for four fifth grade pupils. Each subject spent a total of 75 minutes in three treatment sessions over a 3-week period. Two trained raters coded relevant behaviors. Data treatment included analyses of variance and covariance and t tests. The first hypothesis was supported; the second was not although data was suggestive. Results provide further support for the theoretical assumptions. By increasing the distinctiveness of relevant model stimuli, observational learning is facilitated. (JS)",

Participants were certified teachers with at least one year of experience in the district (Ravenswood, California); they were employed for the succeeding year to complete the inservice curriculum-development part of the project. Instruments developed for use in evaluation were a 28-item attitude inventory to measure attitude toward racial and ethnic groups; two 20-item word  association scales to assess attitude toward concepts given emphasis in the training; and a 150-item final examination covering the six instructional units: Black Experience in Literature, Racism and Prejudice, History of the Civil Rights Movement, History of Tropical Africa in the 19th Century, Afro-American History, and Contemporary Education of Afro-Americans. Instruments were administered as pre- and posttests to participants (N=25) and as posttests to a control group (N=20).

A pretest-posttest correlation design was used to investigate the effects of both organizational evaluators' attitudes and prevailing school-staff climate on teacher attitudes toward professional autonomy. (Power, resources, and affect were independent variables; attitude changes in relation to teacher autonomy the major dependent variable.) The 38-item Autonomy Inventory developed for the study was administered to all new teachers in a large California school district before their teaching experience began and to all experienced teachers (N=523) and administrators (N=89) to obtain comparative data on those to whom the  new teachers would have to adapt. Posttests were administered in April after all had been subject to at least one formal evaluation in their school, and all new teachers (N=115) were interviewed to identify the significant other for each to obtain measures of behavioral autonomy and feelings of &quot;legitimacy&quot; and &quot;satisfaction.&quot; Conclusion: New teacher attitudes toward autonomy vary across task areas. The nature of new teacher relationships with significant others, both organizational evaluators and school staff, help determine the direction of change in teacher attitudes toward professional autonomy in these task areas.

With the work of the parallel EPDA Paraprofessional Training Project, a Taxonomy of Paraprofessional Tasks was used as the basis of a hierarchy of tasks, and a three or four step career ladder. Many different positions were then related to this career  ladder. The Taxonomy categorized tasks as \"non-interactive,\" i.e., clerical, housekeeping, or technical, and \"interactive,\" i.e., clerical, monitorial, or tutorial. Important findings are: 1) The career ladder concept based on the Taxonomy described is viable. 2) Personnel should be selected in terms of ability to effectively perform or potential for learning interactive tasks. 3) Working situations should provide more interaction between paraprofessional and professional.

Jacobson (New York: Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1968) and reports an extensive reanalysis of the Rosenthal-Jacobson data. The Pygmalion study purported to show that children whose teachers expected them to &quot;bloom&quot; intellectually would do so. The critique suggests that the Rosenthal-Jacobson report as a whole is inadequate. Descriptions of design, basic data, and analysis are incomplete. Inconsistencies between text and tables, overly dramatic conclusions, oversimplified, inaccurate, or incorrect statistical discussions and analyses all contribute to a generally misleading impression of the study's results. In their reanalyses of the Rosenthal-Jacobson data, the  present authors demonstrate a wide variation in apparent results which can be obtained from slightly different statistical approaches if serious imbalance in design and major measurement problems exist in a research study. They conclude that the reanalysis reveals no treatment effect of &quot;expectancy advantage&quot; in grades 3 through 6. The first and second graders may or may not exhibit some expectancy effect, but a conclusive analysis of first- and second-grade IQ scores is not possible. (Author/RT)",

Of the latter group, 72 percent used microteaching in the general methods course, 43 percent in the subject methods course, and 18 percent in student teaching. Seventy-three percent had used microteaching 2 years or less at the time of the survey in 1968-69. About two-thirds of the microteaching programs involved a relatively small number of students (150 or less), and most of the programs used \"peer\" students in the microclass.  There appeared to be a general lack of knowledge about the technical skills of teaching as defined at Stanford; less than a third of the institutions had rationale or had videotaped or filmed models of any of the technical skills. Many respondents who had used microteaching observed an improvement in attitude toward education and in teaching ability both in themselves and in their students. Fifty-four institutions reported contributing directly to the use of microteaching in the inservice education of the state in which they are located. (Author/RT)",

The sample was drawn from 54 Stanford students who each taught one of six preset social studies or English lessons to 25 eighth and ninth graders. Each pupil took a multiple-choice comprehension test which was used to compute a mean class achievement score for each teacher. The score was adjusted twice, by analysis of covariance for student verbal and quantitative ability, and also for lesson difficulty. These scores were used to select 16 high-scoring and 16 low-scoring teachers. Four categories of presentation behavior (verbal, nonverbal, combination, and interaction) were investigated, yielding more than 100 measures of behavior. Audiotape, videotape, or  typewritten transcript records were used to observe and code behaviors. Statistical analysis of each subsample and the total sample were conducted using analysis of variance, rank correlation, stepwise discriminate analysis, stepwise regression analysis, and sign test procedures. The results indicated that the behaviors related to success in one sample differed from those in the other; few behaviors discriminated high-scoring from low-scoring teachers when the two samples were combined. It seemed that high-scoring teachers conveyed the essential points by frequent use of repetition, verbal statements of importance, and/or reinforcement of pupil responses. (Author/MBM)",

        "description":"Four instructional strategies for promoting the acquisition of infinite concept classes were investigated. Three independent variables were 1) probability level of exemplars and nonexemplars determined by the number of students in a separate sample who correctly classify the instance as an exemplar or a nonexemplar; 2) matching of an exemplar to a nonexemplar so that the irrelevant attributes are the same or very similar; and 3) divergency of an exemplar with another exemplar so that all of their irrelevant attributes differ. Four dependent variables were predicted: 1) correct classification, all instances, exemplars and nonexemplars, correctly identified; 2) overgeneralization, nonexemplars similar to class members identified as exemplars; 3) undergeneralization, low probability  exemplars identified as nonexemplars; and 4) misconception, exemplars and nonexemplars sharing a common irrelevant attribute identified as not class members. The four strategies consisted of presenting to S (N=76) a definition followed by 16 exemplars and nonexemplars which were selected according to the hypotheses: 1) IF high to low probability, divergent, and matched THEN correct classification. 2) IF low probability, divergent, and not matching THEN overgeneralization. 3) IF high probability, divergent, and matching THEN undergeneralization. 4) IF high to low probability, convergent, and no matching THEN misconception. A score on each dependent variable was determined for each subject on a specially constructed test requiring S to identify 30 instances of exemplars and nonexemplars.  Every hypothesis was supported (p<.01). (Author)",

The major thesis is that educational psychology is that special branch of psychology concerned with the nature, conditions, outcomes, and evaluation of school learning and retention; as such, the subject matter of educational psychology consists primarily of the theory of meaningful learning and retention and the influence of all significant variables--cognitive, developmental, affective, motivational, personality, and social--on school learning outcomes.

The research was conducted as a field experiment using a pretest-posttest control group design with replication. A community with a Mexican-American minority population in the southern Bay area of California was selected, and the training program was designed to increase the teachers' understanding of the children's cultural background and to help teachers increase the children's self-esteem. Results indicated that teachers with more than one year's experience with  disadvantaged children were more optimistic in their approach, and that the training program made participants more liberal in their outlook. It is recommended that new teachers should not be placed in classrooms with a large percentage of disadvantaged children. Appendixes include 1) the procedure used for formation of treatment and matched comparison groups; 2) the survey instrument; 3) the classroom observation record; (4) a cybernetic model of the educational process; 5) analysis of the association between teacher background characteristics and changes in score; amd 6) a 73-item bibliography.

A sequence of activities designed first to promote general awareness of research opportunities and to culminate with small grant awards in priority areas with formats similar to those now in use by the U.S. Office of Education was carried out. The following three conclusions were reached: 1) Initiation of institutional endorsement and encouragement of faculty research will increase faculty research involvement. 2) Within the framework of institutional endorsement, identification of an  individual to collect and disseminate sponsored research information on a personal basis is the single most effective technique for increasing research involvement. 3) Faculty visitations to operational research sites in related fields produced the highest \"subjectively identified\" cause for increased research involvement.

The first group of teachers participated in a taped 2-hour interview on their ideas about teaching. From the interview tapes, \"content units\" containing specific ideas about teaching procedures were identified. The second group of teachers was then asked to sort the content units into categories according to the similarities and dissimilarities which they discriminated among the units and express the substantive meaning which they attached to each category. A latent partition model was then used to identify 32 categories  perceived by the teachers. Several replications of this experiment were made using single-word verbs associated with teaching as the content units. This made possible faster sorting and computerized analysis of the data. In addition a questionnaire was administered in which teachers evaluated the contribution to learning of each of the content units.

Thirty-nine secondary teacher candidates served as subjects. They were enrolled in two sections of the course taught by the same instructor and were assigned randomly to four experimental groups. All the subjects engaged in a micro-teach-reteach cycle over a 2-week period, and all lessons were audiotaped. After the first lesson, one group received no feedback--they were not permitted to listen to their tapes or to consult their instructor. The second group listened to their tapes but received no other feedback. The third group listened to their tapes using a listening guide designed to assist them in  identifying their use of refocusing behaviors. The fourth group listened to their tapes using the listening guides and also had a non-directive conference with their instructor. Results indicated that listening to their tapes by the candidates, with or without a listening guide, seems to yield little change in subsequent teaching behavior. There was some empirical support for combining personal non-directive supervision with other types of feedback. It was also suggested that laboratory teaching will probably be more expensive to initiate and maintain than conventional programs. (MBM)",

Twenty-four categories are used in three main sections: initiation of the question, response to the question, and reaction to the response. Under initiation, the categories first designate the pupils expected to answer (MDES, mass designated; NDES, no one designated; GDES, group designated, and IDES, individual designated), and secondly identify the question's cognitive level (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, affectivity, and procedure). Two additional types of question are probing and redirecting, intended to elicit additional responses. The response categories are:  designated (the response is the expected one), independent (pupils respond without being called on by the teacher), intercepted (a pupil other than the one called on responds), aborted (something interferes to prevent a response), and no response (the question fails to elicit any response). Reaction categories are: approval, acceptance, rejection, criticism, and no evaluation. This version of QSOS was developed for a specific research project and does not include categories for pupil initiated questions or textbook or preframed questions.

The unit can utilize three approaches, each serving a different purpose: (1) to study literature about the generation gap which covers the entire span of literary history, expressing a wide range of viewpoints; (2) to present characters in a contemporary novel with whom the student can sympathize and identify; and (3) to promote an emotional response to literature through role playing.

Quality ratings of high (H), middle (M), and low (L) were given to each paper, using the evaluation procedures of the STEP test. The following relationships were tested: For total words, total T-units, words per T-unit, number of subordinate clauses, and total clauses, it was hypothesized that H=M, M>L, and H>L; for words per clause, H=M=L; and for clauses per T-unit, H<m, M>L, and H>L. Results indicated that (1)  distinctions between quality of papers were not signaled by differences in ratios of words to T-units, words to clauses, or clauses to T-units, (2) quality was distinguished by significant increases from low to middle to high in total words, total T-units, and total clauses, and (3) on the whole, low papers made use of significantly fewer subordinate clauses than did either middle or high.

The subjects, 44 undergraduate education majors, were asked to view three 90-second segments of video tape showing fifth and sixth grade boys from three ethnic groups--Black, Mexican-American, and Anglo--and were asked to complete a rating instrument made up of a set of semantic differential scales designed to judge a child's speech in terms of \"confidence-eagerness\" or \"ethnicity-nonstandardness.\" The video tapes were produced in such a manner that it was possible to substitute the speech of one child for another. Each subject was shown a segment of an Anglo child speaking standard English, a segment of a Black or Mexican-American child speaking the  standard English of an Anglo child (dubbed in), and a segment of a Black or Mexican-American child speaking his own dialect. Findings indicated that visual clues of ethnicity did bias the subjects' evaluations of standard English speech samples. Black and Mexican-American children shown with audio dubs of standard English were judged to be less confident and eager and more ethnic and nonstandard than the Anglo children speaking standard English.

Pairs of themes--one well written, one poorly written--were read, discussed, and compared by students in the experimental group before actually writing a specific rhetorical assignment, while the control group was taught by the instructor's conventional method. Themes of both experimental and control classes were judged according to a &quot;Behavioral Objective&quot; (for thesis statement, organizational outline, theme body, introduction, and conclusion) agreed upon by the  Project Director and colleagues as &quot;writing.&quot; Results were twofold: (1) the comparative method seemed to be effective in the teaching of some kinds of themes (e.g., definition, comparison-contrast, diagnostic themes) and ineffective in others (e.g., illustration themes); and (2) the Behavioral Objective used to measure and evaluate both sets of themes proved to be the greatest contribution of the project.

Three groups of students were randomly established: those assigned to one-to-one tutoring (one tutor and one student), those assigned to one-to-three tutoring, and those in a control group receiving no special help. In the third year of the program, a group of students in one-to-five tutoring were also studied. By the end of the first year of the program it was clear that tutoring had a statistically significant effect on the students and that the effect was increasingly greater  from the fourth to the seventh to the 10th grades. The analysis of data from the second year of tutoring supported these findings. A program of delayed testing 1 or 2 years after the students had participated in the tutoring program indicated that the effects of tutoring were still evident for all students both on the STEP tests and as seen in students' grades. Results indicated no systematic differences favoring one-to-one, one-to-three, or one-to-five tutoring. (Thirty-three tables are included.) See also ES 000 937 for the project proposal. (DD)",

Models employing two particular restrictions (where the matrix of weights is completely specified and is either scaled--by some unknown but estimable matrix of scaling weights--or unscaled) are discussed in particular, and their application to test development techniques is considered. It is suggested that more precise measuring instruments can be developed through these procedures by studying the characteristics of the test and the test items, the latent variables, and the ensuing relationships.

        "description":"Dissimilarity Linkage Analysis (DLA) is an extremely simple procedure for developing a typology from empirical attributes that permits the clustering of entities. First the procedure develops a taxonomy of types from empirical attributes possessed by entities in the sample. Second, the procedure assigns entities to one, and only one, type in the taxonomy. This two-step procedure clearly contrasts with many existing clustering techniques that are concerned only with the second step of this two-stage procedure. To develop a taxonomy of attribute types, the method searches for attributes that go together. A statistical test of association is first used to identify all pairs of attributes whose empirical values are significantly associated. Attribute pairs are then linked together to  form serpentine clusters, each of which represents an attribute type. The attributes defining each type are not similar. In fact, the method specifically avoids using any criterion of similarity when developing the types. Each entity is then assigned to the type it most closely resembles. An entity may unequivocally fit a type. Or, if an entry does not possess all of the characteristics of a type, it is assigned to the type with which its attribute values best match. Discrete clusters of entities, based on their attribute types, are thus formed. In short, this method moves from types defined by dissimilar attributes, to clusters of similar entities in each type of the taxonomy. (Author)",

        "description":"Most responses to educational and psychological test items may be represented in binary form. However, such dichotomously scored items present special problems when an analysis of correlational interrelationships among the items is attempted. Two general methods of analyzing binary data are proposed by Horst to partial out the effects of differences in item difficulties: (1) a least square simplex data matrix solution, and (2) a least square simplex covariance matrix solution. Of these, the first was selected for study using (1) a regression approach, (2) a raw data approach, and (3) the computational algorithm for the raw data matrix approach. The results indicate that Horst's modification clearly induces an effect that contaminates the common factor structure of the variables.  Further, the findings also indicate that image, alpha, and principal components analysis of correlation matrices obtained from binary data matrices are all satisfactory methods of analysis without the modification. This may be an important finding since it tends to confirm earlier empirical findings concerning the varying difficulties of binary items. (CK)",

Data was gathered on 54 disadvantaged 5-year olds in an OEO day care center. During the afternoon session, children were randomly assigned to treatment groups for formal learning activities. The same general curriculum was followed in all treatment groups, but each treatment stressed a different kind of perceptual training: Treatment 1 stressed \"general readiness,\" non-alphabet, and visual skills; Treatment 2 stressed alphabet perceptual skills in a primarily visual mode; Treatment 3 stressed alphabet perceptual skills in a primarily auditory mode;  and Treatment 4 placed equal stress on auditory and visual alphabet perceptual skills. At the end of the treatment period (35 days), all four groups improved one or more stanine points on reading readiness measures. Group 4 scored significantly better than the other three groups pooled in terms of IQ gain, and significantly better than the auditory group on reading readiness in subtests measuring visual perceptual abilities.

It was found that when certain ability and background factors over which the schools have little or no influence are statistically controlled, there are no appreciable differences between the achievement of minority and majority pupils. Moreover, there was no evidence of a \"cumulative deficit\" from lower to higher grade levels between the mean achievements of minority and majority pupils when the differences were measured in  standard deviation units. It is concluded that these schools do not cheat minority students in terms of conventional criteria. But it might be concluded that minority children are, in fact, cheated if it were shown that their ability patterns require different instructional approaches to optimize their scholastic learning. Marked differences, not only in overall level of ability but also in the pattern of abilities, were found among all three ethnic groups. (Author/GS)",

The first is an evaluation of school system performance in basic skill achievements, at the fourth and seventh year levels of schooling, by use of test batteries administered to students. This effort will constitute the initial phase of a continuing, comprehensive evaluation program of school system performance. The second area of assessment will involve the development of additional educational performance goals and their evaluation:  (1) the definition of educational goals; (2) the development of instruments to measure within the goal areas; (3) information on the level and distribution of Michigan education in terms of additional goal areas will be included. The criteria of procedures to be used in this program and their importance in future educational research are discussed.

This report focuses on the assessment of Basic Skills performance in the fourth and seventh grades and describes the specific steps taken to accomplish this objective: selection of local and intermediate district coordinators responsible for test administration and collation of test data; creation of an ad hoc test specifications committee; creation of a technical advisory group that would provide alternative solutions to potential assessment problems; and creation of a citizens committee to articulate general educational goals of the system. Details on the test battery, its  administration, the machinery for test data collection, and criteria for classification of school districts according to community type and geographic region are presented.

The &quot;input-process-output&quot; model is examined through an overview of major studies, such as Project Talent and the Coleman Report, and others generally supportive of this approach. The limitations of this research are suggested as: inadequacy of the definition and measurement of the concept of school performance; inadequate definition and measurement of the correlates of school performance; inadequate statistical methods; scarcity of school-by-school data; lack of longitudinal data; and lack of integration of research resources. The report concludes that the paradigm has aided in the understanding of four things about our formal school processes: (1) they are fundamentally  influenced by the children who participate in them and the environment in which they operate; (2) they are additionally influenced by the levels at which they are supported; (3) the effects of resources are largely mediated through the professional staff; and (4) they operate in complex, interrelated, and arcane fashion.

The assessment battery included measures, at the fourth and seventh grade levels, of the following: socioeconomic status, attitude toward school, percentage of teachers with a master's degree, K-12 instructional expense per pupil, vocabulary (50 verbal analogy problems), and composite achievement (reading, English expression, and mathematics). For the purpose of educational profiles, the state was divided into four geographic regions: Upper Peninsula; Northern Michigan; Southern Michigan; and Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties (Greater Detroit Metropolitan Region); and its communities classified as Metropolitan Core, City,  Town, Urban Fringe, or Rural Community. The average score in each geographic region and for each community type within that region for each of the six variables listed above are displayed with reference to the statewide percentile distribution on the same variables. Noteworthy results in the state as a whole and in each region are highlighted.

Language and verbal ability are functions determining achievement in all subject areas. A reading and social science curriculum was designed from this perspective, using a previously-developed listening curriculum as a model. The child is introduced to the reading and social science curriculum at the level where his individual progress has been assessed. Short reading passages concerned with the site, route, and boundary components of a functional community, are followed by multiple choice questions. This technique is considered important because it encourages student independence and self direction, facilitates the acquisition of  social science knowledge and the understanding of reading skills, and provides not only a source of immediate feedback but an evaluation method also. The intent is to use the materials for training in language development of reading skills. The procedures to validate the curriculum materials and ascertain their effectiveness in developing reading skills and improving achievement levels are described in detail, including the study sample, the measurement instruments, the data-gathering process itself, and the statistical analysis.

The Evaluation of Cognitive Development--Pre-Reading Skills, an observational instrument (teacher completed), was administered to 134 first grade students in a Gulfport (Mississippi) project in order to determine the presence of 64 behaviors regarded as significant in evaluating pre-reading skills. Thirty-two behaviors were exhibited by all or nearly all of the students. A factor analysis of the remaining 32 variables yielded eleven that were strongly associated with achievement and readiness. These variables were placed into two general categories: behavior associated with interaction with  other children, and behavior relating to phonic discrimination. Thus, the results indicate that certain social behaviors and behaviors reflecting phonics ability were clearly related to reading readiness and achievement even late in the first grade. Whether this behavior pattern is applicable to the population of other grade and age levels is yet to be determined. A longitudinal study, as well as additional performance validity of the eleven variables, in the age group three to six, is recommended. (AE)",

The correlation of total scores for the two batteries was .89, indicating that the batteries measure essentially the same things. If one were interested in selecting a battery to simply rank order students, either battery would be appropriate. Evidence of uniqueness of similarly named subtests in the two batteries was noted by the range of .49 to .69 correlations. Uniqueness of this magnitude is important in selecting a battery for measurement of outcome of instruction when one is interested in fitting the test to the curriculum. This is statistical evidence indicating that responsible school personnel need to  analyze the curriculum by subject areas, consider future goals and innovations, and administer various subtests of various batteries to appropriate instructional personnel when selecting an achievement battery for diagnosis of pupil progress by areas and making decisions about the curriculum.

The traditional aversions to evaluation which have created a negativistic environment of ambiguity and frustration in terms of educational improvement are discussed. The factors, processes, tenets, and characteristics of effective evaluation that have been developed in past and present educational research are enumerated. The paper presents specific criteria which would provide a systematic process that incorporates the positive aspects of evaluation by use of performance criteria and behavioral objectives. These criteria are seen as initiating a new trend in teacher role perception that offers more effective performance and measurement. Emphasis is placed on the differential roles and  styles of teaching that characterize the profession today and greatly extend the parameters of the teaching experience. Guidelines are presented for a model for future evaluation which emphasizes teacher-student and teacher-administrator interaction and provides for increased utilization of individual skills, knowledges, and attitudes that results in a maximization of performance outcomes. By applying these principles through more precise systems of evaluation a more meaningful process of educational accountability can be achieved. (AE)",

Fourth and fifth grade students' affective reactions to the following stimuli on both techniques formed the data base: home, friends, mother, self, father, school, teacher, principal. Of primary interest in this study was the attempt to predict or explain the students' reactions to the above stimuli on the basis of the following effects: grade-level, teacher-sex, student-sex, teacher-effect, student-behavior (as perceived by his teacher), and student-reading-achievement. Results indicate that the combined  techniques were most valid when estimating students' affective reactions to these stimuli: mother, father, school, teacher, and principal. The semantic differential method, which provided the greatest variability among individuals, seemed to be the more sensitive instrument. Further research is recommended to improve the validity and reliability of the techniques. Several measures of the social climate of the classroom may provide a more comprehensive picture than was previously realized. (Author/LR)",

A preventive intervention program was begun based on a clinical study of every first grader. Forty children were predicted to make normal progress; 30, a &quot;high risk&quot; group, gave evidence on neurological and perceptual examinations that they might have learning problems; and 12 children were omitted. High risk cases were those with a discrepancy between expectancy and achievement. Comparisons were made of the total groups of high risk and normal progress children, of samples matched for IQ and sex, and of subgroups based upon diagnosis within the  Intervention (high risk) group. Despite the small diagnostic subgroups, some tentative conclusions can be drawn: (1) the WPPSI produced rich clinical material best understood in conjunction with the diagnostic subgroups; (2) the quantitative and qualitative WPPSI material helps in the selection and diagnostic processes and in planning intervention; and (3) it is inadvisable to assume that learning disability is a homogeneous condition manifesting itself in a characteristic cognitive pattern in first grade.

It was found that the testing program continues to offer valid scholastic aptitude measures which are used and valued by state colleges for recruiting, admission, and pre-application counseling; by high school counselors for guidance of students regarding choice of post-secondary education; and by other agencies for research and policy planning. The unique aspects of the program are its early availability and its inclusion of  nearly all high school juniors. It was concluded that the values of the &quot;every-student&quot; statewide program justify its continuation, but that if it is to remain worthwhile, it must be strengthened in ways that will increase its relevance to student decisions and decrease its duplication of other programs. Specific recommendations for the achievement of this goal are presented. Statistical data on the test validities and correlations and interview summaries are included. (Author/PR)",

The authors suggest that there are two main issues, the first scientific, the second ethical: (1) Is a test a valid measure of the characteristics it purports to assess for particular types of individuals in particular circumstances; and (2) the whole question of test use, beginning with whether or not a test should be utilized for a specified purpose? Responsible standards exist for evaluating the adequacy and appropriateness of a test for a particular use, but they are not always applied. The adequacy of measurement and the question of bias, the appropriateness of test use and the  question of fairness, the side effects of testing, the problems of misinterpretation and secondary use of tests, the ethics involved, and the social consequences of not testing are other important topics discussed and analyzed in some detail.

        "description":"Even after a number of innovative programs and proposals have met selective criteria, the Educational Research Commission will have a difficult task in assigning priorities and spreading resources. This paper offers many suggestions for handling the problems in research and evaluation related to innovative mathematics projects, especially K-3. For example, it is proposed that innovative programs be generalizable to the public schools to avoid the dangers of elite staffing in innovative schools. The rationale and internal logic of a new curriculum should be evaluated by competent mathematicians, then the pedogogical soundness should be examined by educators and others qualified in a number of appropriate areas. Each innovative school should have computer services at its disposal.  An in-depth study of the nature of mathematics and its role in the technological culture of the future should be made with implications for K-3, while Piagetian studies on mathematical learning should also be reviewed. It is also suggested that a common pool of evaluative resources be developed and pretested so that they could be drawn upon for a variety of research and evaluative purposes. Some innovative enterprises should be directed toward the education of minority groups. Work on reading instruction might merge with mathematics at times. Finally, since some of the innovative proposals cannot be evaluated in terms of criteria for a final product, these proposals must be judged by their spirit and design. (CK)",

Essentially a nomograph is an easy graphic method of obtaining a predicted score without the use of the original regression equation upon which it is based. In the case herein described. the average reading score (grades 5 and 8), average arithmetic score (grade 5), and average composite score (grade 5) on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Form 4 may be predicted from average IQ, average mother's education, and instructional costs. Likewise average arithmetic score (grade 8) may be predicted from mother's education, father's education, and IQ and average composite score (grade 8) from father's education, IQ, and  instructional costs. The computation of each of these variables for use on the included nomographic charts is described. The process of entering these figures on the charts and obtaining the predicted score (a matter of drawing two or three lines) is explained. Once the predicted score has been obtained, it may be compared with the actual average score and school effectiveness may be assessed by use of the standard error. This process is also described.

A complete list of the unique activities reported is appended. Another study revealed that seniors in teacher training showed but mediocre competency in measurement, not only at graduation but also two years later. This low performance may correlate with a lack of commitment to anything associated with measurement (such as mathematics, statistics, norms, scales, etc.) and could be improved by the introduction of innovative teaching in measurement courses. The innovative approaches and experiences of 3 instructors of an undergraduate measurement course at Loyola University are an example, while some findings of the Loyola  Mastery Studies also have relevance. The most important point of these studies is that techniques have been discovered which yield not only mastery learning of content and concepts, but also favorable attitudes toward statistics. Perhaps these techniques are the most important trend in measurement teaching that can be reported. (CK)",

The principal hypothesis, that different students would be selected as a function of the selection technique utilized, was supported. No student was selected by all techniques, seven students were selected by only one technique, and ninety-two percent of the children (N=44) were selected on the basis of one or more technique. It is concluded that communities should be informed of the implications of various selection  techniques so that each may be judged on its merits when establishing special programs for talented students.

And as a predictor of &quot;success,&quot; grade point average has not been particularly valid for either graduate school or occupation. Criticisms of current practices--classified as ethical, rational, and pragmatic--and possible alternatives are discussed. Four suggested innovations are (1) pass-fail grading, (2) credit by examination, (3) criterion-referenced teaching and evaluation, and (4) procedures for evaluating creative extracurricular achievements. Research on the  revision of evaluation procedures at the University of Delaware over a ten-year period is reviewed; and a study of the senior class of 1969 is reported in a comprehensive set of tables. The results suggest that the university has been discriminating against students who are (a) male, (b) enrolled in the sciences and traditional academic disciplines, and (c) academic nonconformists.

A distinction is made between criterion-referenced scores, norm-referenced scores, cut-off scores, criterion scores, criterion variables, and content-standard scores. The relationship between norm-referenced information and criterion-referenced information is considered. The need for vigorous, empirically-based construct validation studies of criterion-referenced tests is pointed out. The use of criterion-referenced testing in instruction is considered in terms of absolute interpretations and mastery learning. It is seen that whether criterion-referenced testing and/or norm-referenced testing is needed to make instructional decisions depends upon the instructional context within which one operates.  It is concluded that, for purposes of instruction and instructional decision-making, there is a need for the integration of measurement knowledge with knowledge about instructional psychology.

The three central objectives were: to construct separate empirical procedures for Anglos and Blacks to predict certain academic performance criteria; to construct an empirical scoring procedure that could predict estimated family income in order to provide information about the socio-economic and biographical correlates of such data; and finally, to conduct a separate analysis on the five most integrated schools in the sample to examine the interrelationships of the measures in this selected sample. The paper surveys the literature, discusses the procedure used to construct the Biographical Inventory (BI), presents reliability and validity data on  the instrument, analyzes various aspects of the sample, and discusses the differential measures of some biographical corrleates of family income as indicated in the sample by the BI. The BI keys constructed were found to be substantially more valid in predicting academic performance and college attendance than IQ, College Boards or other non-biographical predictors. Keys built on Blacks were as valid for Anglos as keys constructed on Anglos. Blacks were equal or slightly superior to Anglos in academic performance and creativity when the family income variable was controlled; and Blacks scored significantly lower on intellectual tests even when the effects of family income were controlled. Statistical data and a bibliography are included. (AE)",

Evaluation of the project was undertaken to determine the effect of generous expenditures, used to modify basic conditions (class size, for example), on achievement levels. Ability and achievement tests were administered to both the experimental and comparison groups throughout the year. Analysis revealed that although the average mental age was 6 months lower for the experimental group, it essentially matched the comparison group on achievement at the end  of the school year. If mental age is used as a covariate, the experimental group exceeded the comparison group on 8 of the 10 achievement variables. The effect of other variables, including readiness, sex, father's occupation, integration, grouping, Head Start, and variable interactions on achievement are also reported.

Current testing problems include the time lag between events and curricular changes and new test construction, the time lag between changes in student population and re-norming of tests, comparability of school populations of large cities and norms groups, reinforcement by standardized tests of the concept of a standard as the goal rather than progress, and the failure on the part of the public, despite all efforts to the contrary, to appreciate the importance of the standard error of measurement. Among other issues considered are the problems of cultural differences,  the results of deprivation, language difficulties, the use of test results as one method of evaluation in accountability, and calls for a moratorium in testing. Suggested remedies include the construction of better, more relevant tests; more frequent test revisions; more sophisticated understanding, interpretation, and use of test results; periodic review of material entered into a student's cumulative record; moderation of test publishers' oversell; and working together to put standardized testing back into context.

        "description":"This paper introduces a model for describing outliers (observations which are extreme in some sense or violate the apparent pattern of other observations) in linear regression which can be viewed as a mixture of a quadratic and a linear regression. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters in the model are derived and their asymptotic properties discussed. Small sample behavior of the model and robustness to inaccurate specification of the mixing parameter were investigated using Monte Carlo techniques. The asymptotic properties provide reasonable indications of behavior for n as small as 21 and the procedure appears quite robust to the inaccurate specification of the mixing parameter. Building models to describe outliers and estimating their parameters provides an  interesting alternative to procedures of outlier detection followed by ordinary least squares procedures. (Author)",

The project focused on the need for raising the level of professional competence of school personnel in predominantly black, rural school districts, with the hope that the quality of education would be improved and desegregation facilitated. In addition, improvement of race relations was a specific objective. The summer institute program included lectures and seminars. The program was evaluated by pretest-posttest measures; the data show that the institute was effective in bringing about and maintaining positive attitudes towards integration for the total  group of participants.

Concerned school superintendents, authorities in behavioral science research, government officials, political leaders, and school board members discussed the rationale for attempting to solve racial problems in education and ways in which integration might be accomplished. The dialogue centered around research support, legal requirements, and social, political strategies. This account of the proceedings is presented in the form of representative excerpts from the comments and papers given at the conference.

The first was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in terms of the change occurring in the participants as perceived by the participants themselves. This was done by a pre- and post-program questionnaire. The second evaluation technique was intended to measure the success of the Institute in terms of the action produced at the back-home level. This was done by asking the participants to plan and reduce to writing action programs for their local school systems prior to leaving the program. The participants were then called back to evaluate the progress of the action plans. The report concludes that the greatest change occurred  in knowledge of procedures, while less change in racial attitudes occurred. However, favorable attitudes towards desegregated education increased. As for the action-plan evaluation, exactly how many actually made headway is not noted.

The question thus remains as to whether it is rational (or humane) to attempt to teach a child who is hungry, ill, or, tired. If not, then health and nutritional programs should be instituted as the one sensible course of action, and not merely because they may be based on scientific research findings.

This racism has created an environment which hinders the learning capacity of all children, even those with special family resources. Similarly, this racism has made it impossible for children to obtain the health services vital to their survival, growth, and development. Removal of external handicaps to the family and support of internal strengths through federally sponsored and financed programs acceptable to and designed by these families is of the highest priority. Programs that deal with discrimination in employment and lack of access to financial resources should take priority over  currently popularized programs. The greatest injustice to children can be found in government failure to provide wholesome physical environments and services.

Some of the techniques suggested include role playing for students, sensitivity sessions for teachers, and diagnosis of school sentiment through the use of questionnaires. The reviewers suggest that discussion of basic issues might enhance educators' understanding of the problems involved in school desegregation. Also discussed are organizational strategies for planning desegregation such as pairing, school closing, open enrollment, and educational parks. In conclusion, the reviewers  note that the requirement for the proper utilization of the ideas in \"Planning Educational Change\" is a commitment to work toward the achievement of a racially integrated society.

More than 200 \"black\" periodicals work hard at forming, leading, and interpreting for black communities. No black community is totally dependent upon the standard white-owned and majority oriented press for information basic to the forming of public attitudes towards education and desegregation. Lack of familiarity with black newspapers may be because most are published virtually unnoticed and are relatively amateurish. Also, dubious but often unchallenged social theories support the educator's avoidance of the local black press. There are many reasons why an educator might read a black newspaper with some regularity.  He may gain insight into what black leaders say to the black community and how the black community really places them in its constellation of influences. Also, what does the community value, and how does it value his activities? Thus, judicious reading of the black press may broaden the dimensions of his understanding of the black community without spending a fortune on another resented study. (Author/JM)",

Title I programs for disadvantaged pupils are examined in addition by  interested parents' and citizens' committees, and by research scientists who specialize in learning problems of disadvantaged children and youth.

The acquisition of teaching skills allows the parents to focus their efforts. The use of positive verbal reinforcement was selected as the skill parents would be helped to acquire. The research was conducted in three phases. The first was designed to determine if the literature that described the use of reinforcement by parents was accurate for both middle class mothers and for the target population of lower class mothers. During this phase the learning strategies most helpful to parents to learn reinforcement skills were developed. During phase two, one parent was worked  with for 15 weeks using the strategies developed in phase one. Phase three consisted of working with six mothers using the same design as that of phase two, in order to evaluate whether the reinforcement skills training program had similar effects on other parents. New strategies were developed as these became necessary. Although a considerable amount of responsibility is given the parent in this program, no diminishing of education or accountability is implied. (Author/JM)",

Several tentative general conclusions emerge. The number of black teachers being hired to fill vacancies or new positions is declining in proportion to the number of whites hired. Nonhiring is a form of displacement as serious as dismissal and demotion. Displacement is more widespread in small towns and rural areas than in metropolitan centers; in sections with a medium-to-heavy concentration of black citizens than in predominately white areas; and in  the Deep South than in the Upper South. Finally, demotion of black principals and teachers is more prevalent than outright dismissal. The irony of displacement is that it has followed compliance with Federal laws designed to end discrimination. In the South in recent years, displacement of black professionals, and the diminishing of positions, pay, and prestige have accompanied each newly desegregated school despite legal decisions, the &quot;equal protection&quot; clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and HEW guidelines.

More specifically, the paper focuses on the problems of the infant and young child in the 21st century urban environment. The essay is broken down into three categories: (1) the immediate environment (the infant's crib and bath facilities; toys; playrooms; etc.); (2) the orbital environment (the immediate environment in relation to all other needs--health services, schools, etc.); and (3) the orbital environment as an extended family (a general category including the child's environment and its implications for the parents). Most of the essay deals with the immediate  environment. Several specific problems of infants and young children in urban centers in the future are brought up. It is pointed out that technology often outstrips the ability to ask relevant questions from it. (Author/JW)",

It is not a voucher plan that is suggested; new kinds of public schools are called for. In a plea for a new approach to educational decision making which involves direct participation by all concerned parties of interest--parents, students, teachers, administrators--it is deemed necessary to open up the  structure of public education to a whole new range of ideas. Several programs already in existence are discussed--such as a community-centered school, a school without walls, and an academic prep school. (JW)",

After 125 program days, analyses of covariance of posttest scores (taking pretest scores as covariates) on the Slosson Intelligence Test, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS) revealed significant differences favoring the Center Group on the first two  measures. Nonsignificance on the VSMS appeared to be artifactual. The results demonstrate the feasibility and merits of compensatory education with disadvantaged infants in a school setting.

The in-school Youth Service Corps enrollment during the Winter-Spring Program 1968-69 included 134 boys between 14 and 18 years. Although corpsmen lived in the police precincts with high rates of juvenile crime, the number of recorded contacts for violations during the YSC enrollment is extremely low. It is recommended that, in the 14 to 16 age groups, the  program should continue in the accepted and effective summer &quot;out-of-school&quot; operation.

Home environmental measures were obtained by means of a 70 minute interview with the mother. Differences between means for the high verbal boys as compared with low verbal boys revealed that high verbal boys were from homes where parents have a higher interaction index, higher academic and vocational aspirations, provided more opportunities for the use and development of language, and higher occupational status. The variable &quot;opportunities for the use and development of language&quot; was the best predictor of verbal ability for  the pooled sample. Inclusion of the occupational level of parents as a second predictor significantly increased predictability of verbal scores. Findings of the study are considered to contribute to understanding the interactive process between environment and heredity, and enhance the ability to maximize the environmental influence for the improvement of deficit skills.

Although this has remained the goal of Project GAIN, through the years various facets of the program have been considered less than stable; a thorough and competent evaluation has been very difficult to achieve. The authors of the 1969-70 evaluation conclude from their data that Project GAIN was not a success this year. Further, some reasons for questioning the positive trends in the past have been put forth. These trends  have usually been due to interactions between schools and treatment (differential effects) and may well have reflected mere artifacts. Many associated with the project can point to individual pupils whom they believe have profited from the GAIN program. However, in terms of outcomes for groups of students rather than for individual cases, the program is considered to have little, if any, effect. (Author/JW)",

The school provides a specially designed, in-school compensatory program, which views the child as an individual. Markham School is nongraded and emphasizes team teaching approaches. Children enter the school at age five and progress at their own rate. The individualized program has as its core a phased or sequential structure for mastering skills in communication and mathematics; other subjects are taught via the unit method. In addition, there are tutoring services and extended day programs for the students. A vital link to community activities is the school's evening classes in adult education. In the first evaluation of the Markham School (1967-68), a local  achievement test was created in order to identify and measure development; the results indicate that the Markham students were on par with the control students. This evaluation, however, did not provide adequate controls for differences in socioeconomic status. The 1968-69 evaluation concluded tentatively that the Markham children were, on the whole, more disadvantaged in terms of home conditions than the control subjects. In addition, several of the tests used were found inadequate. The 1969-70 report concludes that Markham students were, on the average, more disadvantaged than control subjects. However, the relative average achievement of these Markham students appeared to be higher than that of their controls. (Author/JW)",

The research design included three experimental WW classrooms and two control classrooms for grades 1 and 2; the five classrooms were all in ESEA Title I schools. Although all classrooms were in disadvantaged neighborhoods, one classooom was integrated--black, white, and Mexican-American. Objectives of the program were: (1) to discover  a difference, if any, in the rate of mental, academic, and personal-social development on WW students and the control students; (2) to determine if WW students continue to progress at a different rate; and (3) to determine if there is any tansfer of skills learned through in the program to other skills in the future. The subjects were given standardized pretests and posttests in mental ability, achievement, and personal-social growth. In addition, observations of paired students were arranged. WW students were found to have progressed significantly better in mental and academic development; skills learned in the workshop were transferred. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"This is an evaluation report of ESEA Title I programs in St. Louis, Missouri which maintains that despite the decline in funds, St. Louis' Title I children held their own. In 1970, these students scored about two months higher on achievement tests than they had in 1966. The fact that Title I students are not losing ground is considered a significant achievement. Each report included in this evaluation has two sections. The &quot;Program Summary&quot; section describes the objectives of the program and its basic procedures for achieving the objectives; it also summarizes the evaluation. The second section, the &quot;Monitor's Report,&quot; is intended for readers with more interest in the details of the evaluation; it views the problems and progress of the project against the backdrop of the previous  year's evaluation, and projects new priorities for the coming year. Some of the programs include: (1) addition of remedial teachers to elementary schools; (2) setting up multi-media study-learning resource centers; (3) making available cheap cold lunches; and, (4) opening of Lincoln Opportunity High School for students suspended from regular high school programs. [Because of the contrast on a few pages of the original document, information about the contact, number of participants, time, staff, and cost of the program given on these pages may not be as clearly legible as the rest of the document.] (Editor/JW)",

The program was evaluated in three categories: East Side Cluster Service, summer enrichment, and educational programs. The major evaluation objectives were to determine whether participants in the education program continued their education and/or became successfully employed; and whether the participants exhibited self-confidence to achieve in educational settings. Methods of evaluation included information from interviews, school and employee records, and questionnaires. Over 78 percent of those who graduated from both phases of the Academy Program and 64 percent of those who left the Academy prior  to graduation either continued their education and/or became successfully employed. The students tended to exhibit some hopelessness with regard to their futures, but in general saw education as valuable, and the Academy as a place where they were accepted by persons in whom they had confidence. The report concludes that the educational phases of the Street Academy are in accord with goals at a level far above what one would expect. (Author/JW)",

Suitable alternates to existing school admissions criteria would stop defining students in terms of deficiencies, instead focusing upon the positive aspects of each student's experiences and integrating them into the curriculum. Further, admissions standards would be free of any taint of middle-class superiority. They would genuinely accept cultural diversity, building upon positive elements in the community involved. They would respect the community's unique aspirations, priorities, and values and would make the resources of the university available to minority individuals and communities,  assisting them to develop positive solutions to their particular problems. They would contain no \"a priori\" assumptions about what skills are necessary to meet the needs of those minority communities. The author states that compensatory education is wrong, both morally and practically--morally, because it destroys children and cultures for no justifiable reason, and practically, because it wastes the potential productivity of talented people who are alienated by an inadequate educational system.

Hall School is in a low income area of the city and nearly all children in the project were considered educationally disadvantaged. First year evaluation results show that students in the program made gains in mathematics equal to gains made by average students throughout the nation. When compared with students who were also below average in mathematics achievement, the Hall School students made better than expected gains. IPI students also made greater gains in mathematics than did students in three comparable Title I schools which were not on the IPI program. It was estimated that from 15 to 30 percent  of the standardized test items were not related to the IPI curriculum and that as much as 75 percent of the IPI curriculum was not measured by these standardized tests. Reactions of teachers and teacher aides to the IPI project were generally favorable. Student preferences for mathematics rose. In grades two and three, mathematics was preferred over all other subjects including gymnasium and art, two subjects which initially had higher preferences. (Author/JM)",

It includes a summary of intervention projects and survey of present knowledge and theory about language which constitute the rationale for such projects. Specific recommendations are made for the application of the findings in broader educational contexts. Although many educators agree that language is one specific area in which disadvantaged children need to catch up, they often disagree on the nature, importance, and antecedents of these deficiencies in language. The paper includes discussion of alternative views of language, methods of language assessment (language production, comprehension assessment,  and standardized testing), a selective review of subcultural language differences, and a review of language intervention research (Project Head Start, Bereiter-Engelmann Program, etc.). In addition, the authors recommend specific educational practices. (Authors/JW)",

The students were not graded, had no dress codes and few &quot;rules&quot;; in return they had to find their classrooms, their curriculum, and in some cases their teachers from among the plentiful resources of their urban community. The Program was given  the task of trying to integrate school children with the life of the community, a life which under normal conditions they were not expected to enter until leaving school behind them--for although schools are supposed to prepare students for a life in the community, most schools so isolate students from the community that a functional understanding of how it works is considered impossible.

Middle socioeconomic status adults aged 30-55 and comprising samples of 100 each in the Bronx and Harlem were interviewed; most respondents were born in the South but had been living in New York for many years. The groups were somewhat different demographically, that from Harlem being slightly higher in financial and educational attainment. Relating to employment, housing, and schools, data for both groups showed a firm commitment to integration; in the area of close personal primary group social relationships, however, there was a desire for  contacts on a single race basis almost exclusively. Responses showed a great awareness of current racial problems but little activity in civil-rights groups. In the acceptance level of whites by Negroes, there was a downhill trend verbalized relating to the past five years. The study findings are considered to indicate a shift in goals from the integrationist views current in 1957; both lower-class and middle-class Negroes displayed a pride in being black and a strong wish to maintain an ethnic identity. A system of cultural pluralism, a pattern held to be already in force with most other groups, is contended to be the goal orientation of blacks. (Author/RJ)",

Participants at the conference were administrators, teachers, aides, and parents who met in small-group work sessions. The conference is judged to have succeeded in stimulating exchanges of ideas and self-examination. In addition, several key concepts are considered to have merged as continuous themes, which should be, it is held, taken into consideration in the design of any ESEA Title I program of compensatory education: (1) basic academic skills, with an emphasis on reading and language arts, must be the focus of Title I programs; (2) the trend in compensatory education programs for the disadvantaged  is toward prevention of problems rather than remediation of long-entrenched problems; (3) a comprehensive assessment of the needs of the disadvantaged is essential in preparing Title I projects; (4) the key to meaningful evaluation is in the statement of the project's objectives; and (5) evaluation instruments to be used to measure the effects of the project should be expressly and specifically related to the stated objectives and activities of a project.

Attention is focused on youth, public schools, and Milwaukee Voluntary Equal Employment Opportunity Council firms; ideas that blacks and whites have about themselves and each other are explored. The major hypothesis is that educators, social scientists, and businessmen will conceptualize racial problems in a way that: (1) makes blacks responsible for their inferior and disenfranchised position in society; and (2) leads to the proposal of &quot;solutions&quot; to social problems that cannot possibly be implemented and has no  relationship to existing institutions. Chapter II provides a general description of Milwaukee and a detailed account of employment and educational problems of blacks. Chapter III discusses the problems of the study and hypotheses developed. Chapter IV describes the design and methodology of the study. Chapter V and VI report on the barriers to equal employment opportunities. Chapter VII describes the effort to develop a plausible educational alternative that confronts barriers to employment.

In this evaluation, METCO and non-random control children were tested close to the beginning and the end of the academic year, a unique feature of this evaluation being the use of siblings of the bused children as the control group; each control child selected was matched as closely as possible on age. With the exception that METCO children gained significantly less than the siblings on mathematics achievement at grade 5-6, there are no significant differences in  performance between the two groups from grade 2-12. On a measure of the social environment of the classroom given at grades 3-4 and 5-6, the METCO children perceived their classes as more satisfying; METCO children in grades 5-6 also saw their classes as less difficult and competitive, and as having less friction. The evaluation concludes that school busing programs are a small step in the right direction, but may be doing too little too late. (Author/JW)",

Four hundred and twenty-one black high school and junior high school students in a suburban-city school system were arbitrarily and without fanfare moved up to the next higher ability group while 384 comparable students were retained in their assigned groups as controls. Of those moved up, 54 percent were subsequently recommended by their teachers for the higher group as compared to one percent of the controls. Experimentals also achieved higher scores on standardized achievement tests. Thus, grouping assignment was shown to affect teacher expectations and student performance. (Author/JM)",

Initially very selective, the program subsequently reduced academic admission standards; most recent students have non-academic backgrounds with demonstrably poorer graduation rates. One-third of entering students graduated from community college, and two-thirds withdrew; nearly all graduates continued at senior college and most graduated. Most drop-outs took clerical or other jobs and many continued in evening classes but generally did not graduate from community college, despite high educational and occupational aspirations. They  withdrew because of motivational, family, personal, and financial problems or unsatisfactory college placement; they studied much less than survivors. Early college performance was considerably improved for students taking half the normal credit load and two remedial courses. (Authors/JM)",

Self-concept measures were collected on 323 deprived mothers and their children. Canonical and factor analyses indicated that self-concept measures of mothers are related to self-concept measures of their children; and that beginning of school year self-concept measures of mothers are related to change scores of their children over the school year. The latter relationship appears to have  practical as well as statistical significance. Prior research suggests that even in relatively standardized achievement data the correlation between status and growth appears to be about 0.10. Hence the figure of 0.307 between status and growth appears substantial. (Authors/JM)",

A total of 87 teachers took part. A questionnaire was developed and administered. In addition, data were collected from the summaries of Title I programs submitted by the local district to the Michigan State Department of Education. Analysis of the data suggested the following. Teachers perceived themselves as having a small part in the preparation of the Title I proposal in their districts. Approximately three-fourths of the teachers were unable to identify the person or persons responsible for determining the goals of the Title  I programs in their districts. Teacher knowledge of the goals of the Title I program by grade level varied by groups. However, approximately one-half of the total sample did not know the goals for their own grade level. A majority of the teachers in the sample stated they had not changed their classroom teaching methods because of the Title I program in their district. A former Title I program in a school district is not financed locally if Federal funds are withdrawn. (Author/JM)",

Sixteen years after the Supreme Court (in Brown vs Topeka) had ruled that school segregation compelled or sanctioned by law unconstitutional, there is still no widespread understanding of the nature and scope of the issues. The Civil Rights Commission believes that public understanding of the issues involved in school desegregation is essential if they are to be resolved satisfactorily. Many of these issues are legal in nature and require careful analysis of relevant court decisions. Other issues involve practical questions concerning the quality of education afforded  to the Nation's children. Still others relate to fundamental human and moral questions of national conscience. The Commission speaks out in the hope that it can shed light on the issues and, by so doing, contribute to their successful resolution. The issue of school desegregation, like other issues of national concern, has roots deep in history; to understand fully the present situation and to form a sound basis for determining courses of action for the future, what that history has been must first be understood.

        "description":"The Yale Summer High School (YSHS) is an experimental program addressed to the development of high-potential, underachieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the intervention, an experimental design including random selection of samples, two control groups (one matched for a test of generalization, and the other not so matched), and two year follow-up procedures were instituted. The initial testing of all groups included personality, intellectual, and background factors. Thefollow-up involved school performance, college attendance, and other plans. The major results were as follows: the matched control group demonstrated similar career patterns to the YSHS; and the non-matched group attended college less often, going on to  technical school, work, and military service. The experimental design and long term evaluation is considered to lead to the following conclusions: (1) there were no appreciable differences between the experimental and matched control groups; (2) utilization of only the non-matched though highly selected group would have led to an over-estimation of the effectiveness of the YSHS program; and, (3) since equally outstanding students did as well as those who attended, such programs might better address themselves to the students who have been ignored by the local public schools and who might be the greatest beneficiaries of innovative educational endeavors.

In order to evaluate the program, 240 interviews were held with students, teachers, teacher aides, work supervisors, project coordinators, and district general administrators. Reactions by all groups were enthusiastic, with the major complaints involving the need for expansion of the program. There was general agreement that this program was better than either of the two previous programs, despite a drop in enrollment. Recommendations were made for: (1) providing ongoing programs, (2) early funding to assure effective planning, (3) relaxing age requirements, (4) extending programs to reach all high school students, (5) improving communications between districts, (6) extending  the work portion of the program to commercial organizations, and (7) holding a conference to plan a continuing year-round program.

Data were obtained by a series of questionnaires which had been completed at entrance to the program, upon graduation, and 1 year and 5 years after graduation. Though data from previous surveys are summarized, the main portion of the report concerns the findings 5 years after graduation. Age, marital status, and number of children were found to be closely related to the working status of those respondents who remained in the work force after 5 years. It would appear that the younger participants were  at entrance, the more likely they were to withdraw from the work force during the 5 years after graduation. Family income reported by entering students was statistically related to working status, with the youngest group at entrance coming from families with higher incomes. The social index and working status of the husband were also related to the wife's employment. Recommendations are provided, and a discussion of the methodology and sample questionnaire are appended.

The conferences generally agreed that vocational education needs more power and money, and that its relationships with industry, general education, and other training programs for the disadvantaged should be strengthened.

Several other conclusions were reached plus five recommendations, one of which states that the findings of this study should be closely  examined by all program personnel.

These 1967 interviews provide data on the magnitude and patterns of changes in educational and employment status during the 12 months following the first round of interviews. The data suggest that family income and other measures of socioeconomic status have a large effect on the decision to remain in school or return after dropping out, especially for the transition from high school to college. During the period between interviews, labor force participation increased substantially, with a moderate reduction in susceptibility to unemployment, measured while holding demand conditions constant. The large number of job changes occurring among the  cohort are consistant with previous studies of entry workers. Noting that these shifts diminish with age within the cohort, the study concludes that these early adjustments contribute to employment stability. The first report is available as MP 000 718.

It was thus demonstrated that the model provides a generalizable procedure that can be applied to all labor markets in the State. The study integrates theories and concepts from the fields of vocational education, operations research, educational administration, and mathematical economics. The generalizability of the model is also enhanced by the fact that the administration of vocational education programs  in every state must follow the regulations set forth in the guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Education.

The 10 procedural phases of the model were developed over a 2-year period in cooperation with a comprehensive high school, although the basic model is flexible enough for use at many levels such as the state guidance system or local school systems. Each phase is independent, allowing the  adoption of the combination best suited to individual needs. A revised model will be published following extensive field testing. (BH)",

Results of the conference were favorable for all three areas.

The continuing flow of federal funds and the greater program flexibility under the Vocational Education Act of 1963, together with increased state and local expenditures, made possible expansion of ongoing programs and development of some needed new programs. However, despite notable progress, there are many population groups and areas which vocational education is either not serving or not serving adequately. As manpower requirements and the vocational education needs of people continue to change rapidly, vocational education should be made more flexible, innovative, and relevant. Increased resources and effective leadership are urgently needed at  the local, state, and federal levels to establish a comprehensive, responsive system of occupational education which will help provide adequate educational opportunity for all youths and adults in every community.

To facilitate the needed change and to achieve maximum results in meeting individual and manpower needs, a workable model of research, developmental, and exemplary activity must be employed. This, in turn, can be followed by the use of a master plan for the implementation of new programs. Priority areas identified for research and developmental  activities are: (1) K-14 coordination and articulation, (2) educational programs in all occupational areas, (3) programs for the disadvantaged and handicapped students, (4) inservice training to update instructors, and (5) comprehensive evaluative techniques for the programs offered.

The 16 enrollees were recruited among staff and volunteers of Chicago Heights agencies and organizations, most were middle-aged, worked at least part time, and had family responsibilities. Evaluation was performed by the students through questionnaires and informal discussions, the instructors, agency directors, and others. Low attrition and high attendance rates as well as positive evaluation by students contributed to course success. It was  concluded that testing an innovative curriculum requires teachers who understand and agree with the method of creating that curriculum.

Questionnaires, which were derived from a task analysis inventory and sent to over 500 students, were returned by 367 and provided information on the course taken and the time, nature, and area of employment. Most of the students worked full time, and the largest employment areas were within schools, primarily paraprofessional positions, and factory jobs. These were followed by business, social service, and medical positions. In addition large numbers of students responded that they had  performed the tasks presented, but many students felt that the courses did not help them perform the activities. The findings revealed that the curriculum as offered did not fully achieve the core curriculum goal and design. Results further show the need for course modification and precourse orientation of the instructors.

Our society is no longer in the industrial era but rather in the post-industrial era which is characterized by pressing social problems. Solutions must be found for the problems of pollution, power generation, housing, transportation, communication, conservation, more effective resource utilization and industrial productivity. The role industrial arts can play in these areas of concern is not one of finding solutions but rather one of educating the citizenry to be aware of the implications of these problems. There is no doubt about the extent of our technological know-how; the question is how to reduce the ever-widening gap between the technologist and the great masses of people who use or must make  decisions about the application, acceptance, or rejection of the technology. This proposal outlines a system of study for the senior high school that will educate citizens to make intelligent decisions concerning the future application of our great wealth of technological know-how.

A questionnaire was administered to 365 senior girls from six vocational, comprehensive, and general academic schools in Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. Questions were included on work attitudes, work knowledge, and personal and family characteristics. Analysis of variance and an intercorrelation matrix were used to determine interrelationships between variables. The results show that social status and community size have positive effects on knowledge and negative effects on  plans for full time work. Vocational school girls showed more interest in financial rewards of work and in early marriage than did graduates of other types of schools. Recommendations for further research and for possible changes in educational programs are made. The findings of this study will be used to develop a curriculum unit, &quot;Planning Ahead for the World of Work,&quot; designed to assist girls in preparing more adequately for their probable futures.

Structured at three levels of learning, course content at the 10th grade consists of general concepts and treatment of political, social, and cultural problems in diverse societies, while the 11th grade limits the study of concept and treatment to a specific society and the 12th grade to the individual's role in that society. During the first year (1968-69) of implementation, several problems hampered the introduction of the instructional materials which  necessitated revisions in subsequent materials. It was also found that in order to objectively evaluate the materials, special criterion measures or appraisal techniques were needed. Other recommendations were that materials should be evaluated against stated learning objectives, student population should be altered to a size permitting validation of the materials, and the format of the units should be changed to provide more variety of instructional media.

To gather the needed data, various subsets of eight tasks from a battery of 64 typing tasks were administered to 3,134 typists. This data, in turn, provided equations for estimating the difficulty of office-typing tasks and for constructing typing tasks at specified levels of difficulty. The difficulty indexes resulting from the equations permit the eventual establishment of standards and norms for trainees and job-applicants. It was discovered that the correlational data on intelligence in relation  to typing proficiency support the standard practice of offering beginning typewriting to all persons, but leave uncertain the propriety of offering advanced instruction to low ability students. Finally, low relationships between straight copy and office-typing proficiency confirm the desirability of reducing the conventional heavy focus on ordinary stroking skills and of increasing attention to realistic office-typing tasks. Decision processes applicable to the layout of such tasks on the page should also be emphasized. (Author/JS)",

The author also indicates how grading practices can be and are being altered to provide an educational tool that accurately reflects the many dimensions of student performance. It is noted that grades seem unnecessary for many of the administrative purposes within an institution, other than as an indicator that a certain course has been passed by a student. Furthermore, selection for academic awards, honor programs or special classes could be based on faculty nominations supplemented by evaluative information provided by the faculty. It is concluded that more varied and effective grading procedures are available; however, that they are seldom  employed may be caused by the uncertainty over what is really wanted of grades. In light of this, the components and structure of grades need closer scrutiny so that the issues raised by the grading process--involving, as they do, all levels of society--can be dealt with.

The Commissioner envisions the Federal role in education to be one of increasing the effectiveness of the human and financial resources of our schools, colleges and universities. The Federal role in education will greatly increase technical assistance to states and local school systems to insure better ways to teach and learn. The report discusses the wide variety of means employed in FY70 to aid the disadvantaged. In the area of management reform the report develops a nationwide strategy for maintaining a continuous process of improvement and relevance in American education. Decentralization and  regionalization plans for education are advanced. The unfinished and ongoing educational programs which enjoy Federal support are covered.

In addition, they examine the role of the managerial scholars who are in the positions of leadership since they believe this role is vital to organizational success. The data for the investigations has been derived chiefly from the schools of education. There are four reasons for this choice: (1) The study of education includes all the behavioral sciences. (2) Education requires the integration of service and scholarship within the university which needs to be studied widely by researchers. (3) Graduate schools of education have taken great pains in the past decade to  improve their research establishment. (4) It is possible to achieve a unique historical perspective to the problems of university research organizations since there has been a long and well documented history of educational research agencies in the university.

A &quot;45-15 Plan&quot; provides for each pupil forty-five days of instruction and fifteen equivalent days of vacation. With the cycle repeated four times each year, one-fourth of the pupils are on vacation at any one time. The experience has shown that there are three main problems to be solved in undertaking such a plan. These are: student scheduling, teacher scheduling, and winning community support. The most difficult of these is student scheduling, but this problem can be eased considerably by the use of individualized instruction and by having as large an enrollment as possible in each school. Attached are appendices including instruments  used in the study and questionnaires used among concerned participants. (DAS)",

Public and private placement services are also offered. TRANSITION gives priority to the combat disabled, persons ineligible to reenlist, those without civilian job experience or skills, and those needing basic or high school equivalency education. The military establishment cooperates with business, industry, labor, and all levels of government (Federal, state, local) to provide on or off base on the job training or other educational services. Specific course offerings depend on  resources made available by the public and private sectors (including educational institutions). Of about 400,000 men surveyed during 1968, about 83% received counseling. About 35% of servicemen indicating a desire for training actually began, but the completion rate was 93%. Thus far, despite operating problems in such areas as funds, staffing, counseling, followup, and determination of target groups, the program has generally met its educational and skill development objectives. Britain, Israel, West Germany, and Canada have somewhat similar programs. (LY)",

Data were gathered through a  socioeconomic survey of rural household heads on the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia in 1970. The years of school completed by the respondent which was a measure of achievement in the sequential-unit system, and the educational level of the wife which represented the quality of education available in the family-educational system, were the variables showing the strongest influence on participation. The education of the father, did not show such a strong influence on participation. (NL)",

The sample comprised women from metropolitan St. Louis and nine rural areas in Northern Missouri. The typical participant was married; was a high school graduate; had 2.8 children; had participated in informal education; and was employed. The participants' mean score on the English examination was 462, as compared with a mean of 506 for 1189 freshmen and 516 for 1207 sophomore women. The women's performance on the Natural Science examination was the poorest of the three. The mean score for the total group of 319 was 409, representing about the 32nd. percentile for freshmen and the 25th. percentile for sophomores. Only 304 scores were  available for the Social Sciences Examination. Scaled scores for these women ranged from 289 to 687, with a mean of 451, as compared with a mean of 463 for 277 freshmen and 481 for 297 sophomores. This was the only examination of which the mean score for women did not differ significantly from those for freshmen and sophomores. (Author/NL)",

With the use of correlation analysis and regression technique, the authors analyzed the total socioeconomic and political framework of citizen attitudes influenced by social-psychological factors, and specific factors such as age, education, and anticipated rise in income. Governmental orientation emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor. Attitude toward the park objectives and formal education also showed a significant relationship. Implications are drawn relating the findings of  the study to involvement between federal agencies and local people in a planning situation. Especially significant to successful joint planning are the perceptions that residents have of social, economic, and political issues associated with community improvement. (Author/NL)",

The study revealed a significant need for job-related adult education, which is not now being met. Few programs provide vigorous outreach, placement in a job or a skill training program, and post-instructional student followup. Program features were found here and there which could be combined into an effective job-related ABE program. Funds now exist which could be allocated to support these programs. (Author/EB)",

The volunteers would offer an ABE class in a private home once a week with the help of the teacher--using materials prepared by the teacher aides. Continuous inservice training would be given to both aides and volunteers by certified teachers and consultants. A followup study was conducted in November, 1970, to ascertain that student needs were being met adequately. The overall  response to the Homebound Program was favorable.

Six certified teachers and consultants serving as team leaders assisted the teacher aides and volunteers as needed, and designed the instructional material. Twelve teacher aides recruited students, and prepared and taught material devised by the teachers. Volunteers held classes in private homes one or two evenings a week with a teacher as support. The aides and some of the volunteers received two hours of daily continuing inservice training from the teachers and consultants. While  instruction in ABE was individualized insofar as possible, the average student received either two and a half or five hours weekly, chiefly in communication and computational skills. Efforts were continuing to bring more students into neighborhood classes. Results thus far have shown the need for (and acceptance of) ABE home classes; successful use of volunteers; active minority group participation as volunteers and teachers as well as students; and the effectiveness of the project's overall teaching team structure.

Le Breton's Planning-Implementation Model was used to make a critical analysis of the Bureau's actual programs in the communities. The analysis showed that the main thrust of the Bureau's process was effective. Problem areas included: problems of the current program--implementation and evaluation; organizational problems--budget, professional ambition, and  location in the university; and problems of philosophy and objectives--basic philosophy, objectives, defining the community, and best use of resources.

(Speed of promotion and number of yearly publications were chosen as achievement criteria.) Interviews, test scores, and physiological measurements (including cholesterol readings) were used to collect data from 25 assistant, 25 associate, 46 full professors, and 18 academic administrators at the University of Michigan. Motivation was measured in a projective test involving storytelling, and through a rating scale. Although the exact psychological correlates of bodily processes involving uric acid still  defy precise analysis, findings did confirm a relationship between achievement orientation (such traits as drive, self-confidence, and attitude toward pressure) and respondents' serum urate levels. High scholarly productivity was relatively dependent on personal drive, while speed of promotion depended more on decisions by others. Thus, it also appears, that different criteria of success prevail at different levels of the academic hierarchy. (LY)",

Systematic program evaluation is needed so that scarce human and financial resources can be used effectively without needless duplication of past efforts and mistakes. The work oriented literacy project launched at Mwanza in 1967 is presently the only place in Tanzania where large scale evaluation of adult education activities is occurring. However, the Institute of Adult Education at the University of Dar es Salaam has begun evaluating the operation of the &quot;Uchaguzi ni wako&quot; radio citizen education study groups, together with provisions for adult educator training and the  problems these educators encounter in the field. Irregular attendance and high dropout rates are a major weakness in literacy teacher training programs; failure of adult education in general to attract youth is another problem. There is evidence that adult education can be most easily organized within a framework of existing village systems and social relationships; and that literacy education is not necessarily a prerequisite for rural adult education.

        "description":"A study was made to determine how many university level adult educators are likely to be needed by the organizations involved in adult education in Tanzania, and to determine the type of training desired by these organizations. Heads of 38 of the organizations were interviewed. It was found that the organizations are willing to release and sponsor many candidates for the diploma course or to hire larger numbers of personnel in the future trained at the current diploma level. Several employers wanted their adult educators to have some practical skills as well; several wanted a Mature Age Entry candidate who then had the specific training in adult education. Each organization wanted its people trained in a combination of subjects that might include some radio, some methods, some  planning and administration, or some evaluation. Education in Tanzania was desired by those organizations needing personnel. It is clear that there may be a need for B.A. level adult educators in the next five to ten years; but there is need to think seriously about alternatives to the university setting for adult educators who will work in rural socialist development.

Adult education activities should be organized around skills which are reinforcing in their own right, such as masonry, mechanics, carpentry, or vegetable growing, and with immediate use in the post-training environment. Literacy teaching should be a follow-up and not a first step. Initially all teaching of illiterates should be by auditory means; having got the people involved in the learning process, literacy can be introduced gradually, by pointing out its facilitative effect; and to maintain the reading ability, a good supply of carefully selected material should be made available. More emphasis should be made to reach as many people as possible, especially in  the rural areas so that Tanzania Socialism can be made a reality. (Author/EB)",

In an effort to trace the chain of communication, 180 people were interviewed as to the product and its use, how the need arose, internal and external information sources, the choice of a particular type of product, and factors (including the supplier's role) in the choice of the successful supplier.

Using questionnaires completed by 774 agents, the study obtained background data and investigated economic perceptions (cost effectiveness) of an advanced degree, personal factors seen as influencing degree decisions, and attitudes toward the influence of administrative superiors. Relevant factors included improved competence, prestige, formal study difficulties, economic gain and sacrifice, better job opportunities, \"revitalization\" leave, accessibility of graduate school, and support by peers and supervisors. Agents without advanced degrees related decisions positively to administrator persuasion, better job opportunities, and improved competence; negatively, to economic  sacrifice and formal school difficulty. Agents with advanced degrees stressed competence and job opportunities. Younger agents noted many concerns, while older agents responded only to administrator persuasion. Based on these and other findings, several conclusions were reached: the kind of decision making described is complex; adult education administrators can and do influence such decisions; adult educators measure the cost effectiveness of advanced degrees quite accurately and are influenced thereby; and they seem to treat their decision as basically an individual problem.

It was planned that participants should complete an attitude scale covering orientations (research, service, teaching, objectives, judgment, degree of confidence) toward evaluation, then pursue a simulation exercise and other problem solving  activities. Intended instructional activities were largely carried out. The reported usefulness of a specially prepared instructional resource (the Evaluation Notebook) more than compensated, both during and after the workshop, for the lack of the preliminary activities originally planned; and the attitude scale was well received. Significant increases in knowledge, understanding, and application of the model were also noted, together with much participant satisfaction with outcomes. (LY)",

In a postscript, Harry L. Miller focuses on the implications of this proposal on a more particular level, the university. He suggests that there may be more than two sources for educational aims; the option seems to be that one can construct programs, about which no university person needs to be defensive, by changing and adapting the academic tradition not to clientele demand, but to some defensible theory of adult need. Perhaps organizational separateness needs to  be so; we should give organizational identity to the serious efforts to educate the public which are attempts neither to entertain nor to induct individuals into the society, which is the job of the undergraduate college.

The first gives an overview of institutional arrangements for adult education in colleges and universities, covering factors influencing growth, objectives, organizational structure and personnel, and clientele. In a section on program and methods, the growing concern for what is different about the teaching of adults and of undergraduates is discussed. Current problems include the peripheral aspect of adult education; increasing demands on faculties, space, and money; lack of endowment or government subsidy; and autonomy without accompanying integration into the university  complex. The second chapter describes the major existing liberal adult education programs -- the most common model, in which the curriculum of the undergraduate college program is duplicated (as at Rutgers University College); the type of program which emphasizes intellectual skills rather than the understanding of knowledge and principles (Basic Program of Liberal Education for Adults, developed by the University of Chicago's University College); and programs which provide a liberating experience (agricultural extension).

Seven steps in the HumRRO procedure for systematic curriculum engineering are identified: determining the performance required; deriving training objectives; basing training content on training objectives; selecting appropriate training methods; minimizing training interference with learning; monitoring the school-trained product; and modifying training as required. Procedures for identifying and sequencing curricular content and for generating curricular information have been discussed--a job model for use in creating listings of job tasks; functional  context principles for content integration; and hierarchical structures of technical concepts (use of a word-associational technique for hierarchical grouping of technical concepts). The use of a word association technique in a military radar maintenance course revealed that more research was needed before this approach could become an operational tool of curriculum designers.

Differing views of language teaching authorities and various experiments carried out to test the use of translation in foreign language teaching are presented briefly. The author's experiment, involving teaching two groups of third-grade children patterns of Malay sentences by means of a Language Master Machine on which were pictures corresponding to sentences on a tape strip, is also described. The results seem to show that the group that learned the second language in a situation where the first language was excluded except for the instructions (the &quot;Picture Group&quot;) actually showed the effects of a compound language system more markedly than the group that  practiced through the medium of L1 (the &quot;Translation Group&quot;). The writer proposes to investigate further the use of L1 in L2 teaching and learning and the problem of acquiring and retaining meaning. Her experience with many children has shown that often they can repeat sentences and read quite well without any inkling of what they are saying. She feels that teachers may be inhibiting a &quot;natural tendency&quot; to translate, which may bring about a conflict between subconscious translation and overt injunction to think in the L2, with disastrous results to the acquisition of meaning.

Subjects (145), Negro and white, male and female, were grouped in terms of high-, middle-, or low-intelligence using raw scores on a portion of the Kuhlmann-Anderson Intelligence Test. The subjects were then individually administered a 20-item adapted version of the Berko Morphology Test, with responses taped and transcribed in writing. Analysis of data included item and factor analysis of the adapted Berko Test, Multiple linear regression analysis, and non-statistical content analysis of test responses. Results of this study in a population controlled for socio-economic level, geographic distribution, and age-grade  level showed a significant relationship between morphological proficiency and intelligence and race. No significant relationship between language proficiency and sex was found. Implications suggest the need for additional refined test instruments for intelligence and language, appropriate for use with lower class rural, southern subjects, as well as a need for a descriptive linguistic study of adult speech in the rural south.

(Convergent communication is defined as communication in which two persons cooperatively exchange information in order to reach an explicitly stated goal and where, because neither person has sufficient information to solve the problem alone, cooperation and a convergence of information is necessary to reach a solution.) The communications of 48 child dyads and 25 adult dyads, which were observed during the performance of three convergent communication tasks were compared on various features of communication structure and content. Compared to child dyads, adult dyads more consistently marked the  organization of the communication and included more evidence of verbal cooperation and reclarification of encoded messages. Children's communications showed more variability in the inclusion of the identified structural features than did adult dyads. No differences in these features were observed in the communication of children from different socioeconomic, race, and sex subgroups. (Author/FWB)",

Its purpose was to examine for developmental differences in sentence processing systems expected by psycholinguistic theory and research. A group of 64 subjects, comprised of fifth graders and college students, were tested individually with 32 sentences of mixed types including active and passive transformations. Recall of both verbatim and synonymous sentences was scored. Results revealed various surface and deep structure differences in the recall patterns of children and adults, suggesting some differences in the factors governing their sentence productions.

        "description":"This paper notes the tendency among non-literate peoples such as the American Indians to lose their native language as the demands of modern technology increasingly push them towards literacy in a language which is not their own, and argues that literacy in the vernacular language may present such acculturation and language loss from going hand in hand. Relating this to the Navajo Indians, the author shows that, despite the relative ineffectiveness of English teaching programs, Navajo is steadily declining. Thus, although the resent Navajo Reading Study indicates that it is still the main language of Navajo-populated areas, Navajo continues to decline as more roads are built, as more children complete school, and as the Reservation is increasingly exposed to the outside world.  The author feels that the achievement of literacy in Navajo might prevent this shift to English. He believes that present programs directed at Navajo literacy may have a better chance than past ones because of the growing realization that teaching reading is easier in a child's strongest language as well as because of the community school movement, which includes the teaching of reading in Navajo as part of its program for community control of Navajo schools.

It was found from measures of response animateness that the selectional rules were followed for both subjects and objects, and verb classes defined for both together.

Video-tape can serve the demonstration and practice aspects of the methods course in unique ways by providing the language teacher with an \"invaluable\" means to (1) observe and analyze the teaching of others and (2) analyze his own classroom behavior. He can prepare his own demonstration films to suit his own curriculum; these films can be saved and indexed in a reference VT library at a rather small cost (a VT reel of about two hours playing time costs about $50.00). Demonstration tapes are used in primarily three ways: (1) as \"standard lessons; (2) for teaching techniques of classroom observation and analysis; and (3) for teaching application of  theory to procedures. Video-tapes may be used as an initial step in learning to analyze classroom behavior, e.g., isolating such elements as presentation of teaching points, different types and classes of drills, explication of grammar by analogy or by analysis. Evaluations by student-teachers agreed that watching themselves on VT \"definitely contributed to a sense of self-image and self-realization.\" Presented is the author's step-by-step \"Video-Tape Practice Teaching Cycle\" and a checklist for her observation and analysis report.

It is important to note that each of these evaluative measures has certain advantages and disadvantages. These should be kept in mind so that the measures can be used with maximum efficiency.

The appropriateness of model construction arises from the nature of reading as a cumulative process which can be divided into specific subskills and abilities. A basic concept is the ordinal nature of human development as opposed to normative concepts. Therefore, this theory rejects normative data such as IQ scores and grade level equivalents when diagnosing reading ability. Instruction which is individualized to the extent that it (1) proceeds from diagnosis of what the child can do, (2) observes  the hierarchical arrangement of reading skills, (3) matches these two procedures in order to control change, and (4) continues to diagnose in order to obtain optimum match can be said to be based on the structure process theory.

This is analogous to the gated and buffer-stored input of a digital computer and raises answerable questions as to how other sense-modalities are inputted--whether in series or parallel with visual input. Drawing analogies to other information-bearing systems, such as printed language, helps clarify certain issues. Just as printed language has a hierarchical structure with sets and elements of letters, words, and sentences (with the sizes of the sets increasing up the hierarchical  scale), so in the brain there must be an analogous hierarchy, with nerve spikes as the lowest set and the \"packages\" of discontinuous visual input as a higher level. The establishment of a discontinuous input model, with lucid alternatives of intermodality processing, leads to a computer-analogy model of behavior as a hierarchically structured chain of states which define acts.

Administrators, teachers, and school boards are anxious to improve their reading programs as part of the new national goal to end reading failures in America by 1980. The report is designed to give them answers to some of the most pertinent questions: What can schools do to improve their reading programs? What can superintendents, principals, and teachers do to help? How can high schools help their students read more effectively? What are some examples of successful preschool and elementary school programs? What are the lessons of reading research? To answer these questions such topics as  diagnosing the problem, choosing the teaching technique, surveying the school's needs, building the staff, bringing in the community, training teachers and specialists, and organizing the high school developmental reading program are discussed. An annotated list of reading resources compiled by the ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading is appended. (Author/DH)",

Thirty-two low-achieving sixth-grade children were assigned to experimental and control groups for 9 weeks. Materials were selected not only on the basis of their instructional usefulness but with regard for the students' psychological needs for success. In a special class each morning, the experimental group was given 165 minutes of intensive work in reading using Science Research Associates Reading Laboratories and teacher-devised materials and behavior modification techniques. One teacher and two student teachers worked independently with and were accountable for five students each. The reading subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test which  yielded significant results in favor of the experimental group were Word Knowledge and Reading Comprehension. According to results of some informal reading inventories, the experimental group gained 1.78 years and was significantly superior to the control group.

Knowledge of how a child goes about particular reading tasks may give clues to the difficulties he is encountering. Work with disabled readers during three phases of behavior--(1) before the breakthrough in acquiring a reading process, (2) at the time of the breakthrough, and (3) after the breakthrough--provides insight into how a reading process is acquired. From these observations it is hypothesized that learning how to read occurs in moments of \"light.\" As a child instantaneously perceives a concept which has hitherto eluded him, he acquires a new processing method for making the printed symbol meaningful. Examples of times when a child acquires a new processing method are when he first  (1) blends sounds into words, (2) groups printed words into meaningful phrases, and (3) comprehends unvocalized thought units. Since these processes can be acquired independently of one another, children differ in how they read. The teacher who subscribes to this theory will be constantly examining the child's performance to determine whether, in relation to the skill being taught, he understands the process, needs more information, or is ready to use and perfect his skill through functional reading.

Because this type of readiness model does not take into consideration a number of important variables, an approach is suggested which will provide a closer approximation between the predictor and criterion. This would entail (1) evaluation of the kindergarten child's reading-related skills and behaviors, as well as interfering behaviors; (2) evaluation of each first-grade classroom program to determine the skills and behaviors the child must have in order to cope with the reading task; and (3) an analysis of the  discrepancy between the child's skills and behaviors and those required for successful performance. Rating scale instruments are being developed for evaluation of the kindergarten child by the teacher. The first-grade teacher and classroom situation will also be evaluated by an observer who will use a separate but parallel rating scale.

In this experiment, 48 children (16 from each of grades 2, 4, and 6) who read Hebrew as well as English were shown patterns of Hebrew letters, of English letters, and of binary elements. Recall of Hebrew letters showed right primacy. Recall of English letters showed left primacy. The report of binary patterns presented after  language patterns showed a persistence of the directional sets established by the preceding language. When English and Hebrew patterns were mixed, the expected directionality was produced for each language, but recall of binary patterns after mixed language patterns showed neither left nor right primacy.

Also included is a section called Viewpoints, which consists of questions and answers from discussion groups. Classified as learning characteristics are variability of performance, memory deficits, discriminatory or perceptual deficits, and need for repetition; the emotional characteristic described is anxiety. Three major factors in the prevention of reading problems are pointed out: (1) The concept of readiness which is not synonomous with maturation is viewed as a result of interaction between maturation and learning and is defined in terms of skills the child is lacking. (2) Thinking must be in terms of the school  taking the responsibility when the child fails to learn. (3) The principle that there is no best method of teaching all children to read can result in matching method and child. Some of the discussion questions dealt with grouping, junior high school retarded reacers, the language experience approach, and personal aspects of reading. References are included. (DH)",

Subjects were indigenous primary-school pupils in New Guinea for whom English was a foreign language. No significant difference was found between the mean scores of subjects on cloze tests using blanks of a uniform length and the mean scores of subjects on cloze tests using blanks of the same length as the deleted words. Both versions of cloze tests were equally valid as measures of general reading comprehension. The question of length of blank to use in cloze tests has practical as well as theoretical significance for teachers in constructing cloze tests when they wish to use photocopying facilities. The implication of these findings is that by the use of a photocopy procedure, such factors  as size of print, illustrative material, and page layout may be included in the estimate of the ease or difficulty of printed material as measured by cloze tests.

        "description":"A major part of the primary school day is devoted to reading instruction. However, current practices in many classrooms interfere with growth patterns on which the ability to read is dependent. To alleviate this the teacher should have more freedom to interact with individual children, greater flexibility in scheduling and adaptation of materials to fit the child, and further training to become a better decision-maker in the areas of curriculum, instruction, and management. These changes in teacher practices can make the learning-teaching process more relevant and enjoyable to both teacher and child. The classroom environment must be arranged to provide for self-directedness through child planning and decision-making, to encourage the building of a positive self-concept by  creating an atmosphere which is free of fear and failure, to develop good interpersonal relationships by making time available for the teacher and child to work together, and to give children a chance to associate with all of their peers.

Some of the environmental causes related to socioeconomic disadvantagement which were discussed are distracting family problems, frequent moving, and few educational-related activities in the home. The family life is also important in forming the child's self-concept; a poor self-concept may interfere with learning to read. Reading failure can also be traced to inappropriate activities and methods used in the schools. The classroom teacher is not the only person responsible for the child's lack of progress in reading, but a great deal does depend on her understanding of the child as a person, his readiness at any level, and the methods by which he  learns best. Because not all problems can be handled by the teacher in corrective reading groups, the school is responsible to provide for ancillary reading programs where children will get help in small groups or on a one-to-one basis. The services of a skilled clinician may sometimes be necessary. It is also the responsibility of the school to use its resources and personnel in efficient ways. Summer schools and the use of volunteers are advocated. A bibliography is included. (DH)",

The investigation was conducted (1) to compare the longitudinal effects of the initial teaching alphabet (i.t.a.) and traditional orthography (T.O.) beginning reading programs through and end of grade 3 and (2) to determine the feasibility of starting i.t.a. instruction in kindergarten. Approximately 700 pupils from nine school districts were grouped so that one-third of the pupils started T.O. in grade 1, one-third started i.t.a. in grade 1, and the remaining one-third started i.t.a. in kindergarten. The i.t.a. groups transferred to T.O. basal readers during the second semester of grade 2. Tests in i.t.a. in grade 1  demonstrated the superiority of i.t.a. pupils over the T.O. pupils in skills requiring sound-letter association. After the transition from i.t.a. to T.O., few significant differences were found between the groups on spelling and other reading subtests. Since the group with which i.t.a. instruction was begun in kindergarten maintained their advantage through the end of grade 3, it was suggested that it seems not only feasible but necessary to introduce i.t.a. in kindergarten.

The federally funded program was introduced into kindergarten and first-grade classrooms and concentrated on direct reading instruction based on sound patterns and supplemented by use of the talking typewriter. Originally the program served over 300 children, and expansion into second grade has increased this number. Teachers are aided by two paraprofessionals per classroom and by additional parent volunteers. The adults work with individual children using a predesigned system with highly structured directions and responses to teach  reading skills. Games supplement this activity, and children are urged to work with other children in order to increase interdependence with peers while lessening dependence on adults. Evaluation after 1 year of operation showed significantly better readers among the Follow Through students than among other first graders. (MS)",

Children admitted to the Center receive careful diagnosis, are referred to outside specialists as needed, and are given individually prescribed remedial programs. Demonstration classes and inservice workshops  emphasize preparation of teachers to overcome reading disabilities in classroom and clinic situations. Special programs offered in cooperation with the University of Utah are aimed at extending knowledge of reading instruction to reading specialists in a wider area than could otherwise be reached.

Four instruments, two standardized tests and two designed for the experiment, were administered to a stratified sample of Mansfield, Ohio, fourth-grade students. The first hypothesis--that there is a significant relationship between ability to identify relationships that conjunctions signal and reading comprehension--was accepted on the basis of significant correlations on all measures. The second hypothesis--that there is a significant difference in the difficulty of various conjunctions--was supported through item analysis, binomial test, and chi-square indices of relative difficulty for various conjunctions. The third hypothesis--that  significant differences in comprehension of conjunctions exist for boys and girls, for socioeconomic levels, and for intelligence levels--was also accepted. Among the implications of the study were the suggestions that more attention be given to teaching conjunctions and the relationships they signal and that more attention be given to the role of conjunctions in assessing the readability of materials.

The second chapter, which is only partly completed, and which will be revised in order to simplify the presentation, discusses symmetries of the Schrodinger  equation for one or two particles, including gauge invariance of the wave function and parity.

Examination of 17 unacceptable concepts and the frequency of rejection of each provided little evidence to support any speculation of the existence of possible bias. The rating of the concepts does indicate an individual divergence of opinion and interpretation. Scholars from 40 professional areas and 12 ecological regions in the United States agreed on the majority of  concepts to be emphasized in environmental management education.

It was hypothesized that students responding to more complex questions would have significantly higher achievements than students who responded to less complex questions. Questions were of a given level of complexity for each of three treatment groups and of different levels of complexity for the different groups. A fourth group, without questioning, read a paragraph related to the questions asked other groups. Controls were provided for ability to read and comprehend science content materials. At the .01 level, groups with questioning  achieved higher than the treatment group without questioning and the latter groups achieved higher than the control group without instruction; there was a significant positive trend in achievement per unit change in question complexity. It was concluded that as the complexity of questions to which students responded increased, student achievement increased, the amount of instructional time taken increased, and the numbers of errors on the interspersed questions increased.

The study employed an interview technique to analyze the status of three basic concepts of probability--sample space, probability of an event, choosing the most likely of two events. The effects of visual aids on the child's ability to solve problems involving these concepts were also measured. Socioeconomic, grade, and I.Q. differences were explored in relation to visual aids and the three concepts. The study indicated that the status of these concepts is related to I.Q. socioeconomic background, and to a lesser degree, grade differences. All differences were in the expected direction. The children had learned a significant amount about the  three concepts without formal instruction. The children from a middle-class area were more successful at the verbal level than the children from the low socioeconomic area. The study showed that none of the students knew initially to assign a probability number to the chances of an event occurring. The study indicates that the counting of sample points is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for assigning a probability to an event. (Author/FL)",

Attitudes toward a number of common behaviors including drug use, sex, theft, etc., were obtained from over 650 subjects from junior high school level through adults. Reported frequencies of actual behaviors were acquired. The attitudes and frequencies of behavior were analyzed separately and then compared to each other. In general, behaviors rated as having high risks were also rated as having low gain and vice versa. Multiple regression equations were drived to predict frequency of behavior from attitude ratings. It was concluded that it should be possible to (a) use attitude ratings to predict which individuals or groups are highly prone to  drug use &quot;before&quot; drug use starts, and (b) evaluate the effects of action programs by noting changes in attitude ratings. The low gain value of socially undesirable behaviors can be taught where it can realistically be shown to be the case. The probable consequences of immediate behavior on future goals should also be emphasized, but the goals used must be ones with which the person presently identifies.

Evaluation embraces the major thrusts of the project, that is, developmental work with teachers at the Natural Science Center and local school sites via workshops, conferences, newsletters, and curriculum materials and the use of some class field trips. Three categories of teachers took part in the evaluation: project teachers, other teachers, and control teachers. Quantitative measures were assessed through a staff-prepared instrument while analysis of qualitative impact was assessed through a 15 item consultant-prepared form appearing in the appendix.

In Australia, the decline in the proportion of new tertiary enrollments in the sciences occurs primarily in the applied and professional science courses which have quotas restricting enrollments. The increasing female enrollment in universities, primarily in arts and social science courses, contributes to the apparent drift in the proportion of science students. There is little evidence that uninspiring school science courses contribute to the decreasing proportion enrolled in tertiary science courses. A more serious drift is the decreasing attraction of teaching for professionally trained scientists:  this may be remedied by improved employment conditions, including opportunity for periodic intensive retraining, and a flexible salary scale. Drifts in educational philosophy and from the compartmentalized scientific disciplines have implications for science education. (AL)",

The shortage of investigators in the accident research field is noted, and reasons why accidents have not become a matter of important concern to society are discussed.

The experimenter identified the high and low dominant students by means of a group personality test developed by Porter and Cattell. The students in each category were then randomly assigned to two treatment groups. One group received both praise and reprimand from the computer while the other group received reprimand only. The results of the experiment indicated that the use of reinforcement patterns of praise and reprimand alone did not affect achievement in a relatively short-range CAI study with high and low dominant fourth grade students. The  experimenter suggests that prior to the use of CAI for instructional purposes, long-range studies of social-reinforcer-personality-trait relationships should be implemented.

Quantitative distribution maps present a number of design problems that have led to continuing investigations of graduated circles as point symbols. A summary of the original graduated circle study, by the author, is presented. Six advantages to using graduated circles are summarized, however, map users consistently underestimate size differences when relying on the circle. One thousand forty college students from five colleges were tested and there was 70.5 percent underestimation. Additional tests were given to provide data for the construction of an appartent of visual size curve. Logarithmic  transformation and the method of least squares were used to derive an estimating equation for circle tests to convert data into symbolic form. Recent test results, including P.V. Crawford's dissertation on the validation of apparent size scale for graduated circles, are included and generally support the author's research. It is noted that wedges and bars as symbols have some advantages, but that circles are generally preferred. (SLD)",

        "description":"For most Americans the pursuit of happiness begins with the simple fact of a good job. Manpower policy is aimed at improving job opportunities and earning for the American people. To help young people bridge the gap from school to work we must assist them not only to acquire vocational information and job skills, but we must also help them to understand the broad socio-economic environment in which they will work, as productive human resources, and live as men and women. A program of manpower education approaches the study of work and the economic system from the point of view of man in his capacity as a human resource, functioning on the productive side in the economic process where the creative instinct of workmanship may be expressed. Its dual objective is manpower development  and socio-economic understanding of the world of work. An example course centers around the world of economics, technology and change, economic and noneconomic dimensions of work, rational decision making and career planning, the manpower market, occupational opportunities in the U.S. economy, and manpower skills and the economic value of education. Students taking the course showed a change of attitude, increased knowledge, and a positive course rating. The course is limited in that it cannot do the entire job for successful labor force participation, and it is designed to meet only the general needs of secondary students. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Three basic concepts of education for employment are discussed. It is stated that vocational and academic education can no longer be compartmentalized. Education is mandatory for employment in modern society. Vocational education should be a basic objective of all education. Second, technological and economic progress demand change. Appropriately prepared persons must be highly adaptable, and this is viewed as requiring continuous learning. Finally, freedom of opportunity is measured by the individual range of choice. Education can increase this range. From these, five operation principles are discussed: not limiting vocational education to particular skills, school assistance, formal occupational preparation, and development of the individual. A unified system of vocational  educational education is seen as necessary. It should begin in the lowest grades and continue throughout the educational experience. The curriculum should be spiral, and postsecondary occupational preparation should be a goal. The program should include fieldwork, and the school's obligation should continue past graduation. Creation of an occupational preparation system must be a continuing pursuit. (SLD)",

Playroom 81, housed in a local basement, has utilized the aid of neighborhood mothers to provide babysitting services and instruction in arts, crafts, and cooking for minority children from preschool to 12 years of age. In the view of those involved, the project has fostered a more positive self concept for both mothers and children. Moreover, the authors point out, Playroom 81 has turned out to be a useful model for the kinds of activities that should be generated by school-related mental health workers to help the schools function in their rightful  role as community agents rather than autonomous institutions. By involving parents, it is hoped that the project can generate this educational responsiveness with the active thrust of the community. (JLB)",

        "description":"A booklet of a programmed-instruction type was developed to obtain the measures needed to test Carroll's model of school learning, including ability, aptitude, quality of instruction, opportunity for learning, perserverance, and time criterion. Simple rules in an artificial foreign language were taught by means of the booklet to sixth-grade children. Poor quality instruction was found to retard the learning rate of children at all IQ levels, and to be almost as detrimental for children of higher intelligence as for children of lower intelligence. It also resulted in reduced perserverance among high IQ children but had no significant effect on the perserverance of children with IQ's of 115 or below. Statistics were developed to indicate the efficiency of learning under conditions  of inadequate opportunity. The empirical data generally confirmed the trends hypothesized in Carroll's model. These findings, if confirmed in other studies, would emphasize the need for good teaching for the more able as well as the less able student. Learning was also shown to be highly inefficient when students had insufficient opportunity for learning. This suggests that learning efficiency measures should be established for children of different intelligence levels for given units of instruction. Such data would allow teachers to assess required amounts of learning time much more accurately than is possible at present. (Author)",

        "description":"The broad use of maps by non-cartographers imposes on the cartographer the burden to make maps not only accurate, but to use symbols which make map-reading easier for the public. The latter requirement implies a need for universal symbols. Although there are no universal symbols today (letters, words, and figures, to a lesser extent, are dependent for their meaning on the symbology of particular cultures), there are favorable factors which could make cartography a first in the development of truly universal graphic symbols. There are three major categories of graphic symbols: pictographic, concept-related, and arbitrary symbols. Official Canadian and U.S. maps, among others, have all three symbol types represented. In order to remove this complexity and make progress toward  universal symbols, at least two actions will be required: 1) agreement among the professional and governmental organizations concerned with symbols of a given country as to what symbols are currently in use, and which of these are primary candidates for standardization, and 2) organization of a permanent international agency for the development of universal symbols, perhaps as an expansion of the existing International Standards Organization.

Most of the commentary on such \"overseas American communities\" is impressionistic, superficial, and stereotyped, and tends to foster the notion that Americans are peculiarly ethnocentric. Such an assumption ignores the fact that whenever a fairly large number of persons from one country reside abroad, they tend to cluster into enclaves that provide havens from \"culture shock.\" It is suggested that systematic, objective, and empirical descriptions of such communities could make a valuable contribution to the study of migration, acculturation, and communities in general. To that end, a frame of reference derived from past  studies is proposed, both as a generic concept and a subcultural category. Data would be generated that would permit an analysis of the relationship between community characteristics and cross-cultural interaction and attitudes. (Author)",

The order in which the  content areas are presented is not dictated by the structure of the objectives; the instructional sequence can be shaped largely by the personal interests of the students and the availability of instructional materials. The key concepts, principles and facts of each knowledge objective are appended: social problems, history, cultures, sociology, anthropology, religions, American ethnic groups, American institutions, sociology, anthropology, religions, American ethnic groups, American institutions, social psychology, individual behavior, political science, American civics, basic economics, personal economics, geography and ecology.

It has been written to describe and clarify environmental education, in preparation for the reforms called for by the Environmental Education Act of 1970. The environmental crisis is related to the evolution of civilization, technology, and consumerism: definitions, aims, values and principles are given. Student involvement and a realistic assessment of the difficulties in bringing about change and the assuming of personal responsibility are called for. Part II delimits a large role for education in environmental improvement and calls for programs both formal (in school) and informal (out of school). These programs should operate at all levels and use the full range of media. Local, state, and federal roles are  described with a call for multiple funding at several levels and federal coordination. The ideal is nothing less than individual environmental awareness, understanding, and responsibility on the part of every citizen. (NH)",

The major goal of this curriculum is to provide an educational program to increase student involvement and therefore provide more vital learning experiences. The ten topics present a broad spectrum of American civilization: SO 000 379 through SO 000 388. While historical content furnishes the core of study of each topic, the units are interdisciplinary in nature drawing from facts and concepts in political science, economics, sociology, geography, and the humanities. There are a wide variety of learning activities to help the student discover for himself the substance of each topic. In addition, the entire curriculum plan is open-ended so that the  activities can be geared to various learning levels and interests. Each unit is divided into six basic sections: overview, objectives, suggested evaluation, learning activities, suggested content guide, suggested resources. A model Social Studies Learning Center provides the environment in which the student can be actively engaged in the learning process, can have easy access to a variety of equipment and materials, and can receive more individualized instruction.

The emphasis of the unit is on values held by Americans rather than on the forces affecting them whether they be economic or social. The material shows the maturing of the American Mind from the Puritan experiment during our Colonial period through the conflict of the twentieth century. Specific objectives are: 1) to identify uniquely American patterns of thought, and the influencing factors; 2) to understand that a free society  breeds conflict of ideas, and that democracy provides an avenue for resolution; 3) to appreciate the range of achievements in art, music, literature, drama all as an integral part of American culture; 4) to realize the role of the individual in forming public opinion, and in social development and change; and, 5) to create their own philosophy of life taking into consideration the ideas and rights of others.

First is presented a general framework for this type of evaluation, along with its underlying rationale. Included are possible kinds and sources of data, some considerations of the constraining forces affecting such an evaluation, and an indication of the ways in which certain aspects of the entire evaluation scheme were selected for  application to the three courses. The next section presents some of the specific kinds of data which resulted from the application of this approach to the three courses. Finally, an attempt is made to integrate those results in an accurate representation of the courses, and to bring together common concerns which emerged from the study. Appendices include samples of the student questionnaires used, and achievement test items. (Author/JLB)",

The specific objectives were: 1) to develop the framework of concepts and to become acquainted with new materials and instructional techniques; 2) to encourage perception of students as both learners and citizens, and to design material on this basis --eleven units were developed; 3) to get the teacher to involve students in efforts to deal with fundamental social issues --race, minority groups, prejudice, social class, poverty, nationalism, dissent, protest, and war; 4) to influence the teacher to emphasize problem-solving and the development of the critical ability through the use of case material, games, and simulation rather than the memorization of facts; 5)  to understand that learning involves questions of personality, emotion, and content; 6) to realize the importance of the development of a students self-concept; 7) to encourage curriculum revision activities; and, 8) to encourage integrated social science sequences geared to individual development and responsible citizenship. The introductions and objectives of the eleven units are included here along with the workshop lectures, an evaluation summary, and resource materials. (SBE)",

They agree with many of the values of the NSS and the curriculum projects (which they tend to equate), but they want the developmental role shifted from the projects to the teachers. They see the NSS as overly academic, cerebral, and teacher-centered and want more emphasis on student interests, community activities, social action, and the affective domain. Methods teachers in schools of education are more dissatisfied with NSS than those who are appointed to academic departments. Dissatisfaction might be explained by one or a combination of three different theories: obsolescence, role conflict, or value conflict. The latter is probably the most  explanatory and describes the situation most difficult to deal with because it reflects fundamental differences about the nature of a good social studies program.

Several evaluation instruments were developed for pre-institute and post-institute administration: EPDA Geography Questionnaire, The Geography Content Test, and a History of Geography Test. A major concern of the Questionnaire was to assess the participants' expectations of the institute, to determine their needs and wants, to assess their perceptions of ethnic minority group youngsters, and to discover individual philosophical orientations toward education. In an on-site evaluation, they reviewed reports of the eight-day field trip, conducted interviews with participants, evaluated curriculum and curriculum materials, and  examined final course projects. The participants perceived geography as one logical and important vehicle of instruction and communication in a combined social-behavioral science approach to teaching ethnic minority group students the interrelationships of men and the interactions of man and his environment. Summary statements on the organization and conduct of the institute are included, along with the evaluation instruments, and the pre-test and post-test analyses of how much and what was learned, and what attitudes and values were changed by the institute.

Each activity in the unit was described with the teacher guide in terms of the major concepts to be taught, the materials needed, an estimated teaching time, a suggested procedure to be followed in  class, and answers to questions in the students' materials (a manual of exercises). The specific purposes of this unit were to increase student analytic and decision-making abilities, and student awareness of the spatial dimensions of their environment. Teachers and students found that the unit had promoted the inductive reasoning approach that was desired for all of the units.

It was then revised for this trial with four other units in the fall of 1966. At the beginning of the trial, the participating seventy teachers administered the verbal sections of the Cooperative School and College Ability Test (SCAT), Form 3A, to 3,034 seventh through twelfth grade students. They also administered a pretest in geography. Following the teaching of each unit, a unit test was administered to all of the students to measure understanding of the basic concepts taught in the unit. Students and teachers then filled out forms evaluating unit effectiveness. Teachers also evaluated the activities in each of  the four parts of the unit: 1) The Location of Settlements; 2) Accessibility and Land Use Patterns; 3) Growth of the Cities; and, 4) Planning for Growth. In conclusion, many teachers commented that the greatest strength of the unit was its success in motivating and interesting a large number of students over an extended period, along with its timeliness and relevance to the lives of the students. The unit test and the results, the evaluation forms and the statistics are appended. See SO 000 430, SO 000 432, and SO 000 434 for the reports on the other units. (SBE)",

Subjects represented a random sample of 800 pupils in 113 Harvard Project Physics classes during 1968, and were divided into eight same-sex samples--one for each of four learning criteria. The Learning Environment Inventory was used to obtain 14 climate scores. Regression-adjusted gain scores of individuals were related to individual IQ, class mean climate properties, and their interactions. To give an indication of the types of relationships found, this paper examines three social climate properties--intimacy, friction, and cliqueness. These are considered in their relationship to female gains on one learning criterion only, Test of Understanding Science (TOUS). Intimacy is positively related to TOUS  gains for females of high ability but bears a negative relationship to learning for females of low ability. Extremes on friction are positively related to gains in science understanding. Cliqueness of school classes acts similarly to friction for females. This study has implications for helping researchers and teachers to understand, control, and harness the potential influence of peer group forces on school experiences.

But the crisis atmosphere surrounding this issue threatens a thoughtful, systematic approach to the subject, and poses the danger of a careless rush to activity. As social studies educators, we have three major obligations: 1) to familiarize teachers with the ecological framework in which environmental issues must be viewed; 2) to alert teachers to the range of opinions on environmental action and stress that this, like other social issues, are controversial and must be so treated; and 3) to prepare teachers to lead effective inquiry into questions of social action. The issue of population growth, for example, can be placed  in the ecosystem framework by examining how increases affect food supply, proportion of land available to man in relation to other species, and overall support capability of the system. The range of opinions runs from warnings of imminent disaster to accusations by ethnic groups that birth control serves only to reinforce existing white dominance. Inquiry should proceed on the basis of an analysis of the underlying values and the kinds and sources of data upon which differing conclusions rest. (JLB)",

A commitment was made to materials at the expense of teacher education and other changes in the educational system. Successive choices focused on a complete but frugal package of teaching materials for a one-year course with a 30% overrun for fast teachers. Timing constraints dictated a &quot;Dive in, do the job at the present state of the arts, and get out&quot; approach, with no effort to do further research or maintain and expand a bureaucracy beyond completion date. The decentralization of the creative work among unit authors allowed for variety and ingenuity, while centralized evaluation and editing provided coherence  and consistency. Commitment to teachability was protected by school trials with representative teachers; little attempt was made to accommodate the bottom one-third of American high school students. Evaluation was pragmatic--Did it work? Was it liked? Commercial considerations were not primary, but remained constant. The project outline occupied a large share of initial attention, but proved to be a flexible and valuable guideline. HSGP broke from tradition as far as possible, retreating to a more conventional approach when necessary. (Author/JLB)",

Education Mission in 1946, she turned her schools toward democratization. The major aims of this reform program in education were: 1) the elimination of militarism and ultranationalism; 2) democratization; 3) modernization; and, 4) decentralization of education control. Specific reforms included: 1) the provision of greater equality of educational opportunity through the conversion of the multiple-track into a single-track system; 2) an additional three years of compulsory education; 3) coeducation at all levels; and, 4) general education at the secondary and higher levels. To train intelligent participation in a democracy, a new content was introduced --notably social studies  at the elementary and secondary levels.

Remedial instruction is felt to be most appropriate for children with slight weakness in learning skills or for those with intact learning skills who are culturally deprived. Serious deficiencies in learning skills are to be referred to specialists.

One of the computer assisted instruction experiments reviewed compared the strategy derived from the linear model with the all-or-none strategy  and found that the all-or-none strategy accounted for significantly higher scores on both immediate and delayed posttests.

        "description":"The concept of performance-based teacher certification asks that criteria for certification (whether knowledge and/or behavior and/or the product of behavior) be made explicit and that students of teaching be held accountable in relation to these criteria. Central to the question of performance-based criteria is the issue of whether performance beyond the knowledge level should be defined in terms of teacher behavior, the product of teacher behavior, or some combination thereof. Arguments for using teacher behaviors as the basis are: 1) It is logical to focus on what a teacher does rather than what he knows, believes, or feels. 2) Teacher behavior is the primary determinant of teacher influence. 3) Research has laid our observable, measurable categories of behavior. 4) Such a  focus provides one means of meeting the requirement of accountability. The case for demonstration of ability to bring about specific instructional outcomes as the basis for certification: 1) It represents an absolute criterion of teacher effectiveness. 2) It accommodates individual differences in teacher performance or styles. 3) It requires that effective behaviors and/or instructional programs be developed and utilized. 4) It requires the whole educational system to be clear about goals. 5) It takes much guesswork out of teacher hiring.

Such certification is needed because it makes sense, the public will demand it, and it will strengthen the profession of teaching. The Florida plan is designed to move certification practices gradually but steadily along a continuum toward more performance-based certification with traditional components replaced by new ones as they become available. It will depend on the success of individuals and institutions to develop and implement new techniques for training personnel and evaluating their performance. Few changes in legal regulations or state  administration of certification are needed, but some changes in procedures for program approval have been required. Activities to encourage movement toward performance-based certification include: 1) development of broad teacher education guidelines which can be used in designing preservice and inservice programs for state approval and which provide alternatives to the course-by-course certification regulations, and 2) a plan coordinated at the state level for designing and disseminating individualized teacher education modules which employ a performance based approach to training personnel in specific skills or knowledge identified by professional educators and which can be adapted to ongoing preservice and inservice programs.

Curriculum guides provide secondary teachers a basis for planning their course. Unit 1, \"The Individual and Tolerance,\" attempts to get at student self-perceptions. Through various  uses of media teachers help students answer who they are, how they feel about themselves, and what their values are.

Responses to the three separate 80-item instruments were received from 4,397 supervisors, 4,483 student teachers, and 1,001 principals. General findings include these: Student teachers make possible significantly more individual contact with pupils by both supervisors and student teachers. Positive effects on specific instructional activities often include more small group instruction, better provisions for make-up work and exam follow-up, better supervision of study periods, playgrounds, and hallways. Negative effects or no effect were more common on  amount of material covered, discipline, and motivation of pubils. A high majority of supervisors were thought by themselves and their principals to be more effective teachers as a result of contact with student teachers, who bring new ideas, materials and teaching aides. Supervisors' total workload (timewise) is not greatly affected by student teachers. Relieved of approximately 40 percent of classroom teaching responsibilities, supervisors most often engaged in increased professional reading and writing, work with other staff members or principal, increased committee work, and research activities.

Participants met in two groups for a series of 14 sessions on the principles of group dynamics and planning, assessment of group activities in the elementary school, and leadership training. Over half of the visiting teachers set up pupil groups of five to sixteen members. They felt the program was successful in providing them a worthwhile skill which gave them increased contact with pupils leading to more thorough diagnosis. Process and product evaluations indicate that a primary need is for the  understanding and cooperation of the school principal. The service was generally well received by administrators and teachers who noted improved pupil diagnosis, some positive behavioral change, and enhancement of the working relationship of visiting teachers. Attitude evaluations revealed that visiting teachers who conducted groups came to regard the master classroom teacher more and more as the key person in accomplishing educational objectives, particularly those of a cognitive nature; those who did not follow through with groups apparently identified more closely with the social worker and the individual counselor.

This program will initially involve 27 Teacher Corpsmen working in Jacksonville Model Schools implementing the home component of the Florida Parent Education Model. The program will emphasize university study toward certification and a degree and service to poverty children and their families in the community. Objectives  will be to train teachers who can teach inner-city children effectively, think for themselves in curriculum and instructional development, work with parents and other community agencies to strengthen the learning environment of the child, work with paraprofessionals, and cooperate competently with parents and others in institutional change. Innovative components include emphasis on the disadvantaged, work in the disadvantaged schools, work with paraprofessional parent educators, training in theory and use of systematic classroom observation, academic preparation from a panel of specialists in a non-course format, intensive work in reading and language development, inservice work on a differentiated staff.

        "description":"Some form of accountability for what comes out of schools is increasingly demanded. The cause-effect or means-end relationship assumed to underlie most institutional management strategies must be reexamined since the educational system must assure that individuals can cope with and profit from the other \"teaching experiences\" in the world around them. While advances in knowledge and technique make possible an institution where individual learning can be facilitated and assured, it is difficult for people to believe it possible since few have had the practical experience of managing resources to that end. The needed management procedures exist today--a goal-directed management process which permits both the present and desired operation of a school to be viewed from a common  frame-of-reference focused on the learner. Implementation of an institutional policy of accountability--as a managerial ethic--must take into account the reality that educators have little control over many external factors affecting individual learning. The educational management process (in which administration is not considered as a function apart from teaching) is a continuing information feedback mechanism which holds the professional educator responsible or accountable, not for the discrepancies, but for doing something about them with the information provided. A policy of total institutional accountability can provide a management framework in which both the process and product can be perceived and dealt with together. (JS)",

Analyses included determination of urban-rural differences, contingency tables to ascertain various relationships among characteristics, step-wise multiple regression procedure to identify aspects of school districts, teachers, and community which are related to high proportions of teachers in those districts intending to remain teaching there. Recommendations were made for areas in which programs need to be developed. Results include this profile of the typical Appalachian teacher: a woman about 38 years of  age, born and educated in the region (bachelor's degree in last 10 years), who has taught 10 years (in same state); who judges her college training as adequate for her needs except in methods for teaching disadvantaged and student vocational opportunities; who has had inservice training and college credit course (available within 25 miles) in last 2 years; who judges inservice training inadequate in application of educational theory and methods for disadvantaged; who doesn't work directly with student teachers, interns, or teacher aides; who chose her job for family or community reasons; who has classes of 26-35 students; who earns about $6500 annually; and who is satisfied (enough to stay) with respect from teachers and community and administration, has freedom to teach own way, and is  teaching in major subjects.

        "description":"Dr. Lessinger's position of accountability (see ED040 155) seems to be within a very limited view of the function of the school. Not all educators are well adjusted to the status quo; some hold that the school shall build a new social order. Dr. Lessinger seems to say that teachers should be accountable for the training component but not the more important education component. Teachers want to know what he means. Regarding the &quot;basic skills of reading,&quot; the issue is not that teachers have failed to teach the basic skills but that they often have not been made aware or given the proper tools, materials, and preservice and inservice training to do the job. The difference between Dr. Lessinger's paradigm for accountability and that in AFT Quest Paper #12 (ED041 870) is that his is  based on the simplistic dichotomy of success or failure whereas ours is based on the more complex notion of identifying teachers' strengths and weaknesses and then establishing continuous progress programs for them. Dr. Lessinger says that the heart of the education engineering process is in the performance contract. AFT teachers have passed a resolution pointing out that performance contracting can take the determination of education policy out of the hands of the public, threaten to establish a new monopoly of education, dehumanize the learning process, sow distrust among teachers, promote teaching to the &quot;standardized&quot; test, and subvert the collective bargaining process and reduce teacher input.

This booklet contains materials and suggestions for the four preservice training objectives: 1) to give the participants an understanding of their motivation in wanting to work in an ABE/TESOL program (adult basic education/teaching English to speakers of other languages); 2) to give them a thorough understanding of the psychology of the adult learner; 3) to give them a first-hand experience of the difficulties involved in learning another language;  and 4) to instruct the teacher in TESOL techniques and methodology. Under objective 1 are questions suggested for use in small group discussions. Under objective 2 are an outline on factors to be considered in training adults plus questions and suggestions for micro-lab and role play techniques. The remaining 73 pages, for objective 4, cover initial theory orientation and practical demonstration lessons based on these concepts of the TESOL class: sound drills, pattern practice, vocabulary development, controlled conversation, reading, writing, and testing, warm ups, games, etc. Suggested readings and speakers also included.

Organization is in three parts: teacher education in general, the educationally handicapped child, and teacher for the educationally handicapped. Chapter 1 explores issues related to planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher education programs. Chapter 2 focuses on problems related to luring, selecting, and keeping high quality personnel. Chapter 3 hypothesizes that the educationally handicapped  consist of three subgroups: at one end of the continuum those who actually have major disorders interfering with learning and at the other end those whose problem stems primarily from the deficiencies of the learning environment. Chapter 4 suggests a set of sequential and hierarchical teaching strategies involving a two-step process by which teachers can identify and attempt to meet the remedial needs of youngsters in each subgroup. Chapter 5 takes the position that there is a need for the educationally handicapped specialist and suggests the appropriate range of his duties. Chapter 6 offers opinions regarding the recruitment, preparation, and certification of teachers for the educationally handicapped. (JS)",

The second period, extending to July 1970, included a 3-week program involving 71 teachers who gave subjective reactions to the program 3 weeks after it concluded. Follow-up interviews with 19 participants 6 months later confirmed that significant changes in self-realization had occurred. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the effects of the Training Program on participants and use was made of internal and external criteria and matched control  groups. Measurement was by F Scale, Personal Orientation Inventory, Semantic Differential, Leary's Interpersonal Checklist, the Motivation Analysis Test, Ryan's Rating Scale, and the Michigan Picture Test. The results of these tests are examined in detail and indicate that the teachers taking part in the program became less authoritarian and more self-actualized, developed greater self-insight and leadership skills, and were perceived more positively by their supervisors and students.

What we want now in governance is a teaching profession act in every state, created by law, which could give to members of the profession legal power to 1) establish the requirements for and issue certificates for teachers; 2) determine and establish procedures to accredit teacher preparation institutions; 3) define performance criteria for teachers in beginning and later-career roles; 4) conduct a continuous study of teacher standards and practices and recommend needed  changes; 5) revoke, suspend, and reinstate certificates when teachers, after a full and fair hearing, are found in violation of the act; and 6) adopt rules and regulations to implement the teaching profession act. The National Council for Teacher Education and Professional Standards (NCTEPS), which is increasing its activities in support of self-governance, is maintaining a clearinghouse so that states may learn from each other the pitfalls to watch for and the various alternatives.

Until people spend more time really watching and recording behavior, we will not get many new ideas. It is possible to teach effective, functional behavior analysis and management to teachers and parents in 10 to 20 hours of instruction; in some cases, in 2 to 4 hours. One reason that it is possible, in addition to employing a common functional language for analyzing behavior, is that natural consequences have proven to be extremely effective. A class  of 34 graduate students were required to find a child whose behavior they wished to accelerate or decelerate . They recorded the frequency of the behavior on graphs which were shown to the class on a large screen with an opaque projector. They described where they were having difficulty or why a particular approach did not work, and only after the class had exhausted its ability to comment and suggest did the instructor comment. This class, which had never had formal instruction in symbolic behavior analysis, outperformed groups taught by other procedures which had had formal instruction. This class and a group of fathers handled in the same manner had 100 percent success in modifying child behavior. (JS)",

        "description":"The proposals from 27 of 34 applicants for Phase II of the USOE Comprehensive Elementary Teacher Education Model (CETEM) program were reviewed to determine 1) what kinds of institutions participated, 2) how responsive applicants were to guidelines, 3) which Phase I programs Phase II applicants found most useful, 4) what were some major and common features of Phase II programs, 5) how applicants felt about Phase II competition. It was found that applicants were mostly state colleges and universities; that applicants varied considerably in how they responded to guidelines but taken together they were strongest in describing programatic features; that the Phase I work of Michigan State, Syracuse, Massachusetts, and Florida State was most useful; that there was agreement on a host of  teacher education program features; and that applicants felt Phase II competition was exhilarating but that whether there was fair competition or not was dubious. Conclusions drawn include that Phase II applicants did provide a blueprint for teacher education requiring dissemination and support and that USOE must plan more efficiently and communicate more effectively.

Ten design characteristics were identified: type of binding, statements of goals, recorded history of production of materials, instructions for use of curriculum materials, content interpretation, inclusion of instructional strategies, subject matter design, evaluation scheme, number of pages, and feedback correction provisions. Four curriculum engineering characteristics were also studied: planning arena, personnel involvement, geographic region, and grade  designation. The major analysis revealed the number and percent of distribution of the 14 design characteristics within each curriculum type: general curriculum, art, business education, foreign language, health and physical education, home economics, industrial arts and vocational education, language arts, mathematics, music, science, social studies. A second analysis showed the number and percentage of the distribution of the 14 design characteristics within each of the four curriculum engineering characteristics.

A 100-item questionnaire was constructed, based on interviews with several instructors. Subjects (279) were selected by random sample from a list of 1969 College of Education graduates. Findings, based on 96 percent return of questionnaires, indicate that most of the recent graduates are relatively well satisfied with teaching as a profession. As a group, they feel they are  being paid adequately and future plans include pursuing an advanced degree. Students in general felt good about their preparation to work in the classroom but expressed concern over lack of actual experience working with children. Most felt that courses with practical experience such as student teaching were of most benefit. More skills related to actual teaching and media usage were needed. Attitudes toward specific courses were hard to ascertain. (The questionnaire with item-by-item findings is included.) (JS)",

The program, to train teachers in skills specific to the use of the PLAN system of individualized education, included a 2-day spring 1969 session, a 3-day summer conference, a fall minicourse, and inservice consultant training. Subjects were 24 PLAN and 12 Control teachers in Eastern districts and 36 PLAN and 14 Control teachers in Western districts. Using the PLAN Teacher Observation Scale (TOS), trained observers collected data on 21 categories of teacher behavior totalling one hour observation for each teacher in fall 1969 and in spring 1970. It was hypothesized first that PLAN teachers at the primary, intermediate, and secondary levels and all  levels combined will spend more time than Control teachers in a) diagnostic and didactic inquiry, b) decision facilitation, c) leading small group discussion, d) tutoring in a small group, and e) giving positive verbal or nonverbal messages, and second that Control teachers at the same levels will spend more time than PLAN teachers a) providing content in small or large group discussion, b) giving negative verbal or non-verbal messages, c) managing records, d) managing learning materials and equipment, and e) interacting with a large group of students. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported in a, b, c, and d. Hypothesis 2 was supported in a and e and partially supported in b. (See also SP 004 464, ED 037 413, ED 037 414, and ED 034 729.) (JS)",

On-site seminars and individual conferences were conducted with 20 teachers and aides (serving in 16 rural Alaskan communities in which the predominant first language is Yupik, Inupik, or Athabascan) to allow them to share with each other their experiences in using new methods and materials in their classrooms. Participants completed and revised the supplementary materials devised during the summer. Several collected and compiled local legends and folklore for classroom utilization. Several programs were established for either teaching English as a Second Language and/or for teaching the local Native dialect. The three-member staff  considered the program successful. The staff received an invaluable education about bush teaching and an insight into life in rural Alaskan villages.

Method A requires the observer to record the activities of the entire class at given intervals while Method B requires only the activities of selected individuals to be recorded. The overall plan consisted of collecting a cumulative every 30-second 20-day cumulative criterion to which each method was compared to determine which of the two was more efficient. It was found that the minimum number of observer hours required to reach an acceptable level was less for Method B than Method A. Therefore, it was concluded that Method B is a more efficient observational method for obtaining activity type  observations in an individualized classroom than Method A. (Author)",

Two groups of five student teachers learned the technique and were then evaluated. The evaluation procedure was designed to measure changes in their educational objectives, their teaching techniques, and their teaching styles. Six types of data were collected for evaluation: 1) a final paper written by the students, 2) adult Grouptalk sessions, 3) ratings of Grouptalk leadership based on tape recordings, 4) student problems Q-sort, 5) teacher ratings, and 6) student teacher paragraph completion test. Two sources of quantitative data yielded inconclusive results, partly because the ratings of performance were  obtained before the experimental training had been completed, and partly because of the questionable reliability of the measurements. The small size of the sample justified placing major emphasis on the analysis of the residual data, including the responses to a projective test, and the final papers. The analysis indicated that the experimental groups increased their self-understanding, gained a more mature perspective on their role, and became more sensitive observers of the children's thinking and needs. It is recommended that Grouptalk training be added to the curriculum of teacher training institutions. (MBM)",

A post-test required 10 teachers from each group to teach a video-taped mini-lesson and the questions asked by them were classified in four categories: cognitive-memory, convergent, divergent, and evaluative. Analysis of variance, t tests, and  chi-square procedures were applied to the data, and the following findings obtained: 1) As a result of analysis of variance, the three strategies did not show any significant differential effects. 2) As a result of multiple t analysis, the cognitive group showed a significantly larger use of critical-type questions than the traditional group. 3) The affective group showed a favorable tendency toward the increased use of evaluative-type questions compared with the traditional group.

A selected review of continuous measurement investigations with children provided the methodological basis. The selection and training of the advisers is described, together with information on each of the schools. Because their differing needs required variations in the conduct of the project, these aspects are described separately, together with the group results and anticipated plans for each  school. Results of three specific projects are listed: 1) managerial behaviors of pupils, 2) academic skills being systematically taught to individual children, and 3) academic performance of groups of pupils. The teachers' post-project impressions are discussed, as is the project administration in the Bellevue school. Conclusions were that continous measurement and contingency management techniques can be effectively employed by elementary teachers, and that by using advisors to work directly with other teachers, large numbers of students can be helped and regular classroom teachers can become skilled in behavior management.

Each three-member team was composed of a teacher and two professors from different colleges. The professors observed, assisted, and tutored classes which included disadvantaged children, a series of team meetings was held, and recommended changes in teacher education were published. The second year of the program was devoted to the implementation of the recommended changes. A total of 26 of the college professors continued in the program on a no-fee basis. The second year experiences included taking whole college classes to observe in public schools, bringing classroom teachers to appear before college classes, and using  films to acquaint college students with a wide range of conditions. The 2-year project demonstrated that, if given the opportunity to supplement teacher education programs, college professors would use funds for travel, for substitute pay for public school classroom teachers, and for films and new instructional materials. A central agency could easily provide such services on a low cost budget to all 16 senior colleges in Mississippi. (Author/MBM)",

Subjects were 34 school districts representing a 10 percent sample of 340 districts receiving state funds through the Illinois statewide gifted program. Questionnaire and interview data were collected from directors, teachers, and students to rate programs in terms of quality; identify and quantify independent variables (55 were grouped into six types); and compile program case histories to discover distinct patterns of program development. The development of a new quality program was found to be dependent upon the  interaction of a small number of powerful variables: size of the developing unit, the norms of the unit toward the innovation, the opinion leadership exerted within the district in behalf of the innovation, the status of the advocate within the system, and the contact of the system with the outside world. No districts followed the Tylerian &quot;behavioral objectives&quot; model, and Rogers'&quot;adoption&quot; model could not order data in appropriate temporal sequence. Data is most economically described by an &quot;advocate&quot; model of program development which incorporates sociological and political considerations.

Thirty students were selected for the first pilot group on the basis of academic ability and interest in research. This group and two control groups were pretested and posttested on their attitudes toward research, educational aspirations, occupational aspirations, and attitudes toward the undergraduate program. Results showed that experimental group members received higher posttest scores on all criterion measures than persons in either control group. There was also a significant positive change for experimental group members in educational aspirations  and attitudes toward the undergraduate program. A longitudinal study of graduates showed that half were employed in research, development, or evaluation. In addition, a survey of 100 public school administrators showed that there are job openings and an anticipated increased demand for personnel with training in research, development, and program evaluation. Future plans include improvement of the undergraduate program and the development of a graduate program aimed at students from all fields who have had no previous training in educational research.

The four groups concluded that researchers, school personnel, and members of the community all have different priority systems, the critical contrast being the long-term theoretical interests of researchers and the short-term pragmatic interests of the schools and the community. They suggested that direct ethnographic observation would be a research focus of interest to all groups.

They felt the need to update teaching techniques, be evaluated on the basis of performance rather than length of service, and be able to demonstrate productive performance. The document discusses the organizational strategies required in the establishment of a successful inservice program. In large school districts a formalized system involving standing committees and a governing charter may be required. Smaller districts may obtain better results from the use of a task force of short-term duration whose members are appointed on the basis of their special knowledge and commitment and which has  administrative support including secretarial assistance, supplies, and equipment. Whichever method is used, the committee or task force would be responsible for research into the goals, activities, and content needed by the teachers; the establishment of goals in behavioral terms; the development of a program calendar; and the establishment of policy considerations and evaluation procedures. The detailed budget requirements of such a program are considered and a sample budget is included. (MBM)",

The history of team teaching and the results of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 illustrate the point. \"Educational research\" also fails as a change strategy, not because of scarcity of funds or a communications gap but because its findings as they come from the researcher are simply not  usable by practitioners. \"Research-based development\" enlists both local innovation and research to produce new products and processes. Although it is costly, it is economically feasible when resulting products are widely used. It provides practitioners with products fully ready for use with rigorous research evidence that they do the job for which they were designed. If the new strategy is broadly implemented, the teacher's role can become more manageable. It would be more like that of a medical physician: working with each individual to diagnose his problem and select from available treatment the one considered most applicable--not to develop new treatments or discover new medicines.

The two behaviors were cue attendance, i.e., analyzing a complex stimulus and identifying its discrete components, and hypotheses generation, i.e., the generation of numerous alternative hypothetical explanations of the nature of a complex stimulus. The subjects, 117 teacher training students, were exposed either to a structured or a random-spliced version of a film in each training condition. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was employed. To this a ninth posttest-only group was added. Results showed that cue-attendance training significantly facilitated later hypothesis-generation behavior as much as direct training. Training for hypothesis  generation significantly facilitated later cue-attendance behavior, although not as much as direct training. Both training procedures significantly facilitated information seeking behaviors. In addition, it was found that subjects with high verbal reasoning scores benefited most from hypothesis-generation training in terms of increased information seeking, while low scores profited most from cue attendance training. It was concluded that although a chain of mental processes underlies uncertainity and information seeking, individuals who differ on a relevant aptitude measure emphasize different parts of this chain.

The program disregards traditional ability and grade level grouping practices and places students in remedial reading and composition courses according to skill proficiency. For all students not requiring remedial work, a growing number of academic courses is offered in American literature, advanced composition, dramatic literature, poetry, mythology, folklore, language study, and narrative fiction. Each course has a specific focus. In literature, for example, rather  than surveying authors and works, the text of each work chosen for study is carefully examined. Some of the immediately apparent advantages of this plan are that students claim to be more enthusiastic about English; 10th and 11th graders are academically stimulated by taking classes together; teachers and students can study in depth; and assignments in literature, language, and composition become meaningful preparation for college.

Some specific teaching techniques for improving composition quality include (1) greater emphasis on the improvement of simple sentences before attempting a mastery of compound or complex forms (2) adoption of the  methods of the Christensen Rhetoric Program (\"generative rhetoric\"), and (3) relating oral usage and the oral approach to writing.

The project attempted to establish the educational potential of nonverbal communication by measuring emotional responses of students (K-college) to stimuli (music, slides, sounds, color, light, film) with a polygraph and an instrument (the Encabulator) developed and tested specifically for the program. It simultaneously applied nonverbal communication techniques to a peer-teaching program for disadvantaged students. Some conclusions reached by the study were that (1) teaching via the arts, in combination with peer to peer techniques is  effective in developing and improving spelling and reading programs; and (2) nonverbal communication techniques--which require no special training-- are particularly effective in motivating the disadvantaged and result in improved learning rates, consistent attendance, and improved classroom behavior.

The traditional methods of criticism--e.g., hand signals, flash cards, peer criticism, and oral and written teacher comments--are either post-performance types of evaluation or lacking in privacy. The Instant Speech Evaluator, an electrically powered light panel fastened to the speaker's lectern, provides both privacy and immediate feedback. This device, operated by the instructor from the back of the room, signals the speaker regarding such things as posture, speaking rate and volume, and eye contact. Speeches are also recorded on a two channel tape recorder which records the performance of the  speaker on one channel and the teacher's signals on the other. In this way, both an immediate and post-performance analysis can be made of the speech and the speaker's responses to the light signals. Although a degree of distraction may result from the light panel, the most outstanding benefit to be derived from the use of the Instant Speech Evaluator is that it will enable the student speaker to immediately experience what is desirable in a public speaking situation, after making adjustments suggested by the teacher.

Following a review of psychological, sociological, and linguistic studies dealing with the structure of communication or the structure of discourse, a type of goal-directed (convergent) communication is defined in which consisten patterns of language use are expected to occur. The language of 48 dyads of children and 24 dyads of adults was observed in three standard convergent communication situations and used to develop a system for analyzing the verbal interaction. This sytem defines the structural units of the communications and permits a description of the behaviors, the connecting structural relationships, and the content which  occur in and between utterances during the communication process.

Twenty sample students, from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and with similar intellectual abilities, were administered the Davis Reading Test (DRT) after which they read and recorded their spontaneous responses to \"The Secret Room\" by Alain  Robbe-Grillet. Open-minded students were found to have higher DRT reading comprehension scores and to read voluntarily a greater number of books than closed-minded students. No appreciable differences were found in the students' written responses to the short story.

Three tasks were developed which represented this class of communications and permitted the assessment of communication accuracy. Dyads (48) of grade 5 students--six of boys and six of girls from four population groups: Negro, white, low and middle SES--were observed performing the tasks. The accuracy scores achieved by pairs were consistent across the three tasks. The K-R 20 estimate of internal consistency was .72. Three components of accurate communication were identified: (1) orientation of one member to the other's point of view, (2) communication of essential information, (3) verification of the problem's solution. Measures for describing the  adequacy of dyads' performance of these components were derived and correlated with communication accuracy. Each component correlated significantly with accuracy and the three components combined accounted for 44% of the observed variance in accuracy scores. It was also found that accuracy is related to IQ and SES, but not to sex or race. These results can be a step in identifying components which could be taught to help students communicate more accurately. (See also TE 002 138.) (Author/DD)",

Scales of items with similar levels of endorsement from different factor scales were placed in a paired-comparison forced choice task and administered to college men. Attempts to validate the test across a wide variety of tasks, such as divergent thinking tests and personality tests, met with marginal success. The development and utilization of a free choice form of the art preference test with the same pictures as stimuli and with similar samples of men taking some of the same tasks as were completed by groups along  with the forced choice form produced a greater number and greater magnitudes of significant correlations. Each of the art scale subtests did not conclusively constitute the analogue for each of the cognitive styles as hypothesized, but the instruments seem a viable entree into the study of the relationship of art preference and personality.

For 3 years, each experimental student studied voice or an instrument as a music major, and the project was completed with about 42 students in each of four schools. Results indicated that no significant differences existed between the experimental and control groups with regard to scores in reading, arithmetic, and study skills; grades in language arts, social studies, and mathematics; teacher ratings on attitudes and  behavior; or attendance. Interviews with 46 students indicated that participation in the program led to personality improvement, stimulation to study, and a more meaningful attitude toward school.

The achievement levels of first grade and seventh grade pupils were evaluated, using both techniques at each level. The instructional team was the experimental unit and the self-contained classroom was the control unit. Eleven questions were posed to test the hypothesis that the experimental unit would make as much progress or more than the control unit. Staff activities of the instructional team, cost effectiveness of both techniques, the testing procedures, and the data analyses are discussed and each question is considered in terms of the amassed statistical  data. Results showed the control group to have had an advantage during the first year, although a combination of circumstances may have influenced the results. During the second year, the position was reversed and the team teaching technique had the advantage. In the third year, however, neither approach was superior in achievement, but the experimental group did score significantly higher on self concepts. (AE)",

        "description":"The historical, political and economic climate in the mid-1960's was ripe for a head-on collision between two conflicting ideologies. On the one hand, there was President Johnson's War on Poverty. The Head Start summer programs were begun in late 1964 as the archetype of the hope to improve the lives of the poor. On the other hand, was the implementation of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting System (PPBS) by the Federal Government under the premise that thorough analysis could produce a flow of information that would greatly improve the basis for decision making. Evaluation was fundamental to the thinking of PPBS. The clash between methodology, political forces, and bureaucracy loomed fearfully in those early days. Many individual project evaluations were undertaken mainly  focusing on the summer programs, although a number of full-year programs had now been funded. This was the context in which the Westinghouse Study was given the task of assessing, in a reasonably short time, the overall effectiveness of the total program. The results caused a great stir because they showed the program to be &quot;ineffectual&quot; over the long term. The methodological and conceptual validity are the explicit focal point of the controversy. However, after reviewing the major criticism, an overall assessment of the methodological and conceptual base indicates that the study is a &quot;relatively&quot; good one and does provide useful information for decision making.

It was found that the relative roles of Family Social Background (SB) and Process (PRCS) variables can be considered roughly similar since the unique role of PRCS greatly exceeds that of SB for both Expectations and Attitude Towards Life in all  geographic regions. This same assertion holds to a lesser extent for Study Habits since there are metropolitan-nonmetropolitan differences at the third and twelfth grades. For Educational Plans and Achievement, however, the relative roles of SB and PRCS are not even roughly similar: the role of SB at both the T and A levels for these variables is usually most pronounced where social and economic stratification on the basis of race or ethnicity is greatest (viz., the South and to some extent the metropolitan North). It is suggested that the aggregate effect of allocating students with similar SB into the same schools is to make it more difficult for the schools to overcome the cumulative effect of SB. (DG)",

This application was made necessary by the nature of several goals of Project PLAN in the area of student personal and social behavior, self-planning skills for occupational and personal development, etc. Attainment of such goals is very difficult to measure using standardized testing procedures. The critical incident technique was utilized to identify important aspects of student behavior which were felt to represent positive examplars of these goals. From this basis, student self-report procedures were developed. These procedures were applied to situations which were structured according to cues obtained from the original critical incidents. The weight of the findings  supports the tentative conclusion that PLAN students are making good progress. However, the study cannot be considered definitive because of certain limitations. A critical incident report form (teacher completed), the teacher's directions for the independent learning and community service activities exercises, the criteria for tabulating responses to these exercises, and a list of the school classes forming the sample are appended.

        "description":"Sensitivity data is defined as involving two response categories, with responses observed at different levels of some variable. The responses are taken to indicate sensitivity to the variable and may be labeled &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative.&quot; The countback method offers confidence limits for the 50% point, the level of the variable for which the two responses are equally likely, in the special case when only one response is observed at each level. A lower bound on the confidence coefficient for these limits can be given, assuming only independent responses and the existence of something like a 50% point. No specific model of response probabilities is required, and the variable need not even be continuous. To gain a greater understanding of the countback method, it is used here to  analyze sensitivity data obtained in an experiment on the perception of depth in pictures, and to study two artificial situations where the response probabilities can be specified exactly. The countback method is compared with the minimum Chi-square and the maximum likelihood estimation methods and its extension to data with more than one response per level is discussed. The results suggest that the countback method has a significant place among previous methods for analyzing sensitivity data. Appendices include historical, statistical, simulation, and experimental details. (Author/CK)",

A statistical test of the equality of slopes and intercepts was used for the FB and SO sets combined to determine group differences, and commonality analyses were conducted and compared for the different groups to determine the relative roles of FB and SO. Analyses showed that Expectations for Excellence, Educational Plans, and Study Habits were more fully explained by FB and SO in the South than in the North, except at grade 12 where the North or the metropolitan North becomes more predictable. Attitude Toward Life and  Achievement were more predictable in the South than North from FB and SO for all grade levels. Family background plays a more significant role in the development of achievement and motivation than do the school factors, and is generally more influential in the North than in the South for all dependent variables except Educational Plans. School factors are slightly more influential in the South, as are the common portions, which may represent mutual interplay of FB and SO. These results suggest that independently of an individual student's own family background, the achievement and motivational levels of his fellow students influence his achievement and motivation.

Two major types of tests, criterion-referenced and norm-referenced, and two types of use, student evaluation and program evaluation, are considered in this context. The strengths and weaknesses of criterion and norm-referenced measures are discussed in detail. A four-step approach to test construction is proposed, combining the better components of the criterion and norm-referenced approaches, which may overcome some of the information problems of current tests. This proposal entails the specification of measurement objectives, the development of test  items for each objective, the development of test items to measure related objectives, and the provision of both a score and a score interpretation for each objective. Responses to potential criticisms of this approach, including its reliability and its usefulness to teachers, are made.

In the age span studied (grades 3 through 6) significant increases with age are noted in Recitation Anxiety, a slight decrease with age is seen in Test and Failure Anxiety, and slight sex differences are seen in Report Card Anxiety. A  significant relationship between teacher behavior and children's school anxiety is reported. There also appears to be a trend toward predictable variation in school anxiety as a function of the school year. Results indicate continued use of SAQ as a tentative research instrument. A bibliography, an appendix describing test administration procedures, and a factorial analysis of questions are included. (Author/AE)",

After reviewing current criticisms of tests and their use, the Commission concludes that the Board's testing functions and associated services, although needing adjustment and augmentation to hew closer to the public interest, should be continued and could serve three main functions: (1) a &quot;distributive&quot; function by contributing to comprehensive and sensitive descriptions of students, of colleges and their programs, and of the potential relationships between the two as  both students and colleges engage in a process of reciprocal choice, (2) a &quot;credentialing&quot; function by certifying demonstrable educational attainment whether acquired by attendance in school or college or not, and (3) an &quot;educative&quot; function by instructing students both in subject matter areas and in the skills and methods of making decisions and choosing.

The utility of experimental design can be increased by following a set of procedures that do not require the use of a common criterion instrument and a uniform decision rule for all students in the experiment.

This led to the realization that all was not well and to the era of massive government grants to aid education. Great advances in technology and new dimensions for one practical field of psychology, education, have profound ramifications for students, teachers, and society in general. Great strides are being made in the field of individualized instruction, taking into account the many human diversities. Ten years hence technology, given adequate research and development funds, will be at such an advanced state that there will be even greater computer-individual interaction. This technology will provide the flexibility to change radically the social organization and atmosphere of our schools.  Naturally, the role of the teacher will have to change in such a situation. It is clear that this psychotechnology, while not only having a major impact on education, will also have a major impact on psychology itself, resulting in a profound identity crisis in psychology by 1980.

If the results of such testing are used for the purpose for which they were designed and are interpreted carefully and accurately, then the results can be used to indicate what kind of teaching methods should be utilized; what kind of cognitive strengths exhibited by the pupil can be capitalized upon; and what kind of cognitive weaknesses can be strengthened. It has been the use of IQ tests that has made educators and psychologists aware of the cultural environmental deficits exhibited by certain groups of children. The school is the primary agent that helps children to maximize their potentials, thus enabling them to cope with their environment. Intelligence test scores, when  intelligently applied, are the best data available for getting a predictive statement about school achievement. The scores can provide a great deal of meaningful and helpful information about a child, but it must be remembered that a given score means something different for each child who obtains it. (CK)",

Behavioral data cen take at least two forms, qualitative (or discrete) and quantitative. Both types are fallible. Measurement errors can occur in quantitative data and measures of these are based on error variance. Qualitative or discrete data can contain misclassification errors, and these are expressed as probabilities of misclassification. Statistical models for psychological data must take these differences into account. A simple sequence is presented as an example of a qualitative model, while disengagement is the model given as an example for quantitative data. These examples, which are special cases of more general problems, lead to an outline of the general nature of the  qualitative and quantitative models. The primary concern here is to develop statistical models which permit the investigation of structure in fallible longitudinal data. Statistical descriptions of the simple sequence and disengagement models are included in the appendix. (CK)",

This study attempted to enhance prediction by a more precise identification of the subjects for whom achievement is being predicted. A sample of 250 college freshman males was used to develop a prediction schedule. Predictions of academic success, based on the criterion of grade point average (GPA), were made on the basis of a clinical profile interpretation of the four clusters of scales on the California Psychological Inventory (CPI). Predictions were made by a gating process through which the  predictions arrived at in each succeeding cluster of scales were used to refine the prediction level assigned in the preceding cluster(s). An attempt was made to quantify this process of clinical prediction using an experimental group of 20 and a replication group of 10. The results of the experimental group were analyzed and a correction formula developed. The distribution of predictions and G.P.A. were skewed in both groups. Prediction in the experimental group was improved by the correction factor but not in the replication group; the results are enigmatic and further investigation is necessary. Some possible explanations are suggested. (LR)",

The instrument used was the Teachers' Practices Questionnaire (TPQ) which had been devised in 1963 to measure teachers' subjective role expectations. Three samples of undergraduate and graduate students who were, at the time of data collection, attending schools of education were employed in the study. Results from the first of these samples, analyzed to determine the extent of the invariance of the factorial structure of responses to the TPQ, revealed that two of the six roles proposed by the authors of the original 120-item instrument disappeared. In a revised TPQ, consisting of 28 items, four factors (Counselor, Motivator, Referrer, and  Disciplinarian) emerged from the factor analysis, but the intercorrelations were judged to be too low to be psychometrically valid. Additional revisions and the addition of items clearly delineated the four role factors and, with one exception, each item was positively correlated with its appropriate factor and no other. A copy of the final 40-item version of the TPQ and a factor analysis are included. See TM 000 401 for a review of the instrument. (TA)",

The subjects were classified as adherents of the cooperative or competitive democracy doctrines of education, according to their scores on the measure. They also completed the Professional-Social Characteristics Questionnaire. Data analyses included a one-way analysis of variance, F-ratio of differences among groups, t-ratio difference between two means, and product-moment correlation of educators' opinion systems and the socioeconomic beliefs of key &quot;influentials&quot; in each county. Professionals agreed on the educational ends and means and were biased toward the  competitive doctrine. When classified on the bases of the differentiating professional-social variables, they differed in educational doctrines; no differentiated group had a consistent doctrine. Compared with the student groups, the professionals were more biased toward the competitive doctrine than the only student group that showed such a bias, the sophomores. Generally, professionals in the more abstract or academic group were less biased, and the concrete or applied group were more biased toward competitive education. The opinionnaire's ability to discriminate reliably among groups supports its validity as a test. (PR)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a new two-phase measurement technique that permits a direct comparison of the perceived relative importance of economic vs. non-economic factors in a job situation in accounting for personnel retention, the willingness to produce, and job satisfaction. The paired comparison method was used to measure the preferences of 91 enlisted men aboard a U.S. Navy destroyer for seven different job classifications, seven supervisors, and seven groups of co-workers. In a second phase of the study, these three job factors were combined, together with various amounts of pay, to form two-factor composites, e.g. job A and Supervisor B, or work group C and pay D. Ninety-seven enlisted men in the same setting made preference judgments among these composites. Multiple  correlation was used to predict preferences for these composites from the job factor scale values obtained in phase one. Using beta weights and coefficients of determination of part correlations as criteria of importance, it appeared that type of work, followed closely by pay, was perceived as highly important in determining reenlistment, production, and job satisfaction. Co-workers and supervision, in that order, were seen as less important. Implications of the method and findings to the formation of personnel policy are considered. (Author)",

        "description":"Twenty-seven kindergarten children were trained on two different double classification matrix tasks in an attempt to determine whether the tasks were hierarchically related. Prior behavior analyses of the tasks suggested that the two tasks shared many components, but that the more complex task had in addition components not included in the simpler task. For this reason it was predicted that learning the simpler task first, then the complex, was the \"optimal,\" learning sequence. As predicted, children who learned the tasks in the optimal order learned the more complex task in fewer trials than those who learned the tasks in the reverse order. In addition, the reverse order group showed evidence of having acquired the simpler task in the process. Both of these findings are in  accord with the hypothesis that the two tasks are hierarchically related. It is suggested that acquisition of complex cognitive skills may be a matter of learning specific relevant prerequisites. (Author)",

        "description":"Most research on information utilization in judgment and decision making has followed two basic approaches: \"regression\" and \"Bayesian.\" Each has characteristic tasks and characteristic information that must be processed to accomplish these tasks. There has been a tendency to work within a single approach with minimal communication between the resultant subgroups of workers. This analysis of the approaches examines (a) the models developed for prescribing and describing the use of information; (b) the major experimental paradigms, including the types of judgment, prediction, and decision tasks and the kinds of information that have been available to the decision maker; (c) the key independent variables that have been manipulated; and (d) the major empirical results and  conclusions. Topics discussed include the configural use of information, task or environmental determinants of information utilization, learning to use information, sequential effects upon information processing, strategies for combiming information, and techniques for aiding the decision-maker. Of particular interest is the degree to which the specific models and methods characteristic of different paradigms have directed attention to certain problem areas to the neglect of other equally important problems. Also of interest is whether a researcher studying a particular substantive problem could increase his understanding by employing other models and experimental methods. By laying bare the similarities and differences between each approach cross-method research may be facilitated. A  comprehensive bibliography is provided. (Author/GS)",

Two sets of goals are identified. Eleven specific goals for each student, which involve the acquisition of a wide range of information, skills, and abilities in addition to personal development are listed and techniques for measuring success in attaining them are suggested. Five general PLAN goals are presented in the appendix. In this report, evaluation of the attainment of goals in grades 1, 2, 5, and 6 is achieved by comparing scores on standardized tests administered at different times for PLAN students and for groups of students from traditional classrooms, designated as controls. The data used  for 1967-68 was obtained from the test files of the cooperating schools, while data for 1968-69 was supplemented by test scores from a PLAN supported testing program. Comparisons were made by PLAN teachers for all students to whom the tests were administered and for those students who had scores on both a given pretest and a given posttest. Problems in the interpretation of the data are discussed. As a result of the comparison, it is generally concluded that when grade placement and growth are considered, the PLAN students perform as well as or better than the controls, despite the initial problems of a new program. It is also noted that there is a tendency for a student to do better the longer he is in the program. (PR)",

Current problems cited stem from post-World War II acceptance of the goal of educating \"all the children of all the people.\" Compensatory education, peer-tutoring vs. competitive scrambling, mastery learning, retention vs. dropout, and socioeconomic segregation by tests, require study. Background surveys are cited that define the scope of the problems. Longitudinal studies are recommended that feed back evidence of need and of success and failure en route to terminal evaluation. Multivariate analysis is advanced as essential methodology; person-environment interactions should be studied, not just controlled, if individualization is a  goal of the teaching-learning process. Major research and development organizations need to be based on an interactive model, rather than a linear model, to speed action and guide research. Innovations and their evaluation should be demanded and supported locally, not just by outside funds. ERIC is hailed for dissemination. New instrumentation is demanded for assessing the young, the disadvantaged, and foreign students; examples of adaptations are given. Forceful graphic presentation is described. Emphasis on the magnitude vs. the inferential certainty of findings is recommended. (Author)",

Superficially, many key elements of a manufacturing organization are part of the system: a product, product tolerance limits, methods for assessing product deviation, and a feed-back system for making compensatory adjustments. In layman's terms these elements are: educated youth, educational goals or objectives, performance tests, and a reporting system. Their existence has led to an attempt at applying a wholesale systems framework to education with mixed results. Reasons for the lack of success in this attempt is analysed in this study. It is suggested that system analysts, rather than modeling the total system, should focus on those aspects of education which can be systematized. Such aspects are:  resource allocation, scheduling, prediction systems (research and evaluation), and data bank systems. It is theorized that two conditions must be met to enable a systems approach to be successful in an educational application: (1) The designers must exhibit a fine sensitivity to the fact that schools are political entities, and (2) the system must be focused at the level of the individual student. The implications of these assumptions are discussed. (Author)",

When the achievement tests on which the QMP norms were based were renormed by the publisher, it was decided to test again in 1965. The results of that testing are reported herein. Testing was restricted to grades 5 and 8 in selected areas throughout New York State and background information was compiled on each student. The workbook is intended as an evaluative instrument to aid administrators in judging the quality of their school systems. The level of academic achievement with reference to students, school systems, and similar systems (large and medium cities, small cities, villages, large rural, and small rural) can be determined for the total test and  subtests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Section I of the workbook explains the normative figures and tables in Appendices A-D which are based on school system mean achievement scores. Section II explains the tables in Appendices E-P which allow one to compare the achievement of certain defined student groups within a school system with similar groups elsewhere.

A search of the literature, attitude inventories, and other teacher measures produced a pool of value statements about educational goals which were placed in traditional categories. Descriptions of behaviors indicative of the achievement of a given goal were devised. The item presentation format required two separate responses to the same set of items. The first response was a rating of the importance of the item and the second was a rating of expected level of performance. An unmodified version of the instrument was first administered to head teachers and assistant teachers of 24 Head Start classes during an orientation  session and again approximately 8 months later. Results indicated that developmental or readiness factors (emotional, social, situational) had higher rank orders than academic skill factors and that Expectancy scores were generally higher than Importance ratings. There were no significant differences between pre- and post-test ratings, suggesting that the sampled teachers maintained stable feelings about goals. However, the degree of correspondence between Importance and Expectancy increased during the year. The present instrument is long (7 factors; 100 items) and modification is necessary, while its discriminative ability has yet to be established.

The Institute was held during the summer of 1967 at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The State University, the Buffalo Public Schools, and several suburban schools came together in order to enhance the quality and creative potential of educators, and to exchange ideas on the problems of urban schools. The Institute was planned around the perceived needs of administrators in the public school system. Consultants and lecturers delivered speeches and conducted seminars on urban education. This report includes the text of all major speeches given during the summer Institute; the topics include: the evolution of the urban community; racial  isolation and its implications for the schools; discussion of proposals for change; and, recommendations in particular for Buffalo. Evaluations of the Institute are included in appendixes. Both evaluation reports indicate that the Institute met the needs of the participants; that their expectations had been fulfilled; and, that they desired to attend another institute.

Major objectives were: (1) to provide educators with an insight into the social, cultural, political, and economic factors affecting the efficiency of educational programs in operation in multicultural Southwestern communities; and, (2) to develop the ability to analyze and create educational programs better suited for schools with significant numbers of minority group students. The Institute  consisted of five series of lectures and small group seminars on various cultures and their respective histories, as well as field experience involving a school-community survey. The report concludes that the second major objective must await assessment until the impact of the Institute on local schools can be described. An interim evaluation of the first objective is held to be promising. Other evidence cited is considered to indicate that the Institute has been most successful in heightening the sensitivity of participants to the problems of educating children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

It is concluded in the overall evaluation report that a large majority of the participating administrators considered the program a success. Most of the participants reported that they would recommend a similar program to friends, that the Summer Institute was helpful in dealing with human relations problems, and that the program influenced their subsequent behavior. Also, the Summer Institutes were considered somewhat more successful than the monthly meetings during the school year. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.

The objectives were to provide participants with a basic experience in human relations in an inter-racial setting; this would expand their knowledge and understanding, needed to work effectively in a desegregated school setting. Further, special problems confronting supervising teachers as they guide student teachers, who are presently in or will subsequently join integrated faculties of desegregated schools, were identified and analyzed. In an attempt to create a candid, open, and honest atmosphere for interpersonal interactions, heavy emphasis was  placed on relatively unstructured group discussions. Public school personnel with experience in desegregated schools discussed the problems they had faced and the solutions that had emerged. Among the many results and conclusions was the consensus that participants became more skillful and comfortable in interracial discussions of social and educational problems. (JM)",

It was planned around the perceived needs of the administrative staff of the participating school districts. The two problem areas most frequently identified by participants were: (1) school-community relations and (2) teachers and staffing. The Institute was divided into three parts: the first was a comprehensive two-week workshop for 20 participants in the summer of 1968; the second was a comprehensive four-day workshop  held in November, 1968 that was designed to familiarize new participants with the experiences of the summer workshop; and, the third consisted of monthly workshops designed to build upon the ideas of the comprehensive workshops and to move toward a working plan for each school.

The purpose of the program was to prepare the school system and the community for desegregation by working with the teaching staff. A Coordinating Committee was set up, which participated in sensitivity training sessions in order to lead small discussion groups. Topics in the seminars included the following: the disadvantaged child; student and teacher experiences in desegregated schools; senstivity; and, black-white confrontations. At the fourth seminar, the teaching staff made recommendations which are included in this report on the program. Results of this inservice program are considered to be shown in the smooth transition into desegregated schools; the Coordinating  Committee provided strong leadership, and the small discussion groups demonstrated the value of letting faculty members tackle school problems. A semantic differential questionnaire was administered to the faculty before and after the program. Results show a positive change with regard to the inservice program and its objectives.

The objectives of the program were: (1) to develop educators' awareness of prejudices and sensitivity to racial minorities; and, (2) to develop procedures for creating this new awareness and sensitivity in educators. The inservice training project (composed of discussion groups) is evaluated by The Urban Awareness Inventory, a collection of statements constructed by black students, which reflect their beliefs about themselves, their community, and the schools. Subjects for the evaluation were selected from black students, teachers participating in the program, and a control group of teachers. Students were asked to agree  or dissent to the statements; teachers were asked to respond by indicating the percentage of black students the teachers thought would endorse the statement as true. From the results, it is held that there is no difference between the estimates of the two groups of teachers. The similarity is so close that the evaluation concludes that the Title IV workshop project had no discernible effect on the participants' awareness of the beliefs and opinions generally held by Tacoma's black students.

The afternoon phase was devised to extend learning beyond the classroom in activities such as fishing, swimming, and field trips. Three hundred and ninety pupils who just completed the fourth or fifth grade and who were at least one year below grade level in reading or mathematics were selected.

Among the eight hopeful aspects of desegregation found by the Task Force was the peaceful opening, for the most part, of Mississippi and Louisiana schools in September 1970, and the lessening of observable in-school segregation of students. Major problems of desegregation  included the displacement of black educators in status positions, continuing displacement of black teachers, discriminatory treatment of students, continuing growth of the public school movement, the misuse of federal funds, and, lack of black representation on Boards of Education.

The School's purpose is to carry on experimentation and research on the causes and possible remedies of underachievement as well as to help individual students realize their potential. For the Spring, 1968, semester, 108 eighth-grade boys, representing all areas of the state, constituted the resident student body; thirty-six boys from the local area were admitted as day students. The students were given individualized and exploratory instruction working closely with a counselor. In  summary, the results of this study tend to indicate that personality characteristics are highly correlated with achievement. It is recommended that further research be done in this area and that diagnostic methods continue to be explored. For related reports see UD 011 076 and 011 078-081.

The instructional program involved studying humanities, mathematics; science, and the arts with close guidance by a counselor. The results from the summer term show some changes in the boys in residence, which are apparently related to the age and grade of the student. The sixth-grade students showed greater and more consistent gains on measures of reading, achievement, and study skills; in addition, they improved their attitudes towards themselves and the School. Seventh-grade students tended to be more erratic than sixth-graders in terms of their response to the summer term; however,  they showed significant gains in oral reading and work-study skills.

It is held that one of the major problems with the study of underachievement has been its isolation from average achievers. To compensate, the Achievement School has collected comparable data during 1969-70 academic year on 1200 children representing the average school population of North Carolina. Data were collected on achievement, behavior, self concept, attitudes towards school and school related activities, and the acceptance of responsibility for one's own behavior. Preliminary analysis of data for sixth-graders showed that on all variables underachievers are well below the normative group before treatment. After a four month period  of treatment, underachievers approached the norm on all variables and in some instances exceeded the norm group. Presently, all data are undergoing sophisticated analysis.

Creativity tasks required the child to name as many ideas as he could that met a simple problem requirement. Tasks were given under \"base line\" conditions and with a reward of one cent for each idea given. If task motivation is the critical determinant of performance, reward should decrease the differences between high and low scorers by decreasing the range of motivation with which the task is approached. However, if these individual differences reflect capacity, reward should increase or leave unchanged the difference in number of ideas given by more and less fluent children. Reward led to an increase in mean number of ideas which was  consistent across levels of creativity. Thus, while motivating conditions may alter the level at which the group performs, the data suggest that individual differences in performance derive from differences in capacity rather than motivation for divergent ideational producation.

        "description":"In earlier research, Sedlacek and Brooks provided evidence for the validity of a measure of attitudes of whites towards blacks. In developing the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) one of their major methodological points was that an appropriate measure of racial attitudes would provide a racial context to make difficult the psychological withdrawal from the measure. They criticized the conclusion of Rokeach and others that belief in an issue, not race, determines the attitude of one person toward another. One question remaining unanswered was whether the particular method employed in the SAS caused the results of whether the SAS really measured racial attitudes. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of beliefs rather than contextual situations on the attitudes of  whites toward blacks. Results indicated that whites generally responded the same to a person holding a belief whether a black held the belief or not. The conclusion reached by Sedlacek and Brooks is that a nonracially related belief provides a way for subjects to ignore race in responding. Hence, there is further support for the necessity of providing a racial context before racial attitudes can be successfully measured. (Author/JM)",

The uproar started when the Board of Education announced the allocations for the districts in the last moments before the 1970-71 year was to begin. The community school boards saw immediately that these allocations would mean drastic reductions in the funds available to them for locally developed Title I programs. In the resulting angry reaction by the community boards most of the attention has been on the specific hardships of the districts involved. Much broader issues are, however, involved: the general question of allocations of all funds, the rights and powers of the community  boards, the relationships between the teachers' union and local and central authorities, and, indeed, the whole concept of decentralization itself.

Responses of the subjects (12 to 17 year old boys) to questions in an interview served as data. The findings indicate that a wide range of places were visited, in terms of number and distance from the subjects' residences. There is also considerable variability in the places to which the subjects said they would choose to travel given an opportunity. Patterns of travel and travel interests are held to be not immediately evident in these data. But an examination of the fantasies about desirable and undesirable places is considered to lead to the postulate that there are at least two attitudinal styles with regard to travel; the first is place-oriented, and the  other, personalistic. Although this study deals with some of the more superficial aspects of travel experiences of a relatively small sample of urban black youths, it is considered to stimulate several problems for future research.

The final questionnaire was administered to 149 seventh and eighth grade students. The findings concerning social class and sex differences in attitudes toward black power and related matters indicate that background variables  do have some important effects on these attitudes. In addition, only a very small percentage of the students questioned attach a specific meaning to black power, or define it in a manner which indicates inclusion of politics or economics.

Determinants of college attendance such as scholastic achievement, financial resources, socioeconomic status (SES), school climate, and race were studied. It is shown that the composition of high schools is correlated with the college aspirations of seniors graduating from high school. A chapter is also devoted to the working class high school student and the differences in college attendance plans and enrollment of the schools such students attend. Relatively high college aspirations coupled with relatively high college enrollment rates in schools attended by black students of working class SES suggest that there may be a trend for black students'  participation in higher education. However, it is considered that caution should be exercised against overstating the improving picture for blacks. It is pointed out that standard indices of social class do not often adequately explain differences in aspiration or achievement. Indications are that low SES blacks have higher aspirations than comparable whites. There are also definite indications that both black and white working class students are expressing goals which they intend to achieve. (Author/JW)",

Tutorial review sessions were conducted with 72 black high school students from a large vocationally-oriented school in Philadelphia in order to evaluate and revise self-instructional programs based on standard courses in vocational education. The hypothesis that instructional programs revised under student review would yield more learning for black students than materials revised through instructor feedback was supported. In an empirical test with 35 students, post-test results between experimental groups and a control group were significantly different at the .05 level. Students contended that status work is barred for blacks and &quot;dead end&quot; careers at minimum salary levels are offered to the  non-college bound student before he is able to realistically match his abilities and interests against the rapidly changing job situation. Students proposed a demonstration project for high school dropouts which used film-making as an aid for the dropout to gain a sense of personal well-being and the ability to communicate before specific career-oriented training. Twelfth and Oxford Street Gang members were trained in film-making; after producing a documentary, they launched several new entrepreneurial activities.

Serious defects in the administration of the program were reported: many grants have gone to districts engaging in serious and widespread racial discrimination; funds have been used to support projects which are racist in their conception and which will resegregate black students within integrated  schools; and, a substantial portion of the funds have not been used for desegregation emergencies, but rather for general aid to education.

The Kramer School is a combined education and day care project serving children from six months to 12 years; it includes a teacher-training program for university students, a training center for child care aides, and an array of supportive family services. The community of the school is poor--50 percent white and 50 percent black. Day care and learning for toddlers is provided; for three to five year olds, there are more structured activities, especially in reading. The elementary school is not graded; but is divided according to ability. In addition, the children often  visit the Learning Resources Center and Library. The teachers and the community seem enthusiastic about the project. Results of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, administered to preschool children, indicate that the experimental group gained 15 IQ points during the school year, while the control group (who stayed at home with their mothers) gained only 2 IQ points. Tests at the elementary school level are to begin in 1971. For other booklets in the series, see UD 010 121-125. (Author/JW)",

The training program is a tutorial program at the University of Illinois involving both mother and child; the program tries to demonstrate that mothers in deprived areas can be effectively trained to provide own children with a more stimulating home environment and some basic preschool skills. Results have been highly promising; in contrast to the usual pattern for children from disadvantaged areas, the participating infants show increasing improvement on intelligence tests. The mothers are self-confident and enthusiastic about the program. The mothers in the program set aside a regular  time for daily training sessions at home with the child; these sessions vary in length depending on the infant's attention span. In addition, the mothers attend two-hour group meetings once a week. The program provides transportation to the school and pays $3 per session to cover babysitting expenses. Basic toys and other materials are supplied. For other booklets in the series, see UD 011 120, and 011 122-125. (Author/JW)",

All teachers chose to participate, many moving up a grade each year with their students. The program's approach is based on the fact that disadvantaged children are considerably behind middle-class children in learning skills when they enter school and, if these children begin at normal rates, they will always remain behind average children in school. The Engelmann Bereiter approach uses programed materials so that children will not encounter tasks that are too difficult  for performance. The materials require many verbal responses for each child. Teachers systematically reinforce desired behaviors, using praise, food, or prizes as reinforcers. This program is used in the first three grades at three schools in West Dayton in impoverished areas. Most of the children have attended kindergarten and have been in Head Start programs. About 98 percent are black. For other booklets in the series, see UD 011 120-121, and 011 124-125. (Author/JM)",

The program is considered remarkable for the amount of parent support it has gained, for the degree of parent direction under which it operates, and for the methods of operation within the framework of the black urban life style. Innovative instructional practices include parent shaping of the curriculum, parent involvement in diagnosis on the basis of tests, and parent administrative activities, including a strong say in the hiring and firing of teachers. A distinctive feature is the emphasis on  education within the black life style. The first communication with the child is in his own dialect; the transition to standard English is made later, with &quot;speaking to be understood&quot; as a goal. In the early years, much attention is given to the development of physical skills to counteract crib infancies. Objectives, as such, are not used; instead an action framework is implicit. There is one teacher and one teacher's aide for every 20 pupils. For other booklets in the series, see UD 011 120-123, and 011 125. (Author/JM)",

Special classes are held in each school building in which the program operates, and a standardized system of referral has been set up. A number of schools not in the target area have adopted a similar approach, but are funded by the school district. Thus the concept of governmental grants as &quot;seed money&quot; has been realized. The program is note-worthy in the light of the student's reception of it--they regard participation in it as a privilege--and also in the light of its low cost--only 200 dollars per  pupil above Wichita's normal expenditure of 603 dollars per pupil. The program focuses on corrective reading in the elementary and junior high grades rather than in the high schools, though the board of education has successfully experimented with multimedia learning laboratories at the high school level. Attention has also shifted to the lower graders, so that the second grade is now a major source of corrective pupils. A summer school is in operation.

Trained interviewers talked at length with approximately 400 students and with teachers, parents, and community leaders. The observations provided a basis for concluding that the &quot;open door&quot; admissions policy does not in itself encourage black students to attend the junior college. Neither does the policy stimulate the development of programs designed to meet the needs of black students. In response to an inquiry sent to presidents of public junior colleges in the South, administrators from a number of institutions reported innovative action  programs designed to increase enrollment of black students and to improve their opportunities after they enrolled. These materials combined with activities in the five pilot project programs provide the illustrative materials used in this report.

The general hypotheses underlying this approach is the expectation of a functional similarity between social class and race effects on the use of reinforcements by mothers and children. The subjects were 109 four-year-old boys and girls, their mothers, and a corresponding number of three-year-olds. The subjects were divided according to race and class; assignment to social class was determined by father's occupation and area of residence in Los Angeles. Use of positive reinforcement was defined by statements of praise, encouragement, and affirmation; negative reinforcement, by the reverse. The experimental situation set up involved having  the subjects teach each other assembling of puzzles. Their method of teaching (reinforcement) was studied. The data relating social class and race to children's and mothers' patterns of reinforcement suggest more general social class and race differences in maternal reinforcement styles. It can be inferred from the findings that the lower-class black child received more negative reinforcements from his mother and less positive reinforcements from his peers than the middle-class white child.

The focus of inquiry was, for example, the relationship between emotional disturbance and being delinquent, the difference between black and white delinquents, and the relationship of emotional disturbance and socio-economic class. The subjects were court-adjudicated, residential delinquent males, age 16 to 18 years, who were consecutive admissions to state and private institutions. Of 470 subjects, 328 were black and 142 were white. A control sample of 367 non-delinquent black boys, matched with the delinquents for age, was recruited from the neighborhoods and schools from which the delinquents came.  The data were assembled by means of a self-reporting test, called the Emotional Reaction Inventory, along with a broad spectrum battery of psychological tests. Some of the results include: (1) the association between living and growing up in a ghetto area and development of considerable emotional distress; (2) the tendency of lower-class Negro delinquent teenage boys to be more emotionally disturbed than their non-delinquent counterparts; and, (3) the fact that the white delinquents were found to be more emotionally disturbed than the black delinquents.

The leading article describes Title I actions in Calais, Maine, and Providence, Rhode Island. The problems in both these towns appear to be quite different from those in large, industrial cities. The community which would benefit from Title I often seems apathetic and uninterested. The article raises the issue of the organization of the &quot;invisible poor&quot; of small towns, the question of education as an organizing issue, and the suitability of litigation as a solution to complex policy issues. The other central essay concerns bureaucratic politics and poverty politics. It is concluded that Federal and State governments have little control over Title I spending; local  school districts are virtually free to meet their own priorities. It is suggested that groups have more say about expenditure of federal funds. In addition, this issue of the magazine includes a section of feature reports on research, litigation, government action, and legislation concerning education and the law.

The published results of the Coleman report are used as an example of how the conceptual framework can be operationalized. The dependent variable of the analysis is one measuring social performance. The independent variables measure some aspect of themes, behavior styles, and information components. Social performance within the &quot;mainstream culture&quot; can be measured using the tests of educational achievement administered in the public schools. Using the score on the Verbal Ability Scale (which according to Coleman is the best criterion of achievement) as the measure of social performance in the mainstream culture, it was found that the groups with the highest performance levels are whites and Oriental  Americans. Southern blacks constitute the group with the lowest score. According to Coleman the test of general information probes areas likely to have become known through out-of-school activities. The high correlation between group rankings on Verbal Ability and General Information indicates the relevance of these information components to social performance within the mainstream culture.

The conference members agreed on the need for consistent and long-range planning in education for the less privileged. They accented the importance of teaching basic knowledge, while advocating the development of a close relationship among school, parents, and community.

In the study, an attempt was made to distinguish between the characteristics associated with income levels and those related to ethnic group affiliation for the three ethnic groups. In the analysis, clustering techniques applied to the data demonstrated that there were differences among the groups greater than would be expected if income level alone were the determinant. This was done by controlling for income level in all analyses. The data variables were patterned by ethnic affiliation rather than income level. This is significant for several reasons: (1) It provides a  means of verifying formally patterns which are derived from traditional participant-observation techniques; (2) it provides a way of critically analyzing high level abstractions such as Lewis'&quot;culture of poverty&quot; concept; and, (3) in terms of guided social change programs, it provides data on differences which may be of benefit to educators and administrators in setting guidelines for program implementation.

The section on industrial technology is based on the findings of an extensive survey of industry, a  comparison of similar curriculums in selected institutions, the literature of the field, and the deliberations of the Consultative Committee over a period of many months. As a result, five elements of a proposed policy were developed. Twenty-two recommendations for industrial arts and technology in California state colleges are included.

Twenty-four Fellows were selected to develop a model program designed to orient, upgrade and prepare a nucleus of urban teachers in evolving technologies for a broad-based industrial arts program. The 9-month program, which resulted in an M.Ed. Degree, was designed so that each Fellow would (1) become competent in those aspects of American industry which embrace either Industrial Materials and Processes or Energy and Propulsion Systems, and (2) develop, field test and evaluate the curriculum materials needed for an application of these evolving technologies in the schools systems. Observers noted that  several changes instigated in this year's program improved this third ExTFP. A more complete evaluation of this project covering 3 years of operations is planned for the near future. Evaluation of the second year (1968-69) is available as ED 038 521, and the instructional packages developed during the year are available as ED 040 303. (CD)",

Mental health agencies have traditionally clustered tasks and activities according to professional specialities, agencies, or specific tasks, none of which is particularly responsive to client needs. It was recommended that the highest priority of rationales for clustering jobs and activities be target groups of persons. This is the notion of the generalist whose primary focus is on meeting the needs of the client. In  addition, 15 functional roles were identified, and four levels of workers (entry, apprentice, journeyman, and master) were determined.

To help find solutions to problems facing the rural population, the RDC proposed a task force be created to explore the feasibility of developing pilot projects in three selected rural areas. These projects were to be designed to make use of the combined resources of all appropriate Federal departments and agencies, including their respective cooperating state agencies. Thus concerted services projects were established in Minnesota, Arkansas, and New Mexico with the strategy to minimize the deleterious effects of  technological change upon rural communities.

        "description":"Accompanying the growing concern for environmental control are expanding job opportunities and an ever-increasing demand for trained personnel to fill these jobs. Thus, vocational educators are confronted with the need to design and develop programs to train needed personnel. To do this in the most effective way, educators need to: (1) assess the availability and current development of curricula and materials, (2) identify promising developments and findings in environmental control occupational areas, and (3) identify and describe the major conclusions and future research and development alternatives. Recognizing these needs, this report identifies subsequent needs for: (1) work-oriented curricula based on occupational analysis and student needs, (2) curricula developed through  a systems approach, (3) improved recruiting and counseling materials, (4) improved methods of obtaining feedback concerning programs, and (5) expansion of current programs to meet future needs.

The State-wide projections are divided into population, labor force, occupational, and industrial projections. In order to show the population and manpower situations which would develop in Tennessee if the 1950-60 trends were continued, these projections for 1970 and 1980 are extrapolations of the earlier trends. The second part of this report presents an analysis of the nine planning regions of Tennessee. Each region is analyzed according to the size and age-sex composition of its population and labor force. Each regional analysis considers the size and sectional distribution of total employment within the  region. The final object of analysis by planning region is to show what changes occur in the sectional distribution of the employed and the age-sex distribution of the population of the region. The regional projections are also compared with the State projections in all areas. A related document is available as VT 011 977. (Author/BH)",

Project national figures and trends reveal that there is a need for educational programs to prepare students to enter food serving, marketing, and processing occupations. However, data concerning personnel needs in a specific employment area should be used to determine if there is a need for these programs. While a number of curricula are available to prepare students for a single occupation or a cluster of occupations, improvements are needed and changes will  be necessary. Curricula should be developed and evaluated through an educational planning system composed of occupational analysis, program planning, program development and testing, and documentation and dissemination of results.

The three acts in federal legislation of primary importance to residential schools are the Vocational Education Act of 1963, and 1968 Amendements and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. The Job Corps, as created by the 1964 Act, involved operating residential schools, and offers data on many aspects of the problem. Other examples of residential schools revewed are the Hashell Institute in Kansas, Mahoning Valley Vocational School in Ohio, and Mayo State Vocational School in Kentucky. Residential schools provide a healthy learning and social environment for the urban disadvantaged, and an opportunity for youth in remote  rural areas to receive vocational training. The residential vocational school can fill a gap in our present educational system and can play a much larger role than is currently being considered. State governments, therefore, should incorporate residential schools in their plans for vocational education. (Author/JS)",

The Milwaukee, Wisconsin SMSA was chosen as the site of the project. The project determined the extent to which information provided by state employment services meets the goals of the Vocational Education Act of 1963. The study found that curriculum planning can be served best by current employment estimates and short-run projections for specific occupations. Although none of the five methods was found to be fully satisfactory, the report recommends the use of a modified Area Skill Survey technique, possibly combined with certain aspects of  other techniques for particular situations.

Scores from 36 aptitude, interest, and personality measures were accumulated for approximately 1,600 prospective vocational high school students as well as a progress record for each of these students while attending the vocational high school. Multivariate analyses conducted on antecedent and criterion data formed the bases for data information conversion procedures used in the field tests involving 900 prospective students. Results of the study  support the development of a generalized system of computer-based procedures for data information conversion as both feasible and desirable. Work was started on a generalized Test Validation and Information Feedback System which is scheduled to be operational by late 1970. Project activities will continue with local support. (Author)",

Using a continuous measure of labor supply, the study analyzes separately the labor force behavior of men, women, and youth during the 1966-67 period of high employment. Because of large discouragement effects which were found among marginal workers, the study concludes that present manpower programs underestimate the problem of hidden unemployment. In addition, the discovery that hourly earnings and hours  supplied are inversely related provides support for new policies of income redistribution. Applications of the model in projecting future labor force participation are discussed. (BH)",

Institute objectives were achieved through a variety of activities and presentations by resource speakers, laboratory assignments, case studies, field trips, field work with local agencies, group discussions, and the development of individual plans for action. Each participant completed assignments in layout, reporting, and developing and designing an implementation plan for a public information program at a local educational agency. A total of 24 presentations were made during the institute dealing with public information, the challenges facing the information officer, and the tasks assigned  to institute participants. Evaluation was accomplished through a series of questionnaires administered at the beginning, conclusion, and after several months to measure confidence level and to determine application of skills and knowledge. The institute was rated as excellent, and the followup revealed that many participants found their plan helpful in applying the knowledge and skills to their job.

        "description":"This study was designed to determine whether student response to supervision would be affected by the reinforcement of positive (or negative) attitudes toward five patterns of supervisory behavior as shown in motion pictures. For one group of vocational high school students, attitudes toward the supervisory roles \"Consideration\" and \"Tolerance of Freedom\" were reinforced, and negative attitudes toward \"Structuring Expectations\" and \"Production Emphasis\" were reinforced. For a second group, the opposite reinforcement procedure was employed. The experimental groups did not differ significantly on the before and after tests or adjustment to supervision. However, the group that received negative reinforcement of Consideration and Freedom was rated significantly poorer in adjustment  to supervision than the group that received positive reinforcement of Consideration and Freedom. Reinforcement of negative attitudes toward the more highly valued roles was associated with poor adjustment to supervision after the experiment. A number of theoretical questions need to be answered before the reinforcement of attitudes can be recommended as a method for assisting vocational students to accept supervision. (Author)",

There is a discussion of typical problems brought before the ombudsman, the manner in which ombudsmen have acted upon these problems, the optimum length of time in office, methods for filling the position, benefits of having such a position, and his role in crisis situations.

The thrust of this course is to prepare the student for a role as homemaker and family member in a changing society. It also prepares the student in occupations utilizing home economics knowledge and skills. Home economics subject matters deal almost entirely with values, material culture, decisions and aspirations of people as they operate in daily life. If home economics is to make an effective  contribution to the life and work of culturally and economically disadvantaged youth and help to break the \"cycle of poverty\", a modification of the present economics program is essential.

The objective is not to diminish student interest and achievement in science or the humanities, but rather to bring the various forms of art and art experiences on an acceptance level with other subjects. Art offerings of the participating high schools will be examined and an analysis of the plans and reports for each school will be made to get  a first hand view of the activity in on going arts curriculum development. A basic objective is the effectiveness with which any art program arouses the interest and participation of all of the students. This report covers the organization of the advisory committee of professional artists and of the curriculum development team by the Director. Objectives for the performing arts program are worked out. Development is made of understanding the arts and teaching the arts.

Over 80 musicians and educators throughout the country participated in the developmental work. The major product of this operation was the \"Synthesis\", a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12. In addition, MMCP conducted a separate but related study for the development of an early childhood curriculum, \"Interaction\" and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Lab, The Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program. In the development and study of plans for  teacher re-education 23 workshops for music educators were sponsored by colleges and universities.

The next paper reviews the adult instruction literature, then offers some generalizations, and closes with an exposition of the author's theory of instructional transactions or interactions. Another examines broad educational strategies in terms of social games--learned cultural sequences--which create communication networks conducive to various kinds of learning. Next, adult educators are offered guidelines for competing more effectively for funds and  program support. In another paper, Malcolm Knowles argues the importance of the emerging field of andragogy (the science of helping adults learn) and suggests implications for adult learning environments. The next two look toward a differential psychology of adult learning and adjustment potential, and indicate how adult educators might apply existing knowledge in motivating and working with adults and in choosing appropriate overall strategies. Finally, consideration is given to administrative responsibility for effective, relevant instruction. Six references are included. (LY)",

In the latter endeavor, a model suggested by McNerney and his colleagues was used to organize the analysis of several factors that may influence the decision to initiate medical care. A stratified sample of 574 families was surveyed. Persons in the lower classes have poorer health than the more privileged. Yet, many persons with low incomes go to doctors and dentists,  some as often as or more often than those with greater incomes. The hypothesis proposing a positive relationship between the ability to pay as measured by the possession of health insurance and the initiation of professional medical care is supported by the data, but only with some modifications. The general hypothesis seems to be tenable for the lower status group in the sample, but does not hold true for the higher status families. The family in the higher socioeconomic status group tends to initiate medical care at about the same rate whether it has health insurance or not. (NL)",

These were among the findings: (1) 61% of participants felt that the workshop had great value in meeting individual and professional needs; (2) 68% felt the workshop experience would increase their job  effectiveness; (3) between 61% and 68% rated the three speakers as highly effective; (4) those who saw the workshop as valuable in meeting personal and professional needs tended to be married men, 35 or older, with a baccalaureate degree, at least two academic years of ABE experience, and over ten years' experience in secondary education; (5) those who felt the workshop would increase their performance were most often 35 or older, with a baccalaureate degree, less than a year of ABE experience, and ten or fewer years of other teaching experience.

Consideration was given to such criteria as participation in discussion sessions, use and evaluation of the manuals, relevance and usefulness of the telecasts, suitability of program topics, opinions on the value of the combined approach, and benefits perceived (improved knowledge and ability to serve) as a result of participation. Respondents showed very positive attitudes toward the total program;  but they felt that the relationship of telecasts and study manuals to areas of work and responsibility needed improvement, and remarked that notes taken by the recorder were seldom referred to during discussion sessions. Moreover, the background variables all seemed relevant to certain aspects of participation and perceived program effectiveness. (LY)",

When scores for both workshops were combined, no pair of speakers received less than 3.21 on a  scale of five. (One speaker received extremely high ratings of 4.89 and 4.83 at the two workshops.) None of the 13 workshop topics received a combined rating of less than 3.09 (average or above), and two topics were rated 4.21 or better. Panel presentations, mock hearings, mock trials, and discussion groups received above average overall ratings. However, evaluation activities and group reporting drew slightly below average ratings.

The 20 point Kropp-Verner Evaluation Scale was used, together with a questionnaire designed to obtain background data and participant evaluations (on a five point scale) of specific program elements. Participants were about evenly divided by age (over or under 35) and sex; most had at least a bachelor's degree; and most were employed at the local or regional, rather than the district or state, level. Over half were health educators, and most had had more than ten  years' experience in public health. The instructor received a mean rating of 4.07 (quite effective), Similarly, evaluations of all program topics but one (questioning) were strongly positive.

A study of the characteristics of the two educational systems shows that while each could offer experience and method to the other, they are different and encroaching on each other; and the sharing is happening with uneven unawareness, and without plan or evaluation. To facilitate the sharing, the systems must be joined consciously and intelligently into a system of &quot;continuing education&quot; which would base its theoretical framework on the fact that  human beings are capable of learning different things in different ways throughout their entire lives; all citizens are entitled to a certain level of education at public expense; and that learning is work and students are fully participating citizens. Such a system would put a premium on the operation of individual choice about learning as early in one's life as possible. (PT)",

MIDNY, which stresses educational aspects of community development, was founded to explore ways in which Cooperative Extension could be more effective in urbanizing areas. MIDNY has a flexible, pragmatic &quot;unwritten philosophy&quot; expressed in continuously evolving procedures. Its techniques are dissemination of information, concepts, ideas, and timely news by memos to  professionals; outreach to the general public through radio and telvision; regional meetings and conferences; program planning in conjunction with county extension offices; and work with other organizations and agencies. Needs in such areas as local program planning, liaison of individuals and organizations, involvement of more diverse groups, community development training for extension agents, &quot;do it yourself&quot; information for new planning boards, and consultative aid to the regional planning board, were noted during the initial period (1966-68).

Session 3 was concerned with five questions about independent study: What is it? What are the best means of supporting it? What kind of faculty is needed? What are their roles? How should they be paid? The fourth session underscored the need for careful choice of faculty for the adult degree  program. The commentators in Session 5 indicated that evaluation needs to be varied, comprehensive, and sequential, and that instruments based on normal distributions are appropriate for only some purposes.

Data were drawn from daily student recorder notes, a summary questionnaire, required term papers, interviews and conversations with students, and such theoretical sources as Mouly's \"The Science of Educational Research,\" Stake's \"The Countenance of Educational Evaluation,\" and an Alan Knox chapter in Shaw's \"Administration of Continuing Education.\" The most  successful data collecting instrument was the series of daily notes, designed to provide practice in \"Action Research\" and to provide feedback for modifying subsequent presentations. The Stake model proved to be a useful organizing principle, but the questionnaire needs to be refined through continuous use. Explicit statement of teacher expectations, plus some ongoing supervision, seems desirable; and independent verification of goal achievement might be attempted by formal test procedures. (LY)",

        "description":"Drawing upon role theory, aging is defined as the patterned flow of individuals through a series of positions, roles, role sets, and position sets. From this perspective, the aging process is one of continual adaptation to transitions in social positions and associated role relationships. Data on the retirement transition are used to test and give support to the generalization that processes of anticipatory socialization (previous preparation and adjustment) aid adaptation to social transition. Exploration of the influence of social rank on intensity of socialization experience shows that, the higher the social rank, the higher the anticipatory socialization to retirement. Finally, the theoretical importance of focusing on formal properties which cut across all changes of social  position, is emphasized. (Four tables and 22 footnotes are included.) (Author/LY)",

        "description":"A study among 284 retired men, aged 63 to 99, in three southern Wisconsin communities examined whether aging entails disengagement from social relationships. The correlation between aging and disengagement was analyzed in terms of social class (education, former occupation, present income) for residents of rural, urban, and suburban areas. Except in two cases (persons with nine to 12 years of schooling, and farmers), the hypothesized relationship was confirmed. However, it was not very strong empirically--an indication that variables other than age may be more germane to disengagement among people 65 or older. A theoretical approach to aging is needed which draws on role theory and emphasizes age related transitions in social positions, instead of chronological age as such.

        "description":"Advocates of residential education have isolated three determinants of residential adult education effectiveness: isolation from the outside environment; concentration on content; and group support. This study investigated the independent and collective relationships of different levels of these determinants with cognitive gain and posttest achievement. Eighty-four subjects in four similar five-day introductory programs and 20 in a seven-day advanced program made up the sample. Five of the six hypotheses which guided the study were rejected, but the advanced program resulted in findings which tend to accept the conceptualization of a residential adult education temporary system. Perception of isolation generally related positively to cognitive achievement; content concentration  seemed to be influenced by group support; and group support generally related negatively to cognitive achievement. On the average, achievement was the best predictor of cognitive learning, but group support overrode the positive relationship in the advanced program. The findings indicate functional benefits from use of a temporary system model in residential education studies. They emphasize a vast difference between the theoretical descriptions of residential education and actual program effects. (Author/NL)",

During visits made to personnel directors of firms employing 50 or more persons, complete presentations of the entire program were made. Registration was done by mail. Some students received reimbursement from firms, Veterans' Administration, and foundations. A pay-as-you-learn plan enabled others to attend. The students had a varied educational background. Approximately 8% were members of minority groups; 15% were women. There were four 12-week evening sessions and the students attended once weekly. Data were collected from industrial psychologists, Chambers of Commerce, and professional business associations to provide information for identifying and  hiring experts in management and marketing, electronic data processing, auditing, business law, insurance, advertising, and so on. Full time faculty taught theoretically oriented courses. Life experience courses were offered with certain stipulations. Each student was exposed to three types of personalized counseling: embryonic (three-hour meeting prior to admission), &quot;ad hoc&quot; (meeting anytime at student's request), and mandatory (meeting at the middle of each quadmester).
