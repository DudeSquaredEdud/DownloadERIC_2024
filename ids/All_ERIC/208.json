        "description":"Distance education is an alternative method for delivering academic course work to students unable to attend traditional campus-based classes. This Digest presents information on the many forms of distance education and keys to successful teaching with distance education. Distance education is a method of education in which the learner is physically separated from the teacher and the institution sponsoring the instruction. There must be a teacher, one or more students, and a course or curriculum that the teacher is capable of teaching and the student wants to learn. Originally, distance education involved teachers traveling to remote sites to teach a class or teachers corresponding with students. Technology has raised the quality of individualized distance instruction. There are  video and audio models of distance education that involve broadcast and cable television, satellites, microwaves, fiber optics, and audio graphics. The linking of computer technology via the Internet or CD-ROM with television transmission potentially provides a new dimension to distance education. Distance education can be used for some aspects of most disciplines. It dictates changes in behavior for both teachers and students. Five critical elements for successful distance teaching include: instructor enthusiasm, organization, strong commitment to student interaction, familiarity with technology used in the class, and critical support personnel.

        "author":["Yasin, Said"],
        "description":"This Digest examines U.S. teacher supply and demand, including projections for the next 10 years. For the past 10 years, the supply of public elementary and secondary school teachers has grown. Currently, the number of teachers in the United States is 3.1 million, 2,666,034 of whom teach in public schools. The number is projected to increase by 1.1 percent annually to a total of 3.46 million by 2008. The projected demand for teachers may outpace the projected growth in the supply. Some researchers estimate that districts will have to hire 200,000 teachers annually over the next decade to keep pace with rising student enrollments and teacher retirements. Other researchers note that shortages are limited to particular regions and communities. Urban and poor communities will have  the greatest need for teachers. Most teachers are female and white, while 35 percent of their students are minorities. From 1989-1995, enrollment in teacher education institutions increased by 5.5 percent. The largest increases occurred among Asian/Pacific and Hispanic Americans. Most students in teaching schools and colleges were white and female. The distribution of teachers across states and regions is uneven. Some states typically produce more teachers than they need while others need more than they produce. This maldistribution also exists within states, partly due to salary discrepancies. (Contains 8 references.) (SM)",

In the first paper, &quot;Trying To Predict School Dropouts at Grade Seven,&quot; researchers developed an instrument, &quot;Is This True for Me?&quot; based on the Junior Index of Motivation (JIM) originally developed in the 1960s, along with procedures for measuring student motivation and assessing risk. Information collected from several middle level schools in six urban districts was analyzed, and a report was prepared for each school and school district that was involved. This instrument was studied in more detail as described in the second paper, &quot;Further Development and Validation of a Motivation Index.&quot; Teachers in 33 middle level or junior high  schools in 6 urban districts administered the &quot;Is This True for Me?&quot; scale to all seventh graders. Results indicate that the revised JIM scale, &quot;Is This True for Me?&quot; is a valid measure of students' motivation to learn in school. It should be a useful predictor of the likelihood of young people dropping out of school before graduation. The scale is attached. (SLD)",

        "description":"In North Carolina, Alternative Learning Programs (ALP) is a designation applied to a variety of activities, locations, and student characteristics. This report focuses on descriptive information about the state's ALP efforts, teachers, and the students they serve. Two hundred and fifteen schools and programs met the evaluation criteria as ALPs. Seventy-five identified themselves as alternative schools, while 140 identified themselves as alternative programs. Half of all the ALPs relied on the state for at least three-quarters of their support. The predominant ALP setting was a separate classroom in an existing school (41%). In general, students served in an ALP were at-risk students, and about half of middle and high school students had repeated one or more grades. Although the  ALPs have multiple goals, they almost universally included academic achievement with a strong emphasis on self-esteem and social behaviors. A significant portion of the ALPs do not serve long-term suspended students, expelled students, or exceptional students, raising the question of how needs of these groups are being met. Most students had achieved &quot;desirable&quot; status by the time they exited the program, but many students had not. It was not possible to determine whether the percentage of students kept in schools was higher than it would be without the ALPs, but it is evident that a genuine effort is being made by many programs. Two appendixes contain evaluation questions asked and a discussion of the method for estimating the number of ALP teachers. (Contains 5 figures and 32 tables.)  (SLD)",

        "description":"In 1996, North Carolina began a 5-year evaluation of Alternative Learning Programs (ALPs). This report describes selected outcomes for students who participated in ALPs during 1995-96. These outcomes include performance on North Carolina End-of-Grade tests (elementary school) and performance on the End-of-Course(EOC) tests (high school) for Algebra 1, English 1, and Biology. Dropout information is also provided. Only about 10% of ALP students were proficient in these three EOC tests, in comparison with about 40 to 50% of the overall student population in North Carolina. The same was true with the End-of-Grade tests, with ALP students performing well below the general student population. There was generally more growth in end-of-grade scores for students with longer contact with  ALPs. Findings show that ALP students have significant educational deficiencies that put them at risk of failure. ALP programs may be helping students improve academically, but they are also dealing with significant behavioral problems that take time away from academic instruction. Data also suggest that early intervention is most likely to be successful with ALP students. (Contains 22 figures.) (SLD)",

This report contains in-depth case studies of four ALPs during the 1996-97 school year. The ALPs were selected to represent different types of programs in the state, and include one middle school, two high school, and one elementary school programs. The case studies were designed to look at issues of student attitudes, behavior, and problem solving. Across the programs, it was found that ALP staff combine caring with high expectations and that they determine program effectiveness by the success of individual students. ALP students do not usually maintain their ties with the schools they have left, and many ALPs are regarded by students as dumping grounds or &quot;junior jails.&quot; Many staff  members do not have adequate training or support, and the programs lack adequate facilities, materials, and budgets. Based on case study findings, recommendations are made for improvement of staffing and resources for ALPs. Small class size, an individualized and experiential teaching format, and a caring faculty are essential if ALPs are to function effectively. (SLD)",

        "description":"This evaluation brief examines several sources of data to show the areas and grade levels in which interventions related to at-risk behavior in public schools are most needed. The evaluation was part of an ongoing look at alternative learning programs in North Carolina. The sources of data include North Carolina's annual report on school violence for 1994-95, selected data from the 1995 North Carolina &quot;Youth Risk Behavior Survey,&quot; and portions of the 1995 teacher end-of-grade and end-of-course surveys. Data show that teacher and administrator reports of increased school violence are consistent, and that violent and disruptive behaviors are more prevalent in middle school grades. The use of drugs and violent incidents with higher stakes are more prevalent in the high school  grades. It also appears that incidents of several types of disruptive and violent behavior reported by students are higher than incidents known or reported by school officials. It is theorized that middle school violence may be higher because middle school students are in a developmental phase that results in higher levels of acting out, testing limits, and participating in relatively &quot;low-stakes&quot; incidents. It may also be that disruptive students drop out before they get to high school, or that middle school personnel have higher expectations and less tolerance of disruptive behaviors than high school teachers do.

        "description":"Part I of the Learning Climate in Schools evaluation brief looked at violence and disruptive behavior in the North Carolina public schools from several perspectives, including that of teachers expressed in an annual survey. Part II examines teacher perceptions of learning and organizational climates using another set of teacher responses to the end-of-grade and end-of-course (high school) surveys teachers completed in 1995. Survey results show that high school teachers have less positive views about their learning climate and school culture than do teachers in grades three through eight. Agreement with positive items became lower with each successive grade, until no more than half of the high school teachers agreed with any item. In spite of the more frequent problems reported in  the middle school grades, middle school teachers reported higher feelings of safety than did high school teachers. It may be that the type of problems at the high school level lead to lower feelings of safety than do the types of problems reported at the middle school grades. Special challenges were noted across all grades in identifying and intervening in student problems early, enforcing discipline consistently and fairly, and providing teacher input into curriculum, teaching, and policy decisions. Differences were also noted in the positive responses of teachers in different subject areas at the high school level. (SLD)",

In North Carolina, 77 schools started block scheduling in 1995-96, bringing the total number of blocked schools in the state to 207. A previous evaluation compared 1995 End-of-Course (EOC) Test scores for block-scheduled (blocked) and nonblocked schools. This report presents results of the analysis of 1996 EOC data for five core subjects: English I; Algebra I; Economics, Legal, and Political Systems; Biology; and U.S. History. Analysis of the EOC data does not change previous conclusions that there are essentially no significant differences between groups of blocked and corresponding nonblocked schools in terms of student performance on state EOC tests. There are also no significant differences among groups of schools blocked  for different numbers of years. While the overall picture is one of equivalence, after adjusting for starting point and parent education level, scores for blocked schools were higher in English, Biology, and U.S. History in 1994, and scores on all five EOC tests were higher for 1995. Only U.S. History was significantly higher for 1996 EOC tests. More data points will be needed to determine if the lower scores for 1996 represent a trend or a fluctuation. (SLD)",

It introduces ways to assess the capacities of various professional development programs, curriculum transformation projects, diversity initiatives, and study abroad opportunities to realize complex cultural objectives. It introduces a content-focused form of program evaluation that indexes program quality to the culture-revealing features and effects of goals and objectives, program designs, learning opportunities, and program outcomes. Each of the three parts of the book examines particular aspects of cultural education program evaluation. Part 1 emphasizes the input side of the program by focusing on conceptual and programmatic  dilemmas that face evaluators as they try to assess the quality of the cultural education provided for participants. Part 2 addresses the evaluation of program outcomes, suggesting ways to evaluate changes in the professional behavior of participants and the quality of instructional materials. Part 3 focuses on the relationship of program inputs and outputs simultaneously, emphasizing two themes of importance for evaluators: the economic dimensions of cultural evaluation programs and the issue of cultural bias in the assessment of students, along with the need for new performance-based assessment. Among the assumptions on which this book rests is the central assumption that cultural education program evaluators need expertise in cultural analysis, qualitative and quantitative methods of  data collection and analysis, and the forms and functions of program evaluation.

The four themes of First Steps (reading, writing, spelling, and oral language) are organized around a development continuum of milestones along the child's path to literacy. In First Steps, the teacher locates the child's place along the continuum for a skill, and works from that point. In 1992, the Western Australia Ministry of Education evaluated First Steps and its continua. This report evaluates the Spelling and Writing Continua and presents teacher responses to questionnaires sent as part of the evaluation. In  all, 80 teachers of grades 1, 3, 5, and 7 completed questionnaires about First Steps spelling and writing and the ways in which their students fit the continua. Findings indicate a high level of understanding among the classroom teachers participating in this evaluation. The Writing Continuum was considered to depict the development of children's writing competencies validly, and the Spelling Continuum was also approved, with two problems often identified. Indicators in the Transitional Phase were not considered more difficult that those in the developmentally earlier Phonetic Phase, and indicators in the Phonetic Phase were generally thought to be less difficult than those in the earlier Semi-Phonetic Phase. The key indicators in both continua were approved, and teachers of Years 1 and  5, who were specifically questioned, regarded the First Steps continua as validly depicting the development of literacy in the children that they teach. Four appendixes provide questionnaire results for particular indicators and developmental phases, and a fifth appendix detailing all teacher responses is available on request.

The four themes of First Steps (reading, writing, spelling, and oral language) are organized around a development continuum of milestones along the child's path to literacy. This interim report presents preliminary findings from two tests administered to First Steps students as the first part of a time series study. The main aim of this report is to examine the impact of First Steps on the reading and writing ability of Year 5 students while taking into account the effect of socioeconomic status background. Reading  comprehension data were available from 665 year-5 students in 31 classes in 19 schools, and writing ability data came from 736 students. There was evidence that First Steps is making a difference in the reading ability of students, with suggestions that the effect of First Steps seems stronger for children of low socioeconomic status background. Results from the writing exercise suggest that First Steps is having a positive effect on the writing ability of children regardless of their socioeconomic status. Eight appendixes present statistical information, details about the reading and writing tests, and further descriptions of analyses procedures. (Contains 19 exhibits and 3 references.) (SLD)",

The four themes of First Steps (reading, writing, spelling, and oral language) are organized around a development continuum of milestones along the child's path to literacy. This report documents the impact of First Steps on teachers and schools by considering descriptions of its impact provided by principals and teachers in a sample of Western Australia schools. Responses were received from 30 Year-1 teachers, 34 Year-5 teachers, 12 focus teachers, and 15 principals. Questionnaire responses reveal that the general  feeling in schools about First Steps is positive, and that its teaching strategies and materials have been well received. Principals felt that the First Steps focus teachers were very helpful in introducing First Steps into the schools, and that the professional development provided by the First Steps program was very helpful also. Principals and teachers thought that one of the major achievements in First Steps schools was the improved performance of students, and another was improved teaching skills. First Steps was particularly well-regarded in schools that had been involved with the program for more than a year. Two appendixes present response rates to the questionnaires and the texts of the questionnaires for principals, focus teachers, and teachers in First Steps and other schools.

First Steps is organized around reading, writing, spelling, and oral language;  children's skills are organized along developmental continua. This study, conducted by Murdoch University, was an attempt to find out if the effects of teachers using First Steps strategies could be measured in terms of student achievement. Participating schools (n=22) tested their Year 3 and Year 7 students with the Monitoring Standards in Education (MSE) reading and writing tests, and their teachers completed a questionnaire regarding their training in and use of First Steps strategies. In all, 889 Year-3  and 902 Year-7 students were tested. The analysis adjusted and removed effects of students' socioeconomic status, ethnic background, first language other than English, and recent arrival in Australia. After removing effects of these factors, there was a positive relationship between the degree of implementation of First Steps and student results on literacy tests, a finding that supports the position that First Steps was assisting students to master literacy skills more successfully than traditional methods. The effects of First Step were much stronger for Year 3, and, in fact, the understanding and use of First Steps were much higher in Year 3.

Traditional standard setting methods ask panelists to estimate how well a randomly selected hypothetical examinee who is representative of a well-defined target group, usually a minimally competent candidate (MCC), will perform on each item on a test. Item performance estimates are difficult for panelists to make accurately; however, the validity of these performance standards rests on the ability of the panelist to conceptualize the skills and abilities of the MCC accurately and make accurate performance estimates. This study investigated the utility of a strategy to aid in the conceptualization of the MCC. Panelists were asked to envision the MCC and the typical  student, and then make performance estimates, first for the typical student and then for the MCC. Results showed that the strategy resulted in significantly lower performance standards than did the traditional approach. Validity data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the judgments resulting from the experimental and traditional approaches. More research is needed to clarify the utility of concept-focusing strategy on the judgmental performance standards. (Contains 2 tables and 10 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Items were compiled from the answers of students in a previous study about how their instructors helped to reduce anxiety. Means and standard deviations were computed for each item. Ranking at the top for reducing anxiety was allowing tests to be \"open book/open note,\" followed by working with a partner in the computer lab. The next five items were focused on instructor behavior and characteristics: positive attitude, encouragement,  reassurance, recognition of anxiety, and humor. The use of rubrics, guidelines for completing and evaluating written and oral projects, ranked in the top half of items indicated by students as reducing their anxiety. Lowest in the rankings were doing work that was \"real world\" oriented, support of peers outside the class, and ability to get an \"A\" in the class. Working with a group in class and outside of class on a research project ranked just below the middle of the items but showed more variability than the other items. As the literature supports, cooperative learning can be both anxiety reducing and anxiety producing, depending on the composition of the group. (Author/SLD)",

The psychometric properties of the 1998 census assessment are also examined. The Florida Writing Assessment Program evaluates the proficiency of students in generating a written response to an assigned topic (prompt) within a 45-minute period. In each grade, students are asked to respond to one of two prompts. The census assessment of Florida's students began in 1992 at grade 4. In January 1998, the census assessment involved 150,600 fourth  graders in 1,548 schools. In February, a census assessment was conducted of 139,810 8th graders in 653 schools and 117,634 10th graders in 526 schools. New prompts were field tested in all three grades in February.

Solutions to these problems include developing checklists and rubrics that break complex tasks, such as writing research proposals and master's theses, into component parts, using the checklists and rubrics to guide students' work, and then grading the students on how well they complete each component. Included in the appendix are sample checklists for scoring content, quality of writing, and adherence to American  Psychological Association (APA) style in research proposals, as well as rubrics for master's theses and group research project presentations.

The purpose of the study was to estimate the validity of the HOBET as a predictor of student success and to compare the two examinations as predictors of grade point average (GPA) for students in the health care field. The sample consisted of 320 students from a small, private, health-care oriented college in the mid-south. The college offers bachelor's degrees in nursing and in health sciences. The data were compiled from fall 1995 through fall 1998. The variables examined included ACT scores, HOBET scores, total credit hours, and GPA. All students were given the HOBET only after scoring 20 on the ACT. The two examinations were  correlated for this sample, and both were correlated with GPA. The HOBET was a better predictor of GPA than the ACT. The correlation coefficient was smaller than that found in a previous study (Educational Resources, 1993), probably because of the homogeneity of the sample. (Contains 5 tables and 10 references.)

The dataset is from a classic study by Holzinger and Swinefors (1939) in which more than 20 ability test were administered to 301 middle school students to discern which abilities determined overall academic performance. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were run with the dichotomized variable as the independent factor to compare the reduction in effect size in the ANOVAs with the effect size of regression run with the intact continuous independent variable. The effect sizes of the ANOVAs that were run with the dichotomized variable were about half of the regression effect  sizes run with the unaltered independent variable. Each of the effect sizes after dichotomization would fit into a lower category, resulting in a serious underestimation of the substantive effect. (Contains 3 tables and 16 references.) (SLD)",

Twenty experts in early childhood education were invited to attend one of two sessions in a university business school team decision productivity laboratory. During each session the participants were asked to identify the key characteristics of an ideal prekindergarten education program, rate the characteristics of the entire group, and identify programs they felt best embodied these characteristics. Both groups arrived at similar key characteristics of effective key programs and produced numerous examples of these programs. The  power of the decision laboratory was seen in the collaborative work process. Using networked computers, participants contributed ideas and opinions on the prompts, simultaneously and anonymously, during electronic brainstorming. The technology also enabled participants to rate or rank all responses, accelerating group consensus while eliminating group intimidation.

The personality dynamics model itself, beyond its theoretical bases, includes the following techniques to assist the individual in the self-evaluation process leading to plan development: journaling, shadowing, and spiritual guidance. These techniques can be supplemented by others more specific to a particular personality perspective. The second step in the self-evaluation process involves the use of these techniques and others in the development activities and supplementation of the activities with mentoring and coaching as the individual implements his or her plan. The model in its development form has four dimensions:  (1) the overarching theoretical frame of reference; (2) the methods for working toward insight from this frame of reference; (3) the ways of interpreting that insight with a view to planning development; and (4) an approach to continuous evaluation of the development plan.

The Tennessee State University course, Advanced Science in the Elementary School, is a team-taught doctoral level course for teachers trained in a hands-on science reform project to develop higher quality science teaching and student learning. During the fall semester of 1998, 12 teachers enrolled in this course located and critiqued research articles that support effective teaching strategies such as cooperative groups, inquiry, and the learning cycle. Then these participants wrote papers that described how the findings connected with the project and their classroom teaching. In this course,  inquiry-based lesson plans were also prepared, science curricular materials were evaluated, and science activities were synthesized to align with state and national guidelines. One semester after taking the course, the teachers were asked how they applied the research findings in their classes and in leadership roles in the project. Their work, videotapes of the presentations, and followup responses were analyzed. Results suggest that once teachers see a connection between research and the classroom, the research becomes of value to them. Schools should provide professional development opportunities that encourage teachers to explore the value of research to their profession. Appendixes contain information on the course, the titles of research papers, and the postcourse survey.  (SLD)",

The Critical Thinking committee of the school system's Graduation 2010 initiative explored various ways to promote critical thinking in the classroom and arrived at a program to put chess boards in the classrooms and to encourage student, and teacher, participation. The program begins with kindergarten students. Because many teachers did not play chess themselves, the school district developed a manual and a teaching aid so that chess could be taught in the school. As implemented, the program is to be a 5-year curriculum plan with implementation through five stages. (SLD)",

The sample included first-time freshmen enrolled during seven semesters (n=942). Variables were: (1) completion of the prerequisite requirement for the English course; (2) student age; (3) ACT Assessment composite score; (4) ACT reading score; (5) part-time or full-time status; (6) public or nonpublic state high school; (7) gender; and (8) traditional or General Educational Development high school diploma. Very few statistically significant relationships were found between various predictor variables and student success or failure. The study did not  validate the need for current prerequisite for first college English courses. Results suggest that the current developmental education may not be providing the preparation needed for successful completion of beginning English courses. The model did confirm prior findings that ACT subscores are a valid predictor of success. (Contains 15 references.) (SLD)",

As part of a general study of progress toward educational goals in Kentucky, an investigation was conducted of the use of the ICC map to describe educational technology used in middle schools in Kentucky and, if the map could be used, the nature of the relationship between the level of implementation of educational technology and Kentucky's high-stakes assessment of academic achievement. Ten middle schools representing 5 levels of performance were followed longitudinally, and data from the ICC technology map compared with the results were of  teacher interviews. In the sample of schools studied, there was a positive relationship between the degree of implementation of education technology in a school and achievement gains posted by the school's students, but it could not be determined whether the gains were a function of the implementation of the technology. The implementation of educational technology may be a marker of a school's willingness to implement reforms. Findings also suggest that another iteration of the ICC Map of Educational Technology would be appropriate to reflect the actual situation in the schools more accurately.

The first two studies were, respectively, state and national level stratified random probability samples of provider and patients, and the latter two were prospective repeated interview designs focusing on urban networks. All studies received multistage response rates of about 60%, except DATOS, which achieved about 40%. From before treatment to after treatment, each study revealed  across-the-board positive changes in drug use, crime, and health status. Clients in SROS shows consistently fewer changes than others on comparable variables, something that may result from its longer reference periods and the lower precision of the variables selected to measure long-term change. Researchers should further the potential of these large data sets to capture differences in client populations, organization of services, and clinical practices that may explain differential outcomes and costs.

This report considers challenges to the validity of results in treatment effectiveness studies due to four factors: (1) nonrandom entry to treatment from the population needing treatment; (2) nonrandom selection of treatment providers by researchers for follow-up studies; (3) non-cooperation of the selected treatment providers with the research protocol; and (4) incomplete enrollment and follow-up of clients treated by the cooperating providers. Both kinds of selection/entry and both kinds of non-response are potential sources of bias, so both should be major concerns in the design and analysis of substance abuse  treatment follow-up surveys. The response characteristics of four large-scale multi-site studies carried out in the early and mid 1990s are summarized and assessed on a comparative basis. Recommendations are provided for minimizing bias in future studies, and statistical methods are proposed for evaluating biases due to the process of entry into treatment and non-response.

        "description":"The rediscovery of a role in extending social organization and bringing &quot;order&quot; to distressed neighborhoods has become an educational reform motif in the United States. A full-service school that links education and other support services can contribute to the social capital needed to improve children's learning. While it is a laudable concept, the full-service school is in conflict with many 20th century traditions, such as bureaucratization, professional distancing, fragmented and categorical programming, and only weak partnerships among educators and families and communities. The results of coordinated children's service initiatives in the United States have been mixed, with evidence that the changes promised by the concept of full-service schooling threatens many  institutionalized features of U.S. schooling. Even more demanding is the idea that the schools should now play an active role in the revitalization of their communities. The added issues addressed in a transition toward &quot;enterprise&quot; schools performing this reform function are major. To accomplish these goals will take a serious rethinking of school, community, and family connections. The issue comes down to a question of how to join aspects of the two competing strategies, professional coordinated services and community development and empowerment, into workable approaches for schools in partnership with parents, community organizations, and other agencies. The best answer is to encourage experimentation to explore the potential of enterprise schools and alternative strategies to the  joining of the two strategies. (Contains 59 references.) (SLD)",

This paper provides an overview of findings from the preliminary analysis of the study's first year database. In the first section, the rationale and the extant research base on Title I schoolwide programs that provided the research are discussed. In the second section, the study's research design and findings from the preliminary analysis are presented. During the 1997-98 school year, researchers gathered data from 33 schools in 9 urban districts and 4  countywide districts. Of these, 17 were considered more effective schools, and 16 were identified as less effective schools. The concluding section of the paper contains an exploratory discussion of implications for policy development in light of the upcoming Title I reauthorization. The preliminary findings from this project suggest the need for closer links between the federal government and school districts in helping schoolwide programs develop coherent instructional strategies. These federal initiatives constitute what is termed &quot;procedural accountability&quot; in Title I schoolwide policy. Procedural accountability is a useful way to measure the extent to which knowledge is used effectively to meet the legislative expectations of the Title I program.

The findings were drawn from a survey analyzed by the Educational Testing Service in which parents were asked their opinions on the public elementary schools in their neighborhood, their views on crime and neighborhood choice, and whether education or crime was such a serious concern that they would like to move. In most cities, between 70 and 95% of households with children were satisfied with their public elementary schools, although in more than half of the cities, upwards of 16% were dissatisfied with their public schools. In most cities, poor schools would prompt only a fraction of households to move. Cities with the largest percentage of households that were dissatisfied  did not necessarily have the most intense dissatisfaction. Cities in which there was the highest degree of satisfaction were also the cities with the greatest percentage of children in public schools. In nearly every city, households with children were more concerned about crime than the schools. The differences in school satisfaction between the cities and suburbs were pronounced in most metropolitan areas. However, in the suburbs, as in the cities, concerns related to crime outweighed concerns about the schools. An appendix discusses data collection and survey methodology. (SLD)",

        "description":"Given the strong interest in school-based mentoring programs, Public/Private Ventures visited two exemplary mentoring programs chosen by the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America (BBBSA). One program was in Green County, Oklahoma, and the other in Jacksonville, Florida. Researchers talked with parents, teachers, children, and mentors to learn more about how the programs operated and the effects they have on the students and the school. The visits led to four conclusions: (1) school-based mentoring programs reach volunteers and youth who would not participate in community-based programs; (2) school staff provide information to BBBSA staff to help create strong matches and supervise these matches closely; (3) mentoring in the school context can provide volunteers with support and  enable them to act as educational advocates for youth; and (4) strong relationships can develop within the school context, and these relationships can make a difference in the lives of youth. Study findings suggest that involving youth in well-run school-based mentoring programs can be an effective way to address the needs of disadvantaged youth. (Contains 17 endnotes.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The past several years have seen basic changes in policies and programs concerning poverty, work, and workforce development. The essence of the changes is putting work first, and many states and localities are building &quot;Work First&quot; into welfare-to-work programs funded under Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, and many are adopting Job Training Partnership Act funds to support the new policy. In implementing &quot;work first&quot; policies, it is necessary to look at and do something about the realities of the labor market. One of the most important of these is the need for skills that working does not teach. This report describes a number of programs that combine skills training and &quot;Work First&quot; employment. Three different models of &quot;Work First&quot; training and employment are described.  In one, the hub organization provides the training, and others provide the &quot;Work First&quot; jobs. A second approach has the hub organization provide the jobs while others provide the training. In the third model, the hub organization provides both jobs and training. Whatever their organizational framework, all the programs described in this report rely on multisource funding strategies. Some of the principles common to the programs described are identified. Descriptions of seven &quot;Work First&quot; programs show how they operate, are funded, and who benefits from their operation. (SLD)",

The most effective antiviolence efforts focus on measures that prevent all types of children's bad conduct: aggression, bullying, and hate bullying. The most effective school antiviolence programs use four strategies: (1) teaching social competence; (2) creating a positive, calm environment; (3) establishing behavior standards; and (4) establishing rules and regulations for responding to violence. Violence prevention efforts need to move beyond the classroom to encompass the playground and to enlist the support of parents. The best strategies to help children develop social competence are those implemented as  part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to nurturing children at home, in school, and in the community.

        "description":"Violence at school can have a significant impact on young people, affecting their mental health, academic achievement, and socialization and adjustment. This brief examines that impact. It begins by defining school violence and examining the prevalence of exposure to, and victimization from, violence at school within a developmental framework. The most serious form of victimization, homicide at school, is discussed, and the early warning signs of the perpetration of violence are identified. The brief ends with a discussion of the behavioral and mental health consequences of exposure and victimization, and implications for strategies to ameliorate them. The challenge for educators is to react appropriately to warning signs of violence, but not to overreact. To respond adequately,  schools need to employ appropriately trained mental health professionals who will be consistently available to students and staff. Mental health services should be considered part of the basic services provided to all students and staff. (Contains 13 references.) (SLD)",

Findings to date indicate that preventing delinquency requires accurate identification of the risk factors that increase the likelihood of delinquent behavior and the protective factors that enhance positive adolescent development. Overall, data indicate a consistent relationship between a greater number of family transitions and a higher level of delinquency and drug use. The magnitude of differences between youth with no family transitions and those with many transitions was similar across  the three cities, and the relationships were statistically significant in Rochester and Denver. These findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of delinquency and drug use. (Contains 6 figures and 15 references.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Shelden, Randall G."],
        "description":"The juvenile justice system is exploring alternatives to the use of secure facilities as a means of juvenile crime control. Some of these alternatives are known as diversion programs. This bulletin offers an overview of the diversion programs and evaluation findings from the Detention Diversion Advocacy Project (DDAP), a disposition case advocacy program operated in San Francisco, California, under the auspices of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. Diversion is an attempt to divert, or channel, youthful offenders from the juvenile justice system. The concept behind the DDAP approach is disposition case advocacy, the efforts of lay persons or nonlegal experts acting on behalf of youthful offenders at disposition hearings. The case management model provides frequent and  consistent support and supervision to youth and their families. The evaluation of the DDAP program concentrated on 271 youthful offenders in DDAP and 271 comparisons. Findings suggest that, if recidivism is the key measure of success, youth referrals to DDAP have been more successful than those not referred. Data from the study do suggest that the risk scores developed for study participants are, in themselves, relatively poor predictors of outcome. However, when one puts the accuracy of the risk scores aside, findings still show that DDAP accepted youth, who might otherwise have been in detention for days or weeks, had recidivism rates that were nearly 50% less than the comparison group. These findings support the idea that intensive supervision over time, coupled with placement in  community-based programs, enables the DDAP youth to lead relatively normal lives and reduce the likelihood of further contact with the juvenile justice system.

Information was collected from state departments of education and interviews with state officials. Since 1995 there has been a steady rise in all aspects of standards-based reform. The number of states with clear and specific standards has almost doubled in the past 5 years from 13 to 22. Virtually all states have currently aligned, or plan soon to align, their state testing programs with their standards efforts. In 1995, 33 states reported aligned tests; today, 49 states report test alignment. The consequences associated with standards have increased significantly. Thirteen states have promotion  policies based in part on state assessment results. Graduation requirements tied to at least 10th-grade standards have been implemented in 14 states, and incentives for students to reach standards are now in place in almost half the states. In 1996 only 10 states focused on students struggling to meet the standards, but in 1999, 29 states concentrate on these students. Although serious incentives and consequences tied to standards are being established, states still need to provide more resources to help students at risk. (SLD)",

Overall, juvenile violence is committed primarily by males and often occurs intra-racially among minority groups. The majority of juvenile offenders are 16- and 17-year-olds. Many violent offenders live in disruptive and disorganized families and communities, although the majority of youth in such environments are not involved in serious delinquency.

        "description":"When serving economically disenfranchised African American children, school systems often unconsciously respond from a racist and class biased paradigm. Teachers often unconsciously operate from a framework of low expectations for these students' success. Society often supports the notion of students getting by with less because less is all the schools believe they can do. The Urban Atlanta Coalition Compact (UACC) is one current reform effort. As researchers engage with UACC schools that are struggling with ways to create better learning environments for African American children, they have observed that racism is a significant factor in the failure of schools to meet these students' academic needs. A 1997-99 research effort explored what could be done as a collaboration of  schools and universities to remedy this situation. This paper discusses the early manifestations of racism encountered in the formation of the UACC project during its planning meetings with the steering committee, the boards of education, school leaders, parents, and other parties. Because of these experiences, part of the research was driven by the question of whether the prejudices, stereotypes, and misconceptions of well-intentioned educators sabotage educational reform efforts. The paper also explores reasons for the resistance of mainstream educators to discuss the impact of racist politics, economics, and educational theory on the school's capacity to teach all children.

Principals from 32 schools discussed their leadership style and strategies that contributed to school and student performance in their diverse schools. For each of 13 strategies, this document presents essential steps for implementation. The 13 strategies are: (1) create a consistent reading program; (2) set clear goals and standards; (3) coordinate curriculum; (4) build strong team faculty; (5) hold teachers accountable; (6) monitor both students and teachers; (7) foster individual teacher support; (8) encourage professional development; (9)  ensure philosophical consistency; (10) invest in performance; (11) instill a love of learning through reading; (12) work together; and (13) increase time on task. The document concludes that good principal leadership is essential to positive school change. The data show that students can flourish academically regardless of their background, and that race, poverty, and other urban challenges are not reasons for failure. Students in urban schools can be very successful if the local conditions and school leadership are right. (SM)",

        "description":"This report summarizes current knowledge and research on the quality and reliability of death rates by race and Hispanic origin in official mortality statistics of the United States produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It provides a quantitative assessment of bias in death rates by race and Hispanic origin and identifies areas for targeted research. Death rates are based on information on deaths from death certificates filed in the states and compiled into a national database by NCHS, and on population data from the Census Bureau. Researchers summarized selected studies of race/Hispanic origin misclassification and undercoverage on deaths and population. They made estimates on the separate and joint bias on death rates by race and Hispanic origin from the  two sources. They made simplifying assumptions about the stability of the biases over time and among age groups. Original results are presented using an expanded, updated database from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study. Death rates for all groups show net effects of race misclassification and undercoverage. For whites and blacks, published death rates are overstated in official publications by 1.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, resulting mainly from undercounts in the census. Death rates for other minority groups are understated as follows: American Indians, 21 percent; Asian or Pacific Islanders: 11 percent; and Hispanics, 2 percent. (SM)",

Section 1, &quot;Sexual Orientation Development,&quot; describes how individuals develop their sexual orientation, focusing on the sexual development of gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents. Section 2, &quot;Reparative Therapy,&quot; describes reparative therapy (also known as conversion therapy) as psychotherapy aimed at eliminating homosexual desires. It is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all of the major health and mental health professions. Section 3, &quot;Transformational Ministries,&quot; describes transformational  ministry as the use of religion to eliminate homosexual desires. This section notes that this view of homosexuality as outside of God's will is not representative of the views of all people of faith. Section 4, &quot;Relevant Legal Principles,&quot; examines general legal principles concerning the rights of lesbian, gay, and bisexual students and the federal, state, and local laws protecting such students from discrimination and harm.

Schools are places where children can learn social and citizenship skills that help them live harmoniously and become contributing members of society. Research shows that parents recognize that getting along with others is a necessary skill. Though many of today's public schools are racially and economically isolated, these shortcomings do not diminish the importance of teaching children to be tolerant of differences and to understand and respect other cultures and other people's views. It is important for children to learn tolerance and respect because: the United States is becoming more diverse; the workforce is becoming more diverse and the economy more international; and  national cohesion and social harmony depend on people overcoming divisions and understanding each other. Public schools are good places for children to learn respect and tolerance of others because: they better reflect the diversity of American society than private schools; they are a place where children learn social skills naturally; and throughout U.S. history, they have helped to promote social harmony.

In 1995, the ICAE engaged in a strategic planning process that resulted in the formation of the Gender Education Office (GEO). The GEO was charged with the responsibility of developing a set of core indicators to measure governments' political will in relation to implementing programs to improve the adult educational opportunities available to women and outcomes achieved by women in adult education programs. Those indicators were used to study the situation of women in Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The separate studies conducted in each country revealed a number of  challenges faced by women throughout Africa, including the following: continuing underdevelopment; high rates of illiteracy; lack of access to education and training; increasing inequality because of religious and cultural traditions and a global rise in fundamentalism; and lack of women in leadership to articulate women's interests. Strategies recommended for improving the situation of African women included broadening the scope of adult education to adult learning and linking local, regional, and global strategies to improve women's access to adult education.

Research methods were as follows: case studies of 12 work-based learning programs at 9 sites located in both urban and rural areas; a survey of employers participating in 5 programs; and a survey of a comparison group of nonparticipating employers in those same labor markets. With regard to employers' motivations for participating in the program, employers who responded to the survey tended to characterize their involvement in philanthropic terms. In face-to-face interviews, employers cited multiple reasons--philanthropic,  self-interested, and collective--for their involvement. Large firms and those with human resources practices generally considered to be &quot;high performance&quot; were more likely to participate. Three measures assessed the quality of work-based learning: type of occupation interns were placed in; presence or absence of particular program characteristics; and amount of internship time spent learning. Paid placements and those in which the firms intended to hire the interns permanently rated better on quality measures. Public and nonprofit organizations offered higher quality internships on some measures. Firms that engaged in high-performance workplace practices also provided higher-quality internships.

It compared long-term wage growth for two cohorts of young white men: the original cohort that entered the labor force in the late 1960s at the end of the post-World War II economic boom and the recent cohort that entered in the early 1980s after the onset of economic restructuring. Long-term wage growth between the ages 16-36 declined and became significantly more unequal for the recent cohort. The rising demand for education and skill in the new labor market apparently benefitted only those with four-year college degrees. Rising  inequality in wage growth was found in all education groups. Working while enrolled and interrupting and returning to school were the dominant pathways to educational attainment. A second set of analyses focused on the recent cohort. Multiple regressions showed educational pathways had a strong effect on long-term wage growth: working while enrolled had a positive impact and interrupted schooling had a negative one. Career choices about industry and occupation mattered. Taking an academic track in high school paid off for workers who get some college credit or enter occupations requiring cognitive skill. Applied and practical fields of study offered the most long-term wage growth to college graduates. (Appendixes contain 19 references and a permanent wage estimation model.)  (YLB)",

        "description":"Education reform in the 1980s and 1990s emerged from a preoccupation with productivity and economic performance. In the 1980s, the country's education system was blamed for slowing productivity growth and weakening international competitiveness. By the end of the 1990s, the economic context had changed dramatically; unemployment rates were at historical lows, stock prices remained high, and impressive developments associated with computers and the Internet seemed only to scratch the surface of the potential in that sector. Still, in education, the United States is implementing a reform agenda that was developed in one economic context and, according to its advocates, was designed to solve a particular set of economic problems. The changing international comparisons during this  period have a negative influence on those aspects of the education reform agenda that were most closely tied to employers and the workplace--employer participation, work-based learning, and systems of specifically focused skill standards. There is little evidence to evaluate the relationship between education and economic performance after 20 years of education reform explicitly designed to improve that performance. Although research suggests that more education improves national economic growth and increases economic performance, exactly which skills are most important and how they should be taught is not apparent. New research should be aimed at specific workplaces and classrooms and at the determinants of individual career progression in order to develop an understanding of the  education and skill needs of the economy.

To ensure the readiness of educators, institutions that prepare teachers must reshape their programs. Three programs were redesigned in response to this need. Two programs are those that prepare high school teachers at the University of California, Berkeley, and at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The third program is a teacher education program for community college instructors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The three initiatives seem to align with  contemporary views of organizational renewal--collaborative reflection, culture of inquiry, and individual and organizational renewal. Based on study of these three programs, the following recommendations were made: (1) expect and plan for a large, complex reform process; (2) organize for change in the long term; (3) involve stakeholders as collaborating, contributing partners; (4) establish stakeholder ownership in the reform; (5) provide stakeholders with opportunities to engage in inquiry; and (6) employ team building processes throughout the reform process.

Data are drawn from applicant and student records for all students coming from a single high school district that has a strong career academy program. Findings suggest that students from career academies have higher academic achievement upon leaving high school, less need for remediation in English at the university, and increased graduation rates from the university than students who are not from academies. Unfortunately for students from this district, the high rates of remediation and the low rates of graduation suggest that the impact of the career academy may not be enough to ensure success  in postsecondary education. About 70 percent of the applicants from the district need some type of remediation, and about 45 percent need remediation in both mathematics and English. Only about half of those who enroll in the university actually graduate. Unless high school school-to-work programs dramatically improve these percentages for students from inner-city schools, students will continue to struggle at the university level and beyond.

        "description":"A study used new data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 to compare students in combined academic and vocational programs with high school students in other curricular categories in 1997 and to compare the 1997 patterns with those of earlier surveys. Previous studies have found that the proportion of high school students participating in vocational course sequences has declined during the 1980s and early 1990s, and vocational students have increasingly represented a low-achieving segment of the student population. To counter these tendencies, public and private initiatives have promoted new forms of high school vocational education that include academic studies and lead to postsecondary education. Data from the 1997 survey showed that students in a combined  program were more similar to the overall student population in socioeconomic composition, though there was a relatively large proportion of females. Compared to vocational students, those in the combined program also expressed more confidence about completing high school and reported fewer absences. The new data showed that the number of students in combined programs continued to increase and that the combined programs have moved career and technical education toward the mainstream of the high school curriculum and involved a broader spectrum of students.

        "description":"Consideration of three specific aspects of the Austrian situation is helpful in understanding funding of the vocational education system: Austria's long tradition as a welfare state; high degree of centralization, and the important influence of the economic and social partnership. Initial vocational training follows one of two paths: the dual system (in-company training and occupation-related school education concurrently) and secondary level 2schools (secondary technical, and vocational schools, and colleges). The Laender and training enterprises share the costs of the dual system. Direct sources of funding for secondary technical, vocational schools, and colleges are public costs, costs borne by &quot;private&quot; funding, and costs borne by private households. Indirect financing comes  from family support, Family Relief Fund benefits, and subsidies for training enterprises, for the especially gifted, and within the framework of labor market policies. Forms of continuing vocational education and training are in-company training and continuing training; training provided by commercial institutions; courses provided by public institutions; and training provided by non-profit institutions. Funding sources are private households, enterprises, and public budgets. Sources of funding for training programs for the unemployed are the Federal Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Matters and the European Social Fund. (Contains 70 references.) (YLB)",

By using comprehensive databases available in Finland and Sweden, it aims to develop the methodological and theoretical perspectives of the research on education and occupations to gain a clearer understanding of the matching of education and occupations and of the factors accounting for the differences between the occupational profiles of similar educational programs. Parts 1 and 2 discuss some basic aspects of the underlying school-to-work transition problem and the matching framework. Part 3 describes the data sets and the basic classifications used in the occupational profile analysis. Part 4 provides  basic information on the features of Swedish and Finnish educational and occupational structures and the changes during the 1980s. Part 5 on tertiary education and Part 6 on secondary education summarize the key findings of the analysis of occupational profiles applying the similarity and domain indexes to the 1990 data sets. Part 7 presents the analysis of age differences and changes in time. Part 8 presents an experimental matching analysis. Part 9 offers conclusions.

        "description":"The extent and distribution of self-reported learning activities in the current Canadian adult population was estimated on the basis of data collected during a 1998 telephone survey of a sample of 1,562 Canadian adults. Random digital dialing was used to give all provinces, households, and individuals within households an equal chance of selection. The response rate was 64% of all eligible households. The interviews averaged 32 minutes, and the data were weighted by known population characteristics of age, sex, and educational attainment to ensure profiles representative for Canada as a whole. More than 95% of those interviewed were involved in some form of explicit informal learning activities that they considered significant. On average, respondents devoted approximately 15  hours per week to informal learning (versus the Canadian average of approximately 4 hours per week to organized education courses). The most commonly cited areas of informal learning activities were as follows: computer skills related to employment; communications skills through voluntary community volunteer work; home renovations and cooking skills in household work; and general interest learning about health issues. It was recommended that those shaping Canada's educational, economic, and other social policies give more explicit consideration to Canadian adults' mostly informal learning practices.

        "description":"As new communications media have developed, discussion of the definition of &quot;distance education&quot; (DE) has increased. The following defining features of DE have been proposed: geographically remote, two-way communication; use of one or more technical media; mass delivery; control of educational institution; and predominance of independent study. In each case, however, examples of programs qualifying as bona fide DE without being characterized by the specific feature can be cited. Some authors have attempted to reframe the concept of distance by emphasizing the pedagogical aspects of the teacher-learner transaction (transactional distance). Learner autonomy and learning as action are two other issues that have been discussed extensively in relation to DE. Learner autonomy is seen  as a requisite in highly structured situations, where learners must compensate for the lack of pedagogical flexibility. Simultaneously, learner autonomy is seen as indispensable when learners must deal with a lack of structure. Some have suggested that the format of DE programs include a structure that encourages learners to become proactive in assuming various learning strategies, committing themselves to the lifelong goal of self-directed learning. In the absence of in situ teacher-learner interactions, DE programs rely on a correct understanding of learner autonomy for their effectiveness. (Contains 15 references.) (MN)",

The informants were recognized professionals in the following fields: computer analysis, structural engineering, media technology, accounting, training, journalism, computer research systems, and management/new media. An analysis of the informants' comments revealed three main elements of the SDL process: (1) emergent goal structure (a fairly clear set of professional objectives  from the outset); (2) unusual learning strategies (including hiring consultants on a one-time-only basis, delegating research tasks to employees, validating new knowledge by discussing business with competitors, and modifying learning objectives to match available resources); and (3) &quot;autodidactic leap&quot; (learners took actions that literally forced them to learn on their own, often under considerable pressure). The interviews also established that successful SDL is determined by a combination of personality traits (including creativity, optimism, high capacity for learning, and curiosity) and environmental factors (including particularly stimulating episodes on the job and a boss's or colleague's suggestion that the informant assume new functions or responsibilities).

The School to Work Opportunities Act 1994 codifies a reform agenda to promote academic achievement and economic opportunity for young people during and after high school. Its general principles are that most young people need help making the transition to adulthood; effective solutions must improve educational achievement and career prospects; schools must enter into new relationships with community partners; reform must be systematic; state and local flexibility must be maximized; and gradual implementation provides flexibility. The best STC initiatives are demonstrating improvements in student attendance, motivation, and satisfaction;  rigor of course selection; employer engagement; quality of adult relationships; dropout prevention; college attention rates; and wages in first jobs. The following four factors have contributed to STC's weakening as a national reform initiative: (1) political realignments; (2) complexity and ambition of the STC vision; (3) implementation choices; and (4) conflict between implementation of standards-driven reform and STC's experiential, outside-the-classroom core. Five priorities can advance what is best in STC: (1) focus on high school; (2) focus on postsecondary institutions and connections; (3) promote STC principles within other education and workforce initiatives; (4) fund the local institutional base for long-term school-community partnerships; and (5) fund research to improve design  and implementation.

Colorado employers also identified barriers to further progress. Among the items requested by employers were the following: access to high-quality information; improved coordination around teacher preparation; clearer definition of roles; and assistance from the national level to align existing systems and programs with an eye toward sustainability.

        "description":"The goal of emancipatory learning is to free learners from the forces that limit their options and control their lives and to move them to act for social and political change. Although emancipatory learning is commonly associated with adulthood, not all adult education fosters it, and not all adult educators align themselves with perspectives that lead to emancipatory learning. Fostering emancipatory learning may bring adult educators in conflict with some prevailing beliefs about adult education, including the educational philosophy of andragogy. Among the theories from which adult educators draw to develop pedagogical practices that foster emancipatory learning are critical theory, feminist pedagogy, and poststructuralist theories. Critical examinations of practices underlying  emancipatory learning have revealed that they do not always have the desired effect and that relationships between and among adult educators and students are not straightforward. The term &quot;empowerment&quot; is another issue related to emancipatory learning. Although empowerment can occur as part of emancipatory learning, it does so within the context of social and political transformation. Because of emancipatory learning's emphasis on social change, some have proposed that it is a collective activity. However, evidence exists that individuals can and do engage in emancipatory learning. (Contains 16 references.) (MN)",

        "description":"Fourteen school-to-work programs characterized by strong work-based learning components and solid employer involvement were examined in a 3-year study to identify pedagogical factors associated with successful work-based learning programs. The main data collection activities were as follows: site visits to the 15 programs to interview faculty, staff, students, and employers and to observe any classroom-based links to the work-based learning components; 2 telephone surveys (a survey of employers participating in the programs and a survey of employers not participating in programs); and case studies of 5 of the programs that included observations and interviews with 26 student interns. The researchers used a task analysis framework that was designed to analyze the situated pedagogy  of particular work contexts. The following pedagogical strategies were identified and analyzed: front-loaded instruction; on-the-job training; just-in-time instruction; back-loaded instruction; mutual self-instruction; laissez-faire instruction; observation; and mentoring. Among the pedagogical tactics used within each strategy were the following: lecturing; tours; modeling/demonstrating; dry runs; giving orders; helping out; coaching; critical feedback; testing and checking; storytelling; reminding; trial and error; and practice. The case studies emphasized the importance of educators enhancing students' learning opportunities at the workplace with connected activities and exercises back at school. (Contains 22 references.)

LT is offered mainly at the secondary school level, although it is required for all students in grades 1-11. In response to calls for curriculum reform, the present elementary and junior high school (grades 1-9) curriculum standards are being revised. Anticipated to be put into effect in 2001, the revised national curriculum emphasizes curricular coherence and integration and more school-based development and management. In these new national curriculum standards, renamed &quot;curriculum syllabi,&quot; are seven learning areas: language, mathematics, science and technology, social studies, arts, health and physical education, and  comprehensive activities. Technology education is expected to unify with science. The curriculum is intended to be skill oriented and must be aligned with further instruction and assessment. The following three dimensions have been used to guide the development of themes and further technology learning activities, assessment rubrics, etc.: context, scope, and content and process. Four characteristics of the new technology curriculum are technology education is interwoven with science; curriculum, instruction, and assessment are skill-oriented; technology education is substantially rooted in elementary schools; and the problem-solving process is emphasized.

It identifies ways in which the Careers Service (CS) in Britain can work in partnership with other professionals and provides consistent and continuing support for the individual's career development on a lifelong basis. Individuals need to be encouraged to engage in a regular process of reviewing, recording, and planning in relation to their learning and work throughout their lives with the progress file as the reference point. Foundations for the process should be laid in schools and individuals encouraged to manage the process themselves with access to ongoing support. A key worker should be  responsible to provide support, including access to specialist guidance for those who need it. Guidance provision should be available at three levels: core service for all; filtered service for those who need specialist help; and intensive service for those in particular need of ongoing specialist help. CS's role is to secure the agreement of the partner organization/professionals to support the model; offer key worker training and support; and provide core, filtered, and intensive services. (Examples of the model are attached for six target groups within CS's statutory client group: year 9 pupils; key stage 4 pupils; full-time post-16 students; work-based trainees; unemployed young people; and employed young people.

Potential social benefits of career guidance fall into the following two main categories: reducing social exclusion and enhancing social development. Guidance is a way of making the structure of society work, by linking individual needs to societal needs on a voluntary basis. It is a significant lubricant of social development. In relation to social exclusion, guidance has both a preventive role--helping young people to avoid exclusion-- and a reintegrative role of supporting those currently excluded to gain access to education and training and the labor market. Guidance delivers social benefits by enhancing educational participation and achievement; reducing the  incidence of long-term unemployment among at-risk groups and improving their access to opportunities commensurate with their abilities and aspirations; providing a gateway to education and work for ethnic minorities exposed to discriminatory employment practices and disadvantaged by spatial concentration in areas of reduced employment opportunity; and avoiding the potential social fall-out of greater labor market flexibility. Hypothetically, guidance helps both individuals in general and categories of individuals at particular risk of social exclusion by exerting a positive effect upon educational and training motivation, participation, effort, and persistence; attainment levels; employment changes; and job quality.

Germany's need for highly qualified information technology (IT) workers and engineers is particularly great. Approximately 10,000 posts for computer scientists and IT specialists remained vacant in 1998. Because of the shortage of such specialists, &quot;side door&quot; entrants who have studied related disciplines such as engineering and natural sciences and have some knowledge of computer science now also have good chances of a job in the IT sector. A total of 13,000 new jobs were reported in Germany's social care sector in 1998. Almost all of Germany's industrial branches are urgently seeking engineers. The job prospects for economists are questionable unless graduates can show that they  have also completed a business training course. The job prospects for lawyers and legal advisers with first-class degrees are improving, and 2,600 more teachers were hired in 1998-1999 than in the previous school year. Employment opportunities for German mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists have also improved considerably. Positions for language and culture scholars also increased. Individuals with the prerequisites for positions in the IT and engineering sectors should be able to secure jobs on the spot. (MN)",

        "description":"Since 1998 a consortium of six educational and community institutions in Australia have created a pathway into tertiary education for those not served by existing paths. The new path results in a Diploma of Further Education. The program is based on a philosophy of lifelong learning, including a foundation of eight lifelong learning goals. Curriculum has been developed to enable learners to work toward these educational goals through a learning experience based on recognizing and encompassing the multiplicity and connectedness of learning. Learners who do not complete all modules for the diploma may attain a Certificate IV of Further Education. The program is aimed at learners who return to adult community and further education (ACFE) but who lack the confidence to move on to  study at a higher level through previously existing pathways. The program contains four core modules that students must take; they also must develop a portfolio of their learning experiences. The program also features learning mentors, who advise, guide, and befriend the students. An information packet, a curriculum framework, a learning mentor manual, and guidelines for conducting the program have been developed. Six pilot programs have been implemented. Approximately 17 students have been through the pilot, and all those who wanted to do so have applied to further education institutions or universities. (Contains 10 references.) (KC)",

        "description":"The Adult Numeracy and Mathematics On-Line (ANAMOL) project investigated the use of online technology as a medium for professional discussion, networking, and collaboration among a small group of isolated adult numeracy practitioners in Australia. After investigation of several methods of online communication, freeware was selected because, in most educational organizations, the use of online systems is complicated by conditions and limitations related to official enrollment or registration of all users. Using freeware packages had particular advantages, such as no cost, ease of use, and independence from outside organizations and people. The two packages selected were &quot;People-Link&quot; and &quot;Discus&quot;; this software was supplemented with electronic and postal mail. The project involved  an induction session, followed by a series of discussions focused on weekly readings related to numeracy teaching and assessment issues. After a few weeks, most of the participants were fascinated with this new form of communication and gained confidence in its use. Advantages of this form of communication included the scope of the discussion, the ability to distribute it to all participants, and the ability to post messages whenever one wanted, rather than waiting for a gap in the dialog. Project outcomes included creation of a bank of adult numeracy teaching and learning activities made available online, reduction in isolation among practitioners, and increase in ability to use technology. Obstacles were mostly related to technological and access problems. (Contains 10 references.)  (KC)",

        "description":"This paper presents a literature review of studies that address spirituality and religion specifically within counseling and counselor education. Results indicate that few studies examine the topic of spirituality outside of the clinical aspect of counseling, indicating that counselor education needs to consider how to educate students about spirituality. Because clients bring spiritual issues into counseling, counseling students should receive some instruction on spirituality in the interest of their future clients. Ethical and accreditation standards of counselors already recognize diversity, and spirituality is part of that diversity. Certain beliefs are associated with specific cultures, and counselors need to be familiar with a variety of these belief systems, including  their own. The studies examined reveal that while most counselor educators recognize the importance of spirituality, little attention is given to the issue in counselor education programs. Spirituality is likely to find a place in the multicultural curriculum if counselor educators recognize its importance and adhere to ethical and accreditation requirements. The consequences of not addressing spirituality in counselor education include possible unethical treatment of clients through undervaluing client belief systems, ignoring an important client variable, and not attending to an effective coping skill of clients. If spirituality is not addressed in counselor education, counseling students will lack an exploration of their spirituality and lack awareness of how their belief systems are  influencing their counseling.

        "author":["Daukantas, George V."],
        "description":"This paper explores the thesis that a discrepancy exists in the treatment of physical disease over mental illness when care is provided by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Inconsistencies exist in the form of narrowed and abbreviated treatment models coupled with outmoded views towards mental illness. Strategies currently used by HMOs to limit the treatment and care of mental illnesses such as substance abuse can also be used to restrict access to marriage and family therapy. HMOs also do not take into account individual differences, and have a complete disregard for environmental, demographic, and multicultural factors. After chronicling the history of HMOs in the United States, the paper explores the effects of HMO decisions on consumers. It reports the results of the  questionnaire distributed to consumers, providers, and executives to determine if the consumer is being denied qualitative mental health care. It concludes with an exploration of more humanistic and acceptable alternatives to mental health care. With this paper the author hopes to: (1) educate newly licensed mental health practitioners to issues regarding HMOs in order that they can protect their interests while maintaining integrity in their treatment of mental health patients, and (2) promote awareness of any ethical concerns that might result as HMOs dictate treatment for mentally ill patients.

        "author":["Kapp, Lisa"],
        "description":"Sexual activity in psychotherapeutic and supervisory relationships breaches counseling ethical standards, some state legal codes, and is perceived as unethical by a majority of mental health practitioners. Many therapists do experience sexual feelings for their clients and supervisees, and an alarming number act out these feelings with clients, supervisors, and counseling student supervisees. Although managing sexual feelings within counseling and supervisory relationships is a significant dilemma, many practitioners in the mental health field do not feel this issue is adequately addressed as part of their training. This paper examines the prevalence and effects of sexual feelings and intimacy within therapeutic dyads and explores ways that counseling programs can help students  manage them through effective training and supervision. It states that by taking an active role to effectively teach counseling students, supervisors, and educators sexual responsibility, counseling training programs can help safeguard the ethical integrity of the counseling profession and protect clients from possible sexually-instilled damage that could filter through the supervisory situation.

        "description":"This paper examines the relationship between clinical psychology and the health care system. The first part reviews the empirical Axis I disorders with patients who also have a comorbid DSM-IV diagnosed personality disorder. While the understanding and treatment of AI disorders have improved, severe limitations exist when patients use the health care system to pay for any other psychological treatment. The second section uses findings from the first section to discuss the status of clinical psychology's relationship with the health care system. Three perspectives on this relationship are offered. An important focus of this section is the observation that clinical psychologists are not powerless against managed care. Because many psychologists cannot see their own value they allow  themselves to be controlled by the health care system. This can lead to an inability to treat patients in a health conscious, ethical, and legal manner. This managed care psychotherapy mindset is also prevalent in graduate programs today. This mindset could be changed if practitioners and students will take a stand for themselves and the integrity of the profession, and not accept the substandard limitations placed on them by the health care system.

        "description":"Today, homosexuality has become a topic of discussion throughout the psychological community and society at large. However, there is great controversy about the etiology of homosexuality and more specifically, lesbianism. This paper describes a review of the literature to examine the hypothesis that a multitude of factors may influence the development of a lesbian sexual orientation. It examines whether lesbianism is the result of environmental influences or is secondary to biological factors. Studies to evaluate biological factors, which include maternal stress, genetic and hormonal factors, have not concurred about factors that can lead to an increase in the number of offspring with lesbian tendencies. Environmental predisposition towards lesbianism such as familial, sexual  abuse, psychosocial, and developmental factors indicate that a combination of these factors may lead a woman towards development of a lesbian sexual orientation. The research concludes that multiple pathways may lead to a lesbian or heterosexual orientation, thereby allowing for the interplay of both biological and psychosocial factors. The paper concludes that it is imperative that the psychological community continues to research lesbian sexual orientation to make information available and accurate to help eliminate the myths, misconceptions, and prejudices regarding the origin of a lesbian sexual orientation.

The Study Circles provide an opportunity to large numbers of citizens to deliberate issues. This was the first time statewide educational organizations had been implemented for racial and criminal justice deliberations. Each partner in the program collaborated to develop and revise pre- and post-questionnaires. The questionnaires were used to provide demographic and other participant information, evaluate the program, and examine the impact  of their efforts. Preliminary information received from these first efforts indicates a positive response to this type of group dialogue and collaboration. A larger percentage of parents with school age children were noted in participating communities organized through the school superintendents.

By using the instrument \"Teens and the Future,\" they were able to survey adolescents about their perceptions of the future and ask about their personal plans, goals, and college interests. Survey results concurred with other research that concluded adolescents have unrealistic expectations and inconsistencies in their views for their future. Several challenges for teachers of adolescents became evident as the pre-service teachers examined the survey results. A major challenge is how to teach students to reconcile career goals  and life goals when they conflict with each other. Some goals that lead to conflicting situations for adolescents include college versus marriage, living near home versus moving for jobs, and personality preferences versus taking jobs that are available.

Prior research on this topic has been couched in the social psychology research on personal attraction and relationship development, which suggests that credibility, attractiveness, and influence are functions of the degree of similarity between source and receiver. The purpose of the study was to investigate the similarity and repulsion hypotheses, to discuss the implications for school counselors, and to establish from a representative at-risk high school sample, rank orderings of characteristics desired in counselors. Few studies have been conducted with high school students, and particularly none with high-risk students. The Preferences for School Counselor  Characteristics was constructed and administered. Data from the study supported the similarity and revulsion hypotheses. Rank order preferences for counselor characteristics was consistent with previous reports of rankings from minority groups. It concludes that the study may have significance due to the very nature of counseling in the schools. Armed with the knowledge that students may prefer counselors similar to themselves, particularly as related to attitudes and values, the school counselors can begin to understand why some segments of the student body underuse counseling services.

Participants were given the task of reading a paragraph that was critical of psychology's historical treatment of women. Each treatment group was told that the paragraph was written by one of four \"authors\": a radical feminist female professor; a female professor; a male professor; and a professor. Participants provided demographic data and responded to a semantic differential to access whether perceived authorship influenced their evaluation of the\"author.\" No significant differences were found between the four treatment groups, even when age, gender, and ethnicity were statistically controlled. These results suggest that graduate education students evaluate radical feminist professors in a non-significantly different manner than the way they evaluate professors who are not identified as feminists.

        "description":"Large numbers of clients entering publicly-funded substance abuse treatment facilities cite problems with alcohol as one reason for seeking treatment. This report presents the results of a secondary analysis of the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES) data set. It profiles the treatment experiences of three study groups that were subsets of the total client sample (N=4,411): clients who entered treatment for alcohol only (n=464), for alcohol plus other drugs (n=1,523), and for other drugs only (n=2,424). Clients using alcohol only tended to be older, more often white, somewhat more educated, and more likely to be employed prior to entering treatment. The majority of alcohol only clients were treated primarily in outpatient settings (61%), whereas clients having  problems with other drugs only were treated in a wider range of settings: outpatient (29%), methadone [outpatient] (17%), long-term residential (18%), and short-term residential (20%). Alcohol plus other drugs clients significantly reduced their consumption of drugs following treatment, whereas alcohol only clients showed minor, but statistically significant post-treatment increases in marijuana (10%), cocaine (3%), and crack (3%) use. With the exception of DUI/DWI offenses, alcohol only clients had fewer criminal behaviors and arrests prior to treatment, yet they were more often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system and were less frequently self-referred. Nevertheless, all study groups demonstrated substantial reductions in criminal behaviors across the follow-up periods.  Employment, general health, and mental health outcomes also showed improvement for all study groups. No significant post-treatment reductions in the self-reported use of any alcohol were observed across the three groups, a finding that may be of clinical concern for the alcohol only treatment group. Findings are discussed as they relate to future data analysis and policy recommendations.

It addresses the relationships between completion rates, lengths of stay, and treatment modality. It examines the effect of program-level factors on treatment retention. NTIES intake and treatment episode completion data for 3,117 clients across 61 service delivery units were used in the study. Data were organized into eight analysis cells defined by treatment modality and intended length of stay. Results show that, in general, shorter programs have higher treatment episode completion rates but longer programs retain clients for longer periods. Long-term  residential programs exhibit higher treatment episode completion rates than long-term outpatient or correctional programs. The median length of stay for clients in long-term or correctional programs with intended lengths of treatment of 120 days or more were lower than in the 90-119 day programs, suggesting that setting the intended length of treatment at 120 days or more may be counterproductive with respect to retaining clients.

Using data from the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES), and client questionnaires, estimates were made of the average costs per client in terms of crime-related costs, health care costs, and social welfare benefits in the 12 months prior to and after treatment. Estimates of average earnings for clients in the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods were calculated. Overall, the findings indicate modest changes in average health care costs (11% reduction per client) and earnings of substance abusers (9% increase) in the period after treatment. Essentially no change in welfare payments or Supplemental Security Income was  found. However, large reductions in crime-related costs (about 75%) were found. Over 94 percent of the estimated treatment benefits were derived from the reductions in crime-related costs. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed.

        "author":["Baloglu, Mustafa"],
        "description":"Over the years, researchers in the field of psychology have been interested in the factors associated with anxiety. As a result of this interest, several theories have attempted to explain the construct and interventions developed to treat it. Even though there is no agreement on the nature of anxiety, there is a wide agreement that general anxiety can be classified as having two distinct components: trait anxiety and state anxiety. While trait anxiety refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness, state anxiety is a transitory emotional condition. Among different state anxieties, mathematics anxiety is distinguished from general anxiety as situation-specific. It manifests itself in mathematically related environments. Considerable research has been  conducted to explain mathematics anxiety as the importance of mathematics applications have grown in our society. More recently, it was suggested that statistics anxiety is a related but separate construct from general anxiety and mathematics anxiety; however, there is a lack of empirical literature distinguishing between these two types. In this paper, mathematics anxiety and statistics anxiety are discussed in relation to general anxiety research. Differences and similarities between the two anxieties are the main focus, and comparisons are made in terms of five main points: definitions, nature, antecedents, effects, and treatments of these anxieties.

Kobasa's hardiness factor, composed of control, commitment, and challenge, was reported to be an important component in explaining why some people can withstand stress without getting sick. A review of the literature supportive, as well as unsupportive, of Kobasa's research is given. Limitations of the hardiness research are also outlined. Although Kobasa's concept of hardiness is in serious jeopardy, it continues to provide avenues for further exploration and study. Current studies are looking at the effects of hardiness on family systems, specifically marital conflict (marital illness behavior). Other needed studies are the  relation between physiological measures and hardiness, stress, and illness behavior, as well as the implications of hardiness development across the life span.

        "description":"Values clarification involves presenting a hypothetical situation to students that requires them to make a moral judgment. That moral judgment must be publicly affirmed by the student, but not criticized by others. Values clarification's philosophical context is existentialist. The values clarification philosophies and methods were consistent with the radical humanistic ideas and the popular philosophies of the youth of the late 1960s. During the 1970s, approaches in humanistic therapy flourished. In \"Values Clarification: A Handbook of Practical Strategies for Teachers and Students,\" S. B. Simon et al promote values clarification as not being concerned with the particular outcomes of any one individual's experience but with the process used to obtain his or her values. Simon  asserts the traditional idea that right and wrong absolutes are obsolete and no final moral authority exists. Years later, motivated by various criticisms, Simon collaborated with L. W. Howe to publish a second book. That book reaffirmed values clarification and made clear misperceived interpretations of the theories in the first book. The four major sources of criticism were: religious conservatism, political conservatism, a therapeutic paradigm shift, and serious flaws with values clarification from the beginning. Given the amount of criticism directed at values clarification, should educators abandon it? Eventually, individuals are required to make a moral stance. Implementation of any type of values clarification should include parental consent. When students arrive upon a final moral  decision, values clarification facilitators should carefully examine and even question decisions that may cause danger to others, even if the process that led to it is sound. The issues addressed in values clarification should be carefully examined before its use. (Contains 12 references.) (MKA)",

The child-becoming-an-adult needs to talk safely with an adult about the meaning of life and how to live it. This book, which is part journal and part workbook, provides an opening for the young person and the adult to have serious conversations with one another on issues that arise on the trail to adulthood. The journal provides 17 trail of life lessons for the youngster and adult to examine, and 17 structured opportunities for them to listen to and talk with one another, and to do an activity together. Both will read privately a brief reflection on a topic and think about what it means in their own life. Several questions are posed which should be answered in writing. The act of writing  helps to crystallize thoughts in a logical and structured manner and provides an opportunity to re-examine ideas. After writing their answers, youngsters and adults get together to share their thoughts. This conversation is the most important part of the program. The open discussion enables both youngster and adult to grow and deepen themselves and their relationship. Topics include: attitude, persistence, decisions, health, balance, honesty, happiness, love, giving, courage, opportunity, learning, hope, responsibility, sexuality, family, and God.

In 1994, the NHSDA added the Youth Self-Report, a comprehensive mental health checklist that has been used extensively in studies of adolescents. The instrument generates summary measures of emotional and behavioral problems, as well as measures for specific syndromes. Selected and  highlighted findings of the study include: an estimated 13 percent of adolescents had emotional problems as indicated by withdrawal, somatic problems, anxiety, and depression; an estimated 17 percent had behavioral problems indicated by delinquent or aggressive behavior; and the likelihood of substance use is associated with the severity of emotional and behavioral problems across age and gender groups. Specific study results are categorized into sections on illicit drug use, alcohol use, cigarette use, alcohol or illicit drug dependence, and using the Youth Self-Report to identify substance users.

This report examines data on juvenile violent crime in Texas as well as the incidence of violence in the schools over recent years. Contrary to popular perceptions that violence is increasing dramatically in schools, new data indicates that over the last 5 years, the incidence of violence in relation to number of students has remained relatively constant. Even though youth crime appears to be declining, studies report that violent acts committed by youth are more serious, and these violent acts are being committed by younger children. Additionally, Texas teachers report  that they fear for their safety, and perceive more problems with crime than do principals. The report concludes by addressing the factors that are linked to youth violence and by making recommendations for preventing school violence. Included is a resource list that can provide more ideas for creating safer schools in Texas. School violence data for all Texas counties are also included. (GCP)",

The author recounts his psychotherapeutic work with young gay men diagnosed with AIDS and his increasing awareness of their movement toward psychological health and the development of a deeper spirituality. His quest became one of finding a theoretical explanation for this movement toward psychological health. The conference presentation with accompanying handout speaks to the outcome of this research. Cognizant of the gay culture, the author approached therapy with this group from an existential theoretical model. To explore the success of the existential approach, the author turned to the writings of Carl Jung and his followers. The integrated model  presented at the conference combines the archetypal developmental stages of Carol Pearson and the spiritual developmental stages of Ken Wilber. Tenets of existentialism are presented as the foundation for the counseling process, which facilitated accelerated movement through the integrated developmental model. Appendix C provides a summary of the relationship between the three models, i.e., Pearson, Wilber, and Existentialism. The presentation of the model was followed by an overview of the stages of counseling that one could expect to encounter when using the model with HIV/AIDS diagnosed individuals. The final aspect of the presentation was a dramatization of dialogue taken from therapy sessions illustrating the archetypal/ existential concepts. (Contains 32 references and 3  appendixes.) (GCP)",

        "author":["Watson, Joshua C."],
        "description":"In 1956, Dr. Albert Ellis presented his seminal work on Rational Therapy, subsequently renamed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) in 1993. This paper explores the origins, theoretical foundations, applications, and implications of REBT and provides a look at the empirical research available in support of the approach's efficacy. REBT is widely recognized as an effective approach to therapy. Many researchers have written on the usage of REBT, including Ellis himself who has authored over 700 articles and manuscripts relating to REBT. REBT is one of the cognitive-behavioral approaches to psychotherapy, in that it pays particular attention to the role that cognition and behavior play in the development and maintenance of people's emotional problems. Although REBT uses social  learning theory and holds that external events and environmental influences significantly affect humans and contribute to their emotional disturbances, it stresses biological tendencies and innate predispositions; a view not held in other cognitive theories. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy is presented as an effective approach for dealing with clients who have the ability and desire to make changes in their lives. The goal of REBT is not to rid people of their irrational beliefs, rather it is to minimize their emotional disturbances and self-defeating behaviors by acquiring a more realistic and workable philosophy of life.

        "description":"With the increase in violence over the past few decades, academic and human development practitioners have tried to better understand the dynamics of conflict and develop effective intervention and prevention strategies. There is an ever-deepening appreciation for the mediation process. The mediation process is a powerful problem-solving and educational tool since it utilizes the parties themselves to develop an agreement to resolve the conflict. Student development professionals are ideally suited to learn the skills of effective mediation. They already understand empathic listening, reframing, and human dynamics. They need only learn the theory and practice of the mediation process itself. Mediation is also promoted as an ideal method for dealing with issues of culture clash  and cultural misunderstanding. The mediation process can help to break down stereotypes and to develop an appreciation for the uniqueness and richness of the other person. Student development professionals should acquire the training necessary to be certified, become mediators on campus, and train faculty and students in the skills of alternative dispute resolution. As an additional step, mediation programs could be developed that would not merely respond to conflict as it arises, but proactively work to transform issues of conflict into opportunities for developing cultural sensitivity and life-enhancing skills.

        "author":["Langdon, Tom"],
        "description":"A problem was addressed within the context of the action based research practicum model. The problem was junior high school special education students who read at or below the 10th percentile when compared to age appropriate peers on standardized achievement instruments; and who have had all manner of reading interventions and yet continue to fall further behind their peers. Conceptually, it was posited that the manner in which a child's oral language develops is inextricably related to a child's ability to read. The basic thesis was that if a child's oral language development was deficit or delayed for any number of natural or environmental reasons, then reading achievement would be deficit and delayed. Therefore, an approach to reading remediation was developed through  identifying oral language deficits and their idiosyncratic relationship to reading achievement as a beginning intervention point. The problem solution was designed to assess oral language skill and deficit areas as the basis of the reading interventions. The reading interventions were continuously assessed through the use of curriculum based measurement. The data were analyzed in several different ways: through curriculum based measurement; though the use of pre/post measures of selected normed referenced academic achievement tests; and through pre/post measures on both teacher and parent questionnaires designed to assess their perceptions of change within their students as a result of the reading interventions. There were seven expected outcomes that led to mixed results. However, while  not all of the outcomes were met, the direction of the data were favorable to the language based reading intervention model. (Author/RS)",

        "description":"This position paper of the International Reading Association (IRA) calls for an immediate increase in funding for books in classroom, school, and town libraries. According to the paper, the condition of these libraries has weakened over the last decade--there are fewer books per child, and the condition of the books and the staffing of the libraries have seriously deteriorated. The position paper contends that this trend must be reversed because children who have access to books are more likely to read for enjoyment, and thus increase their reading skills and their desire to read to learn. Libraries must purchase a sufficient number of new books per student and they must make a concentrated effort to replace older materials. Genres should include picture storybooks, novels,  biography, fiction and nonfiction material, magazines, poetry, and a multitude of other types to suit the interests and range of reading abilities of all children. The paper considers several questions and implications regarding children's &quot;access to books,&quot; and offers recommendations for teachers, librarians, and school administrators, as well as for researchers.

        "description":"Using 17, 211 words drawn from the word list compiled for the Stanford Spelling Study (1963) and drawing upon the \"American Heritage Dictionary of the American Language\" as the pronunciation reference, a researcher approached the language as if little was known about its letter-sound relationships and examined by computer the letter-sound correspondence for all single and paired combinations--a, b, c...aa, ab, ac.... He also examined many three, four, and five-letter clusters and phonograms; if a word contained multiple occurrences of a letter or letter combination, he studied the first occurrence only. All juxtaposed single vowel and consonant combinations that looked like a pair or digraph were counted with the vowel pair or consonant digraph. As he proceeded, he began to find\"stand-alone\" phonic units and placed these in tables of \"phonic cells.\" Within each phonic cell, he included a ratio of words conforming to the sound(s) to the total number of words identified for that cell. Eventually, all but a handful of the letters and letter clusters fit into a cell. Findings are shown in 3 vowel tables (Tables 1-3) and in 3 consonant tables (Tables 4-6). In summary, the predictable \"cells\" for the three vowel tables show a collective predictability of 93%, while the consonant tables exceed 99% in letter-sound predictability. This understanding of letter-sound relationships can be applied to students who struggle with decoding; this simple approach to successfully teaching reading fluency can be used with struggling readers from primary-age students to illiterate  adults.

        "description":"A study analyzed word recognition instruction in four first-grade classrooms to begin to identify the instructional practices that best foster learning to read words for particular profiles of children. The study was based on the question of which, and how many, word-recognition strategies should be taught to first-grade children. Subjects were part of four demographically similar classrooms which were observed for a year. In each classroom, students were organized into reading groups of varying abilities. Instructional practice varied widely across these classrooms; phonics and phonemic awareness activities were more common in Classrooms 2 and 4, and while children in Classrooms 2, 3, and 4 were on average reading at or above their grade level by the end of the year, the only  low group children who were reading at grade level were those in Classrooms 2 and 4. Findings suggest: (1) differential instruction may be helpful in first grade; (2) children who enter first grade with low literacy benefit from early exposure to phonics, moving later toward the increased vocabulary and text discussion that serves their higher range peers well; and (3) a structured phonics curriculum that includes both onsets and rimes and also sounding and blending phonemes within rimes appears to be very effective.

The Motivation to Read Profile was administered to 20 fifth-grade students from a variety of socioeconomic families. After allowing the students to make choices in their reading programs, a posttest was given. Pretest and posttest scores were compared on self concept as a reader, the value placed on reading, and combined self concept and value scores. A significant positive difference was found between the self-concept scores and between the combined scores, but no significant difference was found between the value scores.

Reading and writing processes are supported through conversation with Reading Recovery, and moment to moment interchanges have power in student learning. Talk is especially crucial in two parts of the lesson--composing a story to write and introducing a new book. In Reading Recovery, a closely shared situation with an adult and child participating together in reading and writing provides the setting within which teachers can structure their interactional moves to meet the student where he or she is learning. In Reading  Recovery, teachers are assisted in learning through conversations about their work with colleagues and others who share common understandings. Through conversations, teachers help children learn, and teachers help each other learn. Reading Recovery makes possible the power of teaching as conversation. Contains 17 references. (RS)",

An introductory section discusses Reading Recovery, noting that it is an individual tutoring program for young children who are having difficulty learning to read and write after their first year of school. Sections of the paper describe how: (1) the authors learned to teach and to think differently about teaching and learning; (2) demonstration teaching behind a one-way glass offered a powerful setting for their learning; (3) they discovered their strengths as they constructed their own understandings of the children they taught; (4) they became  committed to giving the child control of the learning process; (5) they learned to be efficient as well as effective--to keep a lively pace and make the most of that 30 minutes of time; (6) they learned the reciprocal value of writing and reading; (7) like other scientists, they developed skills in keeping and analyzing records of students' behaviors; (8) their colleagues contributed to their learning in deep and significant ways; (9) Reading Recovery teacher leaders offered special help, support, and challenge as the teachers examined their teaching; (10) they are experienced Reading Recovery teachers, but they continue to learn more every year; and (11) Reading Recovery is hard work, but they have been rewarded by seeing their students' rapid progress.

The lessons learned that are discussed in the paper are: (1) make no excuses for the learner or for yourself; (2) expect learning and teach &quot;doggedly&quot;; (3) watch your language (using the prompts and cues that are consistent with the overall philosophy and goals of Reading Recovery); (4) guard your lesson time as a valuable commodity; and (5) do everything possible to connect reading and writing. The paper concludes that Reading Recovery teachers learn, just like their students, that learning to do something complex requires focused attention, clear and consistent  guidelines, practice, and the support of others.

The three actions children must learn to take from the beginning as teachers move into instruction are: do some reading &quot;work&quot; at the point of difficulty; take some initiative; and make some links between new items learned and existing knowledge. Active learners are constructive, self-directed learners: they monitor their own reading and writing; search for cues in word sequences, in meaning, and in letter sequences; discover new things for themselves; cross-check on information; repeat as if to confirm their reading and writing so far; self-correct, taking the initiative for making cues match, or getting words right; and solve new words by these means. Teachers can support children's active learning by  systematically observing the child's actions and making the right moves. Contains 2 figures and examples from lesson transcripts. (RS)",

        "description":"Reading Recovery teachers can determine the child's literacy performance by using patterns of responding, that is, what the child mostly does in reading and writing. The child's performance informs the teaching, and close observation is the key to being able to &quot;follow the child.&quot; Observation is central to the idea of following the child. &quot;Following the child&quot; means observing what the child can do, determining what the child needs to learn to do, and providing appropriate learning opportunities. Reading Recovery teachers look for patterns of responding across the lesson to inform their teaching. Running records taken during a lesson provide examples of patterns of responses that inform teaching priorities, in particular the child's processing problems. Detailed analysis of two  running records illustrates the process the teacher may go through to determine what the child can do and needs to learn to do: summarize the running record; look for patterns of responding; and provide learning opportunities that will move the child forward in the reading process.

On-going professional development is critical: (1) administrators need to protect their investment in the program through on-going professional development to support teacher leaders and they implement the innovation; (2) due to the complexity of the teacher leader role, multifaceted, on-going learning is required after the training year; (3) the teacher leaders' learning over time impacts the learning of Reading Recovery teachers, which in turn will lead to improvement in student achievement; (4) there is a moral imperative that teacher  leaders be current in their understandings to provide the best instruction to teachers as well as children; and (5) teacher leaders must continue to develop their skills in collaboration with others on the district to ensure that Reading Recovery is seen as part of a larger, systemic plan for change in which all children learn to read and write.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine Reading Recovery training in relation to three models for teaching and learning: instructor-centered, student-centered, and community-centered. Typically, the theories on which these models are based have been used to predict how children learn and how they should be taught. However, the theories and consequent models can also be applied to predict teacher learning and education. The original design of the Reading Recovery training program closely follows the principles of a community-centered model of teacher education. By making explicit the implications of this model, in contrast to the other two models, Reading Recovery teacher leaders and trainers can better understand, plan for, and evaluate Reading Recovery training practices.

        "description":"The goal in Reading Recovery is to support children to develop &quot;in the head&quot; operations or strategies that aid them to solve problems as they read and write continuous text. To help children in organizing experience and correct any idiosyncratic or unreliable relationships, teachers must understand how children develop their internal processing system, how they construct inner control, and how to best support their efforts. The means by which a system of language use is developed in the young literacy learner depends on refinement of both the cognitive and visual processing systems. As this internal processing system matures, the role of attention shifts and fluency is more constant. Reading Recovery teachers need to have a fairly accurate model of how each child normally solves  his or her problems. The tasks of book introduction and first reading are important: by selecting a book carefully with an expectation of how this text will influence the child's internal processing system, the teacher takes into account how the child is currently able to solve problems. Within the first reading, teachers are observing and responding to the overall processing system, the partially correct responding, correct responding, and prompted responding. The goal is to facilitate the child's developing a self-extending system of literacy expertise. Contains 9 references. (RS)",

        "description":"The Fort Bend Independent School District (a large, growing school district in Sugar Land, Texas) elected to become a Reading Recovery Teacher Training site and faced many decisions regarding effective implementation, including campus (school) selection. They began slowly with only two campuses the first year, added four to five the second year, and five in the third year. The plan of campus selection is a multi-tiered model which serves to: (1) ensure that campuses which implement Reading Recovery are committed to its effective implementation; (2) create a partnership between the central office and campuses; (3) result in full-implementation at each campus; and (4) institutionalize Reading Recovery as a vital part of the district's overall literacy program. The district uses  three steps in the selection process: application, interview, and classroom observation. The site selection process for Reading Recovery is only a small part of program implementation; however, it is a crucial component of overall program effectiveness. Selecting the correct match between campuses and the innovation can better ensure that Reading Recovery does indeed provide an important component in schoolwide success. (RS)",

It first establishes three important ideas for Reading Recovery to work: leadership is required; change cannot be accomplished in one or two years; and program effectiveness is dependent upon the effectiveness of the educational program in general and the climate and coherence of programs at individual schools. The paper then discusses administrative leadership and support; Reading Recovery program efficiency; using data to monitor effectiveness; the importance of strong classroom programs; additional support for children at risk; and the formation of school teams.

        "description":"This report describes the early reading program in Emerald Elementary School, located in a Midwest urban fringe district. From 1996 through 1998, Emerald's students performed well above the district average or near the state average on reading achievement. During this period, the school had at least half of its students eligible for free or reduced lunch and a student mobility rate of approximately 40%. This exceptional achievement placed Emerald among the top-performing high-poverty schools in its state. The cornerstone of Emerald's early reading program was referred to as a literacy rotation in which Grade 1 students had access to four small-group instructional approaches for two hours weekly. Beyond the literacy rotation, a variety of safety nets for supporting struggling  readers was identified. At a broader level, several mechanisms for facilitating communication among the staff, professional development, collaboration, and participation in state and federal educational initiatives were found. Analysis of the early reading program identified five key elements of school operation: focus on student outcomes; multiple reading programs in every classroom; shared responsibility for student success; strong leadership at school and classroom levels; and a veteran, knowledgeable staff. These elements were related to resource allocations within the school. Contains 1 figure, 3 tables of data, 8 notes, and 24 references. (Author/NKA)",

A set of guidelines for evaluating beginning reading texts was identified.

The study found that (1) all three programs rated favorably on the content portion of the &quot;engagingness&quot; scale, though the LC program rated higher in terms of language and design; (2) none of the texts proved to be very accessible; and (3) all of the programs introduce children to most of the 100 most  frequent words in English. Even the very early texts, however, introduce children to a large number of rimes without providing many repetitions of them, which renders the text less generalizable. As a group, these three programs do not attend to text characteristics that are crucial in promoting reading acquisition. If struggling readers are not to be left behind, these issues must be addressed before early reading texts are published and selected. Contains 2 figures, 7 tables of data, and 41 references.

The kindergarten language arts curriculum did not meet the diverse literacy needs of the kindergarten students. The goal of the practicum was to meet the diverse literacy needs of the kindergarten students. The writer developed eight integrated thematic units that incorporated emergent literacy instructional strategies, i.e. read-alouds, story retell using props, shared reading, acquisition of unit related vocabulary, music and art activities, and writing activities. The writer also developed a home-school connection designed to create a link between home and school and to provide parents and students with an opportunity  to work together to improve literacy skills. In addition the writer created a print-rich classroom environment to promote literacy and literacy awareness. Data from a teacher-made questionnaire completed before and after the practicum implementation indicated that teachers were successful in implementing the emergent literacy instructional strategies. Teachers also reported on the effectiveness of the integrated thematic approach to instruction, the home-school connection, and the print-rich classroom environment.

Subjects were 11 first-grade students identified as &quot;at-risk&quot; of learning to read by their previous year's teachers. All were in the same first grade, inclusive classroom. Initial scores on Clay's Observational Survey (1993) placed all students below the fourth stanine on four tests of literacy skills: writing vocabulary, sentence dictation, word recognition, and text level comprehension. The results from the post-intervention assessments indicate student gains are significant (p &lt;.001) in all four areas assessed. In addition,  students have been observed using Project Read strategies, such as &quot;pounding out&quot; words or &quot;fingerspelling&quot; sounds; these have appeared to be especially useful for several students who may eventually be placed in a learning disabilities class. End-of-year assessment results appear to indicate that using both Guided Reading and Project Read with at-risk readers in a first grade inclusion class is an effective effort at improving students' literacy skills.

        "description":"In recent years many teachers, English departments, and school districts have taken steps towards averting censorship and strengthening the professional basis for their English language arts programs. This paper states that development of the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) guidelines for selection of materials in English programs was itself the result of a careful process which began when NCTE sent out a call to schools and districts all over the country for guidelines already in use and ended when a joint committee developed the NCTE guidelines. The guidelines are divided into the following sections: Scope of the Policy for Selection of Instructional Materials; Criteria (with subsections on Connection to Educational Objectives, and Relevance to Student Needs);  Procedures for Selection of Instructional Materials (with subsections on Responsibility for Selection, and Selection Procedures); and Opportunity for Informal Selection.

        "author":["Underwood, Terry"],
        "description":"This book is a study, in research-based narrative form, of one middle school's implementation of a new portfolio assessment plan in response to statewide policy changes in California. The book highlights the interactions of state, district, and local forces as teachers work to implement a portfolio-assessment plan that collects student work and evaluates it systematically. It examines a portfolio-assessment project that views student work through three progressive lenses: warm, value free; cool, analytical; and hard, critical. The plot of the book traverses a 15-year period in California during which assessment drove instruction across the state, often in unexamined and contradictory ways, always in powerful ways. The book traces the ebb and flow of a variety of assessment  philosophies located in living rooms, classrooms, principals' offices, district headquarters, and in downtown Sacramento (the state capital)--a variety of philosophies coming and going that left behind fixed, predictable histories of conflict in classrooms. Its story appears to have parallels in the recent history of schools all over the United States. Chapters in the book are: (1) &quot;Washers, Dryers, and School Reformers&quot;; (2) &quot;The Portfolio-Assessment System as an Innovation at Charles Ruff&quot;; (3) &quot;Portfolios in Review&quot;; (4) &quot;The Seeds of Change in California, 1983-1994&quot;; (5) &quot;Ruff Unified School District&quot;; (6) &quot;Inside the Middle (School)&quot;; (7) &quot;Ruff Instruction&quot;; (8) &quot;Ruff Students and Their Portfolios&quot;; and (9) &quot;Conclusions and Implications.&quot; Contains an Epilogue, an Appendix giving the  research method, and an extensive list of works cited.

        "description":"This paper describes a study in which a group of young African-American children responded to literature in a multiage primary classroom setting. This naturalistic study sought to: identify the modes of response preferred by the African-American children in this class, examine the content of those responses for evidence of links to ethnicity, and explore how responses were shaped by the ethnic identities of participants in the classroom--including the identities of the teacher and other students. First, the paper briefly reviews the literature on reader response theory as it has been applied to children. Second, it describes the modes of response observed among the children who participated in the study. Next, the paper looks at how the teacher validated and invalidated students'  observable responses. Finally, it provides examples of these intersections and discusses the implications for classroom teachers committed to fostering high levels of aesthetic response in children.

It describes 10 assumptions about writing assessment, including language is by definition social, writing ability is a sum of a variety of skills, assessment tends to drive pedagogy, and the means to test students' writing ability shapes what they consider writing to be. It lists 5 rights and responsibilities of students; 8 rights and responsibilities of faculty; 6 rights and responsibilities of administrators and higher education governing boards; and 3 rights and  responsibilities of legislators. It concludes that, when conducted sensitively and purposefully, assessment can have a positive impact on teaching, learning, curricular design, and student attitudes. (RS)",

The first chapter presents various strategies for helping students learn to write well: students compile their own examples of effective writing; they turn interviews into gift books; they record their own activities for a whole day to help them develop an eye for detail; and they practice supportive peer-feedback techniques. Other activities in the first chapter focus on close observation, word play, and poetry writing. The second chapter presents activities intended to foster appreciation and understanding of literary works--among the elements of these strategies are a dialectical journal; a list of questions to help students analyze characters; guest poets; a  discussion of banned books; an examination of conflict between friends; and an in-depth poetry project for seniors. Freeze frames, a reading quilt, and riddles that require research are a few of the activities in the third chapter entitled \"Explorations.\" Other activities in the chapter vary in focus, but they have several things in common: they inspire teachers; they motivate students; and they offer opportunities for genuine learning in the classroom.

        "description":"This paper advocates a pragmatist approach to teaching the composition of academic discourse. It discusses teaching directly the conflicting positions of academic discourse as elitist jargon or as key to advanced conceptualization. The suggested pedagogical method involves the examination of academic discourse in general, and the procedure of having each student investigate the discursive practices of his or her particular major. It concludes that: (1) the primary concern of students was what they perceived as the implied submissiveness of the audience to academic discourse; (2) engaging students in the conflict encouraged them to confront and understand the difficulties they felt; and (3) through their engagement in and representation of this conflict, students were taught to  utilize and participate in academic discourse.

        "description":"This wide-ranging analysis of doctoral education in English Studies challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about how English Ph.D. programs came to be, what purposes they serve, and what they might become--what they ought to become--in the 21st century. Section I traces the first century of English doctoral education in the American university, from its German origins to the \"crisis of disciplinary and professional identity\" that precipitated the 1987 Conference on Graduate Study and the Future of Doctoral Studies in English. Section II examines one programmatic response to that crisis, the State University of New York at Albany's \"Writing, Teaching, and Criticism,\" with a particular emphasis on the program's determination to reintegrate the field's increasingly  disparate specializations. Section III turns back to the broader professional and disciplinary scene to consider the implications of such a \"fusion-based\" curriculum: to consider why this curricular model represents the best available option for both doctoral education and the entire enterprise of English Studies. Chapters in the book are: (1) \"Establishing the Tradition: 1876-1950\"; (2) \"Lehrfreiheit, Lernfreiheit, and the Magisterial Curriculum\"; (3) \"Expansion, Contraction, and the (Surp)Rise of Heterogeneity (1950-1990)\"; (4) \"The Crisis of Identity in English Studies and the Demise of the Magisterial Curriculum\"; (5) \"Albany's Ph.D. in English Studies: 'Writing, Teaching, and Criticism'\"; (6) \"Writing to Get Situated: Learning to Stage a Reading\"; (7) \"Charting Courses (1): Extended  Work in a Preferred Mode\"; (8) \"Charting Courses (2): (Re)Combinatory Writings\"; (9) \"Writing beyond Coursework: The Qualifying Examination and the Dissertation\"; and (10) \"The Fusion-Based Curriculum for an English Studies in Transition.\" Contains 120 references.

The first half of the book examines how the term &quot;student&quot; organized the activities of organizations such as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, and the Black Panthers. The second half of the book studies how the political, scholarly, and organizational work around student politics produced the resolution on Students' Right to Their Own Language.

        "description":"Doctoral-level students in a mass communication pedagogy class conducted a quasi-experimental study based entirely on constructivism. The students (n=6) became equal partners with the professor by practicing collaborative learning, ownership, and authenticity. Constructivists see knowledge as actively constructed by learners, not passively acquired from instructors. The students built their own knowledge through selecting the content, teaching the course, choosing projects and assignments, reflecting on the class, assessing the students, and working collaboratively. While some students may not be ready to accept responsibility for their education because of maturity or indoctrination in traditional learning methods, the group believes that the benefits of constructivism outweighs  its disadvantages. Results suggest that constructivism should be incorporated into all levels of mass communication higher education. It can be practiced in large classes or lower-level courses as students actively seek knowledge through choosing course content, working in real-world situations, participating in group projects or reports, and giving input on assessment. This breaks students from their dependence on instructors and readies them for lifelong learning where knowledge is constructed among people, not in solitary. Contains 30 references and 2 figures. An appendix contains course objectives, assignments, and a course calendar. (Author/NKA)",

        "description":"This paper considers the British thinker C.S. Lewis as a &quot;forensic figure,&quot; defining &quot;forensic&quot; in the sense of public discussion and debate. The paper relates that, long before Lewis emerged as a public persuader, he learned to hold his own in private exchanges with William T. Kirkpatrick, his tutor from 1914-1917, and in letters with his Belfast neighbor, Arthur Greeves. It states that with Greeves, Lewis maintained a debate on the subject of religion--the young Lewis equated religion with mythology. The paper explains that Lewis later changed his mind about Christianity and contends that his May 11, 1959 lecture at Westcott House in Cambridge has particular merit because its claims are crucial to every defense he made of historic Christianity. After a brief overview of the  talk, the paper examines in detail its content and evaluates Lewis's arguments on the basis of their clarity and soundness. According to the paper, the audience for the talk was composed mainly of seminarians, and to get across his proposition, Lewis employed a strategy that forensic educators teach early to their debaters: cast doubt on the trustworthiness and methodology of the opposition. The paper concludes that, in the Cambridge talk, Lewis demonstrated the importance of identifying basic assumptions, evaluating the evidence and reasoning behind claims, questioning terminology and definitions, understanding literary forms and various senses of meaning, and mastering biblical texts.

This paper considers the different forms of verbal and nonverbal communications in the classroom, cultural communications in the classroom, and communication enhancers for the classroom--issues which are major crossroads in the path to receiving a successful education. The paper contends that educators are doing an inferior job educating poor children. According to the paper, when a child does not speak Standard English, the teacher must be able to reach the child on his/her level of understanding and transfer him/her to the standard level of understanding; effective classroom communication requires the teacher and students to be able to send and receive  messages accurately. It states that recognizing and appreciating communication diversity (i.e., culture) allows children to feel good about themselves, and that if the classroom teacher and the speech teacher were to team up, they could coordinate interaction with the students and provide beneficial bilingual and bicultural programs. It stresses that teachers must understand the nature of language and the nature of dialect differences and then they must decide how to approach the problem--they can recognize &quot;non-standard&quot; dialect and eradicate it, leave the student language alone, or accept bidialectalism. The paper states that the classroom should: provide a variety of stimuli; provide a secure, comfortable feeling; be adapted to fit the activity; and give some privacy and individuality.

Necessary characteristics for the success of this experiment included little structuring, little or no professional intervention, individual selection of in-depth partners, an offline community meeting to discuss the experiment in process, and willingness to be open to the experience on the part of the subjects. Findings suggest changes in personal computer-use patterns were most noticeable in students originally more techno-phobic.

        "description":"This digest presents ways that school administrators can realistically assess their schools' security needs. It opens by reporting that some types of school violence are declining, such as self-reported weapon carrying and fighting on school property, which reflects an overall decline in youth violence. However, schools still must perform periodic, routine security assessments to ascertain their security needs. Checklist surveys that involve parents, students, law-enforcement personnel, community representatives, and school staff are important measures, and a security assessment performed by an independent consultant holds several advantages. Recent tragedies in schools have prompted some districts to consider adding high-tech security hardware, such as metal detectors. The  usefulness of such detectors depends on the severity of the weapons problems, the availability of funds for staff and training, and possible negative effects on school atmosphere. Other security options include hand-held detectors, security cameras, and changing procedures and space allocation. An important component of any security measure is identifying potentially violent students and intervening before serious problems erupt. Staff and parents should be trained to recognize warning signs. Finally, every school should have a written crisis plan that features procedures for responding to a broad range of possible crises, including natural disasters, bomb threats, fire, and other situations.

It discusses various long-term strategies, such as increasing the candidate pool through career ladders and recruiting teachers through internships and training programs, that districts can enact immediately. Once a vacancy arises, the first step in conducting a principal search is to announce the position. A job model or description should accompany the announcement, and those with hiring authority should have a set of criteria for selection before beginning the screening process. Typically, screening is a two-step process. After the personnel office reviews resumes and applications for candidates, a more formalized paper screening of  qualified candidates is performed. Screeners should use a standardized ranking system to rank applicants systematically before issuing invitations for interviews. The text includes suggestions for conducting an effective interview. The district must ensure that an interviewer is trained to make the most of an interview. Interviews are more effective when all candidates are asked identical, predetermined, well-thought-out questions. Districts can make a principalship more attractive to candidates by emphasizing the principal's role of instructional leadership and de-emphasizing budgetary and legal responsibilities.

        "description":"This digest defines sexual misconduct and offers guidelines that school boards and administrators can initiate to protect students from unwanted sexual behavior. The law recognizes two types of sexual misconduct: quid pro quo, when a school employee grants a student a favor in exchange for sexual gratification, and hostile environment, where unwanted and unwelcome verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature is sufficiently severe to limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational activity. Various studies demonstrate the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct and also indicate that the problem is probably underreported. Ways in which educators can recognize employees' sexual misconduct is by being alert to overly affectionate behavior, by noting the  telling of sexual jokes, and by observing improper contact with students. Schools can fight sexual misconduct by devising a clear sexual-misconduct policy and by communicating that policy to all staff, parents, and students. Effective policies clarify the nature of sexual misconduct, contain provisions to protect the victim's confidentiality, and screen prospective employees. When an employee is suspected of sexual misconduct, reporting, grievance, and investigation procedures should be immediately implemented. Principals should prepare for accusations, disruptions in routine, and various levels of trauma among those involved. (Contains 12 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a study in which classroom teachers were asked to describe their perceptions of the principalship and to identify factors that influenced the development of their perceptions. Forty-five elementary, middle, and high school teachers, all of whom were enrolled in a course designed to facilitate the transition of teachers from the classroom to the principalship, participated. The teachers' written narratives and use of language were analyzed, using the constructivist theory of knowledge and learning, to identify the teachers' existing perceptions of leadership as exercised by school principals. The results show that the teachers used hierarchical terms to describe the power vested in building principals. The teachers expected principals to manage the school, to  foster a culture conducive to learning, to improve student learning, to promote the school's image to the community, and to influence the larger community. Few teachers reported having opportunities to engage in dialogue with principals and some reported that they formed their impressions of principals at an early age. Some of the teachers relied on family values to justify or explain their perceptions. The narratives provided information about factors that influence individual teacher's learning and the processes that teachers use to synthesize information. (RJM)",

        "description":"This article introduces a field-test model that was developed within a major curriculum-development effort in Turkey. Part of the National Educational Development Project, the model provides a systematic set of steps in piloting a newly developed curriculum in schools. Development involved three major phases--planning, implementation, and outcome--and required various activities like writing questions, determining the field-test sample, data collection and analysis, and report writing. The paper examines the process and outcomes of field testing a specific curriculum and discusses various issues regarding the use of the model. The model helped the curriculum-development committee and the Board of Education by providing them indicators of the effectiveness and appropriateness of  the new curriculum through both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings from the study helped the curriculum-development committee make decisions about revisions, which strengthened the curriculum and brought it more in line with the needs and interests of the target population. The field-test process also helped the committee see how the curriculum was being implemented and what impact it had on students in terms of cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills. Interviews and observations showed that different applications of the curriculum produced different results. (Contains 13 references.) (RJM)",

        "author":["Townsend, Tony"],
        "description":"This paper draws on studies from around the world to examine the impact of school reform over the last 30 years. It claims that there is little or no evidence that recent education reforms necessarily lead to improved student outcomes for all students. In fact, findings indicate that some reforms promote a rapid increase in the variation in student achievement between the best- and worst-achieving students and that this variation is linked to the level of decentralization within the school system. The article states that reform activity over the past few years, together with other social changes involving technology, the economy, and employment, have led to new ways of thinking about education. The paper charts the educational changes coming in the third millennium and suggests  that dominant trends in society, such as technology, a global economy, and electronic communications, will foster the move from a national to an international or global focus. The report advocates a new charter for education that is oriented towards global education. It suggests that schools use technology rather than compete with it, that they develop collaborative learning, that they refocus on the individual, and that they highlight process skills rather than specific content knowledge.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study that examined the chaotic events that principals face at their schools. The article uses a postmodern approach, claiming that traditional linear modes of explanation do not address the situations that principals frequently face. The study was conducted at three elementary schools. The primary source of data was semistructured interviews, during which a chaotic circumstance was given to the subjects so as to explain what a chaotic situation looks like. The principals reported that they faced chaotic situations related to family, weather, students, staff, and the beginning of the school year. Their daily activities can be explained best by chaos theory, and the characteristics of chaotic cases used in the study were similar to the definitions of chaos  theory and its tenets. The episodes did not align with typical cause-and-effect outcomes, and it was obvious that principals experienced chaos in their daily activities. They met these challenges through experience, critical thinking, and problem solving. Reflective learning and mental rehearsing were the two best methods used by principals to cope with chaos. Teaching chaos theory can help school principals be aware of how an organization renews itself and what processes an organization experiences during change. (Contains 14 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a 1992 study of mathematics-assessment data by measuring key instructional resources and practices and by investigating the ways in which the resources and practices affect student learning in a multilayered, complex school system. The study examined research methods that assess the effectiveness of instructional resource allocation. The results encourage the possibility of applying objective measurement and multilevel analysis methods to survey and test data for assessing the effectiveness of instructional resource allocation and use. Findings show that the availability of both human and physical resources is positively associated with the level of desired instructional practices across states. Generally, the effect of human resources is greater than the  effect of physical resources. Furthermore, the level of desired instructional practices is positively related to the level of academic achievement across states, although the relationship between instructional resources and practices varied from state to state. Setting desired levels of standards of instructional resources and practices may be tailored to individual states' unique status of resource allocation and use. States that are more effective in using physical resources than in using human resources should set standards for physical resources at higher levels than for human resources.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study that investigated how local school board chairs (N=16) in North Carolina framed school restructuring. It examines major problems awaiting to be addressed in public education and discusses what board members can do to create the conditions under which schools help students become productive citizens. Data collected through interviews and state documents were analyzed inductively. Findings show that decentralization and state-education agency downsizing translated into autonomy and responsibility for local decision making. These two realities were positioned within a perspective that the state bureaucracy had not improved schools to the satisfaction of their customers, mainly parents and business leaders. These chairs sensed that schooling must be done  differently. However, as the external buffering of the state-education agency evaporated, local boards by default became the decision makers and policy setters in an increasingly turbulent environment. Subsequently, these chairs were ambivalent about decentralization, which was perceived as providing little cohesive direction. School restructuring emerged as a vague, broadly cast dissatisfaction with the status quo. Only 5 of the 16 chairs expressed a systemic perspective grounded in a critique of traditional U.S. schooling. As downsizing continues, local boards will find themselves playing the unaccustomed role of major policy setters. (Contains 32 references.) (RJM)",

Two school superintendents were interviewed for the study. They were asked such questions as \"What kinds of information do you use in confirming, revising, and rejecting theories?\" and \"Do you revise or reject theories that no longer 'work'?\" The actions of the two participants were analyzed as theoretical (generalizable across their workplace contexts). The superintendents used data to verify and, if necessary, adjust their theories, rejected some theories antithetical to their  own values/beliefs, connected decision-making to theory, and created a web of complementary categories for addressing different situations. Their theories of practice encompassed an eclectic use of social science theory to help them organize their administrative experiences. Their theories of practice were context-specific and not designed for generalizability. Future and current administrators should learn to organize their experience inductively into complementary configurations of theoretical categories in shuttling between inductively derived generalizations about their practice and the particulars of a situation.

        "description":"This report examines principal-recruitment practices in Kentucky. The job of principal in this state became more challenging as school-reform initiatives mandated a greater emphasis on instructional leadership and decision making. Using a 2x2x3 experimental design, the effects of job attributes (instructional leadership, management), job-information sources (school site, district central office) and school level (elementary school, middle school, high school) on reactions of applicants (N=168) for principal jobs were examined. Results show that reactions were more favorable at the high-school level when the job was described with management job attributes. At the elementary- and middle-school levels, reactions were more favorable when the job was described with  instructional-leadership job attributes. Job perceptions among individuals in the broad pool of applicants paralleled perceptions of the job among incumbent principals. Findings indicate that administrators can improve recruitment efficiency, such as application rates and applicant pool size, by constructing job messages containing job attributes with maximal applicant appeal. The curricula of many principal-certification programs may be inconsistent both with potential entrants' interests and with the demands of school-reform legislation. The research approach used here can be used to investigate other factors influencing applicant decisions. (Contains 29 references.) (RJM)",

It focuses on the way that changes, such as profiles, new exam programs, and alterations in &quot;study house,&quot; interacted with and influenced teachers' tasks. The paper provides an overview of the reforms and the move toward autonomy as government came under increasing pressure to reduce its controlling role. One result of reform is the improved link between secondary education and higher education, leading many teachers in secondary education to renew their relationship with a university or college in their region. The increased emphasis on attainment levels and the raising of standards also exerted change on teachers' jobs. Teachers  use subject matter that is defined in more detail, and a standardized exam narrows the possibilities for teachers to place their own emphasis on certain aspects of the subject matter. Independent learning has been heightened with the reforms, which lightens teachers' involvement but undermines a centralized pedagogy that can help maintain class discipline. Teachers also find their tasks more differentiated and see themselves as becoming more accountable with the ascendance of local control. (Contains 25 references.) (RJM)",

The study focused on the policy process through which one state both reduced its education administration (EA) programs and developed standards for administrator licensure. Participants (N=15) in the study included a legislator, an EA professor, a school of education dean, a legislative staffer, a prominent educator, the standards board director, and other stakeholders. Each was interviewed for an average of 45 minutes and the results were transcribed and analyzed. Two distinct phases (legislative oversight and consensus-building among stakeholders) emerged from the case analysis. In the first phase, two charismatic leaders were able to convince the legislature to cut  EA programs, implement quality standards for entrance to EA programs, and establish standards for administrator licensure. EA professors had little influence during this phase because legislators perceived that universities were unable to reform from within; professors were seen as part of the problem. In the second phase, the policy-making process switched gears to a democratic, collegial model, as school-administrator standards were determined. This phase included behind-the-scene business community influences; stakeholder groups, mainly superintendents and principals; and, to some extent, EA professors. (Contains 19 references.) (RJM)",

The paper makes two assertions: principals as school leaders need academic credibility to relate with teachers as &quot;critical friends,&quot; and successful principals store and draw upon their experiences as expert decision makers. For the study, the Graduate Record Examinations (GREs) of individuals intending to enter EA programs from 1982 to 1996 were reviewed. Trend analysis indicated that the number of U.S. citizens taking the GRE who planned to pursue graduate work in EA rose 35 percent over the 15-year period of the study. However, as a percentage of all test takers, candidates in EA actually  declined from 2.3 percent to 1.8 percent. Two key findings emerged: examinees planning graduate work in education had lower verbal, quantitative, and analytic scores when compared to examinees in six other fields, and within the field of education, examinees intending to study administration had lower GREs than all other majors. The results suggest that many undergraduate education majors did not receive adequate training in analytic skills prior to their acceptance into college. Recommendations for raising the quality of future EA leaders are suggested. (Contains 54 references.) (RJM)",

The 14 chapters examine the components of good schools, including clarity of purpose, leadership, professionalism, lack of bureaucratic control, competition, and choice. The text describes the components of school-based management and the need for thorough preparation before implementing change. The book discusses the advantages and disadvantages of school-based management, such as improvement in morale and the time required in preparing for school-based management. Some of the requirements for successful reform are detailed: effective operation within a decentralized management structure, clear purpose understood and supported by the school and community, effective program  planning, and an effective monitoring program. The volume looks at the responsibility for activities that have significant, fluctuating, or highly unpredictable costs and the effort required in launching the process. It outlines the components of the school-site committee, such as the chairperson's role, and the school plan and school budget. The student-based allocation of funds, examples of allocations, the evaluation of pilot programs, and the necessary steps in evaluating change are also discussed. The final two chapters look at some of the \"Dos and Don'ts\" when implementing a school-based system. (Contains 95 references.) (RJM)",

It is a companion document to the \"Annual Report on School Safety: 1999,\" which offers an overview of the nature and scope of school crime. This report is organized as a series of indicators, with each indicator presenting data on a different aspect of school crime and safety. The report contains 4 sections: Nonfatal Student Victimization--Student Reports; Violence and Crime at School--Public School Principal/Disciplinarian Reports; Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School--Teacher Reports; and School Environment. The report shows that even though the actual rate of victimization has declined or remained constant over recent years, students feel less safe at school now than just a few years ago. Students,  ages 12 through 19, who reported avoiding one or more places at school for their own safety increased between 1989 and 1995. The presence of street gangs on school property continued to concern students, reflected by the fact that the percentage of students who reported seeing street gangs at their school increased from 1989 to 1995. Alcohol and marijuana use on school property remained constant, although marijuana use anywhere by students in grades 9 through 12 increased. Three appendices list school safety practices and policies, technical notes, and other information. (RJM)",

The purpose of this national summary is to provide critical information to decision-makers and other interested parties about the use and effectiveness of Title VI funds. The report summarizes survey data collected from participating public school districts, private nonprofit schools, and state educational agencies on the use and effectiveness of Title VI formula entitlement funds and state set-aside funds. Findings show that the highest percentage of funds was allocated for library services and materials, whereas the lowest percentage of funds  was spent in combining funds for Title I schoolwide programs. Teachers in public school districts were the largest personnel groups funded in full or in part from Title VI funds. The impact of Title VI on students shows that across public school districts, private nonprofit schools, and state educational agencies, students in grades 1-5 benefited most from programs funded in full or in part by Title VI, followed by students in grades 9-12 and students in grades 6-8. Four appendices provide an overview of Title VI funding, national Title VI data submission, and other information. (RJM)",

The case study is part of the Transforming Learning Communities (TLC) Project, designed to support significant school-reform efforts among Ohio's elementary, middle, and high schools. This report describes the implementation of an innovative program at a high school in central Ohio. It is based on a 9-month study that included observations, analysis of documents, and interviews of faculty, staff, administrators, and other stakeholders. Some of the questions researchers asked about the program included: &quot;What are the structures, strategies, and support networks that have developed to encourage change?&quot; and &quot;What is the nature of the learning community at the high school?&quot; The  text provides a history of the school and details the nature of the professional community, emphasizing the presence of reflective dialogue, shared norms and values, the collective focus on student learning, collaborative practices, and the de-privatization of practice. It then examines the collective focus on student learning and explores further the de-privatization of practice. The book closes with a plea to reformers to embrace innovation while valuing tradition. Two appendices outline the methodology and the observation protocol used for the study.

It examines the research that structured the reform and its impact on school change. The reform efforts are further elaborated through a series of five vignettes that portray the changes occurring in mathematics instruction. The report then provides background information about the two principals who played  significant parts in reform efforts and the dialectical relationship between tensions and reform that developed. It looks at the emergence of a critical mass of reform-minded teachers and the effort required to change the structure of leadership, instruction, and assessment. The last chapter describes the complexities of change, the alterations to epistemology, the presence of chaos, and the need for teachers and principals to believe in the reculturing of the school.

It emphasizes the principal's vital role in improving the science curriculum, claiming that principals should work with teachers to develop a high-quality set of objectives, learning opportunities, and evaluation techniques to modify the curriculum. The report outlines educational objectives and how each objective should be relevant and vital for pupil attainment. Three kinds of objectives need to be established: knowledge, skills, and attitudinal ends. The scope and sequence of science units is described as the paper advocates narrowing the scope to accommodate the lack of time and the lack of teaching materials. When teaching science, the sequence of instruction should be  scrutinized, teachers and principals must develop valid criteria to use in the selection of learning opportunities. Students need to have ample opportunities to identify relevant problem areas to facilitate their problem-solving skills. Educators should determine valid and reliable means of appraising pupil progress, which might entail the use of standardized tests and portfolios. Results from evaluations can then be used to improve instruction. Finally, teachers and principals need to study and analyze trends when developing a science curriculum. (RJM)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of a 1999 survey of 336 elementary schools in Ohio. It examines progressive and traditional practices in public, Catholic, and independent schools and offers an overview of the different kinds of schools. Rather than asking principals to characterize their schools as progressive or traditional, principals were presented with a chart listing pairs of contrasting practices (teacher-led instruction vs. student-initiated discovery learning, for example) and were asked to indicate which of the two approaches described common practices in their schools. The results illustrate the variety of schools available to parents and children in Ohio. Among schools in general, there is more diversity than might have been expected. Schools occupy both ends of the  progressive-traditional spectrum within each of the three sectors: Catholic, public, and independent. However, the three types were not that different from each other, and greater educational diversity existed within each sector than between sectors. Catholic schools tended to be more progressive than either public schools or independent schools. On average, independent schools were more traditional than public schools, with the former being most consistent with the educational practices they adopted, suggesting a more clearly articulated educational philosophy.

The report provides background information on KERA and describes the creation of the Support Education Excellence in Kentucky (SEEK) funding mechanism, a three-tiered system composed of three distinct but closely related components. The paper focuses on the effects of centralization on SEEK. It looks at past funding strategies for education and provides a review of educational literature on school finance and the relationship of funding to student achievement. It offers a review of school-finance litigation and concludes that the effect of variables on indicators of student achievement produces a largely inconsistent  finding. Included in the report are the results of a study in which data from public records for 176 local districts were gathered from the Kentucky School Board Association. The study asked such questions as: To what extent do selected financial characteristics contribute to student performance at the school-district level? Findings show that only one of the three selected financial characteristics influenced the district-level score. Comparisons of district expenditures indicate that significant revenue and spending gaps among Kentucky's 176 school districts still exist. (Contains 30 references.) (RJM)",

Classroom behavior-rating checklists, discipline reports, and a student survey provided evidence that these behaviors occurred more during social skills instruction than during academic classes. The goal of the practicum was to increase scores on the classroom behavior-rating checklist, reduce discipline reports, and improve the attitude of the students regarding social skills instruction. The \"Skillstreaming the Adolescent\" program, based on the social learning theory model, was initiated in conjunction with various behavior management techniques including increased opportunities for  tangible reinforcement, interdependent group contingencies, and sending negative letters home when inappropriate behaviors occurred. Behavioral observations were made over the 12-week implementation period. Analysis revealed that, during social skill instruction, classroom behavior improved and discipline reports, because of misbehavior, decreased. Students indicated through responses to survey questions that they enjoyed the social skills instructional group sessions. Appendices include the classroom behavior rating checklist and the pre- and post-intervention survey of social skills. (Contains 36 references.) (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This paper examines differences between students with and without learning disabilities (LD) in processing social information within the context of a social information processing model. It proposes that language problems may not be the sole cause for poor social skills in students with learning disabilities and suggests that social remediation programs consider the possible underlying processing difficulties that may affect these students and their ability to process social information. The paper first explains the social information processing model. It concludes that this model assumes processes that occur at a rapid rate and largely at an unconscious level, with conscious processing taking place only in relatively novel situations with attention given only while such  information is in short term memory. The paper then examines characteristics of students with learning disabilities and their characteristic difficulties with memory in information processing. The following section connects students with LD to social information processing by showing how memory processing difficulties affect these students' social perceptions. The final two sections discuss poor social relational behavior in students with and without LD and implications of this theory for social skills intervention. (Contains 21 references.) (DB)",

The surveys indicate the need to improve the ability of paraprofessionals to effectively contribute to the work of program implementation teams and the need to increase opportunities for career development/advancement for paraeducators. Recommendations include: (1) more clearly defined roles and responsibilities of paraprofessionals and teachers and greater professional development opportunities; (2) competency-based training for paraprofessionals to inform them of their roles and to better prepare them  for working with students, teachers, and parents; (3) develop and infuse content into courses to prepare teachers to supervise and work more effectively with paraeducators; (4) develop different approaches for training that acknowledge that not every paraeducator wishes to obtain a college degree; (5) improve articulation agreements between community colleges and senior colleges to facilitate transfers for paraeducators interested in earning college degrees; and (6) develop methods to accelerate the ability of interested paraeducators to earn undergraduate education degrees.

The theory views personality as a product of the interaction of temperament and socialization. Eysenck's three-factor model of personality is comprised of Extroversion (E), Neuroticism (N), and Psychoticism (P). The temperament based traits P, E, and N and their interactions are discussed in relation to Eysenck's antisocial behavior hypothesis and the development of CD. The interaction of socialization with temperament in the development of antisocial behavior is also discussed. Intervention suggestions for antisocial behavior based on Eysenck's theory as well as some possible temperament treatment interactions are  presented. Interventions for CD identified as well established or as probably efficacious using criteria developed by the American Psychological Association and possible temperament considerations in their use are covered. Effective treatments include parent training groups and videotaped parent training to prepare parents for their role as socialization agents. Finally, the possible contribution of temperament profiles to Kazdin's proposal for the use of a chronic disease model when treating CD is discussed. (Contains 52 references.) (Author/CR)",

Results of the study indicate: (1) the most significant difference among the countries is that in the United States and Ireland enabling and permissive suggestions in policy documents have not been mandated, so each school is left to determine its own arrangements; (2) Italy takes the strongest position on inclusion, requiring all schools to provide for children with disabilities in the regular classroom; (3) Italy has eliminated the deficit model, which is still in operation in  Ireland and the United States and has placed the primary focus on changing the nature of the educational environment to serve all children; and (4) the overall trend in all three countries appears to be an improvement of education for all and a merging of special education and regular education.

The first part of the study involved the formal assessment of reading decoding and reading comprehension skills using a nationally accepted instrument under optimum conditions. The second part of the study involved data collection via the social screening process of the facility, including medical, legal, educational, family, vocational, religious, and nutritional information. The analysis of data regarding both reading decoding and comprehension grade levels showed a wide range of scores achieved by both genders overall in all assigned grade  levels throughout the entire six and one half years of the study. However, the majority scored significantly below grade levels, and numerous clients fell several years below their assigned grade levels in both decoding and reading comprehension. The analysis of the social screening data revealed significant family, educational, and vocational instability. The paper concludes by urging the education community to examine the manner in which vocational education is provided to clients who may permanently feel the effects of drug and alcohol.

The study reviewed data from the 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Survey that included 128,001 people (ages 18-69) with and without visual impairments. Chapter 1 highlights age (seen as lifestage) and health status as critical determinants of the meaning and importance of employment in people's lives and suggests those facts have been surprisingly neglected as analytic tools in research on employment and disability. Chapter 2 reviews key variables relating to vision and disability status, key employment and work variables, and key social and health factors. Chapter 3 focuses on employment status and on &quot;working&quot; as a major life role, comparing people  with serious visual impairment to the general public and to people with nonvisual impairments. Chapter 4 introduces employment data for people who are legally blind and compares them to others with serious visual impairments. The next chapter continues the focus on comparisons of people who are legally blind with others who have serious visual impairments. It shows that health and multiple impairments are powerful factors. The final chapter summarizes and discusses major conclusions and implications. (Contains 61 references and 45 tables.) (CR)",

The paper explains relevant laws and regulations, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, compares one-tier and two-tier systems of enacting due process procedures, and considers differences in how states report time periods. Analysis suggests a trend away from formal hearings toward settlement of disputes through other measures and improvements in quality of data as states computerize their data collection efforts and make data available on the World Wide Web. Five tables provide data on individual states for: (1)  state structures, (2) state record keeping years, (3) number of hearings requested at level 1, (4) number of hearings held at level 1, and (5) number of hearings held at level 2 for two-tiered states.

Introductory information discusses what mediation is, who mediators are, a typical mediation process, and the relationship of education to culture. The document then presents 52 specific strategies organized into four categories: (1) policies and systems (e.g., adopt a policy that mediation services must be sensitive to cultural, linguistic and class differences); (2) education and outreach (e.g., involve families, parent training centers and advocacy groups in the development and distribution of education and outreach materials); (3)  mediation procedures and processes (e.g., give preference to multilingual and culturally competent intake coordinators); and (4) mediators and practitioners (e.g., ensure that mediators and educators are aware that some individuals and families do not welcome the involvement of government or other agencies in personal or family affairs). The paper concludes that use of these strategies demonstrates a commitment to equal access, mutual respect, and basic human rights. An annotated list of organizational resources and recommended reading is attached. An appendix presents the regulatory provision for mediation under IDEA '97 (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments 1997). (DB)",

Tips are provided for preparing for the mediation session, and the stages of mediation are described. Mediation policies are  listed, including the eligibility of disputes that are only applicable for a due process hearing, the prohibition of any video- or audiotape recording of mediation proceedings, the designation of a person by each party who has the authority to make final resolution decisions, the prohibition of legal participation and attendance, the provision of signed copies of the agreement to each party, the exclusion of the mediator from subsequent actions, and the cancellation of a due process hearing if requested.

Three case studies are introduced to help explain the educational applications. The three children (ages 2-15) profiled are representative of the diversity of students who experience a brain injury. Their stories describe how they, along with their families, teamed with staff from their rehabilitation centers and schools to facilitate their return to school. These stories not only personalize students with TBI, but also the educational practices and programming often necessary  to support reintegration and educational success. The manual focuses on several key areas in the context of the three case studies: (1) developing a school re-entry plan; (2) implementing learning, memory, and behavioral strategies; (3) developing an Individualized Education Program; (4) conducting a functional behavioral assessment; and (5) developing a behavioral intervention plan.

Section 1 presents highlights of the 1998 freshman survey and includes personal and family background, high school preparation and matriculation to college, college and career expectations, self-perceptions, and opinions. Section 2 provides data on differences by gender among full-time freshmen with disabilities. Section 3 highlights the types of disabilities, including learning disability, partial sight or blindness, health-related disability, orthopedic impairment, hearing impairments, and speech impairments. A summary  identifies trends such as: (1) the proportion of freshmen reporting disabilities remained at 9 percent between 1991 and 1998; (2) students with learning disabilities continued to be the fastest growing group, with two in five freshmen with disabilities reporting a learning disability; and (3) although freshmen with disabilities were still more likely than nondisabled peers to enroll in two-year colleges, a higher proportion of 1994 students with disabilities was enrolling in four-year institutions, compared to 7 years earlier. Three tables in the appendix provide additional data on freshmen characteristics. (Contains 13 tables and 4 figures.) (CR)",

The guide then discusses how to get a consortium off the ground and key issues that need to be considered. Following sections address how to maintain a  consortium, forming work teams, and funding a consortium. Suggestions for long-term projects for a disability support consortium are then described, including: college nights, college panels, self-assessments to help students evaluate their readiness for postsecondary education, speakers bureaus, and information sessions for the consortium.

        "description":"This literature review discusses the need for rehabilitation organizations to become culturally competent and for rehabilitation research to reach and be utilized by minority populations. Sections address the incidence of disability in minority populations, the socially constructed nature of race, culture, and disability, cultural power and the perpetuation of inequity, cultural and other considerations that can influence effectiveness within the rehabilitation system, and characteristics of effective systems and relationships. Following suggestions for developing culturally competent organizations, recommendations for research are provided and include: (1) grounding decisions about research purposes and hypotheses in a thorough knowledge of potential user audiences; (2)  examining assumptions inherent in the goals, hypotheses, and methods of the intended research; (3) exploring a variety of research methodologies; (4) defining all variables fully; (5) using sampling techniques that provide adequate representation among all targeted audiences; (6) structuring data collection activities to ensure an appropriate rate of return for all targeted subpopulations; (7) carefully considering within-group as well as between-group differences; (8) seeking input and feedback from representatives of target audiences in identifying data collection procedures and instruments, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions; and (9) using multiple dissemination strategies and media.

Thirty-six randomly selected third, fourth, and fifth grade students with learning disabilities were assigned to three interventions: (1) the traditional spelling procedure; (2) a multisensory procedure without perceptual-vowel enhancement; and (3) a multisensory procedure with perceptual-vowel enhancement (where vowels were written in black marker to heighten their intensity). A qualitative spelling error analysis system was used as well as quantitative data analysis methods. The study found no significant interactions among level of vowel precision with type of intervention. Significant differences for vowel omission scores by group and across  grade levels were found.

First, ADD/ADHD is defined and then the origins of ADD/ADHD as a neurological disorder are traced in a review of the periods of 1800 to 1950, 1950 to 1970, 1970 to 1990, and 1990 to 1999. The review then goes on to consider implications of neuro-imaging technology, a look at frontal lobe and parietal lobe involvement, and implications of the neuro-transmitter dysfunction theory. Examination of ADD/ADHD and genetics reviews family studies, twin studies as a basis for ADHD genetic etiology, and adoption  studies. Discussion of other genetic discoveries notes new research concerning the thyroid hormone receptor and a dopamine transporter gene. The final section considers assessment and treatment of ADD/ADHD including current assessment procedures, traditional treatment, and other treatment approaches. One of the five conclusions is that neurological studies involving brain scans indicate brain peculiarities in approximately 70 percent of the children diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.

There are 2,000 students enrolled in the three schools and the free/reduced lunch incidence varies from 60 percent to 80 percent. A description of provisions for identification of economically disadvantaged students is also provided. Twenty-one regular class teachers from the three schools received professional development training in the identification of and educational planning for gifted and talented students, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The training used a model developed by Howard Spicker that emphasizes  identifying characteristics for rural disadvantaged gifted children. The model contrasts these students with the more typical urban middle class child who displays skills and abilities that teachers automatically recognize as gifted. Results from a post-training survey indicate that teachers felt their ability to identify culturally diverse and low-socioeconomic gifted and talented students had improved after professional development training and activities on identification procedures.

The research covers four fundamental problems in technology ownership that add costs to schools and create problems for educators: (1) lack of technical expertise; (2) lack of sustained funding; (3) lack of incentive to manage technology efficiently; and (4) difficulties in managing technology programs. Three State policies are recommended to help schools and school districts identify, plan, and manage TCO for technology. The first requires schools to have separate budget accounts for technology in the school budget. The second divides State  funding into four phases with each contingent on a school's readiness to proceed to the next phase. The third creates incentives for school districts to provide technology support more efficiently. Appendices provide the best practices for each phase of the life cycle of owning and managing technology, and descriptions and overviews of each of the study's schools and the school district.

Data reveal that most school districts had enough space for smaller classes for at least two grade levels; small school districts were much less likely to report space constraints. The CSR did cause some collective bargaining problems for some districts concerning smaller class size costs curtailing teacher salary increases and workload concerns. Finally, the mandated CSR teacher training is being mostly conducted on an ad hoc basis with little attention being paid to core materials needed. Several policy issues are examined that could impede CSR's future progress. Issues include the ability of smaller classes to actually  improve student performance, fading interest from parents and teachers, CSR funding eroding available funding for other programs, space constraints preventing equal implementation within school districts, and teacher supply increasing rapidly enough to prevent bottlenecks.

A CPTED principle suggests that a well designed office should serve as the guardian at the gate, with excellent surveillance outside and inside the school, especially up and down hallways, the entry area, parking lots, drop off areas, and playing fields. Progressively higher levels of security design for the main entry and office areas are diagramed providing  benefits and disadvantages of each. (Contains 16 references.) (GR)",

Ideas presented are based on experiences of real charter schools. The document is organized around four major means by which charter schools can meet the facility's financing challenge. The first section addresses financing preparation and provides tools that can help facilities in crafting business, accountability, and facility-development plans. The second section addresses creative ways to accumulate the amount charter schools need to finance. The third section explains how aggressive shopping, exploring low-cost forms of financing,  looking for ways to make their deals less risky, and pursuing other strategies can help these schools reduce the interest rates they pay for financing. The fourth section explains how charter schools can improve public policies regarding these facilities, obtain per-pupil revenue for charter schools, and bring about other helpful changes. Appendices provide sources for additional information. (GR)",

This report summarizes the major trends in facility design that were discovered in the following areas: safety and security features; classroom space; technology areas; administrative spaces; communal space; school grounds; teachers' facilities; community use of school facilities; energy use and sustainable design; organization of instruction; and special programs. While numerous innovative design features are being implemented in school across Virginia, the data reveal that older schools built prior to 1990 have fewer of them. Older schools lack some of the benefits of flexible space and extra space for learning, have limited  use of landscapes and community access to school assets, and lack central air conditioning. New schools have more cost-saving features and flexible space for instruction, and greater access to the surrounding community. An appendix provides survey statistics. (Contains 11 references.)

Both ESL and non-ESL teachers are coming to view these technologies as a means by which ESL learners who cannot otherwise participate in class activities can be actively involved in language and literacy practice. A recent survey indicates that ESL teachers are effectively using software designed for native speakers of English--software that is academic, is content-rich and, when their use is coordinated with mainstream academic content, helps to support the interplay of linguistic and conceptual development. This report discusses the unique features of electronic texts, provides analysis of learner interactions  with them, and discusses the implications for second language and literacy development. Examples are drawn from extended observations of two exemplary ESL classrooms (one elementary, one middle school). Carefully crafted teacher use of electronic texts demonstrates the real and potential roles of this medium, for computers break down and obsolesce and can sometimes be too cumbersome to deal with, reaffirming the primacy of the human dimension of instruction. Overall, this report surveys and documents the very innovative use of cutting edge information and communications technologies in ESL education. (Contains 47 references.) (Author/KFT)",

At the same time, English-language programming is widely available in Taiwan via cable television. Cable television is a useful instructional tool for teachers of English as a Second Language. This source of authentic English can be brought into the classroom and used as a teaching resource, and students can be taught how to use it effectively for self-study. High school students can be given a transcript of the video and then use the transcript to practice intonation and pronunciation, to study the grammar and vocabulary of commonly spoken English, and to act out selected scenes. Advice is given regarding how to choose an appropriate program, one that is  both entertaining and useful for the purpose of language instruction. Possible activities are also suggested, such as asking students to guess who said what; practicing the proper intonation; discerning the emotion of the characters; completing dialogues; answering comprehension questions; and comparing cultures. Video programming provides an excellent tool for moving students from the artificially slow and clear English of teaching materials to the authentic English used by native English speakers. (KFT)",

        "description":"This paper details a 2-year study of exemplary uses of electronic texts (information displayed electronically on a computer screen) in two English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learning contexts. Topics include the following: the need and desire to communicate; opportunities for topic control; and opportunities for planned and unplanned discourses. Language and literacy are socially mediated and socially constructed phenomena. Where technology is commonly viewed as a venue for independent, non-social activity, quite the opposite has been observed by researchers. Indeed, the presence of technology in conjunction with the goals, purposes, and epistemologies of these teachers is resulting in a unique and powerful classroom dynamic where children are taking control of their own  meaning-making with teachers scaffolding and guiding the process. The manner in which these activities can be orchestrated and supported by technology is instructive for teachers, teacher educators, administrators, and curriculum developers as they consider roles for the technology in various language and literacy-oriented school contexts. Electronic texts and the machines that carry them can be springboards and supports for reading, writing, listening, speaking, and thinking. Such uses demonstrate the real and potential language and literacy implications of computers and electronic texts when these tools are thoughtfully integrated into instructional contexts. When properly used, electronic texts can offer novel and empowering roles for learners and their teachers. (Contains 18  references.) (KFT)",

It assists in a comprehensive exploration of resources with different types of delivery, content, and level of interaction. The book is free of technical jargon, making insight into the complexity of the task all the easier for the user who is not technically-inclined. Resources include the following: comprehensive lists of URLs in a large number of languages, typically including a wide range of links; comprehensive lists of URLs for a single language, also extensively linked; and sites that focus on a single language. Selection of resources has focused on resources that have the potential to be integrated into existing  courses; are instantly usable, in some cases without a teacher; are free or available at a reasonable cost; and are substantial and/or provide useful self-contained activities. Resources are not judged or rated by the author beyond the stated selection criteria; they are merely offered for the reader to pick and choose among. The book is divided into four parts: an introduction; annotated lists of example sites; making sense of the technology; and getting the language right--text input and output. Four appendices are included: useful sites for English-as-a-Second/Foreign-Language; selected links pages for languages in general and specific languages; on-line readings related to MUDs and MOOs; and sites included at the last minute that bear watching.

        "description":"This document presents an action plan to solve the problem of inadequate English-as-a-Second/Other-Language (ESOL) instruction in high school content area courses and to increase effort and motivation among ESOL students. ESOL students often do not have sufficient command of English to do very well in content-oriented courses (such as history, science, mathematics). The plan of action offered is a bottom-up approach with three primary objectives designed to persuade interested content area teachers to try some new strategies and techniques to better serve ESOL students in their classes. Objective 1 is to create awareness of the problem among content area teachers, parents, relevant staff, and the community. Objective 2 is to provide guidelines consisting of strategies and  procedures that will ensure ESOL students have equal access to challenging academic content--emphasizing training of content area teachers to meet the special needs of ESOL students in a mainstream classroom. Objective 3 is to involve parents and the community in the school life. Overall, the plan presented in this study is an effort to provide concrete strategies to help increase teacher awareness of ESOL students and their needs, and to offer many procedures for establishing culturally friendly classes and strategies that should increase the learning and motivation of all students. Extensive references and resources are provided. (Author/KFT)",

        "description":"Expectations of performance in a foreign language are important predictors of future achievement. Two types of bias occur in foreign language learning: self-enhancement bias, which pertains to students who are unrealistically optimistic about their ability to learn a foreign language; and self-derogation bias, which pertains to those students who have little or no confidence in their ability to learn a foreign language. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of these two biases and to compare students with these two biases, as well as those with accurate self-assessments of their foreign language performance, with respect to anxiety and overall academic achievement. Participants were 213 college students enrolled in Spanish, French, or German classes.  Self-enhancement bias was more than three times as prevalent as self-derogation bias--47.4% versus 13.6% respectively. Students with self-derogation bias tended to have significantly higher levels of anxiety about foreign languages, while those with self-enhancement bias tended to have overall lower levels of academic performance. It is concluded that self-enhancement bias has a greater potential than does self-derogation bias to facilitate language learning because language learning anxiety has been implicated as a probable cause of language learning difficulties. Discerning and understanding these expectations may help foreign language instructors better target and help affected students. (Author/KFT)",

Present were Representatives Frank Riggs (chair), Bobby Scott, Randy Cunningham, Bob Filner, and Brian Bilbray. Offering testimony generally in support of bilingual education, or at least the option of it, were Dr. Eugene Garcia, Dean of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Berkeley; and Celia Ruiz, an attorney representing four California school districts. Dr. Garcia based his support for bilingual education on the conclusions of a number of government and academic studies showing overall positive effects of bilingual education. Ms. Ruiz focused her testimony not on the merits or  drawbacks of bilingual education but on a defense of the legal process that federal law has created to allow school districts to choose from a range of educational options, from English immersion to long-term bilingual education programs. Cathy Liska, a teacher from Anaheim, California, and George S. Louie, a parent of a child placed in a bilingual education setting from Oakland, California, spoke against bilingual education. Mr. Louie's child had very negative experiences. Ms. Liska's experience as an elementary school teacher with first-hand classroom experience of bilingual education has convinced her it does not serve limited-English-speaking students well and should be ended.

        "author":["Curry, Mary Jane"],
        "description":"Acting as a sliding signifier, the term \"critical thinking\" has been bandied about for years now by educators who often ascribe widely varying meanings to it. Researchers and writers mainly stress the \"thinking\" half of the phrase, often leaving unexamined what it means to be \"critical.\" Those in the fields of critical pedagogy and critical literacy focus on the \"critical\" part of the phrase. \"Critical\" has become a trendy buzzword, and has been inappropriately appended to English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) texts, particularly writing textbooks, again with widely varying meanings and motivations. This paper explores the similarities, overlaps, and differences in the multiple meanings of critical thinking, looking at the origins of the field, its uses in the educational  enterprise, its limitations, including cultural and feminist critiques, and issues that arise in including critical thinking in curricula for postsecondary ESL students. A definition of critical thinking is proposed for ESL students that attempts to account for these discrepancies, limitations, and constitutive tensions. It is concluded that the critical part of critical thinking should be emphasized when critical means being able to distinguish among alternatives, to make judgments about issues and problems under consideration, and to consider the implications of arguments of direct concern to students' future and current lives.

It is organized into four main sections: an overview of the project; assessment; articulation; and what has been learned. Teams of North Carolina foreign language teachers worked to create instruments to better assess students' language skills and facilitate student articulation from elementary to middle school and from middle school to high school. More specifically, the objectives were to provide training in assessment to foreign language teachers through intensive summer training; to assist participants in developing and piloting assessment tools to be used at various levels  of instruction; and to assist participants in aligning these assessments with national standards, the North Carolina state curriculum framework, and local curriculum. This document provides an overview of the project and sample assessments, a background for assessment in general and more specifically for alternative models of assessment, and a sample of a variety of assessment tools (supplemented by assessment tools from other sources when needed to illustrate particular points). Among the general conclusions were that teachers are more willing to use newer methods when they become more familiar and confident with them, and that for that to happen administrative support is crucial.

        "description":"This paper describes how a large school district in suburban Atlanta, Georgia dealt with the challenges presented by the relatively sudden influx of a large number of highly heterogeneous limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. The eight most critical specific problems that underlay the assimilation of the new students included the following: a lack of proper assessment techniques; a largely negative categorization of the limited-English students by both students and teachers; low expectations; a lack of strategies to deal with the problem; a lack of multicultural awareness; almost no parental involvement in the classroom; a lack of community support; and too large of a student-teacher ratio in content area classrooms. Half of these problems must be solved through  administrative action or planning by lowering the student teacher ratio in classes with larger numbers of LEP students; securing more and better evaluative materials to allow for a more effective assessment of each student; building greater community support programs for LEP students; and promoting greater parental involvement. The other half of the solution requires professional development for teachers, including: cultural sensitivity training; success orientation training; and training to use practical strategies and methods. Attached are appendices that could be the focus of training in the use of practical strategies and methods. Forms include: ESOL Strategies Used in Content Area Courses for Vocabulary Enrichment/Expanding Comprehension; ESOL Strategies at the  Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced Level; Program Models and Approaches of Instruction for LEP Students; and List of Some General Problems and Solutions.

It set out to incorporate what is known about quality professional development with the special features necessary for meeting the needs of English language learners. The project defined a model of sheltered instruction based on the research of best practices, as well as on the experiences of the participating teachers and researchers. They collaborated in developing the observation tool being utilized in the study, the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP), which identifies the features of sheltered instruction that can enhance and expand teachers' instructional practice. The  SIOP was originally designed as an observation and rating tool for the researchers to use while viewing the participating teachers in the classroom. During the course of the project, however, the participating teachers discovered its potential as a tool for lesson planning and reflection. The model has been used to train middle school teachers to implement effective sheltered strategies in their classes in four large urban school districts (two on the East Coast and two on the West Coast).

The cooperative learning model selected was Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC). It consists of instructional practices that develop social, academic, and communication skills. It was selected for the following reasons: (1) It integrates oral language development, reading, and writing through all phases of instruction; (2) it enables bilingual teachers to manage their English, primary language, and transitional literacy  activities effectively; (3) it develops critical thinking and social skills; (4) it develops self-esteem and self-confidence; (5) it uses children's literature in two languages and a variety of text genres, including student publications and reading texts; (6) it helps students appreciate and become proficient in their primary language while developing proficiency in English; and (7) it provides an English teaching and learning environment in which the subject matter is not watered down, and higher order discourse and thinking are the norm. The digest describes the features of the bilingual version of the CIRC model, now called BCIRC, and highlights initial findings from the Ysleta Independent School District. (VWL)",

Called Black Vernacular English (BVE) in the 1960s and 70s, African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the 1980s and 90s, (called &quot;Ebonic&quot;, without the &quot;s&quot; by this author, in keeping with other language names that end in &quot;-ic&quot;, such as Arabic and Amharic) Ebonics has traditionally been considered a dialect of English by educators and linguists. To understand why Ebonics might be considered a language other than English requires a closer look at what it takes to make a language, as well as what the differences are between a language and a dialect. The author discusses the following  questions: What does it take to make a language? Is Ebonic bad English? Is Ebonic a language or a dialect? and Why consider Ebonic a separate language?

The school is also providing all academic disciplines with a consistent set of reports on programs and faculty workload on an annual basis. It has  re-instituted its academic program review cycle, where the Senate Academic Overview Committee reviews all programs on a 7 year basis. A top priority at Keene State College is managing course offerings for students. As part of the school efforts, the academic deans are more closely involved in reviewing course demands, staffing configurations, and enrollment needs. Despite these efforts, there are still complaints from students that they cannot get the courses they want.  However, the senior survey, administered to graduating seniors, does not indicate that students perceive course availability to be an impediment. The college plans to become more evidence-driven in its assessment of course availability in order to understand fully student needs and expectations.  In addition to monitoring  course availability, the school continues to pursue diversity goals. It has made modest gains in recruiting minority students and addressing campus climate and awareness yet has made significant gains in recruiting women faculty to the campus. (AA)",

Discussed at the seminar was the role that these professions play in public life. It was noted that there is increasing dismay over the public's declining trust in America's institutions. Professional reform efforts to remedy this situation have made progress in the fields of journalism and philanthropy. In the past, the field of higher education has given low priority to civic work. Also, research at institutes of higher learning tends to be organized around academic disciplines rather than civic responsibilities. Whether the ideas presented at the seminar will take root in the field of higher education remains to be seen. (JM)",

In August of 1995, the Louisiana legislature raised the legal minimum drinking age to 21. This provided a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a change in legal status on actual drinking behavior. In this study, college student drinking patterns were examined 6 months prior to the change in status and 6, 18 and 30 months after the change. The goal was to seek validation of the Spillover Effect discussed by H. W. Perkins and A. D. Berkowitz in their 1989 study. Four samples of over 400 students culled from a multi-stage stratified sample provided data for 18-21 year old college students'  self-report of drinking behavior each January from 1995 through 1998.

Over the last four years, these leaders have defined a number of state goals that they believe tie budget to policy and will drive the activity of the statewide university system. Significant changes have included: moving toward a more collaborative system approach to higher education issues; jettisoning the traditional state higher education funding formula; reinvesting savings to improve efficiency; adopting  initiatives to increase academic quality and partnering between four-year institutions and other educational entities.

Whereas other federal student aid programs have used grants, scholarships, and loans to help students and their families finance college, the new law has made college more affordable by providing new federal income tax credits, savings incentives, and deductions for interest paid on student loans. This policy guide examines the implications of these federal tax provisions for state higher education policy. It describes federal tax credits designed to help students and their families to meet the current expenses of college: the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits, the new tax incentives concerning college savings, and the new provisions regarding student loans.

The study, conducted at Emory University (Georgia), involved 25 faculty who had participated in a series of semester-long seminars that explored topics of common concern among university faculty. The sample reflected various departments, disciplines, ranks, and experience (excepting the business school). Participants were asked semistructured, open-ended questions concerning the general nature of the seminar experience, positive and negative features of the seminars, and ways in which the seminars might have been improved, as well as questions about what influence the seminars had on  participants' interactions with other faculty members and on their ties to the university. It was concluded that the seminar series expanded the intellectual horizons of all participants by providing a model for interdisciplinary discourse and encouraging exploration of different approaches to knowledge and truth. The program also built a reservoir of good will that enabled participants to engage in unfamiliar and difficult discourse. Many participants also developed a wider and warmer view of the university as more than a collection of disparate parts, and for many the seminar helped mitigate feelings of intellectual or physical isolation.

The sample consisted of 23 women: 10 who had earned doctorates before 1970, 7 who had earned their doctorates between 1970 and 1979, and 6 who had earned doctorates in 1980 or after. Secondary analysis of the original questionnaire and interview data suggested differences and similarities among the three cohorts on three dimensions--perceived obstacles, perceived supports, and the compatibility of marriage, family, and career. Women in the earlier cohorts mentioned encountering structural obstacles more frequently than did  women in later cohorts, and they almost exclusively pointed to a father or other male as being influential in their career choice. A majority of married women reported that marriage had a positive impact on their careers. The report concludes that birth cohort, rather than doctoral cohort, may be a more valid indicator of differences in attitudes and experiences related to compatibility of family and career.

The study found that while active researchers reported somewhat more positive attitudes toward research than did the less-active researchers, there was considerable variation across and within the two groups; both groups held strong allegiance to the historic teaching mission of public universities.

Interviews were conducted with four mathematics faculty at each of three Midwestern, Research 1 public institutions--a national research institution, a land grant university, and an urban university--who were involved in teaching or in the assessment of reform calculus, as well as with administrators, institutional researchers, and faculty development specialists. Interview questions covered such topics as whether students  were ready for college calculus, students' classroom behaviors, new teaching strategies, what destinations lay ahead for calculus-trained students, how well students spoke the language of mathematics, changing faculty roles and practices, how involvement in reform had affected careers, and barriers to adopting new teaching techniques. The study found that faculty who were open to reform embraced the challenges and the payback realized by getting closer to students, noting, however, that these techniques required a greater investment in time.

This study synthesizes findings from the literature in an effort to develop a comprehensive understanding of doctoral student attrition and persistence. A new qualitative methodology-meta-synthesis was used to sort and integrate findings from the large body of research on doctoral student persistence. The sample for the study  consists of 118 research studies completed between 1970 and 1998. Findings indicate that: (1) attrition and persistence rates vary widely depending on field of study, and even more widely depending on program of study; (2) departmental culture affects doctoral student persistence; (3) difficulties with the dissertation relate to attrition; (4) academic achievement indicators, with the exception of graduate record examination scores, are not effective predictors of degree completion; (5) employment and financial factors are poor indicators of persistence; and (6) retention rates vary widely among institutions.

Although the higher education component in China is relatively small, the central government expects it to play a key role in social and economic development. The government also wants to decentralize university administration and reduce its share of the financial burden, but at the same time not lose complete control. Sections of the paper discuss the development of Chinese higher education, sources of funding for higher education, private higher education, the need to  decentralize the administrative structure, and issues of efficiency, effectiveness, and expansion. Issues addressed include free education in China losing out to market forces; a growing disparity between rich and poor; increasing demand for higher education as a result of the growth of secondary education; and the need for legal codes on which to base policies and protect the rights of institutions, their administrators, faculty, and students.

The four major elements of this project include: (1) archival research of the institution's history of segregation and desegregation; (2) a report on the status of women and minority faculty, staff, and students; (3) climate surveys of faculty, staff, and students; and (4) interviews with various constituents and benchmarking visits to other institutions. This paper focuses on the survey of faculty's assessment of the campus climate for diversity. The survey questionnaire, which was mailed to all 2,648 faculty members both on and off campus, included questions on professional treatment and social acceptance in the department, institutional  climate, attitudes about affirmative action, level of commitment evidenced by institutional leaders, and personal experiences with discrimination and harassment. The response rate was 50 percent. The survey strongly suggests that experiences and perceptions of non-majority faculty differ in significant ways from those of majority faculty and that majority faculty are generally unaware of the extent of these differences. Both women and faculty of color expressed concern about the institutional commitment to creating a diverse faculty. The survey questionnaire is appended. (Contains 15 references.) (RH)",

        "description":"This interpretative case study examines how the faculty at Ohio Dominican College, a Baccalaureate II, coeducational college, perceives the college's academic and religious identities, and how these identities are expressed in the life of the campus. Additionally, on a more conceptual level, the study offers an opportunity to examine the emerging concept of organizational identity and its relevance for higher educational institutions. Data for the study were collected between January and September 1997 in interviews with fourteen full-time faculty, as well as with extensive site observations and document analysis. The study found qualitative differences in the way participants' viewed the college's academic and religious identities--as an academic liberal arts institution, and as  a Catholic college with a Dominican tradition. Faculty identification with Dominicanism is more widespread than with Catholicism. Further differences are concerned with the values of liberal arts education, as opposed to education in applied and professional fields. Although liberal arts are central to faculty perceptions of the college, more than half of the 31 baccalaureate majors offered are in applied and professional fields, and 63 percent of the baccalaureate degrees are awarded in those fields.

However, they maintained close, long-standing supportive ties with women colleagues; and in cases where women colleagues in the home department were scarce or absent, they identified with colleagues from other campuses.

        "description":"This comparative case study investigated instructional methods that effectively enhance the development of students' critical thinking. Four institutions were selected for study; two at which students reported experiencing high degrees of growth in the ability to think critically, and two at which students reported experiencing low degrees of growth. Analysis of the data, which came primarily from 55 interviews and 28 classroom observations, suggests that the development of critical thinking is linked to an emphasis on writing and rewriting. At the two schools scoring high on an institutional growth in critical thinking (IGCT) measure, there was a strong focus on writing, a focus absent from the two schools that scored low on IGCT. At one school (high IGCT, low selectivity) a  curricular policy stipulates that writing be an integral part of all course programs (which are taught by a multi-disciplinary team of faculty members). Another classroom factor that appears related to the development of critical thinking is an emphasis on class discussion, which again exists at the two high IGCT institutions. Appendices include a table showing selection criterion for case study sites, a summary of classroom observation data, and descriptions of categories for the observation data.

        "description":"This study examines the relationship among Chicano students' sense of belonging to colleges and universities, their cultural development, and their subsequent persistence. A survey questionnaire was given to a random sample of 687 Chicano students at 3 institutions of higher education in San Diego: a University of California campus (247 students), a California State University campus (339 students), and a California Community College campus (101 students). A 47-item questionnaire measured students' cultural responses; an additional 4 items measured their sense of belonging (as defined by Hurtado 1997). Analysis of the data indicated a high degree of biculturalism, and the significant but modest contribution to a sense of belonging indicated by the cultural response factors  reflects the likelihood that Chicano student perceptions of their campus experiences and their subsequent persistence may be affected by the students' degree of biculturalism. Factors contributing significantly to a sense of belonging include a reasonable comfort level in social affiliations with white students, knowledge of Mexican history, positive perceptions of their primary (Mexican) culture, and a well-developed ethnic identity. The study concludes that these dimensions of development can be addressed positively by educational institutions through their curriculum, staffing patterns, and pedagogy. (Contains 13 references.)

The same course was delivered to both classes by the same group of professors, using identical course requirements. The on-campus class met once a week for three hours in the evening; eleven adult students and two or three professors attended each class. Distributed class sessions (using a Lotus notes platform) took place at the time of students' choosing throughout the week, with all assignments and exams conveyed through writing. The professors were all experienced in the subject matter and in teaching; two of the three had previously taught using the software.  The survey revealed that the characteristics of students in both classes were more alike than different. The distributed education class had a slight edge on the final grades, with the strongest indicator of difference seeming to lie in the greater amount of confidence the students brought to the class. The study also notes that the distributed students who had previous experience in distance learning spent more time in class. (RH)",

The objectives were for the teachers in the targeted group to demonstrate an increased use of instructional technology by generating products using four out of eight skills in which they had been instructed and for 20% or more of the targeted group to attain more skills to operate and integrate various technological hardware and software programs. A target group of 14 teachers involved in regular education was established for the program. The 12-week program focused on staff development of computer-related technology so that as teachers gained expertise they would transfer their  knowledge to their students. The program contained various activities and strategies using multimedia instructional technology for the improvement of these skills. Levels of success were measured by a pre- and post-teacher technology survey as well as products generated and recorded on a technology profile checklist. Appendices include tables showing the pre- and post-teacher technology skills survey and results in percentages, and a teacher technology portfolio checklist. (Author)",

        "description":"In the current education literature, the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet, has an image of freedom and liberation based on its capacity to transcend the conventional notions of time and space and its potential to offer unlimited educational opportunities. This paper suggests that the use of the Web in education tends to reproduce preexisting structures of power and knowledge. Reading the meanings that the Web brings into education through the philosophical lenses of postmodernism, poststructuralism, and critical theory, the paper contends that use of the Web in public schools in the United States embodies a paradox. On the one hand, the computerization of knowledge seems to provide the postmodern societies with an opportunity for liberation by providing an equal, free and  open environment for exchanging diverse choices and voices, symbolizing human emancipatory cognitive interest. On the other hand, the pleasure of gaining information may create a smoke screen that hides social injustice through its redistribution of knowledge and its lack of equal opportunity through equal access. The paradox can be understood as a dilemma of human interest pursuing liberation only to be further alienated. (Author/AEF)",

Results lend support for the choice of instructional materials appropriate to students' learning styles, based on Myers-Briggs psychological types, but they do not make very clear distinctions  between the latest instructional methodology, the CD-ROM, and a more traditional one, the videotape, as to which is more appealing to a particular learning style.

        "description":"Many United States institutions of higher education have established Web-based educational environments that provide higher education curricula via the Internet and diverse modalities. Success has been limited primarily to virtual classrooms (real audio/video transmission) and/or test taking (online form filing). An extensive survey was carried out that examined the course content offered by many leading private and public North American Universities and some colleges in the United Kingdom that offer full or part-time programs via the Internet. Four alternative methods that have been employed to place laboratories online include: videotapes, home kits, arrangements with local facilities, and software simulation. These are far from being \"real\" labs. In electrical and computer  engineering and other technical fields, the challenge remains how students can perform real working lab experiments through virtual technology. The innovative concept of having a Real Lab on the Internet via Remote Lab Technology could provide a solution. (Contains 21 references.) (AEF)",

As part of the project, the sixth-grade students in this study received IBM ThinkPads. Trends that appear in the literature on integrating technology into the curriculum are first discussed. Changes that occurred with the introduction of the laptops into this particular sixth-grade classroom are then described, followed by a case study of a unit on ancient Egypt taught in both laptop and non-laptop settings. The &quot;Create-a-Character&quot; project required students to work in two groups: the first group did not have access to any computer technology, while the second had constant access to their  laptops. Findings from both groups are discussed in terms of collaboration, the writing process, research skills and critical evaluation of information, and presentations. Results of the study suggest that laptops enable change in the management of the classroom and in the design of instructional activities and assignments. (Contains 39 references.) (AEF)",

        "description":"In 1997-98, all Acadia University (Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada) freshman undergraduate students were required to lease IBM laptop computers for use in their programs. With corporate support from IBM, the campus was wired so that students could have cross-campus and off-campus access to a host of network software as well as the World Wide Web. The Acadia University laptop project, coined the &quot;Acadia Advantage&quot; (AA) was a first in Canada. This fully-wired campus and student access to laptop computers allowed for innovative approaches to using computers in classroom instruction. An electronic portfolio assessment strategy was implemented in both Secondary and Elementary Science Education courses for Pre-service Teacher candidates. A survey of the impact of this electronic  environment on students' attitudes reveals that students continue to require significant introduction to the technology in order to overcome the associated anxiety. In a 10- to 13-week course, such a time commitment to the technology may not be reasonable. In future offerings of the course, a preliminary workshop will be offered. (Contains 13 references.)

        "description":"This report describes a strategy for infusing computer technology into the essay composition process in order to enhance student achievement. The targeted population consisted of freshman high school students in a middle class community in central Illinois. Problems related to the use of computer technology in the learning process were documented through data collection via student surveys, document analysis of students' writing, observation checklists of student behavior in a computer lab, and interviews. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that the use of computer technology in the composition process without proper instruction in quality essay writing and basic computer literacy skills led to poor essays and technological oversimplification. In general, faculty in the  targeted school reported student inability to use computer technology proficiently in the learning process. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the selection of two major categories of intervention: explicit instruction of components of effective essay writing with guided practice, and explicit instruction of computer literacy skills in a computer lab with guided practice. Post intervention data indicated an increase in students' computer literacy skills, writing skills, and ability to engage in higher order thinking, as well as an increase in students' experiences with diverse educational software.

        "description":"A needs assessment that utilized questionnaires and an interview showed that fifth grade students at the practicum site were not able to use reference materials appropriately. Target groups for the practicum were the fifth grade students and teachers. Constructivist methods were used to increase students' knowledge of using reference materials and their attitudes toward them, as well as to increase the teachers' knowledge of methods available to teach these skills. The project utilized active lessons, incorporating the use of advance organizers and visual aids. At the beginning of the implementation, the target groups were tested to determine their knowledge and opinions in specific areas. This process was repeated for comparison at the end of the implementation. Student  objectives were to: increase knowledge of appropriate use of reference material by 20%; increase use of reference materials by 30%; and demonstrate 20% more positive attitudes toward lessons about appropriate use of reference materials and reference materials themselves. Results indicated that the first two objectives were met; although there was some improvement in attitude, it was not enough to meet the third objective. Teacher objectives were to: increase knowledge of methods available to teach students appropriate use of reference materials by 20%; and increase students' use of reference materials by 20%. All objectives for the teacher target group were met. (Contains 32 references.) (MES)",

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a literature review on educational methodology reforms. The first section discusses five factors in broad-based school reforms: change theory; organizational theory; state/national politics; local politics/governance; and leadership theory. Five types of reforms for school-wide success are described in the second section, including Success for All, Roots and Wings, Core Knowledge, Accelerated Schools, and Modern Red Schoolhouse. The next section addresses educational facilities and issues for community consideration, including school size and teacher-pupil ratios. Barriers affecting implementations of technology are covered in the fourth section, including lack of training, insufficient funding, reluctance of teachers, and unavailability of  software. Advantages of computer-based instruction are summarized in the fifth section. The sixth section covers instructional methodology with technology. It is concluded that many of the ideas for improving teaching and learning are based on the ways that humans have learned throughout history; what is different today is the availability of technologies that make it easier for these ideas to be put into practice on a wide scale. An administrators' guidebook for developing a technology plan is appended, including guidelines for nine planning steps (preplan, organize/set goals, develop a plan, prioritize/establish a timeline, make software/hardware decisions, develop a budget, implement, evaluate, revise), tips for administrators, and an annotated list of World Wide Web sites.

A definition of technological literacy is advanced that provides a framework for the analysis. The literature review takes a needs-based approach to describe the nature of each domain (i.e., participatory democracy, daily life, work, dehumanization) and define what skills/knowledge are essential to technological competence in each. The essential knowledge, skills, and dispositions that enable individuals to confront technology, comprehend essential aspects of it, put  it into an appropriate/functional context, and control it, are discussed. Each domain is analyzed in detail along these four dimensions (i.e., confront, comprehend, contextualize, control) with a set of summary grids that provide an overview. (Contains 50 references.)

Interviews were conducted with teachers, officers of the Exploring Technology Educators Association, vendors and developers of the ETE modules, and a variety of others with an interest in technology education in California. Materials were collected and analyzed, and classroom visits were conducted. The study found that ETE courses motivated students, were complex and difficult for teachers, were expensive for schools, and produced a particular set of learning outcomes that emphasized personal exploration and developing confidence rather than  facilitating technical competence. Various potential outcomes are described, and findings of how well the modular format and technology-centered activities supported these different curricular goals are reported. The paper covers the following major topics: (1) the nature of ETE, including active education, activities and self-efficacy, classroom management, ETE curriculum, accommodating student differences, and social development in ETE courses; (2) content, including basic concepts, specific technical knowledge, current condition information, how-to information, historical context, social ramifications, and personal ramifications; (3) teachers, including teacher background and role; and (4) academic (cross-curricular) integration.

The first section provides an introduction to impression formation. Factors affecting impression formation in FtF and CMC environments are presented in the second section. For FtF environments, these factors include nonverbal cues (e.g., visual, paralinguistic, and psychological) and verbal variables (e.g., language norms, standard discourse schemas, pragmatic/syntactic codes, language intensity/immediacy/diversity, powerful/powerless language styles, gender-related language, verbal influence strategies, and ironic remarks). Models of CMC environments  are described, and verbal and nonverbal cues (e.g., chronemics/temporal aspects, primacy/recency effects, frequency/duration of messaging, and paralinguistic cues) are addressed. The third section presents verbal and nonverbal strategies for developing positive impressions in CMC. Verbal strategies include: following language norms; using standard discourse schemas selectively; using pragmatic and syntactic codes selectively; using intense language; using immediate language; using diverse language; using powerful language style; using appropriate gender-related language; selecting appropriate verbal influence language; and using appropriate ironic remarks. Nonverbal strategies include: using paralinguistic cues appropriately; taking into account chronemics; maintaining a high frequency of  messaging; maintaining a long duration of messaging; manipulating primacy effect; manipulating recency effect; and ensuring no typing errors.

The strategies also explore how the media can create biased points of view and how commercial interests help to determine the form and content of most commercial media messages. They are designed to raise awareness, to explore the extent to which media messages advocate values that are antithetical to ethical standards advocated by schools and responsible parents, and to place in context the need for media education at all levels of learning. The objective of the first activity presented is for  participants to examine the extent to which violent media messages pervade our modern society. In the second activity, the objective is for participants to demystify how violent media messages are manufactured for high action/high violence television and film narratives; stunts and make-up workshops provide participants with experience in creating the illusion of violence and preparing actors for screen roles that require altering their appearance.

        "description":"One of the major issues in the management of academic libraries is the dual nature of staffing: the professional and the paraprofessional. Using the Academic Affairs Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a case study, this project investigates whether professional and paraprofessional staff in large academic libraries experience significantly different levels and sources of job satisfaction. Over 140 library employees were administered a modified version of Paul Spector's Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS), a standard instrument used to measure job satisfaction of employees in non-profit and human services organizations. While both types of staff were basically satisfied with their jobs, there were significant differences in levels of satisfaction in several  areas. Professionals were significantly more satisfied than paraprofessionals in the areas of enjoyment of the work itself, coworkers, appreciation and recognition, promotion, pay, and overall satisfaction. Reasons for these differences are suggested as well as possible means to bridge the gaps between the two groups. The Questionnaire Packet is appended. (Contains 14 references.) (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"Flexible scheduling in school libraries can provide a mechanism for achieving the learning goals and objectives of both the school library program and the curriculum by making information available at the point of need and by promoting use of the library and its services at a relevant moment instead of on a predetermined schedule. This pilot study examined the successful implementation of flexible scheduling in six elementary schools where no funding was received to support implementation. Specifically, the study examined: why flexible scheduling was implemented in elementary schools where funding was not contingent on it; factors that influenced implementation; and stakeholders' basis for their claim of the success of implementation. Telephone interviews with librarians,  principals, and teachers provided the data. The preliminary results indicate that, in those schools with successful implementations, flexible scheduling was only a tool to achieve another internal curricular objective, such as curriculum integration or literacy improvement. In addition, education of stakeholders is essential; it must emphasize strategies for effective use of the programs supported by flexible scheduling and their potential learning outcomes rather than simply provide information on how flexible scheduling works.

The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) developed a detailed plan, with more than 30 specific objectives and more than 75 target audiences, for the implementation of &quot;Information Power.&quot; Clear delineation of responsibilities at  the national, state, district and school levels was a key part of the plan. Marketing research allowed AASL to increase sources of information for planning and to report that information more clearly and consistently, to reduce error and to manage AASL's marketing program more aggressively. Research from the implementation of change and effective staff development was incorporated in the training for state coordinators. Implementation is now underway with documented achievement of the early objectives.

        "description":"The Library Power program is a school improvement initiative of the DeWitt-Wallace Reader's Digest Fund that began in 1988, designed to promote the full integration of the school library media program into the school curriculum in public elementary and junior high/middle schools. With a total investment exceeding $45 million, Library Power is the largest nongovernmental funding for school library media programs in over 30 years. It operated in approximately 700 schools and served more than one million students. Library Power sought to create a national vision of public elementary and middle school library media programs through the instructional leadership of the library media specialist and through partnerships within the district and with the community. This study summarizes  selected findings of a national evaluation of Library Power and discusses implications for preservice and continuing education of teachers, principals, and library media specialists, as well as the likelihood of institutionalization of Library Power practices. The evaluation found that the Library Power initiative advanced the notion of a student-centered library media program in a learning community. It showed that, given the right conditions, school library media programs can promote positive opportunities for excellence in teaching and learning. (Author/MES)",

Research stages dealing with exploring and forming a focus presented the most difficulty for the students. The three students who were able to establish a clear focus were the only ones who demonstrated all aspects of authentic learning. An additional research question dealt with the types of resources used by the students. Books and videocassettes were the primary sources used by students. All students were highly dependent on the teacher as a source of information. The absence of collaboration between the teacher, the school librarian, and public  librarian is noted. Examination of cooperative learning, intervention, required assignment deadlines, and the format of products as each of these relates to independent research projects is recommended.

From data analyzed in the interviews and written documents, the initial findings indicated that third grade and eleventh grade students feel and think about research writing activities similarly. The younger students seemed more process oriented than the older ones. The third grade students commented on enjoying reading the information on their topic and telling the facts they had learned. The older students used methods of citation and more sophisticated paraphrasing techniques. The younger students did not use any  citations. The amount of blatant copying for the Texas study and the Washington study were comparable. The mental models of both age groups were surprisingly similar. (Contains 15 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a four-year study conducted in primary and secondary schools from all sectors in two Australian states, Victoria and New South Wales. The study investigated the impact of inclusive schooling on the provision of library and information services to students with disabilities. Research questions were identified to direct data collection that would demonstrate the success or failure of school library managers to meet the requirements of federal disability legislation. The methodology used in the study incorporated both survey and case study. Empirical data collected by survey concentrated particularly on the current level of service provision to students with disabilities, while case study investigations also looked at management factors. The focus  was on the relationship between the school library staff and the special education staff, and the effect this had on provision of school library services and the acquisition of information skills by students with disabilities. The discussion includes the level of service provision to students with disabilities, as well as the managerial approach of teacher-librarians and their awareness of appropriate resources, teaching approaches, and technology.

        "description":"This paper reports the findings of a comparative case study designed to describe how the implementation of whole language, an educational philosophy influencing many of today's elementary schools, evolved in four school libraries in Virginia. The study examined the impact of whole language in terms of its effect on the library program and the librarian. The study also sought to understand the change agent role each librarian played during implementation of the philosophy. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (1) What changes occurred in the knowledge, perceptions, practices, and beliefs of the librarians? (2) What changes did the librarians make in the library programs as a result of whole language? (3) What roles did the school librarians play during the  implementation of whole language? and (4) How did the librarians feel about the whole language philosophy and its impact on the library program? Data collection techniques included participant observation; interviews with librarians, principals, and teachers; and examination of relevant documents. Findings indicated that the level of success each librarian experienced varied and was dependent on the culture of the school, principal support, the librarian's knowledge and interpersonal skills, the librarian's reaction to district level changes, and time. Recommendations are provided for practicing school librarians and library school educators. (Contains 31 references.) (Author/MES)",

The project goals were to understand the relationship between reading and attitudes to a range of topical social issues; to examine the ways in which children and young adults encounter and choose what to read; to provide information about the reading habits and information use of children and young adults of different age, sex, class, ethnic background, geographical location, and educational sector; and to discern between conventional forms  of reading (printed matter) and new developments in the presentation of and interactions with text (including audio tapes, video games, CD-ROMs). The findings are grouped in the following areas: how young people choose books and comics; think about fiction, out of school (and after-school) activities and reading for information. The intent of the study is to provide academic librarians, publishers, authors illustrators and parents insights into what children and young adults like to read. (MES/EPC)",

The survey instrument requested respondents to describe techniques they used to facilitate information literacy, their perceptions of their functions in the development of independent learners, and the training they received that enabled them to mediate information seeking and use skills. Survey data revealed that the respondents relate information skills instruction to students' interests, work with other teachers to place information seeking skills within the context of students' course work, and encourage students to share ideas and skills with each other as they build their own search strategies. Results indicate that the creation of independent,  self-directed, lifelong learners is the goal of school librarians over the world.

The first study was a comparison of professional development processes and children's learning outcomes in four elementary schools. Surveys used to uncover perceptions of information literacy development were followed by on-site workshops for teachers of 7 to 11 year olds. This provided a snapshot of challenges that are a function of different school cultures and teachers with varying levels of information literacy understanding and commitment, as well as revealing much about children as information problem solvers. The second study involved all teaching staff at a single  elementary school. Again, aspects of the teachers' information literacy were revealed alongside those of children. Observing the students' information problem solving experience was a key element in professional development. Reflection on teaching practice was heightened by use of action research as the teachers' major learning activity. Findings in the following areas are highlighted: (1) school information cultures--frameworks, policies, and library management; (2) teachers' understanding and expectations about information skills; (3) effects of expectations of children as information problem solvers; (4) connecting teachers' and children's thinking and expectations; (5) the teaching and learning interface; and (6) relationships among staff.

This question was explored in a research study involving university researchers from the University of Prince Edward Island (Canada), teachers, and teacher-librarians in six elementary schools across Prince Edward Island. Learning projects arose from collaborations among the pre-service teachers, classroom teachers, and teacher-librarians as they developed information technology (IT) projects that were integrated into the pre-service practicum. Data were collected on the learning strategies children used and on the collaborative relationship established between the pre-service teachers  and the teacher-librarian. This study tracked how pre-service teachers reacted to working with teacher-librarians. Results indicated these projects created authentic environments where pre-service teachers learned the role of the teacher-librarian and how the curriculum development process associated with resource-based learning develops through school library programs.

While not a radical departure from the previous edition, the recent document emphasizes both greater collaboration and leadership and increased involvement with the technologies of information and learning.

It involved the development and administration of a scale to assess pre-service teachers' beliefs about the role of the school library media specialist. The results of the pilot study reported here are preliminary but suggest that, while pre-service teachers distinguish three distinct sets of  functions, they place more emphasis on those functions associated with information access and delivery than on those related to learning and teaching. Furthermore, pre-service teachers do not appear to understand the role areas of learning/teaching and program administration. (Author/MES)",

Principals and librarians in all countries except South Korea differed significantly on the amount of time they perceived the principal to spend on tasks related to the information literacy program. Principals and librarians in Australia, Finland, and Scotland agreed about the amount of time they thought the principal should spend on such tasks in the future. In Canada, Japan, and South Korea, however, there was a significant difference between the two groups. Overall mean scores on present and future perceptions suggest that, in five of the six countries, principals and  librarians are well-aligned in their beliefs about the role of the principal; the exception was Scotland, where school librarians are not qualified teachers. These and other findings should be useful to principals and librarians in schools throughout the world, as they struggle in difficult times to provide quality schooling and information services and to contribute to the development of literate and independent library users.

Because of the uniqueness of these resources, new tools are required that assess not only the content validity and mechanical functionality of a Web site, but also its motivational quality. This paper describes the development and validation of a set of Web evaluation tools, the Website Motivational Analysis Checklist (WebMAC), designed for use by students in grades 1-12, that are based on motivation theory and provide multiple feedback mechanisms. Research questions included: What motivation theory or theories are most appropriate as a basis for the comprehensive evaluation of Web sites? and Do the WebMAC instruments adequately and validly test the motivational quality of Web sites?  A survey of the motivational literature was conducted to investigate the first question. A comprehensive, well-researched theory that could be adapted to the assessment of electronic environments (particularly Web sites) was sought. Formative evaluation methods that included iterative testing of the instruments were implemented with graduate and undergraduate students, educators, and children, while factor analyses were conducted to confirm the theoretical basis of the instrument. These provided evidence for the second question. (Contains 10 references.) (MES)",

Results from the preliminary study indicate that participants' attitudes toward Web-based instruction are positive, and Web-based instruction provides a learning environment in which participants can develop electronic literacy skills and share their ideas and projects.

The research questions addressed the issues of access to the Internet by school librarians, the purposes for which school librarians used e-mail and the World Wide Web, the demand from teachers for access to the Web, the key issues identified by school librarians in relation to the use of the Internet in schools in the next five years, and any differences between the responses of librarians from the two countries. The key findings were that there was limited access to the Internet in the respondents' schools; school librarians used the Web mainly for curricular material; science and geography departments were the heaviest users of the Web; and the key  future issues identified included information skills, cost, inservice training, and the role of the school librarian. There were no significant differences between the two countries studied. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"Based on research conducted in 1996 and 1999, this paper discusses theoretical issues and provides an overview of the purposes for which school libraries are creating and maintaining home pages or World Wide Web sites. In 1996, a content analysis was performed of Web sites of 50 school libraries in the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Singapore, Iceland, Kuwait, New Zealand, and Norway. A longitudinal study was designed in 1999 to examine: whether the Web pages/sites included in the 1996 study have been developed further or improved; the current &quot;state of the art&quot; in terms of school library Web sites; overall improvement in the school library Web pages/sites; differences in aims, purposes, design, organization, and content of school library Web pages/sites between 1996  and 1999; and new ways of organizing links and any evidence of a developing consensus about the best way(s) of organizing links for effective use. The research has implications for those who are planning a Web page/site for their school library/media center; it provides information about what other school libraries/media centers have done and suggests some pitfalls that might be avoided. It also suggests areas for further study, notably the possible development of a model that might be used for the evaluation of school library Web sites. (Contains 42 references.) (MES)",

Researchers examined the data to rank those perceptions, skills, challenges, tasks, and strategies identified by college presidents as most important to their current positions. Results include: (1) communicator was perceived to be the most significant role of a president, followed by innovator and facilitator; (2) presidential challenges named were keeping pace with the increased costs of technology; increasing partnerships  with industry; encouraging the maintenance of high-quality faculty; addressing issues of professional growth and training for administrators, faculty, and staff; obtaining financial resources; encouraging more articulation between high schools and their institutions; and identifying leadership potential from among the faculty and support staff; and (3) institutional vision and revitalization was rated as the most important presidential leadership dimension.

In fall 1994, 1,926 Washington two-year college students (FTE) were enrolled in distance education courses; in 1998, the FTE enrollment rose to 3,011. About 80% of distance learning students also take classes that require attendance at the originating site. But the 20% of distance-learning-only students represent a fast growing &quot;new wave&quot; of college students. These students, taking classes at a distance because of full-time work, family obligations, or  other life circumstances that preclude regular attendance in scheduled classes, will likely increase at a faster rate than other distance learning students. Highlighted statistics in this report include: (1) females make up 65% of distance education students; (2) the typical online student is between 26 and 27 years of age, compared with 23 for other distance learning courses; and (3) it is forecasted that, by fall 2003, Washington two-year colleges will enroll 7,700 distance learning students (FTE).

        "description":"The first section of this two-part document, The Hermeneutic Struggle: A Teaching Method, explores the author's pedagogical explanation of a hermeneutic approach to teaching philosophy. According to the article, the teacher should come to the classroom and be able to approach the subject matter from the perspective of the beginner, yet, at the same time, possess the education and experience of a mature mind. Through a reflective method, the teacher should develop a connection with the student as a learner, and aid the student in clearing away obfuscation so as to have a greater possession of the meaning of the text. Ultimately, the students gain a personal, holistic understanding of the text through interpretation of its parts and vice versa. In Part 2 of this document, \"What Is  Hermeneutics?\", the author cites the work of Wilhelm Dilthey, a Nineteenth-Century European hermeneutic philosopher. Central to Dilthey's theory is that human subjectivity, born out of living and learning in one's own time and place, affects one's ability to interpret events, arts, aesthetics, ethics, and culture. Once students understand that their perceptions will forever be colored by intrinsic sensibilities, they may set out to directly interpret the world. A summary of Dilthey's three parts of hermeneutics--experience, expression, and understanding--are included. (AF)",

        "description":"As assessed in 1989, the prior quarter of a century had seen community colleges emerge from the shadow of elementary and secondary education governance. This document notes several changes in the types of state-level boards and agencies that coordinate or govern public community colleges. Between 1989 and 1996 the only net changes in state-level structures for community colleges were: the abolition of the State Board of Community Colleges in Maryland, and the substitution of the Maryland Higher Education Commission; the replacement of the New Jersey State Board of Higher Education with the Commission of Higher Education; and the listing of the South Dakota Board of Regents as the state-level board responsible for community colleges. The author states that the third edition of his  book on state systems of community colleges will include considerable data regarding trends in governance, finance, educational assessment, accountability, and economic development. To some extent the third edition will contain information comparable to the 1980 national study on community college funding and accountability. The author expects that state-level community college functions in recent years have changed to a far greater degree than would be revealed by merely examining gross changes in state-level structures for community college governance.

        "description":"At the close of the 1996-97 academic year, some 45,000 transfer-oriented students left the Washington community and technical colleges they had been attending. Eleven thousand, three hundred of these students transferred immediately to a four-year institution in Washington or Oregon, with another 2,000 transferring a year later. More than half of the students did not transfer but either stayed in the job held during college or gained employment after college. The employment status of these non-transferring students is described in this report. All of the former students described here reported that their purpose for attending was to prepare for transfer, but they also encompass people who plan to work for several years before actually transferring. Given the diversity of purposes  masked in the simple transfer declaration, knowing about how the college experience impacts the quality of employment of these former transfer-oriented students is important. Some key findings are: quality employment is a key outcome for those enrolled with a declared transfer purpose; the more education gained at community and technical colleges, the greater the economic outcomes for these non-transferring students; and non-transferring students had substantial labor force attachment before and during college as well as after college.

        "description":"The purpose of this research effort was to introduce the use of simulations in adult learning situations to enhance communication skills in a creative, effective, and enjoyable manner. Adult educators in academic settings or in business and industry training can use simulations not only to teach a concept but also to improve communication skills at the same time. This paper presents a communications experiment that is a teaching tool, and can be used to make learning communications skills more enjoyable for the participants and thus more effective. If simulations can be used to teach communications skills, they can provide an additional tool for teaching students skills that can enhance their employment possibilities by making them aware of their own speaking and listening  skills. The author finds that simulation was an effective tool for participants of this study. It provided a means for students to get to know each other and work together in an interactive environment as well as to identify their personal communications skills and skills that need improvement. This study further indicated that the effectiveness of simulations could be enhanced by tailoring them for specific courses and groups of students. Appended in this report are debriefing topics for discussion, a participant survey, and instructor questions. (Contains 34 references.) (VWC)",

According to the article, a student can develop higher levels of cognitive reasoning through curricular activities that include problem solving, analytic thinking, and synthesizing exercises. In problem solving, students first identify and define a problem, then select information from a variety of sources to support their theory for solving the problem. Analytic thinking exercises help the student learn to separate fact from opinion, and consider ideas like propaganda and censorship. Synthesizing the subject matter involves combining the accurate or useful information and omitting unnecessary parts. Once this is done, students can practice communicating critically by writing an opinion paper or  making a persuasive presentation to the class. The author includes a section on incorporating the following philosophies into the curriculum: experimentalism, idealism, behaviorism, and existentialism. The article concludes with samples of classroom activities using alternative modes of thought such as inferences and cause-and-effect reasoning to enhance critical thinking skills. (AF)",

Class scheduling issues were emphasized in the survey. Less than one-fourth of credit students reported they had problems getting the classes they wanted in the spring semester. This was a small decrease from the previous year. The most common problem students cited was full classes. Parking problems were also addressed. Most students perceive parking to be about the same as it was when they first enrolled at the college. Students cited mornings as the most difficult time to park on campus. Approximately 33% of respondents said they would park in an off-campus parking lot and ride a free shuttle to the college; 25% said &quot;maybe&quot;; and 42% said  they would not park in an off-campus lot. Other questions focused on student access to technology. Student computer access outside of the college continued to increase dramatically. About 75% of credit students reported access to a computer at home. Nearly 62% reported they had Internet access either at home or at work. The number of students with home Internet access has increased from 25% in 1996 to 55% in 1999. The methodology for administering this student survey is appended in the report. (VWC)",

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Hope Scale scores would play a significant role in predicting the effectiveness of a five-session career planning workshop for 61 adults. The results of three hierarchical regressions suggest that the trait hope does not play a significant role in predicting participants' career decidedness, career decision-making self-efficacy, or vocational identity after completing the workshop. Second, this study's purpose was also to investigate the effectiveness of this five-session career planning workshop for adults. Repeated measures, single sample t-tests were performed. Significant change scores were found on four of the five repeated measures including pre- to post-treatment scores on career decidedness, vocational  identity, career decision-making self efficacy, and state hope. Only work hope scores did not change significantly from pre- to post-treatment. Results suggest that while the participants in this workshop changed significantly from pre- to post-workshop, trait hope did not play a significant role in the participants' outcome.

        "description":"Based on population growth in Planning District 8, Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) enrollment for the years 2000 and 2010 were estimated using two models--population-penetration and age-cohort--to estimate enrollments. According to the population-penetration model, it is estimated that during the fall 2000 semester there will be 38,557 students enrolled at NVCC. By fall 2010, there will be 43,680 students enrolled at NVCC. According to the age-cohort model, it is estimated that by 2000, NVCC fall headcount will be 38,432 students, and by fall 2010, there will be 44,970 students enrolled at NVCC. These two models together indicate an annual (fall to fall) growth rate between 1.3% and 1.7% during this period. In addition to population-based projections, estimates for  Planning District 8 public high school graduates were computed. Given that during the last 20 years enrollment of non-white students at NVCC has steadily increased, it is highly probable that non-white students will be the majority at NVCC before the year 2005. The estimates in this report are college-wide and do not provide projections for separate campuses. A fundamental assumption inherent in this study is that there will be no major changes in the area economy and the local labor market. (Contains 25 tables and 11 figures.) (VWC)",

        "description":"The Office of Institutional Research (OIR) tracked all students who first enrolled at Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) in the fall of 1994 for three years to learn the proportion and characteristics of those who were retained each semester. Retention rates were compared across different racial groups to answer the question of whether there were significant variations in retention rates across different racial groups, and what effect this may have on the retention rates at NVCC as an institution. To study retention patterns, OIR looked at the data for two major groups of students: all first-time students in the fall 1994 semester, and first-time students who were only enrolled full-time in the fall 1994 semester. OIR also examined both cohorts to see whether enrollment  or non-enrollment in developmental or ESL courses during fall 1994 or spring 1995 had any relation to retention patterns. During their first year at NVCC, first-time students who enrolled in developmental courses had a higher retention rate than first-time students who did not take these courses. Overall, for the fall 1994 cohort of first-time students, the group with the highest retention rate was Asian students, followed by Hispanic students. Black and White students had the lowest retention rates. For full-time students, the retention rates were higher, but the same racial patterns were evident. (Contains 12 figures and 6 tables.)

The first major section of the report is concerned with the evidence of need for educational opportunity beyond Grade 12 in the Lethbridge area. It considers the role of the city and area as a commercial and industrial center in southern Alberta, trends in population growth, facts concerning enrollments of youth in school, and existing opportunities for higher education already present in the Province. There follows a section that describes the community college movement, potential advantages that a community college would bring to the area, and legal  status of junior colleges in Alberta. The community college plan proposed for the city and the area of Lethbridge is described in detail in the third section. Physical, personal, and financial resources which can be drawn upon to maintain and support the program are discussed in the fourth section, and in the final portion, some recommendations are presented for implementing the projected community college plan with particular reference to the potential roles of the Provincial Department of Education, the University of Alberta, and local authorities in accomplishing the development.

The project is focused on students from the disciplines of nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, social work, early childhood education, early childhood special education, and speech/language pathology. It is structured around three key elements: first, the involvement of families in all aspects of the training program; second, a curricular focus on family and professional partnerships; and third, practical experiences designed to teach optimal interdisciplinary team functioning.  The project organizes the student's learning into four primary learning environments in each of which the student spends about 2 hours a week: (1) family mentorship (each student is matched with a family of a young child with special needs); (2) community placement (each student is matched with a community service provider); (3) the interdisciplinary team (each student works with other project trainees); and (4) seminar (a weekly meeting to provide early intervention knowledge and an environment to process learning activities). The training guide provides a section on each of the four learning environments as well as a section on trainee supervision. (Contains approximately 180 references.) (DB)",

The intention of the projects was to find ways to identify children at risk of suffering emotional disorders and to intervene early enough to prevent these disorders. The first program described, the Interpersonal Cognitive Problem Solving Project, trained 407 second and third grade children, 84 of whom were identified at-risk, in social problem solving skills. Results found that the children who were at-risk demonstrated improvement in problem solving skills. In the second program, the Temperament Project, results found a reduction in the problem behavior of the children of the approximately 100  parents that received temperament services. The third project, the Jackson County Early Intervention Mental Health Project, offered special friends for children who are at-risk, socialization groups, and parent training. Preliminary findings indicated positive and significant changes in socialization. The last project, the Family Service Project, offered parent education and support groups with concurrent and follow-up home visits. Anecdotal evidence from participating parents and agency staff suggested that the project was having a positive effect. (References accompany each section.) (CR)",

The intervention was delivered by Family Associates, parents without mental health training who acted as a system guide to low-income families whose children had been referred to mental health services through the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. The family associate provided emotional support, information about mental health services and community resources, and direct assistance such as help with  transportation and child care. A comparison of 96 families from intervention counties and 143 families from comparison counties indicated that families in the intervention group were significantly more likely to initiate children's mental health services than were those in the comparison group, that they reported higher levels of empowerment, and greater positive change in family well-being during the time they worked with the Family Associate.

The survey evaluated whether the school districts offered the following programs: enrichment in the regular classrooms, part-time special classes, full-time special classes, independent study, itinerant teacher, mentorships, resource rooms, special schools, early entrance, continuous progress, nongraded schools, moderate acceleration, radical acceleration, advanced placement, fast-paced courses, or concurrent or dual enrollment. Results found that Iowa school districts are using the following flexible programming techniques: early entrance (20.5 percent), advanced placement (40.9 percent), concurrent enrollment (55 percent), fast-paced courses (12.9  percent), continuous progress (27.5 percent), moderate acceleration (46.2 percent), and radical acceleration (17.5 percent). Except for enrichment in the regular classroom, part-time special classes, concurrent or dual enrollment, and independent study, findings indicated that not even half of the Iowa school districts are providing adequate programs for their gifted students. This 1997 study is compared to a 1990 study by the same person. Several recommendations are made for enhancing gifted programming and include: (1) providing flexible programs; (2) consolidating school districts to enable schools to provide gifted educational programs; (3) setting special requirements for teachers in gifted programs; and (4) providing and funding inservice programs for teachers in gifted programs.

Project Risk attempted to facilitate the transition of developmental and family coordination services from tertiary AIDS centers to community early intervention services. There were three components to the RISK model: (1) direct service to assess developmental status, risk, and needs for children and families and to provide support and intervention in the community for children referred to tertiary  care hospitals for \"exposed not infected\" status; (2) to develop a model for providing linkage to community service agencies appropriate for child and family needs; and (3) to provide education in pediatric HIV risk and infection and associated developmental and family needs to community service agencies.

        "description":"This final report discusses the outcomes of a 3-year project that studied the effectiveness of word processing tools in improving the literacy skills of students with learning disabilities in grades 4-12. In Year 1 (1994-95), four text entry strategies were compared in 132 students with learning disabilities: keyboarding instruction, alternative keyboards, word prediction, and word prediction with speech synthesizers. The Year 2 study (1995-96), investigated the effects of two types of text editing tools, such as spelling and grammar aids with and without speech synthesis, in 106 students with learning disabilities. The Year 3 study (1996-97), investigated speech synthesis under three conditions in 103 students with learning disabilities: when available at all times versus when  available only during the text entry or the editing/revising stages of writing. Results of the studies found: (1) that word processing had the most impact upon the accuracy of students' writing; (2) word prediction was the most promising strategy for improving the text entry speed; (3) spell checks were effective editing tools, although grammar checkers were not, and spell checks had a more positive effect on students' writing quality and accuracy than synthesized speech.

The project had the following objectives: (1) to identify and promote contingent responses to infant behaviors which in turn motivate infant learning and exploration; (2) to identify compensatory interaction strategies which take into account the infants' degree of vision and hearing impairments and other disabilities; (3) to develop, implement, and evaluate \"contingency games\" as a means of promoting caregiver-infant interaction within the natural context of everyday  routines; and (4) to support and develop caregiver satisfaction and feelings of competence in the role of caring for an infant who is deaf-blind. Participants in the project identified an increase in the amount and the quality of communicative interactions between themselves and their infants as well as an increased sense of efficacy in observing and responding to their children's needs. Quantitative evidence suggests meaningful changes in caregivers' behaviors consistent with the project objectives and activities. (CR)",

This publication examines the problem of providing for non-advanced further education (NAFE) in the context of the expansion of an existing college. It considers the uncertainties of further educational requirements which, coupled with the constraints on building programs, indicate a pattern of growth in three discrete phases. Further, it provides details on the kinds of courses to be expected at the college and the accommodation which will be required. Finally, alternative approaches to the development plan are discussed and  illustrated in relation to this overall strategy. Appendices include descriptions of two college non-advanced further education expansions; and calculation tables for teaching and non-teaching area capacities in existing buildings, and area allocations for 800 full-time equivalent students at the end of a phase 1 expansion.

Subjects were 242 young adult students enrolled in a university English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program. Results suggest that the students improved significantly after formal instruction, and that grammatical  knowledge is a significant predictor of the students' readiness for the next course level. In addition, grammatical knowledge seems to be a significant component in mastering the four language skills, and students at the beginning level of overall language proficiency gain more on the overall test score than do students at the intermediate or advanced level. However, the grammar competence level and interaction between the overall language proficiency level and grammar competence level could not explain the gain in overall test score. (Author/MSE)",

Using a qualitative approach, the study investigated emergent literacy in the classroom, home, and church contexts. The unit of analysis was the literacy event, any occasion in which a piece of writing is integral to the nature of participants' interaction with print and with other people who play the role of teacher. Networks of support available to the individuals and families were identified and described, and the nature of the teachers' roles and interactions were analyzed. It was found that in the classroom, the children participated in literacy events in both English and Spanish that combined phonics  and meaning-making. It was in the classroom that the children had the most significant experience of reading for pleasure. At home, literacy was a necessary, highly valued, and highly significant skill used for instrumental, communicative, and religious purposes but not for pleasure. Parents tended to teach the children in didactic exchanges focusing on homework or religious texts. In religious settings as in homes, literacy was used for decoding, understanding, inherent meaning, memorizing, and reciting jointly. (Contains 24 references) (MSE)",

Subjects were 40 male and 40 female students randomly selected from two Korean high schools in 1995. Results indicated that the students' language use was restricted to instrumental purposes, that their orientation was intrinsic and extrinsic as well as instrumental and integrative, that instrumental orientation appeared relatively homogeneous while extrinsic motivation was distributed among several sub-scales, and that extrinsic/intrinsic orientations and motivations were mostly involved  with developmental changes, which interacted with attributed and classroom factors. In addition, females reported more positive views about the target language, culture, or community than did males. Excerpts from student comments are used to illustrate the findings.

        "description":"The role of grammar instruction in proficiency-oriented second language instruction (POI) is examined, drawing on research and theory on second language use and instruction. Several premises are stated: (1) formal grammar has an important role in POI, while focus on form and communicative practice should be maintained; (2) in POI, a syllabus that is cyclical in nature is recommended; (3) since POI does not prescribe any specific methodology, second language teachers need to discover for themselves which approach to grammar instruction is most effective; and (4) additional research comparing the traditional approach with the whole-language and input-processing approaches is needed.

A comparison and contrasting exercise using two variations of a folk tale is described. An activity focusing on techniques for supporting and evaluating ideas is intended for use after students have read a number of unrelated folk tales. An exercise in evaluating and summarizing ideas uses a single tale. In each case, preparatory activities for the teacher, detailed in-class procedures, and suggested variations  for more advanced students are described.

Ideas for questions were drawn from real job interviews at large companies in Hong Kong, job advertisements, and application letters. Ten questions were identified for use in the interview package, and six dialogues were written so students can select from a variety of interview contexts. After going through an interview, students can click on different exchanges to examine what has taken place, evaluate the answers given, read  comments, and participate in a cloze exercise. Student feedback on the interviews is invited. Experience suggests that students have found the package useful for building interview skills, oral skills, and confidence.

A five-minute segment was taken from a 30-minute conversation between three female native Japanese-speakers, all familiar with the Osaka dialect. The conversation was analyzed for use of the Osaka dialect (Osaka-ben), although the conversation was generally in the more standard \"hyojungo.\" Contexts in which the dialect was used and impressions or implications created by its use are examined. It is concluded that Osaka-ben was used by the speakers when showing concern for each other, making corrections, and adding a sudden thought. In each case, the reasons for shifting to the  dialect was the same as that for shifting from formal to informal usage, as explained by three theories. (Contains 8 references.) (MSE)",

Semi-structured interviews were then conducted with four NNS University of Melbourne students of macroeconomics, three macroeconomics instructors, and three ESL teachers. It was found that interviewees sometimes expressed similar ideas about what is needed for successful academic writing, but also found differing perceptions both across the three groups and within them,  especially concerning grammatical proficiency and the importance of language.

        "description":"This study examined curricular reform processes at two Swedish institutes of technology through a gender perspective, relating them to two social theories the reproduction theory of Bourdieu and Passeron and the gender contract theory of Yvonne Hirdman. The aim of the reform process was to make educational programs in computer engineering more attractive to female students. Data were gathered by interviewing academic staff involved in the reform process at Linkoping Institute of Technology and Chalmers University of Technology and through observations of planning meetings. The results point out several obstacles to gender-related reforms, including stereotypical conceptions of women and lack of knowledge on gender issues among the reformers, the particular position and  responsibilities given to female reformers, the importance of maintaining the status of a single program, the heritage of engineering education as a whole, and the need for other reforms (e.g., pedagogical reforms) which are perceived of as relatively easy to accomplish, whereas gender reform is both more profound and more difficult. It was also found that even if the reformed programs managed to increase recruitment of female students, their curricula were not perceived by faculty to be especially female-friendly. Seven appendixes provide information on the study methodology. (Contains 165 references.) (MDM)",

MHEC offers its members various cost-saving services, provides a forum for sharing information on higher education issues, and offers savings to some out-of-state students through a student exchange program. Focusing on Illinois' role within the commission, the report notes that Illinois colleges and universities have used MHEC cost-saving programs such as regional self-insurance risk management and the natural gas and utilities initiative very sparingly. The report notes that while one of the most popular MHEC programs has been the interactive video program, most purchases made through MHEC were made in the early years of the program. The report  concludes that while Illinois state colleges and universities probably will not benefit substantially from most MHEC initiatives due to the economies of scale already present in the state system, some small or private institutions might find it advantageous to make purchases through MHEC. It also notes that one of the main benefits of MHEC membership is its role in organizing regional meetings to consider the problems facing higher education. Two appendixes outline the 1998-1999 MHEC budget and provide a list of Illinois members. (MDM)",

The five statements rated the highest included developing positive relationships with students; providing information concerning academic policies, procedures, requirements, and programs; providing appropriate information on personal safety and security; promoting awareness of non-FGU opportunities for involvement; and understanding the purposes of the university. The two statements rated the lowest included providing information about opportunities for  self-assessment and determining one's purpose in working with the FGU. Moderate agreement levels on many of the standards seemed to indicate that although FGU leaders supported the idea of an orientation for new FGU members, a less substantive program or one with other standards and criteria might suffice.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of court challenges to affirmative action policies on the admission of black and Hispanic students to selective science and engineering (S&E) graduate programs. Data were gathered from a sample of 76 major research universities in regard to the application, admission, and enrollment of U.S. citizens and permanent residents by race and by ethnicity for the years 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, as well as policies related to the award of financial aid to students. Case studies were conducted at 10 institutions in states that had faced legal challenges to affirmative action. It was found that while the number of bachelor's degrees awarded to black and Hispanic students in S&E programs increased significantly between 1989 and 1995, there was a precipitous  one-year drop of over 20 percent in first-year graduate S&E enrollment for black students between 1996 and 1997, and a 16.7 percent drop in enrollment for Hispanic students. Three appendixes contain a copy of the survey instrument, interview protocols, and a list of participating institutions. (Contains 16 references.) (MDM)",

In-depth ethnographic interviews were conducted with students, faculty, administrators, state officials, lobbyists, professional association leaders, and state legislators. Overall, the interviews demonstrated that because corporate America is putting more and more pressure on institutions to focus on applied research and to produce a workforce that will manage its firms, operate its factories, and design its plants, universities are perceived to have lost, or are in danger of losing, their connections  to the kind of research that benefits society. The report concluded that universities must change the ways they communicate their mission and must accept the moral and ethical dimensions of leadership, and must also increase their competitiveness with other forms of education and training.

Dave Ambler of the University of Kansas notes that the traditional leadership style, which he refers to as the \"plastic president,\" produces leaders who become combinations of all-knowing entities and salespersons, and who define for the institution and its personnel the objectives and priorities to be followed. Don Adams of Drake university believes that many current leaders in higher education are faced with a leadership challenge, directing institutions with old ideas, with little vision and planning beyond the next academic year, without an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their institutions, and  without creating opportunities for institutional growth. Joan Claar of Cornell College maintains that there is a crisis in higher education leadership, and that some leaders do not possess the skills needed to cope with rising institutional debt, rising tuition, degree devaluation, and the deteriorating image of higher education.

        "description":"This paper presents a case study of distance education at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Toowoomba, Australia. Begun in 1977, distance education at USQ moved from the correspondence model to the multimedia model, to the telelearning model, and finally to the current flexible learning model characterized by on-line delivery via the World Wide Web. It is noted that as universities move to this fourth model of on-line delivery of distance education, institutions will have opportunities to develop more flexible policies and procedures in regard to student selection, student enrollment and progression, and the teaching and learning processes. The paper then examines current USQ practices, the challenges presented by the on-line environment, and possible solutions in  regard to student entry requirements, student enrollment periods, student progression, the nature of study materials, and approaches to student assessment. It is concluded that if flexibility and students' control over their own learning are taken seriously, institutions must devote as many resources to the review and development of academic management strategies, including student support systems and professional development of faculty, as they focus on the development of delivery technologies.

Morden (1995) notes that what works well in one country may be entirely inappropriate in another. Obaldeston (1993) explains that business schools must employ teaching faculty with international experience, enroll a high proportion of students from other nations, and use teaching materials based on international business. Finegold (1994) points out that in response to increasing questions about the usefulness of the MBA degree, U.S. institutions are re-engineering programs to integrate contemporary topics such as information technology and internationalization into the curriculum. Other authors provide specific criticisms of graduate business programs in the United States, noting  that MBA programs focus on technical skills to the exclusion of communication and cross-cultural skills; do not teach leadership, creativity, and entrepreneurship; ignore the importance of group dynamics; lack integration and global perspective; demonstrate little innovation in instructional delivery; and have faculty with little or no real business experience. It is concluded that cooperative efforts between business schools, corporations, and outside agencies would improve graduate-level management education. (Contains 15 references.) (MDM)",

Following a review of the literature, the report presents the results of responses by a panel of 36 international business experts from Canada, Mexico, and the United States to a three-round Delphi questionnaire that attempted to identify the key executive skills required for success. It was found that the skills most highly rated by Canadian participants were decision-making, team building, strategic vision, global view, ethics, and intercultural effectiveness. U.S. participants ranked working with people and information/communication as the most highly rated skills, while Mexican participants ranked as the  most highly rated skills decision-making, team building, working with people, initiative and persistence, strategic vision, global view, ethics, information/communication skills, and intercultural effectiveness. Overall, the most highly rated skills were decision-making, team building, working with people, strategic vision, global view, ethics, information and communication, and intercultural effectiveness. In addition, the following skill acquisition methods were ranked by the participants in descending order of importance: lecture courses, internships, study in other nations, language study, videoconferencing, Internet courses, and correspondence courses.

        "description":"This study examined the robustness of the &quot;U.S. News and World Report&quot; graduation rate performance indicator used in the magazine's college rankings. The graduation rate performance indicator is calculated as the difference between an institution's actual graduation rate and its predicted graduation rate, and is based on a linear regression equation controlling for student aptitude and institutional expenditures. Data were obtained for 198 of the 218 national universities used in the magazine's 1999 rankings. It was found that changes in the sample and variable definitions could cause the predicted graduation rate for an institution to fluctuate by plus or minus two percentage points. More refined model specifications reduced the number of institutions with extreme performance  differences and could actually change the ranking of an institution from under-performance to over-performance, or vice versa. The use of confidence intervals for predicted graduation rates revealed that only about 5 percent of the institutions in the study had predicted graduation rates that differed significantly from their actual graduation rates.

Verbal protocols revealed that mammography interpretation predominantly used data-driven or mixed-strategies but depended on case typicality and clinical experience. Radiologists scanned the cases significantly faster than residents, but no group differences were found in the number of findings, observations, and diagnoses. The groups (1) used the same types of operators, control processes, and diagnostic plans; (2) committed the  same number of errors; and (3) both groups committed case-dependent errors. Overall, the results indicated that mammogram interpretation is a well-constrained visual cognitive task. Results were applied to the design of a computer-based tutor for mammogram interpretation.

The orientation focuses on five factors which determine the value of an educational program: (1) the teacher (abilities, empathy, and support); (2) texts, learning materials, and teaching techniques (appropriateness and applications); (3) feeling welcome in the learning environment; (4) self-achievement assessments; and (5) relative challenge of the course. Following an introduction and the syllabus, the first four chapters address the following topics: the USAWC mission; the resource-rich environment of the USAWC;  learner-centered, inquiry-driven graduate study; and teacher and student experience and knowledge negotiating and positioning. Chapter 5 is a reprint of &quot;Collaborative Learning: Higher Education, Interdependence, and the Authority of Knowledge&quot; by Kenneth A. Bruffee. Chapter 6 is comprised of two reprints: &quot;Learning Styles &amp; Teaching Strategies&quot; (Jeff King) and &quot;A User's Guide to the Case Study Method of Teaching&quot; (James F. Holcomb). Chapter 7 briefly describes a workshop conducted by Carol Barton on critical thinking, writing, and graduate study.

Major findings include: (1) between 1992-98 and 1994-96, the percentage of undergraduate students attending four-year institutions who borrowed from federal loan programs during the academic year increased by about 11 percent at public institutions and by 10 percent at private, not-for-profit institutions; (2) the average annual amount borrowed in each year also increased from $3,000 to $4,100 at public four-year institutions and from $3,600 to $4,500 at private, not-for-profit four-year institutions; (3) the percentage of dependent undergraduates with family incomes of $50,000 or more who had ever borrowed from federal loan programs  increased between 1992-93 and 1995-96 at both public and private not-for-profit institutions; (4) in both years, differences in attendance costs between public and private institutions were reflected in the higher amounts borrowed by undergraduates attending private institutions. A table and a graph show the percentage of undergraduates who borrowed, and the average amount and average cumulative amount borrowed by type of institution and class level for the 2 years, and the percentage of dependent undergraduates who ever borrowed from federal loan programs, by family income, for public and private institutions.

The first chapter, titled &quot;Missing Links: The Relationship between National Policies for Internationalisation and Those for Higher Education in General,&quot; and the  penultimate chapter, &quot;International Comparative Analysis and Synthesis&quot;, both by Marijk van der Wende, identify trends and compare the national policies reviewed. The intervening nine chapters review the policies of the following nations or areas: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. The final chapter summarizes the main findings of this study, noting the growing importance of economic motives for internationalization policies, the diminishing conceptual disconnection between internationalization policies and general higher education policy, and the enhanced influence of institutional and market forces.

The report notes such positive trends as the more than 325,000 students who are pursuing degree programs and the nearly 50,000 students who graduate each year from the state's public and independent colleges, universities, and private career schools, and the fact that students are reporting higher levels of satisfaction with their collegiate experience than they did three years ago. The report also identifies challenges, finding that financial access to a public higher education has become increasingly difficult, with nearly 19 percent of Missouri's youth financially at risk of not being able to continue their education after high school. The bulk of the  report uses text, graphs, and charts to examine achievements and challenges concerning strategic initiatives in the following five areas: (1) institutional mission review and enhancement; (2) coordination of all student financial assistance programs and services in one division; (3) telecommunications-based delivery system; (4) postsecondary technical education; and (5) funding for results. Appendices provide additional information about academic affairs, higher education funding, higher education legislation, higher education statistics, planning and policy development, and the proprietary school certification program.

It concludes that research has provided a clear picture of who is involved in the chair position but has not clarified ways to improve the effectiveness of the position. The review is organized into two sections. The first, on the historical development of the chair position, focuses on the time period during which the chair position was first formalized (1880s to 1925) and the impact played by business, industry, and politics on the formation of the administrative position. The second, on contemporary research on the chair position, examines the various roles and responsibilities, needed skills, and challenges and coping  strategies facing the chairperson. Lack of chairperson training is identified as a critical issue. (Contains 19 references.) (DB)",

The colleges reviewed were in six states: California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The study found that (1) planning was not inclusive, since faculty and students were underrepresented; (2) few institutions had both long- and short-term budget plans; (3) most campuses relied primarily on selective cuts, although a strong minority allocated cuts across the board; (4) criteria for cuts reflected ease and availability rather than quality or priority; (5) expenditure reductions exceeded revenue increases on most campuses, but tuition and fee increases restricted access in  several states; (6) although most institutions favored short-term personnel strategies, a strong minority included layoffs and retrenchments; (7) most campuses acted to raise productivity and performance in administration and management but avoided academic areas; (8) most campuses did not eliminate academic programs to improve quality and efficiency; (9) most campuses limited restructuring of offices and activities to administrative functions; (10) few campuses refocused their missions based on institutional strengths and student demands; and (11) most campuses did protect quality and access in undergraduate education, but a large minority conceded that both had declined.

        "description":"This study identifies the institutions of higher education which are the most productive in the number of degrees in mathematics, engineering, and science (MSE) awarded to minority students (African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics). Using 1992-93 data, the study focused on the 17 states (and Puerto Rico) in which minority students represent at least 25 percent of high school graduates. These were: Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. An introduction lists the leading university producers of minority MSE baccalaureate degree recipients for each state and summarizes responses to a questionnaire which surveyed institutions  concerning minority student recruitment, retention strategies, financial support, faculty role, and outreach activities. A chart rates states according to whether they achieve their &quot;fair share&quot; of minority MSE degree recipients. The main body of the report presents data on the top 10 institutions in each of the 17 states, including general data for the state as a whole as well as specific information on MSE minority-focused activities for each institution. A summary chapter notes types of programs and services frequently offered by these institutions and offers recommendations. The questionnaire is appended. (DB)",

The report reviews the planning history of the proposed campus, discusses the University of California's systemwide physical capacity to enroll new students, and considers a number of review criteria, including potential enrollments, alternatives to building the campus, academic planning, possible conflicts with other institutions in the region, and potential construction and operating costs. Based on this analysis, the report concludes that the University of California at Merced should become a reality and recommends to the Governor and the  Legislature that the campus be approved. It also urges that the university be innovative in its academic planning and provide a clearer indication of potential construction costs. Section 1 summarizes the Commission's conclusions and recommendations and Section 2 provides background to the proposal. Section 3 offers an overview of the major issues and Section 4 reviews the Commission's criteria. Appendices include the review guidelines and two letters. (Contains 32 references.) (DB)",

It notes that although total operating grants increased by 4.2 percent in 1998-99, these additional funds were generally restricted to specific new initiatives. The two most notable of these were approximately $35 million for an Access to Opportunities Program designed to increase enrollment in high-demand computing and engineering programs, and $10 million for a Fair Funding Grant to address an historic funding inequity. The report also notes that Ontario universities are  now entering a decade in which substantial growth in enrollment demand is expected. Following a section of highlights, the report presents tables and graphs detailing financial information in the following areas: (1) grants and revenue Ontario; (2) grants and revenue inter-jurisdictional comparisons; (3) comparisons with other sectors; (4) research support; (5) tuition fees; (6) student financial assistance; (7) university infrastructure; (8) faculty and staff; and (9) education and the job market.

        "description":"Members of the Department of Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Melbourne, Australia have developed a range of multimedia resources for undergraduate education students that allow the students to participate in authentic tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to arrange for large numbers of students. The multimedia resources are designed to project students into their future role as classroom teachers as it has been observed that those students who do this tend to perform better as they can see the relevance of learning opportunities presented in their studies. Observation of student work using these resources shows deeper thinking and enhanced reflective practices in considering how children think and how classrooms can be managed. The first  section of this paper describes three recently developed multimedia resources: &quot;Computers and the K-6 Classroom: Kids Can Do!,&quot;&quot;Teaching and Learning about Decimals,&quot; and &quot;Teaching and Learning about Whole Numbers.&quot; Modes of interactivity are discussed in the second section, including analyzing classroom interactions and classroom management, as well as the advantages of multimedia for making children's thinking an object of study.

The instructors, with a history of personal collaboration both in person and online, designed an activity to provide their graduate students with the opportunity to participate in organized collaborative activities directly related to content in their courses. A year later, they again included a joint collaborative activity as part of their courses.

        "description":"During the summer of 1998, Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) invented a new way to earn an Educational Technology Master's degree. Founded in 1997 as a university dedicated to utilizing new technologies for both local and distance learning, FGCU's School of Education has enabled learners from across the state to complete a degree program in just 13 months, in large part from their own homes. Utilizing a new model combining traditional World Wide Web-based distance learning with two conference-style in-residence sessions, students gain the benefits of both distance and face-to-face teaching techniques. The two conferences are known as &quot;Tech-Ins&quot; and last three weeks each. This paper discusses the development of the program, the first Tech-In, and reports on the status of the  students in the cohort near the conclusion of the fall 1998 semester. (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"Valley City State University (North Dakota) was the second university in the nation to adopt a notebook computer environment, supplying every faculty, staff member, administrator, and student with a laptop computer and 24-hour access to the World Wide Web. This paper outlines the innovations made in the music department to accommodate the infusion of technology over a period of several years. The first section describes the university decisions, grants received, and implications of both in terms of faculty training and the integration of technology into the curriculum. The second section outlines the CD-ROM electronic portfolio Title III grant and its effect on student assessment in the classrooms across campus. The music department developed several projects utilizing technology  and the CD-ROM assessment project to participate in the innovations campus-wide, focusing on the following abilities and skills: (1) communication/aesthetic responsiveness (writing, math, speaking, listening); (2) problem solving (creative thinking, reasoning, decision-making); (3) effective citizenship/global perspective (teaching others, exhibiting leadership, working with diversity); (4) collaboration/wellness (responsibility, sociability, self-management); and (5) technology (selects/applies technology, acquires/organizes information). Electronic portfolio assessments and technology in music theory composition, music history, piano classes/applied lessons, and music methods projects are summarized in the third section. The final section describes future needs and concerns.  (Author/AEF)",

A teacher's guidance, constructive feedback, and facilitated instruction should pave the way for students to meaningfully bridge prior knowledge with new knowledge. This paper suggests how teachers might teach creatively, particularly with respect to computing curricula, while they enjoy the teaching and learning processes. The following topics are covered: (1) teachers as prophets of creativity; (2) learning domains for educating the mind, including cognitive strategy, psychomotor skills, verbal information, intellectual skills, and attitudes; (3) sparking enthusiasm and interest;  (4) the fun of perceiving the &quot;power of 2,&quot; i.e., multiplying by two; (5) divergent imagery, including mindmapping tools and brainstorming techniques; (6) computers as cognitive tools, including learning critically and creatively; (7) education and technology, including encouraging students to explore computer concepts and to think critically and creatively; and (8) the rewards of creative behavior and risk taking.

The program material was designed to support middle school educators with an effective, accessible, and novel didactic tool produced specifically to enhance and encourage the learning of chemistry. The study introduced the Periodic Table of the Elements, utilizing materials developed for middle school students in two distinct formats: printed material in English or Spanish, and an animated video with English or Spanish language narration. Participants were 320 students in middle schools in Mexico and Texas. A questionnaire was administered to assess learning. The results compare the difference  between the students' ability to recall and comprehend complex subjects as presented by linear multimedia as opposed to printed text. The study additionally offered an opportunity to observe the advantage of applying a narrative format to procedural text. It is concluded that, in both countries, students appeared to be more attentive to the animated material. (AEF)",

The first lists of competencies from these efforts are just now being completed. While some of these competencies are linked to teacher certification and re-certification, others are developed as standards or benchmarks to guide professional development. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare initial attempts at establishing teacher technology competencies with the intent of establishing a framework or matrix that could be used to compare other, similar documents. Teacher technology competencies from a variety of organizations and institutions were studied and compared. A master matrix of technology competencies  was created, consisting of the following categories: (1) prerequisite technical skills--basic operations, hardware issues, navigation, and file management; (2) instructional uses--instructional strategies and resources; (3) professional roles--ethical/legal issues, professional resources, and professional development; and (4) technical skills--troubleshooting/maintenance, productivity tools, Internet applications, and networking. Based on findings, generalizations were drawn and recommendations made for improving future technology competencies. Also included is a discussion of the implications for teacher education programs and the need to use teacher technology competencies in an integrated effort which considers not only technology, but pedagogy and curricular content as well.

Content included detective skills such as fingerprinting and handwriting analysis, advertisements, and literature-based mystery stories. Educational goals focused on developing problem-solving skills, literacy abilities, and working as a community. Activities included solving mysteries, analyzing clues, writing mystery stories, creating advertisements, and investigating crimes. Tools used throughout the two-week curriculum included paper and pencil assignments, word processors, video, simulations, books, print  graphic programs, computer-based interactive fiction, and databases. Preservice candidates' reflections on their experience were compared with reflections of candidates who completed a less structured field experience regarding what they learned about themselves, teaching, young learners and the learning/thinking process, and technology in educational settings. The reflections of those who participated in the technology-integrated project suggest that their experiences in actively using technology as a part of the teaching/learning process assisted them in developing an image of how technology can be used and provided them with a vision of how their coursework (theory) can translate to the design of learning opportunities (practice).

This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of several computer mediated communication (CMC) technologies available through the Internet, in three categories: (1) one-way CMC (World Wide Web, graphics, audio, video); (2) two-way asynchronous CMC (e-mail, mailing lists, message boards); and (3) two-way synchronous CMC (chat, audio conferencing, video conferencing). One-way CMC serves as the foundation for a course delivered via the Internet; lessons on the Web carry the content for the students to discuss, and the Web can also be used by the self-motivated teacher to find materials for lesson plans, student activities, and personal  enrichment. The addition of two-way asynchronous CMC to a Web-based course adds a necessary element for staff development; the ability to question and interact with instructor and peers is essential in any course taken by an educator. Two-way synchronous CMC provides for the instantaneous exchange of ideas. (Contains 18 references.) (AEF)",

A correlational research design was used to examine relationships among five learner attributes, three instructional variables, and student satisfaction. The five learner attribute predictors were: (1) previous experience with courses taught via technology; (2) self-ratings of competence with technology; (3) frequency of between-class usage of communications technology; (4) age; and (5) remote-site group size. Instructional variables included instructor/instruction, technology, and course management. Regression analyses identified learner attributes and instructional variables  predictive of student satisfaction. Of the eight predictor variables regressed on the measure of student satisfaction, only instructor/instruction contributes to explanation of the variance in course satisfaction scores. Overall instructor rating strongly correlated with satisfaction. The most potent finding is that good pedagogy is important to students' perceived satisfaction with distance education. The focus of faculty training and development for those who instruct in distance education courses should be directed to development of effective instructional strategies.

Two sections of a graduate level instructional technology course delivered via video teleconferencing and online instruction were examined for instructional strategies that were used to build interaction. In addition, the effectiveness of the strategies and student responses to the interaction were explored. Meaningful interaction was achieved in the categories of  learner-content, learner-learner, and learner-instructor. This was achieved through the instructor's careful planning of collaborative course activities that were specifically designed to support course objectives. Students were taught to use the interactive technologies (e-mail, bulletin board, chat) before they were required to use them, and these skills were reinforced and refined as the course progressed and the students became more proficient in using the technologies. The greatest problem appeared to be the delayed and limited feedback the instructor was able to provide regarding assignments. (Author/AEF)",

Universities seldom stop to determine if required competencies exist uniformly across all students. Literature has shown that computer access and integration of computers into curricula have been significantly lower in student populations from ethnic minorities in K-12 public schools. This study looks at access and utilization issues of students at an urban university across students of many different ethnicities to determine if discrepancies persist at the university level. Findings in  the following areas are discussed: computer skills and training; computer access--hardware; computer access--software; computer access--Internet/e-mail; current computer use; classroom computer use; and computer perspectives. Based on the findings, several changes are recommended that will expand computer ownership, training, support, and modeling of professional use of computers. (Contains numerous references.)

Students engage in online discussions to enhance and reinforce multicultural content learning, explore and develop Internet resources that address a wide spectrum of cultures, and become contributors to a knowledge base accessible worldwide. The instructor uses online libraries for class readings, as well as for resources for students and resources related to multicultural education. The use of technology in a multicultural education course allows students to  enact a way of being engaged in the world that is essentially multicultural in spirit. When used consciously to create a more student-centered classroom, it allows the instructor and students to engage in a constructivist approach to teaching and learning. (Author/AEF)",

The study focused on the manner and frequency of computer use by student teachers during the practicum, student teachers' perceptions of training adequacy, student teachers' attitudes towards the use of computers in teaching, and factors influencing student teachers' computer use. Results revealed that student teachers' computer use was limited in both universities.

The program emphasizes the integration of technology into the curriculum and the use of technology to drive education reform, rather than simply focusing on technology skills. Current research is beginning to indicate that programs such as this may be successful in transforming traditional, teacher-centered classrooms to more constructivist, student-centered environments. Case study and exit survey results are the main data sources for this study. Early findings support early conclusions indicating that there is a transformational effect with cohort teachers, and change agents are graduating who are  having an effect, not just locally, but on a state-wide level. Implications and areas of current and future research are discussed. (Author/AEF)",

Combined with a new school curriculum, which requires the seamless integration of technology into core subject areas, this has prompted the need to rethink the technology aspect of the teacher education program. A needs assessment based on the new Alberta curriculum was conducted to generate a technology profile of student teachers entering this new two-year Master of Teaching program, and to facilitate selecting appropriate means to integrate technology within it. In contrast to the previous teacher education program that concentrated on foundational  technology knowledge and productivity skills with computers, it appears that efforts in the Master of Teaching program should be concentrated on more sophisticated technical skills and on the integration, communication, decision making, and problem solving aspects of educational technology.

This paper focuses on how instructional designers can benefit from awareness of different adult education principles or theories. Traditionally instructional design is taught by connecting educational psychology via learning theories such as behaviorism, cognitive theory, and/or constructivism to learner design considerations. Although this is an acceptable manner for introducing instructional designers to varying educational theories, it does not provide a unified epistemology of learning and knowledge creation. This paper presents  theories that reflect the primary view on which adult education is based, that learning is an interactive process constructed by the learner and not passively received from the environment. These adult education principles are then applied to instructional design issues. (Contains 15 references.) (Author/AEF)",

Many commercially-available software programs, although excellent programs, may not be acceptable for each individual teacher's classroom. One way to insure that software is not only acceptable but also targets a teacher's class in a specific way, is for instructors to design their own software. The HyperCard authoring system is a computer program that enables teachers, even those with minimal programming ability, to easily design their own hypermedia software programs for use in individualized situations. Teachers now have an easy method to teach, drill, remediate, or even test individual classes or students by designing software that targets  these classes or individuals. This paper discusses setting up to design or create a software program; designing the software; adding buttons, fields and graphics to the stack/program; and scripting in HyperCard. (Author/AEF)",

Such goals include improving informal assessment opportunities, increasing study evaluation opportunities, and increasing students' opportunity for inquiry based and project based unit plan construction. The Interactive Web module has been implemented for two years in a teacher education course and has been modified based upon student surveys. This paper also describes the survey results and modifications that were made to the Web  Module accordingly. Preliminary research on the use of this Interactive Web module is described as well as plans for future research. (Author)",

        "description":"There is an obvious growth in the use of distributed and online learning environments. There is some evidence to believe that collaborative learning environments can be effective, especially when using advanced technology to support learning in and about complex domains. There is also an extensive body of research literature in the areas of situated cognition and problem-based learning that provides a theoretical perspective for the design of such learning environments. What is lacking are intelligent support tools to make it possible for subject experts (teacher-designers) to be more intimately involved in the design and implementation of collaborative distance learning environments. This paper describes such design tools, explicitly drawing on a socially-situated view of  problem-based learning in technology-mediated environments. It concludes with an illustration of the tools as applied by teachers to the domain of environmental education. (Contains 31 references.) (Author/AEF)",

Four themes were manifested in the case study of one teacher: learning on her own, authority and control, mathematics as manipulating, and frustration and confusion. The second case study brought forth the two themes of learning with others, and authority and control. The study demonstrates how the teachers' experiences can serve as a basis for a theoretical model for informing mathematics teacher educators about the multi-dimensional aspects of teachers' learning.

        "description":"A central tenet of mathematics education reform is the integral role of technology at all grade levels. Current technological changes combined with changes in mathematics content and instructional method require elementary mathematics teachers to be able to design technology intensive lessons for exploration and discovery of these concepts through appropriate computer applications. In actual practice, however, most computer applications provided for mathematics education consist of software designed for a specific educational purpose--the &quot;solution in a can&quot; scenario. Furthermore, economical constraints often stand in the way of incorporating such special purpose software into an instructional setting. This paper discusses an alternative to this traditional approach which shifts  the instructional focus from specific computer applications to more sophisticated uses of general purpose software. In particular, educational uses of spreadsheets are developed as an exemplar for this approach. The methods and approaches described were presented to graduate and undergraduate mathematics education majors in a continuing education course on microcomputers in the elementary mathematics classroom.

The Pilot put 1,138 high-specification portable computers in the hands of practicing teachers in a range of schools. The teachers interviewed in the course of undertaking case studies as part of the formal evaluation of the Pilot generally exhibited very high levels of motivation and self-reliance. The paper re-examines these case studies in the light of specific ideas of teacher professionalism and of the transition to postmodernity. It is concluded that the Pilot has been successful in providing a context for teacher professionalism to flourish and that the Pilot  was somewhat postmodern in nature--flexible, adaptable, sensitive to context, and non-prescriptive.

The transformative approach, which focuses on user-centered design, placing preservice teachers in the center of their own learning, is described. Instructional technologies are presented within the framework of cognitive learning, and reflective thinking is highlighted. The discussion examines the challenges of creating a student-centered learning environment for a majority of students and faculty embedded in traditional  teaching methodology. This model features assignment modifications, physical delivery revisions, electronic communication components, time commitment, and educational materials. A dialogue is provided concerning the obstacles and victories experienced by faculty and preservice teachers while moving a course of this nature to the Web.

        "description":"This paper describes a qualitative research study concerning the use of the World Wide Web to create electronic teaching portfolios in a preservice teacher education pilot course at the University of Virginia. The goal of the pilot course was to learn about the participants' purpose in creating an electronic teaching portfolio, the process they employed to create one, and the learning gained in the process. Interviews with the participating preservice teacher education students, participant observation in their class, and analysis of the journals students maintained revealed that the process was constructivist, demanding, and multifaceted. A brief review of the literature is provided, as well as a discussion of the following empirical assertions that resulted from the study: (1)  creating electronic teaching portfolios is a constructivist process that promotes an examination of students' beliefs, philosophies, objectives, and purposes for teaching; (2) constructing electronic teaching portfolios using technology, specifically the Web, was a complex and demanding process for students; and (3) students enrolled in the course to enhance their technology skills, to create a portfolio in a structured manner, and to make themselves more marketable for jobs.

Subjects were 78 9th and 10th grade biology students from three public high schools in Texas. Research focused on the following questions: (1) Will the use of a shared, Intranet environment improve learner problem-solving ability in science as measured by pre- and posttesting? (2) Will the use of a shared, Intranet environment increase learner metacognitive reflection as measured by use of pre- and posttest visual learning software (Inspiration) that measured the number of concepts used, number of concept links used, and number of concept nodes used to determine changes in learning thinking patterns, and by World Wide Web-based CourseInfo  software tracking capabilities within a threaded discussion site? and (3) Will gender differences emerge with the use of a shared, Intranet environment in the science area as determined from pre- and posttest scores measuring problem-solving ability and metacognitive reflection? Results indicated that learning behaviors within science Web-based environments provide support for this learning environment model. (AEF)",

The second part is dedicated to a more detailed analysis of the various uses of SMART Board from the point of view of the student. Activities support the learning process in terms of oral skills, the cognitive process, and students' motivation and emulation. Finally, the weaknesses of this tool are identified.

Among the best ways to encourage assimilation of those skills by pre-service teachers is to model the effective use of technology in both college and clinical classrooms. Pre-service teachers (n=410) were surveyed to determine to what degree their professors and supervising teachers were modeling the use of technology. Questions investigated their perceptions of: utilization of 12 different technologies, i.e., word processing, spreadsheet, database, desktop publishing, electronic presentations, the World Wide Web, e-mail, Galileo (a state-wide database), videodisc, satellite television, a statewide two-way distance learning technology, and Channel 1; and modeling of technology  skills by undergraduate teacher program instructors in the areas of core classes, professional education classes, and specialized content for teaching classes. The only technology that was used consistently was word processing. This confirms previous research which showed that word processing is the only classroom technology that educators are comfortable using. Differences among the various major professors' modeling of technology skills were also found. Recommendations are provided for technology modeling and ongoing staff development.

E-mail messages from Internet-based students were also coded. Specifically, the study focused on the following questions: (1) How  many students from the Internet-based class participated in the BSCW system? (2) Do some students use the system more frequently than others in a one-month period? (3) What were the e-mail variations? (4) What were the basic problems students had related to the BSCW system? (5) Were students satisfied with the course? and (6) By the end of the course, what were the variations of participation in the BSCW system?

This study examines what learning activities are applied across a variety of subject areas, how technology assists students' learning activities, and why technology is/isn't used in the typical learning activities. The study documented the typical learning activities and potential role for technology  within the classroom learning environment of the effective middle school teacher. Learning activities such as data collection, data analysis, visual/written communications, and design were employed as core categories for analysis of technology use, non-use, and potential.

Major objectives were to: (1) evaluate performance differences between students in a Web-based class and those in a traditional classroom setting when students are allowed to select the course they prefer; (2) evaluate the hypothesis that the background of students who prefer to enroll in a Web-based course is not different from those who prefer to enroll in a traditional class; and (3) identify what advantages the technology used in a Web-based class  has in terms of enhancing learning objectives. Participants were 89 students enrolled in two sections of an introductory statistics course at Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi, one taught in a traditional classroom and the other taught entirely via the Internet. Dependent variables were student demographics, test scores, and student withdrawal and passing rates. The major conclusion was that the results reported in the earlier study do not appear to be reproducible, at least with this student population. (Contains five tables and six references.) (AEF)",

        "description":"A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize existing research on the effect of gender differences on attitudes toward computers. A total of 106 studies were located from three sources, and their quantitative data were transformed into Effect Size. Nine variables were selected for coding: nationality of subjects, population group, sample size, type of publication, year of publication, reliability of measure, statistical power, statistics, and type of attitude. The results suggest that male subjects had slightly higher (more positive) attitudes toward computers than female subjects. While many authors have indicated that women and girls are more likely to hold lower attitudes toward computers than males, the results of this study provide accumulated research-based evidence to  support this hypothesis. Left unanswered is the question of what factors truly contribute to the differences. Studies of this question will require further clarification of the exact relationship between gender and computer learning. This meta-analysis points out only that gender differences on attitudes toward computers exist. (Contains 31 references.) (Author/AEF)",

This research was conducted with data collected from interviews, journals, observations, email messages, and online conferencing software postings of 22 members of three sections of a graduate-level asynchronous online distance education course at Northwestern State University of Louisiana in the spring of 1998. Two types of incidental learning outcomes were observed. The first developed from the students' use of the technology itself. The second centered on an improvement in certain areas of the students' personal development. An increase in time management ability, self-directive behavior, self-confidence, and  self-discipline occurred. The results of the study illustrate the value of incidental learning in an asynchronous online course and the need for coursework development that fosters the growth of incidental learning.

        "description":"Schools cannot expect to obtain gains in learner achievement from computer technology if it is not properly implemented. The concerns of teachers in integrating computer technology in the classroom may impact how computer technology is ultimately implemented. This study examined the concerns of elementary school teachers implementing computer-delivered instruction. Data were collected by administering the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) to teachers at four elementary schools in an urban school district. Responses were analyzed for each of the seven stages of concern (i.e., how users perceive an innovation from the time they first become aware of it until they gain mastery of the innovation). The findings of the study support the position that teachers' concerns and  perceptions of an integrated learning system (ILS) influence the way in which they implement an ILS. For schools to experience significant change or reform due to the integration of computer technology, the instructional concerns and practices of teachers must be carefully considered. Furthermore, the integration of computer technology must be approved, accepted, and implemented by teachers for computer technology to ultimately impact student learning while reducing instructional costs.

        "description":"Having a good command over basic computer applications is essential for teachers to integrate technology in school. Teachers should learn how to maximize the power of computers for their teaching and administrative work. This paper focuses on some effective approaches that can help teachers learn to use computer applications successfully. First, common computer tasks were categorized based on their features into conceptual, declarative, and procedural tasks. A series of enhancement instruments was designed, developed, and implemented in computer application courses throughout a two-year period; subjects were 186 undergraduate preservice teachers and 112 graduate inservice teachers. Data were gathered and interpreted about effective approaches. The study focused on various tasks,  instructional devices, and factors that may have contributed to teachers' successful learning of computer applications. Goals of the study were to explore: (1) how novice computer-using teachers differ from experienced computer-using teachers; (2) how inservice teachers differ from preservice teachers in computer learning; (3) what kinds of devices can help novice users master the computer tasks and accelerate the learning curve; and (4) what factors can contribute to effective learning about computer applications for teachers.

The arrangement provided an opportunity for children to interact with peers whom they would not normally meet at school. Relying on material from their own social studies curriculum, pairs of children exchanged information in a structured fashion. This allowed children to assume the role of both teacher/resource and learner and to develop potential friendships in an ongoing correspondence. Results indicated that successful implementation requires significant teacher intervention by integrating the program with the existing curriculum. One unexpected but  important effect of this bridge between schools was the exposure of participating teachers to school cultures distinct from their own, particularly in regard to differences in teaching methods. This can lead to a reassessment of values and curriculum needs. (Author)",

        "description":"Expectancy models of behavior such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) offer guidelines that aid efforts to facilitate use of new technology. These models remind us that both acceptance of and resistance to technology use are grounded in beliefs and norms regarding the technology. Although TAM is widely used to model user acceptance of technology, it is suggested that the model fails to capture all of the relevant components to technology acceptance in the context of educational organizations. This paper discusses the application of expectancy models to educational institutions and identifies relevant aspects of technology use that are accounted for by TRA. The introduction describes initiatives to support faculty in technology  adoption at the University of Arizona. The next section presents TRA and TAM, as well as a survey designed to measure a broad set of potentially relevant beliefs in faculty acceptance of technology. Two pervasive faculty development strategies (i.e., incentives and training) are then considered, using TRA to illuminate the process by which these strategies might affect behavior and using the model to generate new strategies.

A key component of the partnership involves meaningful curricular integration of technology, so teachers and students may use this tool to foster higher-level thinking. This study focuses on one segment of the TIPS: teachers' curriculum integration projects. Goals were to document the kinds of technology being used to restructure schools at the classroom level; identify some of the best practices and highlight specific projects that have been designed and implemented by teachers; analyze the growth of respective teachers' experiences with technology  integration; and identify challenges teachers face when infusing technology. A preliminary analysis was conducted from interview data with 17 teachers who wrote competitive project grants. Four teachers were selected to study in depth using interviews and observations to analyze how teachers used technology projects to restructure schools at the classroom level. Themes that emerged in all of the interviews included how curriculum, pedagogy, student learning, and assessment changed in the restructured environment, as well as challenges teachers faced with technology infusion.

One goal of the project was to integrate technology into the daily classroom activities of the students. The expected outcome was that teachers and teacher education students would grow in their appreciation and understanding of the instructional uses of technology, and teacher education students would grow in their knowledge about what practicing teachers do. However, an unexpected byproduct of the project was the modeling by the guest speakers of dispositions of effective teachers and their public reflection on teaching. The success of the project has led to a larger program, supported by  grant funds, with 32 teachers and teacher education students from across Indiana. (Contains 27 references.) (Author/MES)",

Students were asked to contribute an e-mail message to the class discussion at least once every two weeks; they could write on any topic suggested by their field experiences or related class discussions and readings. Critical interpretative methods were used to examine levels of reflection in student e-mail discussions and the degree of support for critical reflection offered in the e-mail activity. Findings suggest that the e-mail activity promoted some reflection among the participants and that, as the discussion developed, joint interpretations of field experiences by the participants increased, but critical reflection was rare. In light of the findings, the following  suggestions for increased structural supports for critical reflection are offered: (1) help students identify problems and issues that emerge from their field experiences; (2) clarify expectations for critical reflection; (3) take a more active role as facilitator in the e-mail discussions; (4) integrate the e-mail conversations with what goes on in face-to-face meetings; and (5) continually monitor and support the joint negotiation of meaning that goes on in the discussions.

The software is composed of an interface that connects the hyperlink, text, graphics, video, and sound capabilities of a browser to a World Wide Web client-server environment and is augmented by local electronic help tools and computer supported collaborative tools. Collaborative activities are supported through specially designed whiteboard, chat,  file, and application sharing tools. Students can access online schedules and determine whether faculty or other students are available. The system is also equipped with management and record keeping capabilities that allow teachers or trainers to analyze various collaborative activities. Students enrolled in a variety of courses at the University of North Texas used the system to collaborate with other students and teachers. Information was logged concerning overall student performance, activities performed while using the collaborative systems, and attitudes related to technology and collaboration. Results were analyzed to determine which factors contributed to successful/unsuccessful collaboration. (MES)",

        "description":"This paper discusses what is known about learning to date by emphasizing \"connections\" as necessary for learning. Knowledge about these connections can be placed into four categories: (1) neurological connections; (2) cognitive connections; (3) social connections; and (4) experiential connections. In terms of neurological connections, sensory input is crucial for newborns, but as long as the brain continues to be stimulated, our brains continue to make connections. Regarding cognitive connections, it has become apparent that people's minds think and understand things in terms of schemata. Therefore, it is easier to learn more complex concepts that fit into existing schemata than it is to learn something completely new. Deeper learning gets placed into schemata with time.  Cognitive strategies can be broken down into cognitive learning and metacognitive strategies. These strategies are broken down and detailed in the document. Social connections refer to the interaction between the internal processes of the mind and how the mind grasps the external realities of knowledge. Making social connections between the various players at institutions of higher education may be an innovative strategy used in the near future. The last category is that of experiential connections, or making connections between experience and learning. Contains 28 references. (AMA)",

The principles state that a learning college: 1) creates substantive change in individual learners; 2) engages learners in the learning process as full partners who must assume primary responsibility for their own choices; 3) creates and offers as many options for learning as possible; 4) assists learners to form and participate in collaborative learning activities; 5) defines the roles of learning facilitators in response to the needs of the learners; and 6) succeeds with its learning facilitators only when improved and expanded learning can be documented for learners. Opportunities for creating a learning  college include capitalizing on a natural trigger event, identifying needs through an assessment, building on existing innovations, and initiating conversations on learning. Finally, key factors for launching a learning college are building a critical coalition, creating an emerging vision, creating action plans, involving all stakeholders, ensuring appropriate support, creating an open system of communication, considering consultants and established processes, paying attention to language, reallocating resources, evaluating, and committing to the &quot;long haul&quot;. Each of these principles, opportunities, and key factors are discussed in the document. Contains 31 references. (AMA)",

Presented are three challenges that will define the System's future relevance in support of economic development: (1) its ability to stay ahead of the &quot;tidal wave&quot; that is technological change; (2) its capabilities in workforce development to address looming technical labor shortages; and (3) its ability to support regionalism trends in economic development. The reality of higher education for the future will be to educate for competencies and certifications of ability to perform. While technology must be embraced for its ability to deliver instruction over distance, it must not replace the emphasis on fundamental  education. North Carolina must increase its workforce development efforts, working hand-in-hand with industry to turn change into opportunity by adding updated skills to the maturity, experience, and strong work ethic of displaced and underemployed workers. Regionalism places a premium on workforce development as a strategic economic development asset. If the community college of tomorrow is to continue to play its role as the preeminent institution for not only educational opportunity, but also economic development, it will be because of enlightened leaders.

This potential growth is a challenge, but can also be a tremendous opportunity. Economic change must start off in the workforce with better skills than those of decades ago, and those skills must improve every day just to keep up. North Carolina community colleges must support an economic future for all North Carolinians. Ensuring that North Carolina's citizens have the skills to participate in the information  technology economy is the most important challenge that the State faces in the coming years. The real challenge is in rethinking partnerships through which instruction is delivered at every stage of the learning process. However, technology skill must not replace the emphasis on fundamental education. College leaders must &quot;think globally, act locally.&quot; (VWC)",

A focus of the planning was technology, and a technology environmental scanning team developed a set of planning assumptions, which led to the creation of 15 goals and related objectives for the 1999-2001 biennium. The technology-related planning assumptions included: (1) increasing the use of technology to redefine delivery systems; (2) using technology to better serve business and agency partners; (3) providing more technology training; (4) developing a communication infrastructure to support distance learning and remote access to resources; (5) redefining the funding model for technology and  technical staff; (6) using technology to reach underserved customers; and (7) reducing administrative, regulatory, and accrediting barriers to the effective use of technology at the colleges. Technology-related goals arising from these assumptions include: (1) acquiring and maintaining the resources to support the educational objectives of the System; (2) creating an integrated, systemwide virtual learning environment; and (3) providing and supporting state-of-the-art administrative systems to integrate the colleges electronically.

With regard to restoring access to higher education and workforce preparation, there was an increase in the participation rate from 58/1000 adults in California to 61/1000 (fall 1995 and fall 1998 respectively). The State is attempting to increase access and participation to 73/1000 adults by 2005. In terms of improving funding per student, the State is considerably behind: In 1995-1996 the national average of per-student funding was $6,022 at the community college. California's community colleges were funded at $3,533 per student in the same year. California hopes to reach $6,500 per-student  funding by 2005; however, the national average of per-student funding is projected to be over $8,000 by 2005. The legislators approved a number of funding measures for facilities needs, which provided local and state funds for restoration, maintenance, and new facilities. A call is made for California to commit to shared governance models, increase the use of and training in technology, increase the overall budget, and successfully implement the Partnership for Excellence program. California should resolve the full-time/part-time faculty issue, recommit to diverse communities, increase transfer and program completion, increase marketing, develop more partnerships, and improve student learning and leadership development.

First, legislation should be developed that establishes the basic framework for enabling community colleges to restore a level of access to community college education and training for more citizens. This would provide economic and social opportunity for more citizens, help meet demands in the labor force and needs of the state, and help reverse trends that harm the state's economy, society, and multi-cultural diversity. Secondly, the state should develop a public awareness and marketing plan that would inform the public, media, and policy makers about the value of community colleges and the need to increase access. Third, accountability to the community colleges' stakeholders by those in governance  should be increased. The fourth proposal focused on the mandates and policies that emerged in the 1990s. They included but were not limited to: welfare reform; the improvement of transfer and articulation; the diversity of students, faculty, and staff; Proposition 209; the development of a state work force preparation plan; and instructional delivery systems. Nussbaum also argued for maintaining a commitment to diversity. (TGO)",

This document discusses the current process of submitting proposals for collaborative facilities projects, and outlines and discusses five recommendations for changing current procedures. The first recommendation is that collaborative facilities projects should compete in the existing California Community Colleges approval process. Second, collaborative facilities projects must have a separate funding source or additional funding from the regular capital outlay program. Third, collaborative facilities projects must contain a 50 percent local match to the state investment in the project cost,  with the proposing community college district providing at least 20 percent of the local match amount. The fourth recommendation is that collaborative facilities projects should have the flexibility to plan for a greater percentage capacity load than provided through current General Obligation bond funding resources. The last recommendation is that collaborative facilities projects should be considered as a pilot program for lump sum funding by the legislature. This document has three appendices, which contain the California State University's 1994 policy and procedures on collaborative facilities projects, acknowledgments, and 12 references. (TGO)",

        "description":"This document discusses the principles that guide the development of the contingent funding methods and the implementation criteria for the Partnership for Excellence Program, as well as significant issues and questions for the system to resolve. The first principle states that the level and pace of progress toward the Partnership goals are not expected to be uniform among all 71 districts in California. Secondly, the funding methods and implementation criteria should reflect that progress will differ among the five Partnership goals over time. The third principle states that the level of progress is dependent upon: (a) the State's responsibility to provide full funding for enrollment growth, inflation, and the Partnership itself; and (b) exogenous factors beyond the direct  control of the system, the colleges, and the State. The fourth principle supports permanent funding in order to allow districts to make long-term plans. The fifth principle allows for funding to be adjusted based upon the level of improvement achieved by district. The sixth principle provides for a reward structure to encourage districts to reach their performance goals. The seventh principle demands an accountability system to prevent grade inflation, or manipulation of data. Finally, the eighth principle encourages an easily comprehensible system. The document concludes with a brief description of the process and time frame for the activities mentioned. The appendix contains the education code. (TGO)",

It is hoped that by providing this document, the reporting of data will improve and colleges will utilize this document in institutional planning, program review, assessment studies, accreditation, and improvement of Partnership for Excellence goals. This document outlines the goals of the Chancellor's Office for California Community Colleges. The first goal is to increase the number of community college students who transfer to four-year institutions from 69,574 to 92,500.  Achievement of this goal is dependent upon the extent to which four-year institutions are able to accommodate the additional students. The second goal is to increase the number of degrees and certificates awarded by California's community colleges from 80,799 to 110,500. The achievement of this goal is contingent upon increasing the number of courses successfully completed. This lends itself to the third goal, which is increasing the successful course completion rate from 68.1% to 70.6%. The fourth goal involves increasing vocational and workforce development enrollment, and the fifth goal is to increase from 108,566 to 150,754 the number of students completing coursework at least one level above their prior basic skills enrollment.

        "description":"This handbook begins with a history of funding in California's community colleges, explaining that financial support for community colleges has evolved over the years, as have the colleges themselves and the purposes they serve. Following this history of funding is a discussion of 1988's Proposition 98, which guaranteed annual funding and revenue for K-12 and community colleges. In 1990, Proposition 98 was amended with Proposition 111. The amendments that were put into place to stabilize state funds ended up reducing the State General Fund support from 40.33% in 1986-1987 to 33% in 1993-1994. The debate over Proposition 98 and 111 led to a return to program-based funding, as is examined in the next section of the handbook. In this section categories of operation are defined,  standards and workload measures are described, target and standard allocations are made, levels of funding and how they are to be appropriated are considered, and recommendations are outlined. This portion of the handbook also includes a &quot;frequently-asked-questions&quot; section about program-based funding. The handbook moves on to discuss full-time faculty obligations and financial accounting, outlining 12 principles for sound fiscal management.

This is the fourth report in a series by the RCCI Documentation Team. The RCCI program challenges community colleges to become catalysts for change through two mutual and complementary goals: expanding access to higher education and fostering regional economic development. This brief examines the experiences of the nine pilot RCCI colleges and their efforts to acquire the capacities for change, and identifies implications for other institutions facing similar challenges. It suggests that an institution's capacity to meet these two  goals requires attention to institutional cultures, leadership style, and organizational infrastructure. In strengthening these areas, community colleges can improve their effectiveness in building human resources and social capacities for survival and success in a changing world. Colleges must look seriously at new roles, partnerships, and marketing, as well as value systems that include team-building strategies, risk taking, and openness to expanded access, economic development, and local cultures.

New Mexico's colleges and universities have steadily improved their working relationships, which is based on an increased rate of transfer credits. The state's six public universities have been found to accept 95% of the credits presented for transfer. Reasons for transferring and being denied transfer are described. An analysis was performed on data from the Commission's statewide database to gather information about the representation of transfer students among bachelor's degree recipients. The study found that over half of New Mexico's bachelor's degrees are awarded to  transfer students. In addition, most baccalaureate students enroll for more than the minimum number of credits needed for the completion of a degree. Statewide, transfer students differ little, if at all, from native students in this respect. Among associate degree recipients, it was found that over four in ten of New Mexico's associate degrees are awarded to transfer students. Commission Priorities for 1999-2000 are also detailed. Tables describe credit hour accumulation by associate degree recipients and the total hours in New Mexico by campus. (JJL)",

Sixteen general guidelines are listed for the colleges to follow in applying the standards and measures, which are expected to continue to evolve to ensure that they achieve their intended purpose.

Local governing boards and academic senates were given the responsibility for determining  equivalency. The paper addresses the historical context within which equivalency was established, the precise meaning of the term, and how districts address the issue of equivalence through the published minimum qualifications for hire. It stresses the importance of faculty judgement in determining equivalency. This report reviews what constitutes appropriate criteria for determining equivalent qualifications and suggests ways of defining a process for determining equivalent qualifications.

The paper begins with a review of good practices in technology-mediated instruction and proceeds to consider and make recommendations on effective instructor-student contact. Many of the recommendations apply equally to courses offered in any mode of instruction, but the paper specifically addresses local curriculum committees as they decide how to apply these recommendations in their review of distance education course proposals. The  paper briefly mentions some unresolved issues in the area of faculty collective bargaining. Finally the paper makes recommendations for action by local academic senates to ensure that the curriculum review process for distance education courses separately documents effective instructor-student contact, technical support, accessibility, and provision of support services to students.

        "description":"This report summarizes the progress made by the Commission on Higher Education and the faculty and administrators at New Mexico's 25 postsecondary campuses in facilitating student transfer between institutions. New Mexico's colleges and universities have steadily improved their working relationships, which is based on an increased rate of transfer credits. The state's six public universities have been found to accept 94% of the credits presented for transfer. Reasons for transferring and being denied transfer are described. An analysis was performed on data from the Commission's statewide database to gather information about the representation of transfer students among bachelor's degree recipients. The study found that nearly half of New Mexico's bachelor's degrees are awarded  to transfer students. In addition, most baccalaureate students enroll for more than the minimum number of credits needed for the completion of a degree. Statewide, transfer students differ little, if at all, from native students in this respect. Commission Priorities for 1998-1999 are also detailed, including the defining of the competencies expected of students when they complete the statewide common core of general education. A table describes credit hour accumulation by transfer and native students in New Mexico, by university. (JJL)",

A digital divide has arisen in America and a national agenda is needed that will fully train all adults in 5 years so that they can be comfortable with technology and continue to grow on their own with the Internet. There will be an increase in our higher education population (boomlets) over the next ten years at the very time that a vast number of teachers will be retiring. Therefore, we must seek to encourage and train the next generation of community college teachers and administrators quickly. The overuse of adjunct faculty debilitates  colleges and shortchange students in their education, and asserts that the government must address this practice before the coming tidal wave of students and retiring faculty. Financial and educational deprivation is an equal opportunity oppressor, and community colleges can play a major role in the process of educating the poor in a less expensive mode. (VWC)",

The evaluation process at ICC is characterized by the following: it is short, it is data-driven and quantifiable, it is clear, it is fair, it reflects the accountability that is the hallmark of the new millennium, and it has meaning. The components used in the evaluation are driven by the job description. Points are assigned to the following components of the process: (1) teaching, which  includes student ratings of instruction and advising, material preparation, recordkeeping and instructional management, advising, and student retention yield, accounts for 75 percent; (2) service to the college accounts for 10 percent; (3) service to the profession or industry accounts for 5 percent; and (4) other expectations (professional development), which includes creative and/or scholarly production (academic faculty) and compliance with standards established by external agencies (technical/vocational faculty), accounts for 10%.

He states that North Carolina is a leading manufacturing state today in an economy that is increasingly being refocused on information-based services. From an economic development perspective, the shift toward a knowledge economy places greater not less importance on workforce development and the role of the community colleges. He contends that even though the state's leaders recognized the central role of workforce development in promoting growth over fifty years ago, this does not mean the state has achieved its goals and can refocus its resources elsewhere. Instead, the author advocates the  courage to change as appropriate and to continuously evaluate one's position. With new federal legislation and new economic circumstances, there are certain changes needed to adapt to this environment: salaries, lifelong learners, short-term training initiatives, program integration, and redesign of delivery systems through the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Implications of the WIA for community colleges are presented through a list of key provisions: funding streams, three tiers of service, vouchers for training, eligibility of training providers, youth programs/councils, governance structure, one-stop delivery system, and statewide activities. Finally, a community college action agenda is presented, which includes keeping informed of any WIA guidelines, obtaining copies of draft  regulations, and contacting governors and chief local elected officials.

The first students to graduate from the honors program will do so in May of 2001. In order to graduate with honors students must: (1) meet all of the requirements for a two-year degree with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher; (2) complete one honors seminar; (3) complete two honors contracts; (4) perform specified community service; and (5) complete the leadership development seminar. An honors contract can be attached to any college-level course and is therefore an extension of a parent course and not a new and separate course. Faculty members are encouraged to participate in the honors program as mentors and are given financial incentives for their  participation. A mentor is awarded a $250 initial writing bonus for writing an approved honors contract, $100 for the first student enrolled in an honors contract, and $25 for each additional enrolling in the same contract. However, no more than five students may be enrolled in a single contract.

        "description":"This study was performed using a convenience sample of 90 students at a northeastern community college to determine gender differences of math anxiety and its effect on math avoidance. Four sections of an introductory English class were given a mathematics anxiety rating scale (MARS) and a math avoidance survey. Five hypotheses were analyzed using both standard normal distribution tests and chi-square contingency tables. It was determined that men reported significantly less math anxiety and sought significantly less help with math than women. Men and women were equal in avoiding taking required math courses. Women avoided majors requiring two or math courses, significantly more than men. Perception of math difficulty was not associated with math anxiety. Although there were few  participants with both high levels of math anxiety and math avoidance, inspection of scatter diagrams suggest that men with high MARS scores and women of all MARS scores are at risk to avoid math courses. It is concluded that MARS represents a moderately useful measure for school professionals to predict men's math avoidance, and to a lesser degree women's math avoidance. Literature suggests that societal norms may be more influential than math anxiety in explaining women's math avoidance. This document contains thirty-nine references and two appendices, which include sample surveys and supplemental data tables. (Author/TGO)",

From a national perspective, access to postsecondary education for students from low-income families is less now than at any time since 1970. By income quartile, in 1996 the chance that students from families with an annual income below $24,500 would graduate from high school and enter college was roughly 35%, a 7.6% increase over 1980, compared to an 80% chance for students of the same age from families with an annual income of $72,000 or more, a 16.7% increase over 1980. Averaging data across the last 6 years, there is only a 16.1% chance that students within the state of Alabama from low income families will gain access to postsecondary education. This ranks Alabama as one  of the lowest in the nation. Many factors affect access to postsecondary educational opportunity, including the extent of poverty in a state, the high school graduation rate, the availability of financial assistance, changes in financial aid regulations, rising tuition and fees, availability of support systems such as transportation and child care, and the flexibility of work schedules of students from low income families. This report presents six charts that provide information about access for the country, southern states, and Alabama. (JJL)",

Four basic categories of planned gifts are mentioned: outright gifts of appreciated assets which result in tax consequences in their giving (stocks, real estate); gifts which retain an income or benefit for the donor (trusts); gifts which pass assets to heirs (trusts); and gifts left to the college through a will or bequest. Bequests are discussed, including their various forms: specific  bequests, residuary bequests, and contingent bequests. Life income plans are also detailed, followed by possible gains in income tax deductions. Other types of donations that are explained are charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, life insurance, pooled life income funds, and retained real estate. Each section describes the process for setting up the planned gift, and provides profiles of potential donors who would most likely contribute and benefit from these forms of giving. (JJL)",

The cost-benefit ratios speak favorably for the economic value of higher education in Tennessee from the student's perspective. On average, a student may expect a return of $5.44 for each dollar invested; the return for an associate degree is $5.84. The cost-benefit ratios demonstrate the excellent value of higher education in Tennessee. On average, society may expect a return of $9.30 for each dollar invested, based on a Department of Commerce multiplier estimating the impact of income on the economy. A table shows the income that the state may expect (in sales tax revenue alone) over and above what a high school graduate would be expected to contribute.  For example, state tax revenues (increase) for a two year associate degree, $8,444; for a Bachelor's degree, $18,096; and for an advanced degree, $31,054. It is clear from this information that the state achieves a significant return on its investment in higher education. The document concludes that an investment by the state in higher education institutions of the Tennessee Board of Regents system yields significant returns to the student, to the state, and to society as a whole.

        "description":"This report gives recommendations for the 1999 budget policy for higher education within the state of New Jersey. In its background section of previous budget policies and related reports, the report describes the Commission's goals and plans on financing, the condition of New Jersey's financial aid to students, incentive programs, and remaining needs. For the fiscal year 1999, the report stresses that the budget must recognize that the various sources of funding for higher education are interdependent. Following a description of possible sources, the 1999 budget policy recommendations are stated. First, in terms of student assistance, the report focuses on tuition grants, differentiating between full time and part time students. The Commission urges that the 1999 budget provide  inflation-based increases for summer programs and costs for the academic year for students. It describes the initiatives of the Educational Opportunity Fund and two scholarships. In terms of capital funding, the Commission recommends inclusion of funding for capital programs with continued funding for the debt service costs of other funds. In terms of educational operating aid, it is recommended that the budget take initiative in achieving the recommended funding partnership for the four-year, two-year, and independent institutions. Other higher education programs are mentioned, followed by a statement on accountability and funding for statewide goals. (JJL)",

This longitudinal and cross-sectional study sought to replicate the association between a self-referential visual self-recognition task and embarrassment, and to extend the understanding of the interrelations between pronoun production and emergence of &quot;other&quot; in imitative pretend play tasks as indicators of self-development. Toddlers' embarrassment reactions (in response to an over-complimenting experimenter), self-recognition, and complexity in imitative pretend play were assessed in a laboratory setting when subjects were 19, 22, 25, and 28 months of age. Pronoun production was assessed through maternal reports when the subjects were 18  and 24 months old. Participating were 161 toddler twins who were part of an ongoing longitudinal study of emotional development. The cross-sectional sample size ranged from 51 to 64, while longitudinal sample size with listwise deletion across all four time points was 30. The findings provided very limited support for the hypothesis that the acquisition of a distinct sense of self is associated with embarrassment reactions as they were assessed. The findings did strongly suggest that development of complexity in pretend play, self-recognition, and embarrassment run largely parallel to each other, with different rates of change. Relations between pronoun production and embarrassment were mostly mixed: some associations supported and some contradicted the developmental priority of pronoun  production as a measure of self-development over embarrassment.

The paper notes how the environment of a center should fit its image of children: as learners and researchers; in constant relationship with their surroundings; as being capable of long investigation of media; as being able to solve important problems; as social beings; as entitled to beauty; as welcome; and as engaged in learning. The second paper, &quot;Melbourne via Reggio Emilia&quot; (Kerrie Trebilcock), concerns the culture of a private early childhood center in  Melbourne, Australia. The paper notes how the center's culture was presented through its physical environment such as interior and exterior architecture and design, and suggests that the design of early childhood centers should: create a conducive environment for learning; provide children with a sense of achievement and ownership in the environment; and allow children a degree of freedom. The third paper, &quot;Packing the Suitcase: What To Pack?&quot; (Margo Hobba and Tony Hobba), presents the authors' experiences designing an early child care center in Geelong, Australia, inspired by their Reggio Emilia experience. The fourth paper, also titled &quot;Melbourne via Reggio Emilia&quot; ( Diane Bourke), concerns refurbishment of the Junior School of Melbourne Girls Grammar in Australia.

The states served by the project are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. GLRAP used three methods (survey, canvass call telephone interviews, and focus groups with Head Start staff) to inquire about potential and real effects of welfare reform on Head Start services. Findings showed that the principal concerns clustered in three areas: eligibility and changes in the formal system, family concerns, and internal Head Start issues. Loss of child eligibility for enrollment in Head Start and loss  of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits were concerns which 73 percent of Disability Service Coordinators (DSCs) identified on the survey. There was a trend in concern about enrollment of children as program size increased. Regarding services to families in Head Start, 62 percent of DSCs anticipated changes because of welfare reform. Larger programs serving more families had more concerns in this area than smaller programs. Also, many internal issues were identified as concerns by Head Start staff, including the need for staff development and training. (Contains 18 references and 4 tables.) (EV)",

Subjects were 1,798 pupils from 68 primary schools who completed a questionnaire on different aspects of their lives and a Dutch version of Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children. The 6- to 8-year-olds in the subject population completed an altered version of the questionnaire. Adult respondents included 1,240 parents and 113 teachers. Questions were broad and covered the following areas of children's lives: family, parents' employment, school environment, friends, and leisure. Among the findings were the following: the majority of children are living with their married biological parents. Most children feel happy in their families and  have a good to very good relationship with their parents. Most like or love going to school and are happy with their teachers. The questionnaire, in which the child is the unit of observation and analysis and in which the entire attention is given to the child's point of view, is on the interface between sociology and psychology. It was concluded that it is possible to associate children as respondents in research and obtain reliable and scientifically justified information on children's living conditions.

The findings indicated that in city schools the teacher was stricter than in village schools. Compared to children in the village schools, children in city  schools had to do more work, but had more time to play; they were also teased more, felt more comfortable with their parents and were less angry with their fathers; felt more competent with regard to social competence, athletic competence, physical experience, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Children in villages more often played outside and visited friends' homes to play than city children.

Characteristics of an effective performance measurement system are presented, along with examples of state and local performance measurement systems. Also discussed is a four-quadrant approach for developing performance measures that are useful, quantifiable, and that fit into a more broad performance measurement framework. The report stresses the crucial distinction between two types of accountability, accountability for results and that for performance: results accountability concerns conditions of  well-being for children, families, and communities that cut across agencies and programs, whereas performance accountability is that part of results accountability concerned with how well agencies and programs perform. Taken together, these two levels of accountability cover the whole range of questions, from the broadest level view of community accountability for child and family well-being to the smallest increment of performance by a particular program. Along with an introduction and conclusion, the report has six sections: (1) starting points; (2) an approach to performance measurement; (3) characteristics of an effective performance measurement system; (4) using performance measures to improve performance; (5) examples of state and local performance measurement systems; and (6)  lessons and issues.

        "description":"Many efforts to implement a results-based framework for public programs have been marred by confusion about terms and basic definitions, and difficulty in identifying appropriate results and performance measures. This guide is intended to help planners identifying program results and indicators and tie them to an established planning, budgeting, and management system in funding for public education and other children's projects. The guide presents key characteristics of an effective results and indicators list, important steps in developing this list, and potential problems that a jurisdiction may face in establishing results and indicators and collecting data to measure them. Part One of the guide discusses the movement toward results-based accountability and presents the  rationale for connecting results to budgets. Major shortcomings of current budget systems are outlined as well as the task of selecting results and indicators in the context of an overall strategic shift to a results-based system. Part Two defines basic terms and creates a common vocabulary. This part describes a results and indicators list not only as a product, but as a process that creates a framework for fundamental change in the way that jurisdictions allocate resources. This section concludes with key characteristics of an effective results and indicators list that are used to inform discussion in the rest of the guide. Part Three raises nine key implementation questions that jurisdictions need to ask in order to build a politically credible, sustainable, and dynamic process. The  section draws on the experiences of several states, counties, and cities to illustrate problems, choices, and solutions. The guide's brief concluding section offers a summary of main points.

This study examined the number and characteristics of families and children in Cuyahoga County, Ohio that would qualify for non-assistance child care subsidies. Data were obtained from the Public Use Microdata Sample drawn from the 1990 census. Families were included in the study if they had at least 1 child under 13 years, were headed by a single working parent or by 2 working parents, and had a 1989 income at or below 185 percent of poverty level. The findings indicated that there were over 8,000 children whose families would qualify for non-assistance child under the current voucher system. Of working families, 6,347 (7 percent) had incomes  up to 100 percent of poverty level and would qualify for child care subsidies under the present system. Seventy-seven percent of these families were single-parent families, and 15 percent had received public assistance income during the previous year. Standard child care home and center operating hours would meet the needs of 63 percent of families with working parents. (Four appendices include data tables.) (KB)",

Several themes emerged from the study: (1) parents prefer placing their infants and toddlers in child care with family and friends whom they know and trust; (2) safety of children is the greatest concern of these families; (3) parents want to have choices about the care their children receive; (4) use of child care subsidies depends on adequate choice, accessibility of care, cost of care, and accurate information offered in a timely and respectful manner. Based on the study findings, the following  recommendations were made: (1) the system for accessing child care subsidies must be seamless and responsive to the needs of parents regarding education and training and to those who have become employed; (2) measures to expand the supply and mix of child care arrangements in the central city should be carefully considered; (3) all parents need to understand how to shop for a care provider; and (4) mechanisms to ease the co-payment for families just beginning their employment should be considered.

        "description":"This paper discusses a one-page curriculum outline for a preschool mathematics program in Israel. The curriculum was developed in the course of preservice and inservice teacher education programs in Israel, and the mathematics activities offered to support the curriculum were developed by student teachers there. The curriculum starts from Ginsburg's (1977) recommendation to focus directly on numbers, not on readiness for learning numbers, and also draws on the work of Payne and Rathmell (1975), Gelman and Gallistel (1986), Resnick (1983), and Barrata-Lorton (1972, 1979). The curriculum integrates the NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) Standards (1989) with specific learning expectations for children age 2 to 5. Within the curriculum, three assumptions state how  young children learn mathematics: (1) by confronting tasks/problems which offer a variety of solution strategies; (2) by engaging in meaningful conversation with partners and in small groups about the tasks/problems: describing, explaining, deciding, considering; and (3) by encountering the mathematics in familiar situations: stories, songs, familiar games. The curriculum outline itself is a mapping of the conceptual contents: what young children learn about numbers. This extends from the earliest stages of exploring numbers to the formal addition and subtraction of the standard first-grade curriculum. Following a presentation of the one-page outline, the paper clarifies each subheading and offers examples of appropriate activities. (EV)",

The targeted population consisted of fifth-grade students in a regular education program, and high school students classified as having behavioral disorders. The problem of irresponsible behavior was documented by means of student surveys, teacher observation checklists, student journals, and teacher journals. The 12-week intervention consisted of: (1) increasing student choice in classroom activities; (2) implementing a series of learning activities addressing student organizational skills; and (3) employing learning activities that require metacognitive and  behavioral reflections. In order to assess the effects of the intervention, teachers completed pre-post surveys and maintained weekly teacher observation checklists and journals through the period. Students wrote in journals to reflect on their progress. Post-intervention student survey data suggested that fifth graders' understanding of responsibility had changed from that of compliance to taking care of themselves. High school students with behavior disorders were not able to articulate responsible behavior, but there was consistency and improvement in responsible classroom behavior over the course of the intervention. There was considerable example of irresponsibility outside the classroom.

This guidebook details the results of the Project on State-Level Child Outcomes, designed to assist states in measuring child outcomes in the context of welfare reform programs. The guidebook is presented in three sections. Section 1 describes the Project study, in which representatives of state welfare agencies, federal government representatives, and researchers identified a set of child outcomes and agreed upon measurement techniques. This section also describes why child outcomes may be affected by adult-focused welfare programs, describes the conceptual model and common set of constructs, and describes several approaches to studying child well-being and  the strengths and weakness of each approach. Section 2 presents the common core of constructs, including the rationales and sample questions to assess outcomes related to: (1) family income; (2) employment; (3) family formation and dissolution; (4) mother's psychological well-being; (5) absent parent involvement; (6) stability and turbulence; (7) consumption; (8) use of health and human services; (9) child care; (10) home environment and parenting practices; (11) children's education; (12) children's health and safety; and (13) children's social and emotional adjustment.

This report presents the results of a questionnaire study, undertaken by the European Forum for Child Welfare (EFCW), which investigated at a grass roots level the presence of working children in European countries. Information was obtained through a questionnaire sent to non-governmental child welfare organizations, all EFCW members, to determine how the network of child welfare organizations deals with working children and their awareness of the issue. Chapter 1 of the report presents relevant definitions, focusing on legal differentiations made among child labor, work, and employment. Chapter  2 considers the state of international law concerning child work and the protection of the work of children. Chapter 3 examines the state of ratification of the main international pieces of legislation related to working children and includes a table delineating the national education and child labor legislation for European Union countries. Chapter 4 contains case studies for the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, and Portugal to illustrate different approaches used to deal with working children. The report concludes that children in Europe work in both exploitative and beneficial situations. Finally, the report includes recommendations for systematic research on several aspects of child work, eradication of all forms of hazardous and exploitative child work, careful differentiation between  the usefulness of international instruments articulating universal principles and the need for flexible and relativist programmatic approaches.

The major goals of the program were to promote effective use of health services by mothers and their infants and to enhance infant development. The intervention program consisted of home visiting, a parent-infant developmental playgroup, and a parent support group designed to improve parenting skills and maternal social competence. This training model and curriculum from the program create a comprehensive instruction course to prepare lay home visitors for facilitating healthy changes in behaviors of high risk mothers. The training curriculum is designed for a 45-day intensive training program over a 9-week period.  Following an introduction to the training, the curriculum units for home visitors (parent support specialists) cover: (1) communication and relationship-building skills; (2) coping with stress and problem solving and decision making; (3) helping clients build self-esteem and deal with feelings; (4) using curriculum support materials; (5) working with families; (6) cultural diversity/ethnicity among families; (7) postpartum care and planning; (8) family planning options; (9) infant feeding and nutrition; (10) health care in the first year; (11) child growth and development; (12) identifying family needs and accessing community resources; (13) managing home visits; (14) child growth and development--birth to 1 month; (15) 1 to 4 months; (16) 4 to 8 months; (17) 8 to 12 months; (18) 1 to 2  years; (19) children in violent circumstances; (20) behavior and discipline; (21) health promotion for families; (22) maintaining personal safety; (23) substance abuse; and (24) evaluation and closing ceremony.

The statistical portrait is based on 12 indicators of well-being: (1) infant mortality; (2) low birth weight births; (3) immunizations; (4) child poverty; (5) early prenatal care; (6) child abuse deaths; (7) health insurance; (8) paternity establishment; (9) teen births; (10) teen suicide rate; (11) youth unemployment; and (12) high school graduations. The report begins with a discussion of the major results. The bulk of the report details county- and state-level demographic, economic, health, education, and safety data. County-level trends for data are indicated where appropriate, based on 1991, 1994, and 1996 data. Additional information on school enrollment, child abuse and  neglect, and teen suicide is also included. Findings indicate that since 1990, only 1 of the 12 indicators (infant mortality) has met the decade goal, but that progress has been made toward meeting seven goals. Fifteen percent of Colorado's children live in poverty. About 25 percent of infants are born to unwed mothers and 10 percent to teen mothers. Over 80 percent of women who gave birth in 1996 received early prenatal care. The low birth weight rate continues to rise and is one of the worst in the nation. However, the infant mortality rate is on the decline. Over 90 percent of Colorado's licensed child care facilities were ranked poor or mediocre. The high school graduation rate is still well below the state's goal. (KB)",

        "description":"This Kids Count report examines statewide and county trends in the well-being of Colorado's children. The statistical portrait is based on 12 indicators of well-being: (1) infant mortality; (2) low birth weight births; (3) immunizations; (4) child poverty; (5) early prenatal care; (6) child abuse deaths; (7) health insurance; (8) paternity establishment; (9) teen births; (10) teen suicide rate; (11) youth unemployment; and (12) high school graduations. The report begins with a discussion of progress toward the Decade of the Child goals set for the year 2000. The bulk of the report details county- and state-level demographic, economic, health, education, and safety data. County-level trends for data are indicated where appropriate, based on 1991, 1994, and 1997 data. The report's  findings indicate that infant mortality, early prenatal care, percentage of young children who are fully immunized, paternity establishment, the number of children dying from abuse or neglect, teen birth rate, and teen suicide rate have all shown improvement since 1990. Low birth weight births and high school graduation rates have worsened during the 1990s. (KB)",

The Partnership Project provides a series of technical assistance resources and materials to support the development and strengthening of public-private partnerships to improve the quality and supply of child care. The guide is designed to provide practical information on creating and maintaining public-private child care partnerships, and draws from the experiences and wisdom of successful partnership leaders at the national, state, and local levels. The guide begins with a definition of public-private partnerships, followed by a summary of why they are created and what public-private partnerships can do. The guide then presents a set of principles and strategies for  establishing and maintaining successful partnerships based on lessons from successful national, state, and local models. The guide asserts that successful partnerships: (1) have clear goals; (2) aim to achieve positive results and regularly measure their progress; (3) involve families and include them when developing programs and services; (4) are broad-based and include key stakeholders from the beginning; (5) involve powerful champions and make their initiatives visible to the public; (6) establish clear governance structures that define partner roles and responsibilities; (7) set and adhere to a set of ground rules that guide the partnership in its work; (8) are flexible, adopt an entrepreneurial mindset, and adapt to changing conditions and resources; (9) enable all partners to  benefit by drawing on their strengths and contributions; and (10) work to maintain momentum and to sustain their work over time.

The booklet is divided into two sections. Section 1 describes the Reception Year Pilot Project and discusses how young children, the people who care for them, and organizations working in ECD can become involved in the project. (The &quot;reception year&quot; is defined as the first year of formal schooling.) Issues addressed in the first section include implementation of the reception year and distribution of project funds in five areas: (1) subsidies for community-based ECD services; (2) contracts for ECD training organizations;  (3) accreditation of ECD practitioners working in the services that are involved in the project; (4) development of the interim policy for ECD into a final policy; and (5) a publicity and information campaign. Section 2 provides a bigger picture of policy development for national education and training, introducing the National Qualifications Framework and explaining how ECD fits into that framework. Information in both sections is presented as a discussion between a person from the National Educare Forum (producers of the booklet) and a group of parents and ECD practitioners. (EV)",

Part 1 examines the new approach being established as the foundation of the country's education and training system: outcomes-based education (OBE). The section explains OBE and describes how it will be applied through the NQF. Part 2 discusses the process of developing standards for the accreditation of ECD practitioners. The process will set up and test interim standards and interim accreditation in the short term, with the aim of developing final policy on standards and guidelines for accreditation of ECD practitioners.  Topics covered in this section include proposals about: the levels of qualifications for ECD practitioners, the level descriptors for each of the qualification levels, the kinds of qualifications that are needed for ECD, a framework for unit standards, and methods of assessment.

        "description":"Until recently, fathers were the hidden parents in research on children's well-being. Research stimulated by the new interest in fathers suggests that fathers' involvement in their children's schools does make a difference in their children's education. Using data from the 1996 National Household Education Survey (NHES:96), this Digest looks at the extent of father involvement in two-parent and in single-parent families, explores the types of involvement, and discusses the link between fathers' involvement and kindergartners' through 12th-graders' school performance. Findings noted include the following: (1) fathers in two-parent families are less likely than mothers in two-parent families to be highly involved in their children's schools; (2) fathers and mothers who head  single-parent families are virtually identical in their level of involvement, and it is quite similar to that of mothers in two-parent families; (3) fathers in two-parent families are more likely to attend school or class events or general school meetings than they are to attend parent-teacher conferences or to volunteer at their children's schools. Findings also indicated that in two-parent households, children are more likely to do well academically, to participate in extracurricular activities, and to enjoy school and are less likely to have ever repeated a grade or to have been suspended or expelled if their fathers have high as opposed to low involvement in their schools. This finding was also true in father-only households, allowing that children living in single-parent households  are, on average, less successful in school and experience more behavior problems than children living in two-parent households. The Digest concludes by noting that the low participation of fathers in two-parent families offers schools an opportunity to increase overall parental involvement by targeting fathers, and that fathers can be a positive force in their children's education.

        "description":"Educators commonly recommend that children born during the summer months, especially boys, be given an extra year to mature before entering kindergarten so that they will not suffer from the academic disadvantages of being among the youngest children in a class. Terms such as &quot;academic red-shirting&quot; and &quot;graying of the kindergarten&quot; have been invented to describe the practice and effects of holding children back from kindergarten. This Spanish-language Digest asserts that research cited in support of delayed entrance, however, is meager and somewhat contradictory. Results of a study comparing a group of summer-born children who delayed school entrance to a group who entered kindergarten on time (matched for intelligence) indicated that boys with summer birth dates tended to be  advantaged academically by postponing entrance; the advantage was greatest in reading. The Digest asserts that such small-scale studies need to be replicated before educators can make informed recommendations about optimum kindergarten entrance age. The Digest notes that affluent parents tend to hold out their summer-born children more often than do low socioeconomic status parents, causing children at academic risk from poverty factors to face the additional hurdle of being compared to advantaged children who are 12 to 15 months older. The Digest concludes by noting that academic achievement is only one piece of the school entrance age puzzle, and that blanket recommendations to hold back one group of children only serve to change who will be part of the youngest group. The Digest  recommends that educators and parents consider the individual child when making entrance age decisions. (EV)",

        "description":"Research has shown a decline in motivation and performance for many children as they move from elementary school into middle school; however, research has also shown that the nature of motivational change on entry to middle school depends on characteristics of the learning environment in which students find themselves. This Digest outlines some suggestions for middle school teachers and administrators for enhancing student motivation and discusses three theories that are currently prominent and that have particular relevance for young adolescent students and their teachers. Attribution theory emphasizes that students' perceptions of their educational experiences generally influence their motivation more than the objective reality of those experiences. Through instructional  practices, teachers can unknowingly communicate a range of attitudes about whether ability is fixed or modifiable and convey their expectations for individual students. Goal theory focuses on the reasons students perceive for achieving: a task goal orientation represents the belief that the purpose of achieving is personal improvement and understanding; an ability goal orientation represents the belief that the purpose of achieving is the demonstration of ability. Studies find that the adoption of task goals is associated with more adaptive patterns of learning than is the adoption of ability goals. A third motivational theory of importance for middle school educators is self- determination theory. This theory describes students as having three categories of needs: needing a sense of  competence, of relatedness to others, and of autonomy. Most of the research focuses on the last of these three needs. Within the classroom, autonomy needs could be addressed through allowing student choice and input on classroom decision making. It is important to recognize that supporting student autonomy does not require major upheaval in the classroom or that teachers relinquish the management of students' behavior. Even small opportunities for choice can increase students' sense of self-determination. (LPP)",

        "description":"Young adolescents entering high school look forward to having more choices and making new and more friends; however, they also are concerned about being picked on and teased by older students, having harder work, making lower grades, and getting lost in a larger, unfamiliar school. For middle school students, including those who have been labeled &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;high-achieving,&quot; the transition into high school can be an unpleasant experience. This Digest discusses how educators can ease students' transition into high school by providing challenging and supportive middle school environments and by providing well-designed transition programs. These programs should include activities that provide information to students and parents, activities that provide social support, and  activities that bring middle and high school educators together. Finally, the importance of parents being involved in their young adolescent students' transition from middle to high school can hardly be overestimated, and parent involvement in the transition process can be encouraged through a variety of activities, including conferences with the high school counselors and school visits.

Among the main causal factors analyzed are human capital (education and work experience), labor market segmentation, gender, social class position, level of development/modernization, and concentration of land ownership. Data on individuals employed in the agricultural sector (including livestock production) were drawn from Brazilian National Household Sample Surveys for 1973, 1982, and 1988. Contrary to previous reports, the impacts of both schooling and work experience on the earnings of the farm labor force were found to be positive and very large. Level of development or modernization did not affect the relationship between human capital and earnings. However, structural variables  such as agricultural modernization and social class did have direct and independent effects on earnings. Up until 1982, the positive effect of agricultural modernization on earnings was greater than the negative effect of concentrated land ownership; after 1982, the latter exceeded the former. With regard to public policy, the findings suggest that investment in the rural labor force's human capital would increase agricultural productivity, and that agricultural land distribution may be useful in Brazil for purely economic reasons, if not others.

A dual labor market perspective argues that the labor market is structured into primary and secondary sectors (&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; jobs), that mobility between sectors is very limited, and that placement in either sector is related to structural inequalities. Substantial evidence suggests that labor market characteristics are influenced by location (urban versus rural). High School and Beyond data on approximately 15,000 young adults who graduated from high school in 1982 and were followed up through 1992 were analyzed to examine the relationships among workforce experiences,  educational attainment, and various sociodemographic indicators. Results indicate that most people with a bachelor's degree or higher worked in primary sector jobs, while few individuals with a high school diploma or less held such jobs. However, access to primary sector jobs was also determined by urban-rural location, U.S. region, race/ethnicity, and gender. People who attended a rural high school, people from the South, Blacks, Hispanics, and females were more likely to work in the secondary labor market. Compared to those in primary sector jobs, persons working in the secondary sector had lower income, more spells of unemployment, more job training, and lower job satisfaction.

Busing policy choices have been made and expanded without regard to the impact on the central enterprise of schools, which is student learning. Anecdotes from Montana, the Navajo Reservation, West Virginia, and Colorado are presented to describe long bus rides and the hardships that accompany them. Research on busing is reviewed and found to be scarce and insubstantial. Two of the most recent researchers have found that busing could be considered exploitation of children's time, and that students with large average times on buses report lower grades, poorer levels of fitness, fewer social activities, and poor study  habits. Knowing more about the effects of busing might lead to better choices about closing, maintaining, or opening new schools in rural areas. Three questions are recommended for further research: what is the impact of long bus rides (over 30 minutes each way) on children's success in school? what is the effect of long bus rides on families? and what are the true costs of long bus rides for school districts? Riding the bus should not be just a 12-year task that children endure, but one that makes sense as an integral part of their successful and full education. (TD)",

Despite the trappings of equality, the system is failing to teach Native American children the essential skills of reading, writing, math, and thinking. The mission in Indian education is to enable each child to reach full potential in spirit, mind, and body by providing essential skills and ensuring that all students achieve or surpass national norms and standards. Fifteen steps are outlined that are necessary to achieve this mission. The first step is to meet students' basic needs, including cleanliness and hunger. Second, physical fitness should be emphasized by establishing programs such as 50 Mile Clubs. Third and fourth, accountability of school boards must increase, and racism must end.  Fifth, school leadership must be improved. Suggested techniques include showing inspirational movies at schools and holding rallies with students. The sixth step would be to change the elementary system so that the same teacher teaches the same children from kindergarten through third grade. Seventh, students should be taught metacognitive strategies such as how to manage time and how to study. Classroom instruction should also be improved. Eighth and ninth steps involve connecting the classroom to the real world and improving reading skills. Steps 10 and 11 would improve special education services and use technology wisely. Step 12 calls for ending corporal punishment and reporting child abuse. Thirteenth, staff housing should no longer be segregated, but integrated into the community at  large. As a 14th step, every school district serving Native American students must establish a private nonprofit educational foundation so that private moneys can be raised to counter cuts in Indian education funding. The 15th step in educational reform is to practice accountability in time and finances. (CDS)",

The project took place at Chamberlain Elementary School in Goshen, Indiana, in 1998-99. The school enrolls about 314 students, of whom approximately 94 are from Spanish-dominant homes. Case studies of four ESL students illustrate certain themes: low proficiency in both English and Spanish, rebellion against traditional female roles, use of curanderas (traditional healers), importance of knowing students' family situations, and family support of academic success. A literature review focused on the process of acculturation, Hispanic parent involvement in the education process, and education in Mexico.  Project surveys asked parents about their educational experiences, their home activities, and their communications with the school, and asked ESL students to write a paragraph explaining how they were able to succeed in school. The project helped teachers to understand reasons for some discouraging student behaviors and to avoid assumptions regarding parents' English language proficiency. Teachers came to realize that cultural differences affect the ways in which students and parents react to the school system. Teachers were encouraged by the fact that many parents face difficulties, yet still support their children's education. Contains 48 references, the parent survey, and figures. (CDS)",

        "description":"The basic assumptions of a society bear directly on the kinds of schooling and education that it has, including the ways that it develops or beleaguers academic talent. In the United States, the pervasive influence of capitalism, which is predicated on limitless growth, tends to equate affluence with academic talent. By imagining futures for gifted students that mirror the aspirations of the affluent and elite, the field of gifted education is complicit in the economic and cultural impoverishment of rural areas by encouraging gifted rural students to leave their communities, which are viewed as backward and impoverished. American society equates job-holding with work, and separates work from play, so that achieving happiness through work is denied. This contrasts with  Csikszentmihalyi's concept of &quot;flow,&quot; a feeling of well-being experienced when absorbed in the care and attention given to work. Key points to consider in regard to rural gifted education and keeping gifted kids in rural areas include: concentrate on academic talent, defined as careful reading, clear writing, and mathematics through statistics and calculus; help gifted kids finish 13 years of schooling in 10 or less; discount the value of a college education; stop promoting the pursuit of happiness and promote the pursuit of real work; consider what the good life means to you; understand the meanings of rural in your place; and promote the good life in your own place as a rural work.

        "description":"This annotated bibliography is a response to teachers' concerns about choosing culturally sensitive and historically accurate books about American Indians and Alaska Natives. It contains critical annotations and evaluations of approximately 1,000 books, most published 1960-93, and points out controversial titles and disagreements about specific books. The focus is primarily on materials for elementary and secondary students but also includes publications of interest to the general public. Sections are organized by culture area--General, Southwest, Northwest Coast, California, Plateau, Arctic, Plains, Great Basin, Subarctic, Northeast, and Southeast--and each area is further organized by tribe and then divided into nonfiction, fiction, biographies, and traditional stories. Within  each section, entries are listed alphabetically by author and include publisher, publishing date, and number of pages. Broad reading-level categories are indicated as lower elementary, upper elementary, secondary, or adult. The annotations note books' strengths and weaknesses. Highly recommended books are given a star, questionable books a question mark. In an attempt to assist teachers and parents in making informed choices for their students and children, the introduction offers 17 questions that provide a framework for evaluating books on American Indians and Alaska Natives, 4 common examples of stereotypical representations, a discussion of words that reflect bias or prejudice, a recommended reference series, and 11 additional resources.

This report summarizes data for fiscal year 1997 on federal programs authorized through Titles I, II, IV, VI, and VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and through the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Most of the report is concerned with Title I programs, operated in 592 of Ohio's 611 school districts. In fiscal 1997, Title I programs served 296,202 students who lived in low-income families, institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or foster homes, as well as 2,953 migrant students in preschool and grades K-12. Details are provided on federal funding, institutional participation, student participation by  institutional type and grade span, instructional services, student performance on state proficiency tests, expenditure patterns, teachers and staff, professional development, parent involvement, and successes. Profiles describe: (1) Title II, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which funded training for over 38,000 educators; (2) Title IV, Safe Drug-Free Schools, which funded prevention and intervention programs; (3) Title VI, Innovative Assistance Program, which encourages comprehensive education reform; (4) Title VII, Lau Resource Center, which funded services for immigrant students and those with limited English proficiency; and (5) education for homeless children and youth.

        "description":"This paper introduces important issues in the psychological and vocational assessment of Native Americans in schools, mental health clinics, counseling centers, and rehabilitation programs. A primary concern is to conduct such assessment in a fair and unbiased manner. Various methods are used to gather information: interviewing the client, family members, and acquaintances; reviewing client records; observing the client in real-life situations; and using norm-referenced or criterion-referenced tests. Specialist evaluations include medical, psychological, social, educational, and vocational assessment. Aspects of vocational assessment are work evaluation, work adjustment strategies, and job tryouts. Psychological assessment may be based on an etic perspective, which emphasizes  universals among human beings, or an emic (culture-specific) perspective. Strategies and difficulties in using these perspectives with Native Americans are discussed. The assessment of acculturation to the general U.S. society is an important first step before using standardized tests or procedures. General issues in assessment of Native Americans include language differences and reading level, nonverbal communication, client beliefs and mistrust, evaluator-client similarity, client acculturation, translation of tests, and potential bias in standardized tests. Cultural issues in clinical diagnosis and personality assessment are discussed, and various instruments are described: projective instruments, inkblot and figure drawing techniques, and standard personality inventories. Also  discussed are assessments of alcohol usage; intelligence and cognitive functioning; and interests, abilities, and aptitudes. Contains 58 references. (SV)",

        "description":"In 1998, the British Columbia Teachers' Federation (BCTF) appointed an eight-member task force to investigate the effectiveness of the education system for First Nations students. The task force report and recommendations are intended to serve several groups of Aboriginal students: First Nations students, with or without status under Canada's Indian Act, who live on or off reserves in rural and urban areas, as well as Metis students. Many Aboriginal students are not achieving success in the public schools, for reasons related to the history of Canada's treatment of Aboriginal peoples, to poverty, and to the failure of public schools to value indigenous cultures. The task force recognizes that each child has a gift that must be looked for and nurtured. To contribute to the success  of Aboriginal students, the task force proposed numerous recommendations to the BCTF. Each is accompanied by a supporting statement and the outcome in the 1999 BCTF annual general meeting. Recommendations are in six categories: those specific to BCTF goals and programs, development of teacher awareness and commitment, school support for Aboriginal students, culturally relevant curriculum and materials, elimination of racism in schools, and funding and governance (involvement of Aboriginal parents and communities). An appendix, &quot;Summary Report of Selected First Nations Education Documents&quot; (Deborah Jeffrey), reviews seven reports on Aboriginal education in Canada, published 1967-98. (SV)",

This book examines difficulties encountered by Mexican-origin students--one of the fastest growing minority groups--and describes why some schools fall short and how others have improved student outcomes. The focus throughout the book is on positive changes that school staff, families, community, and students can make. Each chapter uses a different lens--culture, language, gender, family and community, and social and political context--to examine issues and challenges affecting first- and second-generation Mexican American children. Chapters are: (1) The Mexican American Student Population: Growth and Diversity (demography, immigration, academic achievement,  innovative programs); (2) Cultural Perspectives on Learning (cultural influences on classroom organization and achievement, child rearing, parent education programs); (3) Language, Literacy, and Creating Bridges to Success (the bilingual education controversy, learning English, maintaining Spanish, special needs of migrant students); (4) Gender Issues in Mexican American Schooling (sex role attitudes, teen pregnancy, school factors, peers); (5) Creating Family-School Partnerships (family poverty, parent-school relationship, parent involvement, community outreach, successful programs); and (6) Political, Social, and Pedagogical Issues Impacting Early Childhood Education and Public Schools (immigration and education policy, politics of early childhood education, teacher training, intergroup  relations).

An introduction discusses legislative authority for consultation; lists dates, locations, and local contacts for 13 regional meetings; and outlines formats for meetings and for submitting written comments. Item 1 concerns tribal application for construction of replacement educational facilities. The BIA developed a streamlined  application and instructions and specific criteria for ranking applications on the basis of need. An alternative funding scheme for facilities construction is also described, involving long-term financial partnerships with the federal government. BIA sources of technical assistance are listed. Item 2 is open for discussion of any topic, but suggested topics are the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and how to obtain an appropriate tribal governing body for BIA off-reservation boarding schools that wish to convert to tribal-school status. Item 3 discusses possible expansion of the Family and Child Education Programs to include all BIA-funded schools.

The work of cultural anthropologists, and more recently science educators, points to the role of individual world views in the learning of science concepts. A world view is one's fundamental assumptions and presuppositions concerning perceptions of reality. The purpose of this ethnographic investigation was to shed light on the dynamic interaction of individual world views within an elementary science methods course in relation to understanding science and nature and how these presuppositions influence individuals' view of science teaching. The subjects for this study were 30 students  enrolled in a science methods course at Temple University. Ten of these students participated in the interviews reported here. The outcomes of this investigation revealed that students do not view themselves as part of science or nature. The investigation also uncovered students' views of the self, nonself, relationship, and causality that affect their learning and view of science teaching. This investigation provides further demonstration of the influence of world views and the interplay of those views with the notion of scientific literacy. Contains 47 references. (Author/CCM)",

The discourse of the seminar was examined with an eye to discerning the way in which instructors interacted with participants to help them learn to interpret the videotapes of reformed classrooms differently. After describing research methodology and theoretical orientation,  four vignettes from the seminar were analyzed in which facilitative moves were made for the purpose of helping administrators attend differently to the events depicted on the classroom videotapes.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if the moral voices of care and justice, as described by C. Gilligan (1982), would be expressed in the solutions to environmental dilemmas selected by 7th grade students. A further goal was to determine if those voices were differentially expressed by girls and boys, and if that difference was related to gender alone or to gender role orientation. The Environmental Dilemmas Measure of Moral Orientation Survey presented 281 urban school students with 9 environmental dilemmas and 2 response items, each resulting in 18 items and 2 subscales, one designed to measure the care orientation in response to environmental situations, the other designed to elicit the justice orientation. Results showed that the three-item care scale was strongly  associated with the female participants in the study, lending support to the extension of Gilligan's theory into the area of environmental science. When controlled for gender role orientation, the association of the care voice with sex was eliminated. The feminine gender role orientation was the stronger determinant of the care voice for the participants of this study. Environmental education is being integrated into an increasing number of science curricula. If consistent gender differences are found in the evaluation of environmental dilemmas, it will be important for educators to be aware of these differences so that they can teach to each student's strengths, and consider them when designing programs and assessments.

The models proposed were a combination of &quot;exploratory&quot; and &quot;expressive&quot; activities. Students constructed spreadsheet models guided by paper-based worksheets. They were asked to construct graphs relating variables of the model and to investigate the effects of varying different parameters, corresponding to different physical situations.

The study concludes that: (1) teachers were accepting of examining and even embracing new conceptions of science, but clung to their prior conceptions of science when pressed with uncertainty in a teaching situation; (2) teachers understood the notion of knowledge construction but did not have a clear understanding of the process; and (3) teachers perceived the alignment of science curriculum to national  standards to be a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating process.

This report is intended primarily for science teachers; hence, the results presented relate directly to student performance, classroom practices, and school climate. This report also discusses students' attitudes and beliefs about science. The report is divided into four parts. In the first part (chapter 1), an overview of the assessment is provided. This includes information about the framework used in the development of the  assessment, a description of how the assessmet was administered to students, and an explanation of how to interpret NAEP results. In the second part (chapters 2, 3, and 4), examples of questions and student responses are presented. These chapters are divided by grade. The third part (chapters 5 and 6) contains information collected from students, teachers, and school administrators about classroom practices, student motivation, and parental involvement in learning. Finally, the fourth part contains appendices offering a fuller description of the procedures used for the NAEP 1996 science assessment (appendix A), scoring guides for questions discussed in chapters 2, 3, and 4 (appendix B), and standard errors for the statistics presented in the report (appendix C).

That is the initial inquiry for this pilot ethnographic study of African American fifth graders in an urban public school. The study sets out to show how children are engaged in a class set up to understand science and mathematics. Themes emerging from fieldnotes suggest that children are more engaged when they are the presenter, when they work in cooperative groups, when they are solving open-ended problems, and when they play critical thinking games such as Project Zero's Starting Block. As the study unfolds, the theme of self-selected, science presentations stands out. When examined more closely, the self-selected presentations reveal four ways in which 5th grade presenters  involve other children in their presentations. Thus, the study explores methods children use to involve their audiences. One implication of the findings is that kids teaching kids gives them another way of showing what they know and building new understanding. (Author/CCM)",

Each organization is at the same time also cross-referenced with other relevant sectoral chapters, indicated by keywords at the bottom of an entry. An overall sectoral index, combining the various cross references, ensures easy access to the information in this section. The third part consists of sections of resource material focusing on youth and children's issues, including publications, electronic information resources, and international and Southern African charters and conventions.

A major research question guiding the study was: what are the characteristics of an elementary classroom that values civic participation? The assertion generated from the findings and attentive to this question was that in classrooms where democratic elements such as providing student choice, shared responsibility and decision making, and opportunities for student civic participation are present, students begin to accept more responsibility for their immediate community. The cross case analyses of the data from each classroom indicated that the strength to which the civil characteristics exist may depend on classroom structure, use of a  common vocabulary, and repetition of structure, characteristics, and vocabulary.

Analyzing the Bill of Rights and how the Supreme Court has interpreted challenges is an exercise that incorporates citizenship education, offers insight into judicial decision making, and utilizes primary sources. For example, using the web site, &quot;Supreme Court Cases by Topic,&quot; students can use keywords such as &quot;cruel and unusual,&quot;&quot;search and seizure,&quot;&quot;free press,&quot; or &quot;free speech&quot; to find a list of cases in the database that deal with those topics. Versions of Supreme Court cases can be accessed quickly. In a few pages, the facts of the case are outlined, the decision is explained, and the majority  opinion is given. The Court considers the Constitution, the intent of the framers, precedent, and in the case of the Amendment, the evolving standards of justice. After discussing the students' views of the case in question, they can examine the case to see what the Court decided and on what constitutional basis the justices made their decision. After the students have been introduced to the judicial side of the issue, the class can review the legislative side and use the background they gained from studying cases to assess pending legislation. When they have completed their evaluations of legislation under consideration, they can write to their representatives to express their views and urge their congressmen to vote appropriately.

Controversy over the statute and its powers has not been resolved; the lesson discusses several questions surrounding the controversy.

The monograph describes and presents facts about some of Enda-Tiers Monde's programs and activities. It explains that Enda's teams work closely with local people in elaborating and carrying out programs in the belief that it is the young and the poor themselves (who normally have no say) who should conceive and carry out their own development strategies. According to the bulletin, Enda is attempting to redefine attitudes and approaches to  work, learning, and environmental preservation, and is now carrying its activities to other countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The bulletin suggests that Enda Tiers-Monde's alternative approaches to today's world of globalization, urban expansion, economic instability, and fast demographic growth are of particular relevance to all those seeking an appropriate and equitable future for the countries of the southern hemisphere.

An important gauge of curricular frameworks, content standards, instructional materials, and pedagogical practices considers whether these concepts are amply and effectively addressed in the curriculum and classroom. Effectiveness in teaching these core concepts is enhanced by collaboration and partnerships between liberal democracies and by international partnerships in civic education such as those initiated by CIVITAS (an  international civic education exchange program).

        "description":"Currently, the question is how the best of human values can be instilled in young people living in the midst of a mobile, media-bombarded, and changing society. Predictably, about every 20 years, the same challenge of teaching values or the virtues of human character is laid at the door of the school. The new &quot;Partnership in Character Education Pilot Projects&quot; awarded to the Departments of Education of 10 states provide the opportunity to design and pilot long-term character education projects. Knowledge from the fields of human development and social psychology enlightens the character education challenge. Human behavior is a product of the interaction of the person with an environment. Children who live in caring families demonstrate more confidence than those living in  neglectful homes. Moreover, behavior changes when the environment is changed. Thousands of schools that have been re-culturing their school environments with the caring community process known as the Tribes Learning Community (TLC) indicate outcomes that support using this character education approach. Respect for social and cultural diversity increases, discipline problems decrease, students demonstrate greater participation, cooperation, and kindness. This year the Tribes Learning Community process was recognized by &quot;The President's Initiative on Race, One America in the 21st Century&quot; as a &quot;promising practice to build a more just and more united American community, offering opportunity and fairness for all Americans.&quot; TLC process components are outlined.

        "description":"In the formal settings of universities, all academics regulate themselves constantly, including how and when they laugh. This paper considers the matter of pleasure and women's scholastic and pedagogical work, and how it has come to be understood. The paper explores the idea that pleasure is taken &quot;within reason,&quot; drawing on Michel Foucault's (1985) work to examine the relationship between feelings such as pleasure and modes of rationality. It then moves to situate pleasure within a western historical tradition, noting how pleasure-as-fun has been framed outside bourgeois traditions of conduct, including subversive traditions. Carnival is examined more precisely as a site of fun whose remembering could be productive for women in the academy. Mary Russo's &quot;The Female Grotesque&quot;  (1994) is used to elaborate this point. The fact that fun so often eludes feminism as an academic performance is then explored more fully using two exemplars from feminist writing. Also the author comments on Camille Paglia's (1995) idea that &quot;all roads from Rousseau lead to Sade.&quot; The reader is brought to consider the value of playful irony for academic women, arguing for a reconsideration of its legitimacy alongside, not instead of, advocacy.

The study included 61 high schools in 23 provinces representing the 7 geographic regions of Turkey. Through a survey questionnaire, teachers and students were asked their perceptions of the textbooks. Then a sub-sample of the teachers and students were interviewed to collect more in-depth data on their assessment of the textbooks. The results indicated that the textbooks assist teachers in instructional planning and in preparing examinations. However, the books were found to be ineffective to some degree in terms of physical aspects, content presentation and organization, language, teaching and learning aids, and impact on students. The textbooks  focus mostly on transmission of knowledge. The texts were found to be ineffective in leading students to read the information with an interest, to develop an understanding of the content area, to develop thinking skills, and to foster positive attitudes toward the subject.

        "author":["Bembenutty, Hefer"],
        "description":"A study examined college students' academic delay of gratification, that is, their preference for an immediately available option (go to a concert the day before a test) or a delayed alternative (stay home studying for a test). Differential explanations of academic delay of gratification between task, performance approach, and performance-avoid goal-oriented college students (n=102) also were examined, as well as their motivational tendencies and use of volitional strategies. Results showed that differences between task, performance-approach, and performance-avoid goal-oriented college students are highly related to their different motivational tendencies and use of volitional strategies. Goal orientation of mastery and understanding academic tasks is related to students'  preference for activities that would facilitate attainment of long-term academic goals. Likewise, competing for grade is related to greater preference for delay of gratification to secure long-term academic achievement. In contrast, having a performance-avoid goal orientation is associated with the high value of the delay alternatives but at the same time with little use of volitional strategies. Further, task engagement for the sake of mastering the task or for the sake of showing ability and skills is associated with thinking and considering long-term goals. In contrast, avoiding task engagement is associated with learners' short-term thinking that will preclude them from delaying gratification, which in turn is necessary for long-term academic success.

        "description":"A study explored the process of collective identity development and related social-psychological factors among the Arab-Palestinian students in Israeli universities. The purpose was not only to explore the content or structure of collective identity among this national minority, but more importantly, to understand collective identity as a developmental process which is one of the most dominant among Arab-Palestinian youth in the university. Two sets of in-depth interviews with purposefully selected samples of Palestinian student activists were conducted in the summer of 1996 and the fall of 1997. The five main themes that emerged from the first round of interviews provided the bases of the study's second phase which included more structured interviews with another sample of  student activists. Cross-case analysis was conducted on the transcripts by grouping together answers and comments from different participants regarding the same topic. Identification of categories and themes from the first set of interviews followed the procedure of Glaser and Strauss' (1967) grounded theory development. The second round of interviews probed more in depth into emerging themes; triangulation and validation of these themes was provided by using content analyses of over 1500 documents collected from the field and participant observation. The following main themes were identified in the first phase: collective identity achieved; inequality and group relative deprivation; party identification, membership and commitment; nationalism and feminism in the women's voices; and  personal and social development of activists.

The paper first discusses how experienced and novice art teachers may vary in their thinking and approaches to instructional content. It then focuses on the results of a project that investigated curriculum development and teacher thinking through the use of concept maps. The paper notes that concept maps, often used to visually represent the relationship between ideas, may provide a way of understanding, extending, and assessing art teachers' perceptions of the relationships among art content, pedagogical strategies, student learning, and other factors that influence teaching. By comparing the varying conceptions of teaching held by beginning and experienced  teachers, the paper suggests ways of enriching approaches to art teacher preparation.

Using the membership list of professional organizations, questionnaires were sent to individuals with 25 years or more in social studies; 43 responded  directly to the survey and offered insights. Findings included identification of changes in social studies such as the inclusion of multicultural/global/gender related education within the scope of social studies programs; the impact of the &quot;New Social Studies&quot; as a whole or the identification of specific changes in curriculum content that emerged from these initiatives; issues related to standards, testing, assessment and evaluation of students and teachers; and inclusion of technology as a teaching tool in social studies programs.

        "author":["Rury, John L."],
        "description":"James Bryant Conant issued his famous report, &quot;The American High School Today,&quot; in 1959, giving voice to a clear and influential reaffirmation of the comprehensive secondary school. Conant's vision in this, and in another work, &quot;Slums and Suburbs&quot; (1961) makes an interesting point of departure for consideration of the forces that have shaped the U.S. high school in the latter half of the 20th century. This paper discusses Conant's ideas and addresses just how these ideas have been treated by history. First the paper provides the historical context of the post World War II United States, and then it examines in depth the questions of race and the comprehensive high school; the rise of a youth culture; and high schools, youth, and the changing urban economy. The paper assesses how  the changing social and economic context of postwar U.S. society changed the prospects for success of the comprehensive high school. It concludes that a number of historical developments converged in the decades following the Second World War to make James Conant's vision of the high school problematic, at least in the nation's large metropolitan areas. It also questions what the best institutional arrangement is for the great variety of U.S. youth to be educated in the coming century.

        "description":"A study examined the extent and significance of organizational learning in international development agencies (IDAs) concerning gender and education; the manner in which IDAs learn; and the factors that create obstacles to learning. Research was divided into four steps: (1) tracing the relevant academic literature on organizational change; (2) contacting consultancy firms in the field and obtaining a selection of reports from organizations that have developed learning strategies; (3) analyzing agency reports and projects to trace their conceptions of development and the provision of development assistance materials; and (4) interviewing personnel in selected IDAs. A group of two bilateral and three multilateral agencies was contacted, and data were obtained by means of  semi-structured interviews with persons covering a variety of roles and responsibilities. Agency visits were limited to 3-4 days. The case study on organizational learning in girls' education took researchers through an examination of policies, structures, processes, and cultural norms. Much of the transformation in IDAs to address girls' education, and gender in general, has come from outside sources and outside pressure rather than through the internal realization that some elements in development assistance were missing. Training has been provided on gender, but it has been short and voluntary. So far, the kind of learning that goes on in IDAs emphasizes improving practices and refining rules and procedures rather than questioning the principles in use. Contains 5 notes and 18  references.

        "author":["Beauboeuf, Tamara M."],
        "description":"An exploratory, interview-based qualitative study explored the self-concepts of culturally relevant women teachers. Few studies have taken an explicitly psychological approach toward understanding these teachers and their pedagogy. It was expected that this study would offer insight into how a particular pedagogy might be rooted in a specific psychological world view and not simply in an individual teacher's personal preferences or experiences. Data collection consisted of three rounds of individual life-history interviews with six African American women who taught in northeastern urban junior and high schools. &quot;Purposeful sampling&quot; was engaged in by locating potential participants from the African American members of the social justice, curriculum development, and teacher  training organization, &quot;Facing History and Ourselves.&quot; Teachers were mixed in age and teaching experience. Analysis employed the Listener's Guide (Brown and Gilligan, 1990), a feminist interpretive tool that approaches interviews as &quot;texts&quot; and directs the researcher to read the texts for the viewpoints or &quot;voices&quot; they contain. The teachers'&quot;voices&quot; did in fact describe aspects of both a relational and an extended or sociocentric self. In their portrayals of the self concepts from which their pedagogy emerged, the women recounted how they saw teaching as a personal and relationship-oriented, rather than strictly professional, activity. In particular, they likened teaching to &quot;mothering&quot; and strove to provide each child in their classrooms with intense care and attention. In addition,  they demonstrated an extended self as they evaluated pedagogical decisions in terms of the political consequences for the children they taught. Contains 25 references. (BT)",

        "author":["Trone, Carole J."],
        "description":"There was widespread initial interest and use of intelligence tests in the schools immediately after World War I; this interest is reflected in the fact that &quot;Reader's Guide to Periodic Literature&quot; indexed nearly 300 articles on intelligence tests in the 5-year period from 1919-1924 alone. The history of intelligence testing and the schools contains a more nuanced story than testing statistics reveal. Questioning what the historian really knows about teachers' motives and the ways they implemented intelligence test scores into their classrooms, the paper finds that the answer will probably never be conclusive, since teachers, like the students and the classroom itself, remain the most elusive subject within the history of education. A deeper look into the teacher-oriented  journals and teacher-training textbooks of the day suggests that the teacher's and principal's relationship to testing was complicated and fraught with ambivalence.  Testing rhetoric of the time aimed for the strongest declaration of its potential for the schools. Historians of the early testing movement have often reduced the testing controversy to a conflict between those who were philosophically opposed to the deterministic implications of testing versus the educational psychologists, but that the educational arena of the 1920s was far more varied than that and the historian who attempts to tease out these variations of response must consider the source of records as well as their intended audience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the spread of standardized testing in the  schools and results of that policy. Contains 89 notes. (BT)",

        "description":"A study examined teachers' strategic use of a recommended curriculum through the lenses of the three perspectives of fidelity, mutual adaptability, and enactment. The recommended curriculum under consideration was an integrated curriculum developed to prepare middle school students to attend a performance of the opera &quot;Turandot.&quot; For 40 years, the Dallas (Texas) Opera has brought 13,000 students annually to live performances of traditional operas. In 1993 the Dallas Opera embraced the National Education Goals and changed its approach to creating instructional materials. The paradigm shift from music orientation to multi-disciplinary materials placed both the opera education department and the teachers using the curriculum in a position of change management. The new materials were  roundly criticized by teachers at first, but after staff development, following the fourth implementation of opera curriculum (for &quot;Turandot&quot;), the study was conducted to determine the level of implementation of the materials. Teachers of all teaching areas responded to a survey. A brief summary of teachers' written responses indicated that the materials met with satisfaction from the teachers. The curriculum's design recommends implementation by a team of discipline-based teachers. Results align with current curriculum implementation perspectives. Most teachers elected to use an adapted approach to the curriculum, several applied fidelity principles, and even fewer created new approaches through an enactment procedure.

        "description":"This paper discusses the need to prepare teachers for the role of agents for a culture of peace. The paper calls for the cultivation of vision, a capacity to see the potential for positive development in learners and constructive change in society. It notes that the core values in a culture of peace are: environmental sustainability, cultural diversity, human solidarity, social responsibility, and gender equality. For each of these values there is a complementary human capacity to be developed through teacher education, making it possible for teachers to cultivate these values and capacities in their students. These capacities are: ecological awareness, cultural competency, global agency, conflict proficiency, and gender sensitivity. The paper suggests a number of recommendations  to help promote developments in these directions, addressing them to UNESCO, ministries of education, and educational and professional associations.

        "description":"The &quot;moral curriculum group&quot; of the Taiwan Provincial Institute for Elementary School Teachers' Inservice Education is developing a moral curriculum based on a new curriculum standard. But how do group members deal with the problem of Taiwan's national identity? To understand the interpersonal decision-making process regarding the &quot;patriotism&quot; of the moral curriculum group in the political and historical context of Taiwan, a study collected and analyzed data through qualitative research methods, including content analysis, participant observation, and interviewing. First, meanings were interpreted and ideologies were criticized regarding &quot;patriotism&quot; in both the curriculum standard and the textbooks. Second, audio-taped records of discussions in curriculum meetings regarding&quot;patriotism&quot; were analyzed. Third, to examine group members' thoughts and the accuracy and objectivity of the interpretation, some group members were interviewed. Finally, literature regarding the political change in Taiwan was analyzed to understand the political and historical context of curriculum development. It was found that the decision-making process of the &quot;moral curriculum group&quot; could be divided into two stages: (1) the &quot;editing group&quot; made the initial decisions in editing the textbooks; and (2) the final decisions were made in curriculum meetings based on the initial decisions. Decisions regarding &quot;patriotism,&quot; influenced greatly by political circumstances in Taiwan, were not only made based on group members' personal ideology, but also through arguments, negotiations, and  compromises among members with different political standpoints. After martial law was abolished in 1987 and former President Chiang Chin-Kuo died in 1988, Taiwanese society became more democratic, and &quot;Chinese Identity&quot; gradually lost its political base and legitimacy and was eventually replaced by &quot;Taiwanese Identity.&quot; However, the curriculum group members still tended to avoid using the terms &quot;Taiwan&quot; and &quot;Taiwanese&quot; in textbooks. This leads to confusion in national identity regarding &quot;patriotism&quot; in the moral curriculum. Contains 11 references. (BT)",

Methodology was based on hermeneutics and critical theory. First, meanings were interpreted and ideology was criticized regarding national identity in the new subject in both the curriculum standard and the textbooks through comparison with the ideology in other junior high school subjects. Second, data were collected regarding the political change of Taiwanese society to understand the political and historical context of the controversies related to the new subject. Third, controversies regarding the new subject were collected and  analyzed. Finally, to understand committee members' thought further and to examine the accuracy and objectivity of the interpretation, some members were interviewed after the analysis of the curriculum content and political context. Findings suggest that (1) the ideology of &quot;Chinese Identity&quot; has been gradually replaced by &quot;Taiwanese Identity&quot; in curriculum development regarding national identity; (2) because of continuing controversy about Taiwan's relationship to China, curriculum content regarding national identity remains ambiguous; (3) the ideology of &quot;Taiwanese Identity&quot; seems to be basically constructed by the editing committee members' autonomous consciousness based on its legitimacy in current open society in Taiwan; and (4) in the interpersonal process of editing textbooks,  decisions regarding the new subject were not only made based on editing committees' personal ideology, but also through arguments, negotiations, and compromises among members with different politics.

        "description":"Current history textbooks include Christianity when discussing U.S. history. A study systematically examined the content of 10 secondary U.S. history textbooks to evaluate how Christianity is portrayed. Selection of the textbooks was based upon information supplied by the Texas Education Agency and the American Textbook Council and represented the textbooks used in most public high schools. References to Christianity in contemporary U.S. history (post World War II) were analyzed and recurrent themes were sought. Findings support Gilbert Sewall's argument that the public perception that religion is absent from U.S. history textbooks is simply outdated. It is clear that textbook authors do address Christianity. Authors, however, make little effort to highlight the importance of the  relationships among faith, religion, and historical events. For example, the textbooks examined fail to provide discussions regarding the essential beliefs of &quot;born-again&quot; Christians, or even define the term. The textbooks surveyed used a variety of terms when discussing Christianity and the Religious Right. Authors were also simplistic in their definitions of fundamentalism, failing to adequately define the term. Regarding the portrayal of religion, 9 of the 10 textbooks examined included Christianity in the discussion of contemporary U.S. history. To provide students with a more complex understanding of religion, however, authors need to incorporate within the text the role of religion in individual lives and within society.

        "description":"The concept of citizenship is at the core of education for democracy. This Digest presents what citizenship is; why citizenship is an essential element of democracy; and how to teach about citizenship in a democracy. In a democracy, the source of all authority (the legitimate basis of all power) is the collective body of the people, the citizens of the polity. A citizen is a full and equal member of a polity. In some states or countries citizenship is based on the place of a person's birth; in other states citizenship is based on the citizenship of one's parents. The single identity possessed equally by all citizens of the polity is civic identity, the freely given commitment to certain civic principles and values of the democracy. Citizenship is the social and legal link between  individuals and their democratic political community. The status of citizenship entails responsibilities and duties that must be fulfilled: paying taxes; serving in the military; obeying laws; loyalty and commitment to the state; and improving the quality of political and civic life. Students involved in education for democracy need to know what citizenship is; how it is acquired or lost; what rights, responsibilities, and duties are entailed by it; and how it is connected to the institutions of particular nation-states, including their own. Students also need to develop the participatory skills of interacting, monitoring, and influencing. These skills can be developed through (1) student participation in democratically conducted student organizations; (2) school-based community service  that is connected to the school's curriculum; and (3) cooperative learning activities which pursue a common goal. The &quot;We the People...Project Citizen&quot; program develops these skills. (JH)",

The second project was a science project designed to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills to help students succeed in the sciences as demonstrated by their academic performance both in their current grade and in subsequent grades. Teachers participated in the training and completed various forms of evaluation and feedback. Based on experiences with the two projects, researchers developed a professional development model that attempts to facilitate the  growth of teachers toward sustained skill mastery using a focused, programmed approach that provides them with support at each stage. The model's six levels are as follows: basic information, observation, guided practice, skill enhancement, initial mastery, and sustained mastery.

The New Curriculum is based on a change in basic assumptions about the nature of foreign language teaching and English instruction in Israeli schools. Students were asked to write their initial reactions and their present reactions after dealing with the New Curriculum in pedagogy class for a semester. Many students initially reacted with shock and anxiety, considering it very different from how they were taught. They saw the organization of the curriculum into new domains as theoretical and not relevant to the classroom. They felt this new way of viewing English would be hard to adjust to. A few saw the New Curriculum as progressive. Activities  designed to teach the New Curriculum were based on domains suggested by the Ministry of Education, including access to information, social interaction, presentation of group activities, and appreciation of literature. Most students' feelings about the New Curriculum changed after participating in the class. They felt it opened their minds to new ideas and opinions and was a change for the better. They could now see the associations, connections, and bridges between different domains. They saw application of the New Curriculum as having advantages for teachers and students. A few still viewed the change as difficult, problematic, and unclear. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper presents initial findings from a 2-year study to identify the core knowledge and skills necessary to teach in a standards-based system. The study was part of the Standards-Based Teacher Education Project (STEP), which focused on the development of frameworks and materials for preservice and practicing teachers. High school teachers and higher education faculty formed &quot;co-development teams&quot; in each of six disciplines committed to implementation of standards-based instruction and assessment in one or more of their classes. In collaborative work groups, they shared pedagogical practices, broadened content knowledge, and learned new ways to engage students in learning. Culminating statewide institutes in the spring of 1997 and 1998 provided the opportunity for  co-development teams to cross-score classroom performance assessments, determine levels of student proficiency, and verify one another's judgments of proficiency. This paper summarizes initial findings from participants' reflective inquiry. The study found that the voices of STEP teachers engaged in the actual implementation of standards provided clear imperatives for those who formulate educational policy and design teacher preparation and professional development programs. The overarching imperative is that teachers are the primary agents of school reform and should be included in all stages of design, implementation, and improvement of the standards-based system.

        "description":"This study sought information from two cohorts of student teachers regarding their concerns in the teaching practicum component of their course and strategies they used to cope with these concerns. Students completed the Perceptions of Teaching questionnaire, and supervising teachers rated them in seven teaching areas. Data were analyzed in various ways to (1) test the psychometric properties of the survey instrument; (2) identify aspects of the practicum that concerned students most and least; (3) examine differences between students' experiences of stress in relation to age, gender, and degree status (graduate or undergraduate); (4) define strategies that students reported help them cope with practicum stresses; and (5) investigate the relationship between stress and teaching  performance. Examination of data across time yielded a consistent finding of significant reduction in stress from the first to the second practicum. The composition of this change produced a constant pattern of greater concern for students in the area of preparation and less concern related to school evaluation. The critical importance of the student/supervising teacher relationship for student success in the practicum emerged both from the students' reports that seeking support from the teacher was their principal coping strategy, and from the strong link found between stress in the relationship and teachers' poorer rating of the students' performance.

Data came from three large national probability samples of teachers taken over 6 years. The main data source was the Public School Teacher Questionnaires of the Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) of the National Center for Education Statistics. Data reveal major trends in those aspects of teacher career paths associated with entering, and continuing in, the ranks of employed public school teachers. Data also reveal variables  associated with teachers' career path transitions. A parallel Data Analysis Report from the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Research and Evaluation in Social Policy provides similar data on trends and predictors of teacher turnover. Data from the SASS indicate whether entering teachers had previous teaching experience and whether they were fully certified in the main teaching assignment into which they were hired. Data on demographics, qualifications, teaching assignment, and working conditions also come from the SASS. The report summarizes study findings. Descriptive tables comprise the bulk of the report. An appendix presents data sources, the teacher sample, and data analysis procedures. (Contains 12 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper identifies existing and potential measures of teacher qualifications as a single aspect of teacher quality, emphasizing their underlying rationale, ways to use them, and availability and quality of data collected from various sources. It categorizes types of teacher qualification measures, discusses data sources, and notes availability and quality of data collected from these sources. The paper groups measures of teacher qualifications into four categories: ability or aptitude, content knowledge, pedagogic knowledge, and teaching credentials. The two principal data sources are self-reports on questionnaires like the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and teachers' academic and test-score records maintained by colleges/universities, the Educational Testing Service, and  the American College Testing Company. The review suggests that most data collected on teacher qualifications are general information with response rates similar to other non-sensitive items. Collecting highly specific, sensitive, or difficult to recall information has been done less often, with response rates substantially lower than average. The SASS and the Baccalaureate and Beyond study collect the most information on the broadest range of teacher qualification measures. Teachers' academic records provide the most complete picture of teacher qualifications, but access to these records has legal and financial considerations. An appendix presents tables showing teacher qualification measures, data collection surveys, and sources. (Contains 15 references.) (SM)",

The study was also designed to further substantiate the construct validity of the Attitudes and Beliefs on Classroom Control (ABCC) Inventory. Respondents were 228 teachers from a Regional Service Center AC program and from traditional university graduate-level courses. The AC program required all participants to be currently teaching full-time in public K-12 classrooms. Their teaching experience was further augmented by coursework that was more utilitarian than theory-driven. Data were collected from the teachers using the ABCC and a demographic  questionnaire. Researchers examined each of the subscales of the ABCC inventory (instructional management, people management, and behavior management) and analyzed the data via a series of t-tests. Results indicated that only the instructional management subscale of the ABCC inventory yielded significant differences. The scores on the instructional management subscale of the ABCC of teachers participating in the AC program indicated that they were significantly more interventionist than teachers in the traditional program.

The paper identifies the characteristics of individual and structural preconditions and their development during active project work within the schools. Project work was organized into five phases that involved contacting the schools, building confidence, initiating project work, integrating researchers as participant observers, and terminating the project. Researchers developed surveys for students and teachers, taking into account recent research on school culture. The surveys examined formation of concepts in natural sciences; views on science, technology, and  society; and school culture. Results indicated that in all types of secondary schools, formation of concepts was not sufficiently clear or in-depth. The knowledge base on modern technologies was almost totally dependent upon secondhand information from the media for both teachers and students. There was very little inservice training for teachers of biology and related subjects. The gap between present preconceptions and attainment targets was evident when examining questions on school culture. There was general contentment with school life, though students tended to be critical of preparation for responsible citizenship. (Contains 9 tables, 8 figures, and 19 references.) (SM)",

This study examined teaching activities within 10 project schools over 1 year. Researchers evaluated the role of project work in school development. Students in grades 5-8 and in grades 9-13 completed surveys. Researchers examined teacher portfolios and conducted participant observations. Results indicated that most students felt ill-prepared by the schools for responsible citizenship. Facts from the sciences were only made central in classroom work when they had gained specific significance  with regard to a question or when they could be used to show the difference between empirical knowledge and ethical considerations. Verification experiments were only conducted in the classroom if students had discussed their worth and implicit meaning. The role of teachers changed in an analogous way during project work. All schools had difficulties planning and converting the ideas of developed understanding of science and technology into real classroom work. The main cause was the prevalent school culture. The researchers note the need to change school culture at all levels. (Contains 3 figures and 13 references.) (SM)",

The researcher began by designing and developing interactive Internet-based course material using WebCT. She converted the course syllabus and class lecture notes and identified useful web links to help students with their learning and application of course content. WebCT's bulletin board was used to develop a volunteer national network of mentor health and PE instructors. This allowed mentors and PE methods students to engage in dialogue throughout the semester. Another network was established collaboratively with another university's health and PE instructor so students at both schools could exchange  ideas and concerns. The researcher constructed several multimedia interactive tutorial programs to teach students the content used in the Physical Education Teacher Assessment Instrument. Finally, she constructed a web page that shares information; highlights students' home pages; enhances communication between student teachers, cooperating teachers, and university supervisors; and promotes the teaching program. She surveyed methods course students and mentors to determine their reaction to technology integration. Results indicated that the mentors liked the experience much more than the students, though both groups considered the experience enjoyable and were glad they had participated.

In the study described in this paper, somatic practice was used as a tool to investigate the body perceptions and experiences of undergraduate dance-education majors. Five female students took part in a somatics/creativity project within a university-level instructional setting at a state university in the south. The students kept journals and wrote body stories based on their previous experiences in  dance and what they were learning during the project. The paper details and analyzes what happened during the course and illustrates with students' statements.

For a 6-week period prior to Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) testing, one class was taught creative dance movement holistically, and the other class was taught creative dance in isolation. Data were collected from standardized TCAP test scores and end-of-the-6-week grades in English and mathematics and were analyzed using measures of central tendency, dispersion,  and t-tests for independent means. Results indicated a significant difference in TCAP scores between students who were taught creative dance movement with a holistic, integrated approach and those who were taught creative dance movement in isolation.

The paper draws on a preliminary introduction and analysis from a previous study and accompanying course which pointed out a common dominant focus in dance education (an externalized view of the body). That view tends to objectify the dancer's body and requires students to strive to achieve a specific look while being corrected so that the students perform proper dance technique. The term somatic authority as used in the paper is defined as a focus on and affirmation of what the body looks like or how it should behave. The dance education students in the study often defined somatic authority as a sense of personal  engagement in the learning process and an ownership of the body. The paper also discusses the reflexive analysis of participant responses that were sometimes in conflict with the assumptions and ideas of the study. It concludes with a consideration of agency and other implications for dance education. (Contains 15 references.) (SM)",

It reviews socioeconomic and political issues, current and emerging policies for early childhood and primary education, teacher preparation strategies, and examples of successful programs. Information was collected during a 1997 sabbatical in the four countries. The researcher observed various urban and rural early childhood programs and met with government officials, directors of nongovernmental organizations, program directors, teachers, community leaders, and parents working in the field. Three sections examine: changing national contexts for early childhood education, a new global vision for early childhood education, and selected programs in the four  countries. The four countries are each at crucial, pivotal moments in their national history. Challenges they face to provide care and education for their children are monumental at a time when new levels of education are essential for individual and national survival in the global society. They are faced with young, rapidly growing populations that need care and education to be productive future citizens. Rapid communication has brought information from other parts of the world, changing people's perspectives. This is all occurring at a time when poverty is increasing and finances for education and social services are inadequate. Despite this, opportunities for success are apparent in all four countries.

The researcher kept a journal to record books, poems, and ideas of ways to integrate to two disciplines. She sent a survey to 10 PE teachers that asked what books they used and how they integrated language arts and PE. She compiled an annotated bibliography of books and poems, listing ways to integrate ideas from PE with the literature. Results indicated that stories were more frequently read to K-2 PE students. Other types of reading were also incorporated into K-2 classes more frequently than in other grade levels. Writing was done most often in grades 3-6. Neither reading for writing were done often in any of these situations.  Listening skills and  verbal skills were used most of the time at all grades levels. Computer skills were not used at any level. Teachers listed 11 ways they incorporated reading, other than books, into their lessons. Limiting factors to integrating PE and language arts included time constraints and space limitations. Most PE activities listed in the literature related to animal movements. The paper offers suggestions for making PE classes a place for literacy. The annotated bibliography for integrating PE and language arts is included. (Contains 2 figures and 20 references.) (SM)",

        "author":["Levin, Barbara B."],
        "description":"This study examined how elementary teacher candidates in a program that emphasized the integration of computer-based technologies as tools for teaching and learning used technology, both personally and professionally, during the teacher preparation program. The study also examined factors that influenced their disposition to use and integrate computer-based technologies into their teaching. This paper presents baseline data from three points during the preservice component of a longitudinal study of members of a second cohort group of preservice elementary teachers involved in educational technology. It describes four factors, some internal or personal and others external or contextual, that influenced the dispositions of preservice teachers toward integrating technology across  the curriculum: sense of self-efficacy about teaching and using computer tools; attitudes about using computer-based technologies; skill and knowledge base about computer technology; and actual usage of technology in classrooms during internships and student teaching. In addition, several illustrative cases convey the scope of technology integration by elementary student teachers during the first phase of the study. Results suggest that prospective teachers can and will apply what they have learned about computer-based technology to their teaching situations. Study participants had relatively positive efficacy for teaching, high efficacy and attitudes about using specific computer-based technology, and above average computer literacy upon graduation.

        "description":"This booklet shares what South Carolina teachers said during Teacher Talk, a series of regional dialogue sessions between teachers and the State Superintendent of Education in 1997. Teachers from all levels and disciplines participated in the meetings. Teachers identified learning activities that were highly effective for students, worked in small groups to develop ideas, and shared ideas with the large group. Next, they worked in small groups by grade level to discuss two predetermined issues, then provided responses to the issues. Finally, they named tools, techniques, and support needed for successful implementation of best practices. After introductory information, Section 1 of the booklet, &quot;Teachers' Top Education Issues,&quot; discusses class size, accountability, professional  development, parent involvement, teacher leadership, testing, public image, curriculum, at-risk students, school safety, discipline and management, technology, and licensure. Section 2, &quot;Tools, Techniques, and Support,&quot; focuses on information related to local school districts, higher education, state department of education, and parents and communities. Section 3, &quot;Learning Activity Ideas from Teacher Talk Participants,&quot; discusses activities at each grade level. Information from a Teacher Talk evaluation is included. (SM)",

Data collected in Queensland (Australia) and Pennsylvania (USA) public schools allowed comparisons of teacher roles and responsibilities under two education systems. The co-teaching partnerships in both countries were dominated by subject teachers, with special educators being assigned monitoring or helping duties within the class. Teachers stressed the importance of school-wide commitment to inclusive principles for co-teaching to succeed. Professional and personal compatibility between co-teaching partners were seen as critical for success by most respondents. Barriers to the introduction of  co-teaching in secondary schools were reported to be entrenched attitudes rejecting inclusion and administrators' unwillingness to commit the required time and resources. Teachers believed that well implemented co-teaching results in academic and social gains for all students and should be regarded as an effective support option for inclusive secondary classrooms.

        "description":"This descriptive study examined two aspects of teacher education (text materials and curricular methods) with respect to the question of how gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual (GLBT) issues are presented and discussed. The first study focused on a content analysis of a variety of textbooks (lifespan development, adolescent development, and multicultural/social foundations) that are available for use in teacher education programs. Findings here indicated a general inclusion of GLBT issues in lifespan and adolescence texts, though there were some structural and content treatment considerations. The second study involved a set of interviews with 11 teacher educators from a variety of programs nationwide. Four main themes were derived from the data (curricular consistency,  community/campus contexts, perceived administrative response, and perceived student response). Findings suggest that while GLBT issues are increasingly a part of teacher education programs, there is still inconsistency across and within programs. Implications for these studies include recommendations for incorporating GLBT issues into teacher preparation in a more formal manner as well as integrating the issues across the curriculum.

It begins by describing the current situation in the U.S., focusing on two important issues: the training of teachers as supervisors and training for paraeducators. This section also examines a federally funded Project of National Significance: Super-Vision: A Model for the Teacher's Role as Supervisor of Paraprofessionals,\" which addresses the lack of training for both teachers and paraeducators by providing training to teacher-paraeducator teams. Next, the paper addresses two critical areas of supervision: defining paraeducator roles and enhancing communication (ethics, time to plan, and differing  work styles). The paper concludes that with nearly one million paraeducators in classrooms nationwide, and a projected 38 percent increase in that number by the year 2005, issues of training and supervision continue to emerge and must be addressed. Administrators and teachers must provide support to paraeducators that will define their roles and responsibilities, enhance communications, and develop effective teamwork. They must also seek out training for teachers to develop their supervision skills. Federally funded programs are available to support these efforts. (Contains 10 references.) (SM)",

The study took place in 1993 and 1995. Participants included two each of average seventh- and ninth-grade English classes. Intervention group students participated in a prewriting activity prior to the literature comprehension test. The activity involved writing about personal knowledge, experience, or emotion related to the story. Control group students did not participate in prewriting. Students in both groups read the same story and had the same test questions. Data analysis indicated a majority  of higher scores for all four ninth-grade experimental groups in nearly every itemized comparison with the control groups. However, for the seventh grade, the same indications were not as evident. In some comparisons, the seventh-grade control groups outperformed the experimental groups. However, in general, prewriting increased students' performance on reading comprehension tests, even when students in one of the intervention group initially had lower overall grade point averages than did students in the corresponding control group.

The interviewee was a high school and college English teacher. The external dialogue of the interview focused on the positive aspects of her teaching career and educational experiences. Some of the themes of her external dialogue included stages of learning according to age categories (early adulthood, middle age, late adulthood, and retirement). The internal dialogue was composed of  the interviewee's personal relationship to education, which she viewed as one of loyalty, constriction, and domination of her life. It noted her fear of being alone and fear of aging. The interviewee perceived education as fulfilling many needs, including self-identity, organization of life structure, enhancement of work experiences, contribution to the profession, social achievement, escape from personal problems, and remaining young.

The benefits include greater tolerance and empathy for individuals and groups in society, greater social awareness, better communication skills, greater self-confidence, and a stronger sense of social responsibility. Section 2 discusses mentoring and tutoring by prospective teachers, noting that this activity enables education students to become familiar with different social groups, to apply and integrate knowledge taught in different courses, and to develop professionally. The mentoring experience can teach education students about themselves and provide a means for testing their suitability to the  teaching profession. Research shows that education students who provide mentoring are very satisfied with the experience.

Section 2, &quot;Standard Setting in Teaching,&quot; explains that in order to appreciate the effects of the National Board's work, it is important to understand where it fits in the organization and governance of the teaching profession. It discusses the accreditation of teacher preparation programs, the development of a common knowledge base, and the creation of professional standards. Section 3, &quot;Influences of New Standards and Assessments on Teacher Learning,&quot; explains that the new standards are significantly different from first-generation approaches  to teacher testing. They seek to assess teaching knowledge and skill through portfolios and performances. This section discusses the demonstration of standards and assessments at work and describes the INTASC standards, which include 10 principles. Section 4, &quot;Uses and Effects of the New Standards,&quot; describes how states have adopted and used the new standards. Section 5, &quot;Preparing Teachers to Meet the Standards,&quot; examines how teacher education programs participate in preparing teachers for the new standards.

Collectively, the surveys span a decade and provide a quantitative description of the teaching force for the next century. The report provides data for discerning the discipline areas that have the greatest need for educators of color, noting the state and regional productivity of prospective teachers and students. Data come from many sources, including the U.S. Department of Education Schools and Staffing Survey of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System surveys; and the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) teacher education survey. The study identified the number of students in  the teacher education pipeline by race/ethnicity and gender. Researchers mailed the survey to all schools, colleges and departments of education (SCDE) from several rosters and received 1,026 usable responses (a 52.1 percent response rate). This report presents: a national profile summary; data on postbaccalaureate enrollment; SCDE doctoral enrollment data; regional summaries (northeast, southeast, central, and western regions); SCDE undergraduate program enrollment summary; and SCDE graduate-level program enrollment summary. The three appendixes present technical notes, response rates, and the survey instrument. (SM)",

Section 2, &quot;Conceptual Foundations of Intercultural Communication,&quot; discusses concepts of culture and communication that are necessary to understanding the process of ICC. It explains that communication is an imperfect process, one made even more complex when the element of cultural differences is involved. This section concludes by describing Gudykunst and Kim's (1997) model of intercultural communication. Section 3,&quot;Cultural Influences on the Communication Process: Dimensions of Cultural Variability,&quot; explores how culture influences communication, pointing out how cultural variability can impact communication and thereby affect teacher-student interactions.

        "description":"This paper presents a conceptual framework of teachers' practical knowledge. The researcher examined interview data from 29 Finnish elementary school teachers to identify common features underlying teachers' practical knowledge. The interviews examined teachers' teaching and students' learning activities, social relationships within the profession, and teachers' professional selves. The empirical findings indicated that teachers shared some common epistemological stances guiding their practical ways of knowing. These stances were investigated and identified according to ways of being (nonscholastic stance) and ways of acting (organizational stance). This paper brings these two stances in teachers' practical knowledge together. It argues that the stances have the potential to  combine vocational and professional aspects by establishing alternative epistemologies in teachers' practical knowledge. The results indicate that teaching can be seen both as a vocation with deep personal commitment and as a profession with procedural reasonings. For effective teaching, both aspects should be brought together. (Contains 66 references.) (SM)",

It argues that the construct of collective efficacy is the missing link in understanding and implementing successful linkages between schools, parents, and communities. The paper suggests that preparing teachers, counselors, and administrators for work in the nation's urban schools involves training them in the importance of designing educational goals and programs that reflect linkages between homes, schools, and communities. The paper discusses collective efficacy and specific outcomes that may be sought when students, parents, school professionals, and community advocates work together for  proactive learning experiences. It concludes that fostering beliefs of collective efficacy must begin with preservice education. If preservice teachers are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to form linkages and create nurturing support systems for themselves and their students, they will know when, how, and where to begin the process. Appendix A presents a course syllabus designed for preservice teachers that reflects goals which prepare students with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to engage in collaborative relationships with schools, parents, and community advocates.

        "description":"This study of eight elementary student teachers used stimulated recall interviews to investigate their knowledge and processes in reading their students, or informally assessing their students' understanding during instruction. By collecting data from four student teachers in each of two different programs at the same university, one of which was a Professional Development School, the study explored factors essential to developing these skills and knowledge and the role of the program in this development. Study results clearly described the general model of assessing student understanding, which emphasized student understanding, gathering various types of cues from three sources, and interpreting the cues in terms of student understanding. Results exposed the thoughts and  knowledge necessary for assessing student understanding by defining the general categories of knowledge needed for deep interpretation of cues and describing the complex thinking employed by relative experts. The study proposes that this complex thinking is dependent upon knowledge of classroom routines so that cognitive space is available to attend to assessment issues. The study explains how the assessment processes and knowledge are learned. It also proposes that stimulating classroom experiences and coursework focused on student assessment helped student teachers learn the requisite knowledge, develop a template that facilitated gathering and interpreting cues, and develop routines that allowed cognitive space to focus on cues and integrate forms of knowledge.

        "description":"The South African educational system has experienced many significant changes in the past 5 years which are intended to facilitate paradigm shifts in terms of ownership of schools, equity, wider access, more mobility, and modernization. New legislation and policy frameworks propose numerous strategic recommendations. It was against this backdrop of new legislation and policy formation, the concept of effective schools, and the need for capacity building of institutions and individuals, that the Delta Foundation's Centres of Learning Project was born. The Project was designed to develop a replicable framework for the development of centers of learning through building governance, management, and administration capacity of leadership of school communities. After discussing the  concept of effective schools, this paper describes the vision, mission, and objectives of the Centres of Learning Project, discusses project sponsors and project management, and explains the research and development process used in the project. It then describes the leadership training program and discusses the consolidation and practical implementation of the leadership training. Finally, the paper describes program evaluation and lessons learned. The proposed model for the development of centers of learning includes: scientific needs assessment; a training program on personal effectiveness and leadership skills; a followup workshop; a regular feedback session; a continuous monitoring of progress; and a replication of the process to other schools.

This is the final year-end report on the Hartford Comprehensive Partnerships for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA) covering the program's second year. Fourteen schools were identified for CPMSA activities. The students enrolled in these schools represent 52% of the total student population of 22,531 in all the Hartford Public Schools. Multiple data sources were used to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Evaluation of the second year for CPMSA found a different and more effective form of implementation than seen in the first year, in part due to the appointment of a full-time program director. The most  significant issues associated with CPMSA were those that stemmed from ongoing problems in the school district. The chaos in the public school system made it difficult for program activities to unfold as planned. The most significant problem was the removal of the former superintendent, coupled with the appointment of two interim superintendents and the eventual hiring of a new permanent superintendent. Key partners in the Hartford community expressed strong support of the CPMSA initiative and related efforts for systemic reform of mathematics and science education, but the district was not able to commit itself to the program.

CSILE software is a communal database system in which learners are allowed to externalize their thoughts as text or graphic &quot;notes,&quot; and then organize their knowledge collaboratively to advance their communal understanding. A web-based version of CSILE (WebCSILE) was used in university courses in Japan to explore the effects of CSILE on learning with a Japanese student population. The study examines the frameworks of discourse in learning communities with and without instructional scaffolding to determine the additional support novices might need as they used CSILE. Participants  were groups of 30 and 24 Japanese undergraduates. Students used WebCSILE as a tool in collaborative discourse, and its use appeared to expand their communication and collaboration. However, providing scaffolding seemed to students to be supplying tasks that they had to complete by specific dates. Instructional interventions were thus transformed into simple tasks. Some suggestions are made for improved use of CSILE in the Japanese context. (Contains 2 tables, 6 figures, and 20 references.) (SLD)",

A characteristic of the portfolio process is that students are led to notice their own progress through the work included in the portfolio. Many educators welcome the portfolio process because they recognize that standardized tests do not tell enough about what students are learning. Portfolios have a definite advantage over testing to assess learner progress since the portfolio process is ongoing and continuous and presents evidence of student progress. Portfolio use might not survive, however, because of weaknesses that include cost, administration difficulties, assessment challenges, and practicality. In many cases, the portfolio does not provide a \"score\" that is easy for the public to  understand. Rubrics have been used to evaluate and score results from a portfolio, but use of a rubric still requires a great deal of interpretation. A major reason why the portfolio may prove to be a fad is the lack of numbers to describe how well students are achieving. (Contains eight references.) (SLD)",

The Aspects of Self Knowledge-KIDS Inventory (ASK-KIDS) (L. Bornholt, 1996) was used to determine self-knowledge about activities in the SYSTEMS cognitive screening test. Participants were 188 Australian students, aged 5 to 11 years. ASK-KIDs profiles indicated that students felt good about the SYSTEMS activities, thought that the activities were easy, and believe they would be good at SYSTEMS activities the following year. Children's  perceptions of the effort needed and task difficulty differentiated among two and three clusters of children. Lower perceptions for the following year differentiate a fourth cluster. Findings illustrate the importance of determining the diverse meanings children make of self-concepts.

This paper proposes methodological and design alternatives to measure nontraditional outcomes, such as changes in policy, over the lifespan of the reforms. Systemic reforms include intended and unintended outcomes and the actual outcomes that result. Outcomes of educational reform can also be organized in terms of whether they result from top-down or bottom-up approaches. A research approach to measuring reform outcomes will be more methodologically sound if the variables of interest are measured in multiple ways. By comparing findings using multiple qualitative and quantitative data collection strategies, evaluators can  identify trends and lead reformers to midcourse corrections when needed. By defining outcomes and measuring those outcomes, evaluators and reformers will be driving the reforms. (Contains 17 references.) (SLD)",

Failing schools are typically identified in terms of student test performance. However, evaluating the impact of reconstitution in terms of test score gains may not be an appropriate methodology for the short run. Instead, evaluators should consider multilevel evaluation models that account for those school input factors that were reconstituted, i.e., teaching staff and class size,. The position is taken that it is vital to delineate, obtain, and report information on teacher and class size variables in an evaluation of school reconstitution reform. This paper attempts to define the nature of the school  reconstitution evaluation problem, relate teacher experience/training and class size to school reform, delineate operational definitions for obtaining standardized teacher and class size variables, and show some descriptive and correlation results for these variables.

The second phase of the study investigated the hypothesis that examinee motivation and item type moderate the relationship between test consequences and test performance by expanding the Wolf and Smith design to include multiple-choice and essay test items. Ninety undergraduate psychology majors participated in the study. The study supported previous findings concerning increases in  self-reports of motivation and enhanced test performances in testing situations with consequences. The motivation subscores of Importance and Effort were found to be useful, and for some of the hypotheses the two scores behaved differently and in accord with expectations concerning the construct and context.

In addition, the use of a TopicScore, or measure of topic content for each assignment, was incorporated into the PEG model to determine how well it would correlate with the five traits. In the first experiment, essays from 500 students were used to create statistical predictions for the PEG software. In the second experiment, the ratings from 300 essays were compared with ratings from 6 human judges. The interjudge correlation of the raters was only 0.51, but the prediction of all 6 judges, in the blind test, reached 0.83  for the PEG program. Of the five traits, &quot;content&quot; and &quot;creativity&quot; had the highest interjudge correlations. The new TopicScore correlated most highly with content, providing some measure of PEG's construct validity. The PEG software was an efficient means of grading the essays, with approximately six documents graded per second. (Contains 3 figures, 6 tables, and 15 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The KMA, which evaluates how well students distinguish between what they know and do not know by comparing their knowledge estimates to test performance, is partially performance based and may be group or computer administered and objectively scored. Participants were 462 academically gifted high school students in a summer enrichment program. Mathematical and verbal analogy KMAs were developed. Results confirm prior findings that the KMA has significant but moderate relationships with scholastic aptitude, and that these relationships are somewhat higher than those that study skills and metacognitive self-report scales have with scholastic aptitude. Results also suggest that the KMA has low relationships with  self-report measures of metacognition and study skills, which are highly related to one another. Results do indicate that knowledge monitoring has significant relationship with school grades, and that accurate monitoring is an important variable in school learning. Evidence supports the construct validity of the KMA and its usefulness in the study of metacognition. (Contains 5 tables and 24 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This study compared the classification performance among parametric discriminant analysis, nonparametric discriminant analysis, and logistic regression in a two-group classification application. Field data from an organizational survey were analyzed and bootstrapped for additional exploration. The data were observed to depart from multivariate normality; neither the group sizes in the sample nor the covariance matrices of the two groups were equal. A crossed design of classification function by prior probability was implemented for over 244 bootstrap samples. The classification error rates for each group and the total sample were gathered for each cell of the design matrix. The major findings of this study are: (1) nonparametric discriminant functions and logistic regression  performed below expectations from theory; (2) the choice of prior probabilities influenced the classification performance for the smaller and the larger group, but not for the total sample; and (3) minimization of error rates for one group implied an increment in the error rate for the other group, or vice versa. The findings do not demonstrate the expected theoretical strength of nonparametric discriminant functions when applied to data with nonnormality and unequal covariance matrices. No consistent superiority was observed in logistic regression and quadratic discriminant function over the linear discriminant function. This indicates a more complicated situation than that portrayed in previous studies on the applications of discriminant functions and logistic regression for  classification purposes.

        "description":"Because scores on high-stakes tests influence many decisions, tests need to be secure. Decisions based on scores affected by preknowledge of items are unacceptable. New methods are needed to detect the new cheating strategies used for computer-administered tests because item pools are typically used over time, providing the potential opportunity for test takers to share items with future test takers. Because of the serious ramifications of accusing someone as being a user of item preknowledge (or &quot;cheater&quot;), it may be more useful for operational computer-administered test developers to focus on item security rather than the behavior of individual test takers. This research explores the development and use of a fit index to detect items that have been memorized so that these items  may be removed from the item pool, while leaving secure items in the pool. The results from this initial simulation for the developed Bayesian posterior log odds ratio index are promising. It is hoped that this work and future work will enable testing programs to determine more effectively how long to leave an item pool (or specific items) in the field.

In addition, the hypothesis of equality of factor structures for boys and girls was tested. The analyses were carried out on data from 3,073 students in grades 3 and 4 and repeated on data from 4,057 students from grades 7 and 8. Results from the study for grades 3 and 4 show that factor structures of girls' and boys' attitudes toward mathematics are quite similar at age 9, and the relationships between these factors and mathematics achievement are similar for the most part. Attitude  factors explain only a very small percentage of the observed variation in boys' and girls' mathematics achievement. At age 13, some gender differences in attitudes toward mathematics are apparent, and some gender differences are seen in the percent of variance in responses accounted for by each factor. Attitude explained more of the variation in achievement for the older group. (Contains four tables.) (SLD)",

A methodology is presented that captures cognition in situ, with the goal of tracing the emergence and development of practices, concepts, and resources, as well as the role of particular interventions in supporting this process. The sociological approach of actor-network theory provides the structural framework within which the Constructing Networks of Activity (CNA) methodology is grounded. In advancing CNA methodology, a set of criteria for researchers introducing novel methods that was  developed by A. Schoenfeld (1992) is applied. In addition to setting the context and providing a rationale for the CNA methodology, the discussion includes an in-depth description of the methodology and its application to data sets and a discussion of the reliability, validity, scope of application, and limitations of the method.

Yet, little research has been reported on the practices of teachers who are actually using portfolios within their classrooms and how those practices are moderated by contextual variables. This research examined the instructional, learning, and assessment roles of student portfolios, and explored, from the perspective of the classroom teacher, variations in portfolio applications associated with teaching level (primary versus intermediate) and classroom environment (self-contained versus multiage/teaming). Teachers for kindergarten through grade 5 in 3 elementary schools (n=314) completed a survey questionnaire regarding the instructional and assessment uses to which portfolios are put within their  classrooms. To further examine patterns of portfolio use, a subset of 44 teachers was interviewed to explore teacher perceptions about the impact of student portfolios on themselves and their students. Results suggest that these teachers make deliberate decisions regarding uses of their students' portfolios, decisions that appear heavily impacted by the maturity or skill level of the child, the purposes of the application, and the classroom environment within which the application occurs. They also depend on whether the portfolio product is in a formative state (working portfolio) or final state (performance portfolio). (Contains 7 tables and 14 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Student experiences are looked at within the context of their demographic backgrounds.

Visible minorities made up over half of the secondary school students, and most had lived in their home countries before coming to Canada. These minority students were more likely to be from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Fewer than two-thirds of the students lived with both parents. Four main themes emerge from the survey findings: (1) the public school system serves an increasingly diverse  population; (2) students from different backgrounds have different kinds and levels of needs; (3) the public school system has made a difference in narrowing the opportunity gap for students of diverse backgrounds; and (4) there are areas that need further attention by the school system and communities to enable all students to reach high levels of achievement.

Gender differences in homework styles were also examined. Participants were 329 fifth graders (172 boys and 157 girls) and 244 seventh graders (130 boys and 114 girls). More distinguishing homework style elements were found with the self-perceived homework achievement and attitude levels than in the teacher-rated achievement (homework completion and quality and final examination scores). Neither gender differences nor gender-achievement interaction effects were indicated in the current samples. As  expected, the motivational elements distinguished the high/low levels of all types of achievement and attitude toward homework. While high teacher-rated achievement was more closely associated with high scores of the teacher-motivated element, the self-perception of work accomplishment at home was more positive in those students who were highly motivated by parents as well as teachers. In general, no significant differences were indicated in the perceptual sensitivity elements (auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic) between high- and low-achieving students, while some group differences were found on the physical elements (intake, mobility) in some of the achievement and attitude measures. A number of environmental and organizational elements also distinguished the high from low  achievers. The importance of teacher and parent roles in student achievement is discussed.

To elicit dialogues that can be captured, F. Dineen developed &quot;Task-Directed Discussions&quot; (TDDs) based on exercises used in teaching English as a foreign language. Students using TDDs are able to have productive discussions very quickly. Videotapes of student discussions using TDDs were used to develop a dissemination system that allows multimedia to be integrated with the primary teaching material. An experiment was run to investigate the efficacy of these &quot;vicarious learning&quot; resources in a  controlled laboratory setting using part of a Master's level course in computers in teaching. Eighteen students used the vicarious learning materials and 18 others did not. Results show some benefits in learning and substantial positive changes in attitudes and discussion behavior for students having access to vicarious learning resources. Implications for instruction are discussed. (Contains 17 references.) (SLD)",

Scores on these assessments can be used for a variety of purposes ranging from subject remediation to promotion decisions. These policy decisions are informed by recommendations for Minimum Passing Scores (MPSs) from standard setting studies. This paper presents a model for setting MPSs on mixed assessments using a combination of two standard setting methodologies. For multiple-choice items, an Angoff standard setting approach is used. For constructed response items, a paper selection strategy is used. The model is described in detail and an illustrative case is presented for a large metropolitan school district in the Midwest.

Students are involved in selecting what goes into the portfolio, and which emphasizes the achievement of objectives from within the classroom. In mathematics education, the portfolio is particularly useful in helping the teacher discuss student achievement with parents. The everyday work of students is stressed in the portfolio assembly and evaluation process. Testing and measurement tend to leave out the results from everyday experiences, but portfolios focus on achievement in the classroom. Teachers, administrators, and parents need to study and analyze different philosophies related to evaluating student achievement,  but the portfolio approach is one that has considerable momentum at this time.

Videotaped mathematics lessons (n=147) for German eighth graders from the sample for the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) were rated, each by 2 raters. Some of the PSI facets were seen very rarely. Results from factor analyses show that the facets have a three-dimensional structure. Although these facets were not directly related to achievement and learning, they were related to lesson characteristics and aspects of classroom discourse. Correlations with the student ratings of frequencies of various  instructional activities also support the validity of the PSI facets.

In particular, state departments of education wish to compare their assessments to the NAEP. The complex design of the NAEP renders simple comparisons problematic at best. A linear projection-plus-variation method is used to translate student state assessment scores onto the NAEP scale. The accuracy of this method is estimated through repeated half-sampling.

This paper examines the use of alternate specifications of 1-year retention that include information about spring semester stopout behavior. Different types of discrete choice models are first described, Next, the multinomial logit model using four outcomes (enrolled first fall semester only; enrolled first fall semester and spring semester; enrolled first fall semester, stopped out and returned the following fall; and enrolled all three semesters) is compared with the traditional dichotomous logit approach using the 3,589 first-time full-degree seeking freshmen enrolled at a large university. The pseudo R-square indicates the multinomial model fits the data  better, but for practical reasons it has very poor predictive power. The multinomial model does yield interesting results for the impact of independent variables on retention; for example, increases in high school grade point average impacts the probability of a student being in the fall-spring outcome more than the probability of falling in the first fall semester only outcome.

A goal of the study was to create test scores that were interchangeable with those from a fixed form paper and pencil test. The first approach to controlling the test construct is to require the CAT to balance the item content type by constraining the amount of information obtained from each content area through algorithms developed by T. Miller and T. Davey (1999). A second approach is to allow content constraints to vary across ability levels. A third approach is to allow a variable standard error across the ability scale.

        "description":"Upward Bound is a federal program designed to help disadvantaged students prepare to enter and succeed in college. Students typically enter the program in their freshman or sophomore year of high school and can remain in it through the summer following high school graduation. Upward Bound projects provide students with a variety of services, including instruction, tutoring, and counseling. This report presents findings from a national evaluation of Upward Bound that draws on a sample of 67 regular Upward Bound projects. About 1,500 students nationwide were in the study group, and about 1,300 other students formed a control group. Followup surveys of students and their academic records provided information about program effectiveness. Findings show that many students remain in  Upward Bound only for a short time, and, in fact, the program has limited impact on students in high school, and no apparent impact on high school graduation. Upward Bound may have some impact on participants' postsecondary education experiences, but, since relatively few of the study group had reached college age, it is too soon to make definitive statements about program impact at the college level. Findings also show that Upward Bound has substantial impact on some groups of students, and not others. Positive effects were more evident for students who initially had low educational expectations and for students with poor performance as they entered the program. (SLD)",

        "description":"The relationships among identity, school engagement, and goal attainment for African American adolescents in urban public high schools were studied with 63 ninth graders. In bi-weekly workshops, information was obtained about student dreams and goals, self-concepts, and knowledge of what they needed to do to attain their goals. To explore engagement strategies, students were asked to respond to scenarios about students with school problems. Some preliminary conclusions have been drawn from this ongoing study. Race and ethnicity were not concepts that students generally situated inside themselves, but were considered issues that created problems or only mattered because other people made them matter. Students distinguished themselves from stereotypes, and clearly recognized that  they had to traverse two worlds, a white world and the black society in which they lived. Students perceived race to be a problem of other people that then interfered with chances in their own lives. They believed that they were working hard, but often did not understand the paths they needed to take to reach their goals. (Contains 16 references.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Goyette, Kimberly"],
        "description":"This paper explores an important component of the high college enrollment of Asian American students: application to college while in high school. Using data from the 1988-1992 waves of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), rates of application to college are compared for Asian Americans and Whites and various Asian American ethnic groups. Using logistic and negative binomial regression models, the study examines whether the high educational expectations of Asian Americans are sufficient to explain their higher college application rates, and, if not, whether factors such as immigration generation, socioeconomic and family background characteristics and tested ability further explain these differences. Educational expectations explain a great deal of the greater  propensity of Asian Americans to apply to college. In addition, the favorable socioeconomic and other background characteristics of Koreans and South Asians enable them to apply to more schools than do Whites. Chinese are more likely to apply to college and to apply to more colleges than Whites, owing in part to their high proficiency test scores. High expectations are an important determinant of college attendance, although some Asian American ethnic groups have advantages above and beyond those that affect their educational expectations.

The description of approaches and activities can help educators integrate an antiviolence education program into their schools and classrooms, select a program to implement from many models in use around the country, or develop an original plan. The brief also summarizes some theories about the causes of youth violence and the best ways to prevent it. There is a wide range of effective strategies to help children develop prosocial attitudes and behaviors. The most successful are those that are implemented as part of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to nurturing children at home, at school, and in the community. The increasing  numbers of evaluations of existing programs offer useful guides for future program evaluations. In addition, some organizations provide schools with technical assistance on antiviolence initiatives. Society needs to strengthen communities by supporting parents' efforts to provide emotionally and economically for their children and to control access to weapons. Elements in society that foster the culture of violence, such as the news and entertainment media, need to consider whether their messages are obviating the benefits of youth violence prevention efforts in the schools.

Descriptions of programs are based on a study that involved a survey of 579 affiliates of 7 national youth-serving organizations: (1) Boys and Girls Clubs of America; (2) Boy Scouts of America; (3) Girls Incorporated; (4) Girl Scouts of America; (5) National Association of Police Athletic Leagues; (6) National 4-H Council and USDA 4-H; and (7) YMCA of the USA. Findings suggest that popular approaches such as boot camps or curfews provide only temporary supervision. Effective prevention approaches are integral to national youth  organizations. Partnerships between police and youth-serving organizations that are effective can take many forms. A review of some exemplary programs shows that they have some features in common: they are based on needs assessment and address multiple factors; and they use existing organizations and services, rather than developing new ones. Their experience suggests courses of action for police administrators, directors of youth agencies, and community leaders. An appendix lists some resource organizations. (SLD)",

In the 1997-98 school year, the District's public schools had not been able to open on time because of repair work that was not completed. After opening remarks by Congress members Thomas M. Davis and Constance Morella, Constance Newman, Vice Chairman of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, spoke about the efforts underway to improve the D.C. public schools. Arlene Ackerman, Superintendent of Schools for the District of Columbia, assured the Subcommittee that the schools would be opening on time and that improvements to facilities and to instruction were ongoing. Colonel Bruce Berwick of the Army Corps  of Engineers, responsible for engineering technical assistance to the school system, emphasized that all schools would be able to open in safe conditions by September 1, 1998, even though all capital projects would not be completed. Arthur Turowski, Director of Portfolio Management for the Public Buildings Service of the National Capital Region of the General Services Administration, reviewed the role of that agency in the facilities repair and improvement process. Additional statements were made by these witnesses: (1) Maudine Cooper, Chairman of the school system's Emergency Transition Board; (2) Wilma Harvey, President of the elected School Board; and (3) Carlotta C. Joyner, of the U.S. General Accounting Office. Constance Newman and Arlene Ackerman summarized issues facing the D.C.  schools and touched on areas related to academic achievement and the situation of charter schools. The prepared statements of each witness follow their testimony. (SLD)",

The proportion of African American families in poverty in the United States climbed from 20 per cent in 1969 to nearly 30 percent  in 1994, and in Cleveland, the poverty rate has risen in a similar fashion. In the same period, the black unemployment rate has doubled. Some phenomena that have major roles in the economic well-being of African American families are the ongoing restructuring of the economy, crime and the incarceration of African American males, family structure, demographic trends in gender  ratios, and continuing educational failures.

In family math programs, program participants are considered to have a contract with each other in which the teacher plans and presents activities, and the parent and child work on them together. Family math program problems and experiments use situations and materials from everyday experience. Most effective family math programs include personal contact between teachers and parents, periodic group meetings for parents, resource rooms, family outings with learning  opportunities, and different levels of group and home work.

The Curriculum for Possibilities (CFP) is an in-service course in which teachers examine their underlying beliefs, decisions, and behaviors that dictate their styles and the context of possibilities for their students. The participant was a junior high school Spanish teacher enrolled in the CFP course. In addition to examining the changes experienced by the teacher, the study also explored ways to adapt the CFP course to make it more effective. The teacher was observed as a student in the CFP course and as a teacher in her classroom. The teacher began connecting with her students, with whom she initially had many disciplinary  problems, after reflecting in the class on what school meant to her as a student. Her attitudes toward her colleagues improved, and she became more open to forming a partnership for learning with her students. Among the suggestions for improving the CFP class was establishing a one-on-one teacher-coach relationship to help the teacher develop as a practitioner of CFP pedagogy. Another recommendation is to obtain a baseline assessment of the teacher's class from the school's principal and then follow this with an assessment at midterm of the difference the course is making.

In 1957 the school became a center of controversy over school desegregation when nine African American students attempted to enroll at Central High. Senator Dale Bumpers from Arkansas spoke of the importance of recognizing the site, already on the National Register of Historic Places as the location of the first real test of desegregation in the wake of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. Everett Tucker, III, President of the Central High Museum spoke in support of the measure, as did Ernest Green, one of the nine students who  integrated the school with federal support. Both speakers noted that the nine students were an inspiration to America because of their poise in a crisis. Although the school would be designated as a National Parks site, it would continue to be a functioning school, administered by the Little Rock school district. The hearing report also contains testimony by witnesses related to the other bills and the prepared statements of all witnesses. (SLD)",

        "description":"This report examines the effects of high school courses on students' readiness for college-level work. ACT Assessment scores for 1998 for graduates of Council of the Great City Schools member high schools are compared with those for 1997 graduates and with students nationally. All data are analyzed by course-taking patterns, school district wealth, student ethnicity, and gender. The report also examines the gap between urban students' readiness for college and their college expectations. Findings support the view that every urban student considering attending college should take a program of college preparatory courses, including 4 years of English, 3 or more years of mathematics, 3 or more years of social studies, and 3 or more years of science. The racial and ethnic composition  of ACT urban test takers continues to be quite different from test takers nationally; three-fourths of urban test takers were children of color. Urban students increased their average ACT composite score between 1997 and 1998, although the national average remained unchanged. Of the 52 Great City Schools studied, only 15% (8 districts) had 1998 average ACT composite scores at or above the national average. These findings and other data from the study suggest the importance of taking courses that are rigorous enough to prepare a student for high school and preclude the need for remedial coursework after high school. Recommendations and promising practices are suggested to improve the academic achievement and college success rate of urban students. Appendixes define core courses, present  standards for transition, and list numbers of ACT-tested graduates by Great City Schools district. (Contains 26 figures.) (SLD)",

Most of the children in this class had peers with whom they could converse in their home languages. There were seven Chinese children speaking different dialects, and one spoke English in preference to her limited Mandarin. Their subgroup differences had important influences on the children's peer interactions. When no two in the play group come from the same place, the children create common ground (e.g., claim to be from Taiwan) to show their similarity and feel that they are a  group. Some of the data show that some elements of Chinese culture might be transmitted or changed when the children interact with their peers. Among the questions that merit further study is that of the role of the school in the peer relationships of these \"Chinese\" children of differing backgrounds.

The program was deigned to test the effectiveness of a set of reforms intended to improve students' attendance and performance in the first year of high school. Project Transition implemented three primary strategies: (1) student-teacher teams of 4 teachers and approximately 120 students who share many core classes; (2) daily teacher team meetings; and (3) a coach position and other supports for teachers. The program created a more supportive environment at both schools,  but it achieved positive effects on student academic achievement only at Schlagle, where it was more fully implemented. This study provides evidence of what such a program can achieve in a short period of time, and it also shows the limits of the strategy. The study shows that although a rather inexpensive but well-run intervention can improve important aspects of school performance, the effects are not dramatic. Well-implemented transition programs are just one element of a broader K-12 strategy. Four appendixes present a survey analysis, the response analysis for the student survey, a discussion of unadjusted impacts, and the regression-adjustment model.

        "description":"This paper explores how &quot;equity&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; can call into question the ecology of a school. It suggests that failing to follow a holistic approach to a school problem can produce solutions that fail the students the effort was intended to assist. Examining schooling as a process of social production and reproduction leads to examining some of the traps set for educators in the most common risk stories told about students and families. On the basis of that analysis of prevalent ideas about &quot;risk,&quot; some principles are established for the development of school-based programs that might make a difference. Some of the school cultural and structure issues associated with these principles are also outlined. These principles center around responding to immediate needs and designing  interventions to meet needs rather than to attempt to arrive at &quot;one best answer.&quot; Taking a holistic approach that is responsive to stakeholders can result in better coordination of services.

        "description":"This discussion of the experiences of Saskatchewan (Canada) Education in developing integrated school-linked services should be a valuable resource for anyone planning or implementing a full service school program. Information derived from the Saskatchewan schools shows that each full service program is unique, characterized by specific local circumstances and needs. These programs work best as collaborative ventures between the school community and the various service providers operating in the wider community. In the Canadian context, a great deal of attention has been paid to the needs of indigenous Indian and Metis peoples. In Saskatchewan, the school-linked services model applied a standard format for the planning of local programs, but the programs then developed based on  specific local needs. The leading role of the planning team is shaped in part by the choices of groups and agencies as partners in program development and implementation. In some respects the Saskatchewan model reflects the &quot;top-down&quot; nature of its development, especially in the emphasis on suggested goals in educational outcomes and the inclusion of the goal of enhanced community confidence in the use of tax dollars. Many goals, however, are set more broadly than education itself. These include increased self-esteem for students and a reduction in substance abuse. Some specific information is provided for planning and implementation of school-linked services programs, and implications for the Australian experience are outlined. (SLD)",

Across the five districts, SEED students scored significantly better than non-SEED students on a test of algebraic concepts and in 21 of 23 statistical comparisons on 5 norm-referenced achievement analyses. Principals, teachers, students, and parents associated with the SEED program all responded positively to questionnaires about SEED. SEED instruction was generally  seen to be very effective, accompanied by high rates of student participation and enthusiasm. Among the outcomes noted were increased student interest in mathematics, improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills, increased student motivation to learn, increased student self-confidence, and better understanding of mathematics. Results were very consistent across the five school districts. Six appendixes contain sample items from the algebra test results and results from the student, teacher, parent, and principal surveys.

The book format created student interest and enhanced motivation, but experiences with this project indicate that some adjustments are needed to teach the lessons in the future. Among the problems was the limited technical vocabulary of these students who were learning English. In addition, the school lacked reference materials in English and Spanish to support student learning.

The 1994 reauthorization of the ESEA included a number of changes to Title I allocation provisions to improve the targeting of Title I funds on the districts and schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. This study examined the impact of those changes on school-level targeting. In addition, the study examined funding for secondary schools, the impact of waivers on targeting, funding for schoolwide programs and targeted assistance schools, allocation of funds for services for private school students, and the percentage of  funds retained at the district level. Data from 4 national surveys, district records from 140 school districts, Title I state performance reports, and an analysis of waivers of Title I targeting provisions were used to examine allocations. Changes in school-level allocations were studied through records form 17 urban school districts. After the reauthorization, the proportion of high-poverty schools receiving Title I funds increased, and the proportion of low-poverty schools receiving Title I funds decreased. This trend was apparent in the 17 urban school districts as well. Secondary schools were less likely to receive Title I funds, although the highest poverty secondary schools became more likely to receive funds. Only a small proportion of schools nationwide were affected by targeting  waivers. Overall, the reauthorization appears to have increased the allocation of resources to disadvantaged students. An appendix discusses the methodology for analyzing within-district targeting in large cities. (Contains 38 exhibits.) (SLD)",

The study has already identified some teacher variables associated with different rates of growth in student performance in reading and mathematics in high-poverty Title I schools. The study has also identified variation across policy environments in teachers' views and the professional development they have experienced. In the future, the study will focus  on other relationships among: (1) interventions intended to influence classroom practice; (2) actual practices reported by teachers; and (3) results for students. Results to date confirm that there are no simple answers, but this research will continue to consider Title I impact on educational reform and academic achievement. Two appendixes contain additional information on study methodology and a discussion of the relationship between student test score gains and teacher responses to survey items.

        "description":"The Survey of School-Based Gang Prevention and Intervention Programs is a study of approaches used by schools to reduce or prevent gang involvement among schools. Principals in a probability sample of 1,287 schools were asked what they were doing in their schools to prevent problem behavior or to promote a safe and orderly school environment. Responses of 848 principals reported a surprisingly large number of prevention and intervention activities, which were used as a basis for sampling programs for more detailed scrutiny. In a second phase, information was requested for 14 categories of intervention activity from more than 550 schools. Responses represented more than 16,000 students in 310 schools and more than 13,100 teachers in 404 schools. Data suggest that schools are  engaging in a great deal of activity to reduce problem behavior generally and to prevent or reduce gang involvement in particular. However, much of that activity is weak and would not be expected to have much of an effect because it fails to use practices known to be effective, is limited in intensity, or is extended to only a few individuals. The quality of school efforts could probably be improved through better training and supervision of intervention activities. Contains 14 tables. (SLD)",

        "description":"Factors that influence principals in decisions related to violence in schools were studied through semi-structured interviews with 12 junior high school principals in a large western Canadian school district. Participants were selected on the basis of their known involvement in school violence prevention initiatives. Several decision-making process components were identified: (1) identifying the problem; (2) responding to internal and external influences; (3) making decisions; and (4) evaluating decisions based on perceived outcomes. The principals interviewed conceptualized violence not as a problem, but as a symptom and response by students to unfulfilled needs that could often be met by the school. These principals made their decisions based on their expectations of what an  excellent schooling experience would offer the students and what the role of the school staff would be in providing this experience. Principals used many sources of influence and personal beliefs as filters through which they prioritized problem areas and determined the best course of action. (Contains 43 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The efforts of an urban middle school to involve parents in the functioning of the school by employing two parent representatives in an on-site parent center were studied. The school demonstrated its commitment to parent involvement by setting aside a classroom as a parent center and staffing it with two parent representatives, one African American and one Latina. Field notes from parent meetings and interviews with seven parents, the two parent representatives, four administrators, and the parenting class teacher also provided information about the program. Some rewarding interactions did occur between parents and educators at this school, but they were limited by a variety of factors and actually involved relatively few parents. The seeds for democratic participation were  planted by the diversity of the participating parents, the inclusive style of the parenting class, and the exposure of parents to the sociocultural knowledge of schooling that was transmitted in parent meetings. Overall, however, parents were not supported in gaining participation skills or opportunities to organize their own efforts. Data seem to reveal clearly that parental involvement in urban communities needs scaffolded support. Participation skills should be modeled for parents by peers who engage them in horizontal relations that allow them to learn without fear of being silenced, alienated, or embarrassed.

        "description":"Technical and vocational education and training should be considered within the more comprehensive concept of human resources development. To ensure that both the human and the professional aspects of vocational education are addressed, two major dimensions should always guide the design of training and human resource development: education and work. The educational dimension caters to individual needs and human aspects, whereas the work or economic dimension caters to societal needs and labor market requirements. The challenge to vocational education practitioners is to integrate these two dimensions. Three major factors are involved in the economics of vocational education systems: funding; costs, efficiency, and effectiveness; and evaluation and assessment. The social status  of vocational education in any society is, to a great extent, a reflection of the status of work values in that society. A rational and balanced approach can be realized if work activities are assessed both by their material and economic returns on the individual and society and by their social and humanizing influences. Although approaches to and systems of vocational education have developed along national lines, vocational education is no longer only a national concern. Globalized economies make the provision of vocational education a worldwide concern, and the integration of the human and market-driven aspects must be assessed in each culture. International agencies in the field of vocational education need to address the issue of the two perspectives of vocational education so that  preparation of workers and citizens can be as integrated as possible.

Growing ecological consciousness has necessitated that environmental knowledge become part of all education. As the need to remain competitive increases, a new balance in responsibility in the partnership between management and the work force has developed. Enabling people to cope successfully with anxiety and uncertainty has become one of the most important tasks of education. Learning to learn must become the overall objective of all education. All education, including vocational education and training (VET), must prepare young people for life by developing their intellect, aptitudes, and talents and by creating  opportunities for them to reach their full potential. A new global movement toward new VET standards is evolving. The European Training Foundation, which was founded in 1994, has assisted Central and Eastern European countries in restructuring their VET systems by providing the following: information agencies (called observatories), an expert network to support development and implementation of VET standards, pilot projects in partner countries, tailored advice, and an information network. Much has already been done to improve VET globally; however, much more creativity and investment is needed. (MN)",

The link between technical and vocational education (TVE) and individual and workplace economic productivity is well documented. Many countries are experiencing combinations of increasing populations of young people and high unemployment rates. Existing traditions of training and available human and financial resources provide little hope of providing access to TVE to the large numbers of people who need it worldwide. Change is essential to meeting the demands of enterprises that require a skilled workforce and people in need of TVE so that they can become economically productive. Challenges facing those seeking to improve access to TVE include the following: (1) development of alternative methodologies  (combining the best of distance education with the best of TVE, developing learning materials appropriate to students' gender and level of schooling, resolving issues related to intellectual property rights and copyrights, and using appropriate technology); (2) quality assurance (improving the credibility of TVE awards and of assessments of practical skills and making qualifications flexible and mobile); (3) development of appropriate policy and strategy; (4) reorienting educational institutions, teachers, and teacher unions; and (5) developing partnerships between and among trainers and enterprises, credential-granting agencies, the labor movement, and other trainers across the globe.

Continuous optimization and reform of production structures are essential procedures for ecology-geared corporate processes; therefore, corresponding training for all members of the workforce, from skilled workers to management, is a key factor in making this continuous improvement process possible. In many cases there is a lack of teaching and training materials directly related to business operations. Therefore, teachers and trainers frequently face the problem of how to integrate the issue of environmental protection in the instruction they provide in college or the workplace. As a response to this problem, an interdisciplinary  concept for environmental education was developed in the former East Germany to support teachers and trainers in their efforts to integrate sound environmental practices into initial vocational training in a systematic and practical manner. The concept was implemented in the form of manuals on environmental education relating to the following: industrial metalworking occupations, sanitation, heating and air conditioning engineering occupations, construction occupations, motor vehicle occupations, and chemicals occupations. The manuals can be adapted for use by various companies and used for online training. (KC)",

        "description":"Many more of the nation's youths deserve the opportunity to make the transition from school to college, casting the net of postsecondary education more widely and equitably. The necessity of encouraging more youths to participate in rigorous academics so they are ready to make a smooth transition to college has been recognized for some time. In the late 1960s, some states began to integrate academic and vocational education as a means of facilitating secondary-to-postsecondary transition. Reinforcing these ideas, federal vocational education legislation since 1972 has consistently emphasized secondary and postsecondary linkages, along with applied academics. Fundamental components of successful transition programs are as follows: (1) rigorous and engaging learning; (2) formal  articulation strategies; (3) implementation of articulation agreements; (4) local partnerships and advanced skills articulation; (5) meaningful linkages between theory and practice; (6) outcomes-focused curriculum; (7) identification of the primary outcomes; (8) exploration of new forms of assessment; (9) access and opportunity for all; (10) longevity through collaboration; and (11) accountability and quality in future transition initiatives. Enhanced school-to-college transition can create valuable educational opportunities for all students.

UFI's key role is to expand the demand for and supply of learning and to exploit the learning potential of information and communication technologies. The main UFI activities likely to impinge directly on local IAG services are Learning Direct and UFI Learning Centres. UFI would develop and run Learning Direct as a freely available public service, offering impartial information and advice on the full range of learning opportunities. Learning Direct would be made available on the Internet. A nationwide network of UFI-endorsed Learning Centres would offer learners points of entry into learning, learning  facilities, and learner support services; UFI Learning Advisors would offer advice and learner support. The government intends to promote a partnership approach to the delivery of local IAG services likely to involve a contract with a single lead organization. An important issue is the relationship of UFI and IAG partnerships to the new Lifelong Learning Partnerships, strategic bodies designed to bring greater coherence to local learning provision, and the development of local targets linked to the new National Targets for Education and Training. Recommendations have been made for the following: (1) Learning Direct and IAG partnerships; (2) UFI Learning Centres and IAG partnerships; (3) role of the lead organization in IAG partnerships; (4)a seamless service; (5) quality, (5) branding,  and (6) customer focus.

Multidimensional scaling was used to analyze the intercorrelation matrix, and a three-dimensional solution demonstrated only partial support for the circular ordering of interests. The theoretical consistency of the hexagonal arrangement was evaluated using a randomization test and yielded a correspondence index of only 0.24. A quasi-spherical configuration of interests emerged and the underlying dimensions of interests, namely things versus  people and data versus ideas were supported.

In these countries, a system of industrial relations comparable to those existing in western Europe is emerging gradually. Social partnership consists of negotiations between employers' and workers' organizations at different levels. It occurs mainly within tripartite bodies, consisting of government, employer, and employee representatives. A framework of social dialogue has been laid down in most countries and regulates the activities of and interaction between the social partners. In most countries, social partners' participation in the VET system has been  established by law that provides for their involvement in initial vocational education at the national level. Themes of the social dialogue include allocating financial resources, developing training and qualification standards, linking training institutions with enterprises, and identifying skill needs and planning training. Ways to develop VET are enhanced interaction between VET and needs of the labor market and economic policy, national measures to develop and manage the VET system, increased participation of social partners in training development, and connection between training and the initial VET system. (The second part of the report contains country summaries that offer an outline of the most important features of the respective national developments.) (YLB)",

        "description":"In the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, employment trends have been considerably more favorable than in Germany. A country is considered successful in an employment policy context if unemployment is falling steadily or is low and if employment is increasing steadily or the employment rate has reached a high level. Everywhere, low-skilled workers are affected by unemployment to a disproportionately high degree. In the United States, a lower rate of economic growth is sufficient to trigger a one percent increase in employment. The employment threshold, the level of economic growth that triggers an increase in employment, is close to zero in the United States. In Germany, the employment threshold is a Gross Domestic Product growth of about two percent and  shifting upward. The Netherlands and the United States show the highest increases in employment. Increases in the Netherlands are due to increased part-time employment predominantly among women who previously had a low labor force participation rate. In both countries, the increase in the population of working age people plays an important role. In regards to wage disparities, the European countries differ from the United States, where the disparities were considerably greater at the upper and lower ends and have increased even further over time. Common features for employment policy success are the following: (1) a comprehensive macroeconomic approach; (2) a favorable framework for investment and consumption; (3) liberalized markets for goods and services; (4) decentralized systems of  wage determination; and (5) moderate wage increases.

        "description":"The Industrialized Needs study identified the perceptions of Malaysian educators and employers regarding the role of vocational and technical education (VTE) in the economic development of Malaysia. The first survey used a random sample of 300 (276 responses) from the population of 4,316 VTE educators in public VT schools and polytechnics in Peninsular Malaysia. The second population was employers from large and medium-size manufacturing companies in Klang Valley and Selangor, 120 of whom became the sample of employers (53 responses). Based on the findings of the study, several conclusions were drawn: (1) both educators and employers believed VTE and training have assumed a major role in the economic development of Malaysia and that a substantial financial investment in VTE and  training was justified; (2) both groups were less certain regarding the employability skills of VT graduates; (3) educators and employers differed with regard to which factors helped or inhibited the restructuring of VTE, but both groups agreed that input from the private sector and technical exchanges between vocational institutions and business/industry were mutually beneficial; (4) they believed the public sector did an inadequate job in satisfying the human resource needs of the industrial sector; (5) both groups were unclear regarding factors that led to shortages of skilled workers; and (6) educators and employers differed regarding the government's role in satisfying the needs of VTE and the needs of business and industry. Ten recommendations for policy, practice, and future  research are offered. (Contains 12 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Five programs in the Bridges to Work demonstration have functioned as a labor market exchange--with the main services being job matching and transportation coordination--for job-ready inner-city workers and suburban employment. The logistics of transportation have been simple; the basics of employment have been an ongoing challenge. Sites have struggled with recruitment because of strong economic growth, insufficient credibility, and local employment organizations reluctant to work with Bridges. Revised recruitment includes expansion of original neighborhoods and more creative and flexible approaches to outreach. Since most participants were not job-ready, sites have added job readiness training and support for recent placements to boost retention. Four principles to guide  planning and implementation of transportation services are the following: flexible, extensive routes and schedules; punctual, reliable service; quick response to unplanned events and emergencies; and no transportation for other purposes. The Bridges program should include the transportation provider early in the program planning process, select one with the capacity and vehicles that best fit the program, select firms whose main business is transportation, and avoid changing providers. Bridges' experience shows transportation alone will not connect applicants and jobs. Intensive recruitment, job preparation, and retention services make more effective programs.

        "description":"U.S. citizens can get two to three times the educational and employment benefits now being obtained if all government funding for youth and adult basic education and job skills training is required to be directed to two investment strategies. The first is to increase intergenerational transfer of cognitive skills. Evidence from studies suggests that focusing funds on the education of the children's parents will lead to better educated, more employable parents, and more educable children. Findings are the following: (1) better educated parents produce better educated children; (2) the parents', and especially the mother's, education level is one of the most important determinants of school participation and achievement; and (3) better educated adults demand and get better  schooling for children. The second strategy is to teach using a functional context education approach to instructional design. Studies indicate that workplace literacy programs increase productivity not only at work, but also at home and in the community and schools, and that better educated adults produce safer communities conducive to learning. Youth and adult education and employment training programs should be required to obtain accountability data on the extent to which their programs improve adult participation in programs, improve achievement in functional context programs, improve prevention of future learning problems of adult students' children, and show how &quot;double duty dollars&quot; are being obtained.

The reality is that, throughout the world (including in Wisconsin), the biggest areas of job growth are in the service and sales sectors. Most of these jobs require short-term or moderate-length training or experience rather than long-term training. Furthermore, there is no evidence that increasing educational  levels or training can create jobs. Upgrading education and increasing people's educational levels are beneficial. The problem is on the demand side (creating living wage jobs) rather than on the supply side (education and training of workers). The ultimate paradox in education in the United States is that while some school reformers are calling for changes in secondary schools to follow European models, the European countries are enacting major reforms to make their schools more similar to U.S. schools.

EDPs are determined by employee needs, offered free of charge, and conducted outside working hours. EDPs were first implemented in the United States as part of the collective bargaining agreement between the United Automobile and Aeronautical Workers and the Ford Motor Company. EDPs are now being offered to employees in the United Kingdom and Australia as well. This article focuses on two EDP programs in Australia: the Geelong program and the Yarraville program. Benefits of the EDPs to the companies include the following: improved morale and team working; greater commitment  from employees to the company; improved industrial relations; lower labor turnover, absenteeism, and stress; more positive attitude toward change; creation of a culture of learning within the organization; and improved effectiveness of job-related training. The EDPs provided employees with the following benefits: improved confidence and self-esteem; renewed or new interest in learning; reduction in stress; and improved life and career prospects. Programs may be delivered in various ways ranging from &quot;taster&quot; workshops to 4- to 6-week introductory programs. Some of the courses that were offered in response to employee surveys included first aid for the home, introduction to computers and the Internet, low-fat cooking, and machine sewing. (MN)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the basic skills and employment prospects of current adult Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) recipients. It performed an analysis for the United States as a whole and separate analyses for nearly all the 75 most populous U.S. counties, plus the District of Columbia. These counties contained 43 percent of the nation's welfare caseload. Analyses were based on a measure of basic skills different from amount of formal schooling; the measure came from the National Adult Literacy Survey. (Individuals at the lowest level of literacy, level 1, were able to locate the expiration date on a driver's license or sign their names; those at level 2 could locate an intersection on a map or understand an appliance warranty.) Results for the United States as a whole  showed that typical TANF recipients had extremely low basic skills: 35 percent were at level 1, and 41 percent were at level 2. Because of low basic skills, the vast majority of jobs were not open to TANF mothers. The economy would have had to create six percent more jobs with very low basic skills (VLBS) to fully employ all welfare mothers. Separate analyses by county showed that the impact of welfare reform would vary greatly. In some counties, only 1 percent more jobs with VLBS were needed; in others, the number would have had to increase by more than 20 percent. Five of the twelve counties that would potentially have had the greatest difficulty moving their welfare recipients into jobs were in California. The study concludes that the need for improved basic skills among most current  and former welfare recipients is acute. (Appendixes contain 29 references, 3 tables, and additional study information.)

A total of 33 students and 9 staff members from two adult education programs were interviewed. The labeling processes used by the &quot;actors&quot; (the adult learners and educators) were analyzed from the perspective of the theory of social constructionism. The native actors used the concepts of culture, ethnicity, and immigrants interchangeably to construct the nonnative actors as outsiders. However, the main concept used by the native actors to construct the nonnative actors as outsiders was culture. The talk of the native actors manifested strong affirmation of cultural difference. In the natives' talk, the  nonEuropean/nonWestern cultures were conceptualized as the problem. &quot;Racialization&quot; of the concept of culture was another important aspect of the native actors' cultural discourse. The nonnatives defined themselves as outsiders and victims of the native actors' prejudices, and they viewed images of their culture as not only different but also inferior and a threat. Despite the fact that they shared many things in common, the native and nonnative actors talked as if they occupied a fixed identity or position. (Contains 87 references.) (MN)",

        "description":"A study used item response theory to examine the vocational interests of 2,709 high school students (1,436 males; 1,273 females) in Australia in relation to Holland's vocational interest typology (1973, 1985, 1997), which identifies six fundamental vocational types (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional) that link interests and work environments within the ambit of personality. Participants completed a 24-item questionnaire. Partial credit analysis was used to determine the location of the four questions that made up each of the vocational scales. Infit mean squares centered on 1.0 and separability was satisfactory for all scales (0.85 to 0.99) except the investigative scale. The conclusion was that scales and items conformed generally to the  measurement model. The analysis of items using a Rasch model provided new information on how individuals responded to items and the complexity of responses within interest categories. It was concluded that simple raw scores or summing scores may not offer a valid basis for assessment of interests. (Included are two tables and six figures that show the distances between rating scales on the six scales. Contains 15 references.) (YLB)",

First, policy in Ireland regarding guidance for adults in education is discussed in the context of the proposals adopted by the European Union (EU) Commission and EU Member States pursuant to the EU Year of Lifelong Learning in 1996. Recent literature on career guidance for adults is reviewed, and the concepts and theories that render the guidance needs of adult students different from those of younger students are highlighted. Then, the development of adult guidance policy in the United Kingdom is traced, and recent related initiatives in Scotland are briefly described. Presented next are the findings of a research study that was conducted by the Dublin Institute of Technology's College of  Marketing and Design to identify the current and future guidance needs of adults in schools and third-level colleges. It is concluded that the focus of guidance for Irish adults must be shifted to a lifetime perspective and that a national vision of adult educational guidance must be developed that includes linkages with noneducation-based guidance services (local employment services, unemployment resource centers, and area-based partnership initiatives).

        "description":"Much about designing learning experiences and supporting environments has been learned from the New Designs for Learning process. Looking at the history of education in the United States and high school change initiatives in other countries, project staff have found that designing schools for the future is a learning process in which staff, students, community, and designers work together to discover new ways to design a school's learning experiences and environment. The project staff had several goals for the characteristics and features of the learning experience and school design when the project, New Designs for the Comprehensive High School, was initiated. Goals included: (1) representing the leading edge of a new breed of schools that would create some new \"space\" in which  to think about the operation of high schools; (2) promising the idea of a common set of learner outcomes for all graduates; (3) relating learner expectations to the challenges and opportunities in work, family, community, and personal life; (4) operating the high school more as a learning community; (5) more closely aligning learner expectations, the learning process, the learning organization, and the learning environment; (6) drawing more attention to learning in contrast to teaching; (7) having a positive special character that gives more focus, coherence, and spirit to learning; and (8) wanting schools that don't cost any more to build or operate than existing schools. The design-down process has 12 learning elements: context, audience, signature, expectations, process, organization,  partnerships, staff and staff development, environment, celebration, finance, and accountability. Lessons for gaining agreement on decisions include looking inside and outside the school for design group members; involving those members from the beginning; using a clear and powerful process; relying on more than one way; and thinking comprehensively and long-term.

Under SSP, IA recipients who left IA and worked at least 30 hours per week were offered a generous but time-limited monthly earnings supplement. A short-term study of SSP established that nearly one-third of those offered the earnings supplement took full-time jobs and exited IA. In March 1995, a SSP was supplemented with a range of pre- and postemployment services. The new program was called SSP Plus. The impact of the SSP Plus program on employment patterns among IA recipients was examined in comparative analyses of regular SSP, SSP Plus,  and control groups. The additional services in SSP Plus led to an increase in the percentage of persons taking advantage of the supplemental offer (52% after implementation of SSP Plus versus 35% before). The additional services in SSP Plus led to a small increase in full-time employment, decrease in receipt of IA, and modest increase in after-tax family income.

In addition, administrators of all accredited schools and colleges and the corporate offices of schools that have such offices were asked to rate sections of the 12 standards in the 4 qualities specified in the federal regulation governing approval of accreditation agencies. The response rates obtained were as follows (usable responses/questionnaires sent, response rate): administrators (221/800, 27.6%); current students (386/1,508, 25.6%); graduates (188/1,559, 16.7%); and employers (250/1,559, 18.8%). Sixty percent of the 780 mean ratings received for the 195 specific requirements were  6.00 (on a 7-point scale) or higher, indicating that virtually all the administrators rated them with a 6 or 7. Only 4% were rated below 5, and none were rated below 4 (defined midpoint of the scale). The standards appeared to be producing their intended conditions and outcomes. To questions about the condition of buildings and classrooms, quality of instruction, and accuracy of information received before enrollment, at least three-quarters of current students and usually well over half of graduates and employers gave positive responses.

        "description":"From ancient Greece to the rise of modern science in the 18th and 19th centuries, liberal adult education was a predominant philosophy. Progressivism, which developed in opposition, had the greatest impact on adult education. It viewed the teacher as a guide, consultant, and resource; the learner as responsible for learning in partnership with the teacher; and education as an instrument of social change. Behaviorists took their basic principles from progressives, but emphasized using the scientific method to arrive at knowledge. Many adult programs adopted behavioral objectives and accountability concepts from the behaviorism movement; the greatest impact was in curriculum design and program development. The humanist movement emphasized development of the whole person. Paulo  Freire brought radical adult education on the scene; he spoke of using education to bring about social change. In the last 30 years, teachers experienced problems using the pedagogical model that ignored adults' needs and learning styles. Malcolm Knowles fostered the study of andragogy, the art and science of helping adults learn. Andragogical teaching incorporated the following research findings about adults: they desire to apply what they learn immediately and be independent and self-directing; and they need intrinsic motivation. Technological tools changed how to educate and deliver adult education. Distance delivery reached excluded populations. The teacher's new role was to link learners to resources and provide support for self-directed learning. (Contains 21 references.)  (YLB)",

        "description":"A cooperative learning model was used in Florida to change the state-mandated grade 12 course called Family Life and Sex Education, which had been found deficient in meeting students' educational and social needs. Pretest data before the change in model indicated a lack of knowledge that had a detrimental effect on thinking and problem-solving ability. A reading questionnaire indicated students did not read an adequate amount of materials to increase their knowledge. Classroom observations showed that many did not interact in a productive manner, display satisfactory work habits and study skills, share ideas and work, network, cooperate, or communicate. Possible contributing factors to ineffective instruction included the following: (1) a technical and anatomy-based curriculum  not structured toward the more important emotional and social issues; (2) textbook and materials that lacked relevant, contemporary information in an exciting, interesting format; (3) few provisions for alternate teaching methods; and (4) inadequately trained teachers. The cooperative learning model was designed to develop students' educational, social, and lifetime skills by motivating them with personal and group responsibilities. The cooperative reading and writing project increased appreciation for reading information on family life and human sexuality. Students felt more comfortable in small cooperative learning groups that provided intrinsic, social, and ego-integrative motives. The small cooperative groups also positively affected all students' academic achievement, increased  information retention, and enhanced self-esteem, social acceptance, and development of social and lifetime skills.

        "description":"Since 1993 and 1994, significant changes in legislation and policy allow women to fly combat aircraft, serve on combat ships, and serve in combat-related occupations. As was the case in the early 1990s, a large percentage of military women continue to work in the areas of health care, administration, personnel, and supply occupations. However, data suggest that military women, both enlisted and officers, are beginning to enter more nontraditional fields such as aviation, surface warfare, air traffic control, and field artillery. Although most military occupations and career fields are open to women, two institutional barriers have been identified that limit the number of women going into these occupations. First, because of Department of Defense and service policies, some units  are closed to women even though the units may include occupations that are open to women. Second, the test used to match enlisted personnel to occupations--the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery--contains sections based on exposure to a subject instead of aptitude. For example, one section tests knowledge of automotive components, systems, tools, and repairs--a subject to which women have had little exposure. (Appendixes include a list of military occupations opened to women in the early 1990s, a list of occupations with the greatest percentages of women, and 8 figures in addition to the 16 found in the text.)

        "description":"A study examined research conducted on the effectiveness of different welfare-to-work approaches. Five evaluations begun in the 1980s with five-year results indicated that programs focusing on rapid employment and job search activities combined with education and training activities more often increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare payments, when compared with programs that focused solely on job search activities or those that placed the greatest emphasis on education. Preliminary results (2-year findings) were obtained from a more recent ongoing evaluation started in 1992--the only evaluation designed explicitly to compare the effectiveness of a rapid-employment approach with an education-based welfare-to-work approach. The results showed that, although each  approach has increased participants' employment and earnings, neither approach has proven itself clearly better. The rapid employment approach did cost about half as much per person as the education-based approach. Recent studies of factors affecting cognitive development of children in welfare families indicated a mother's higher level of educational attainment was one factor that may positively affect children's development. A body of research on effects of poverty on children's educational attainment suggested a significant positive relationship between parents' and their children's educational attainment among welfare and non-welfare populations.

        "description":"Research on effectiveness of welfare-to-work approaches shows programs that combine approaches--job search assistance and education and training--have better employment and earnings outcomes than either approach alone. Consistent with findings and the work focus of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, states have been revising welfare programs to focus on moving people into employment rather than providing monthly cash assistance. States often expect clients to test the job market for a time before providing other services. Education and vocational training are largely reserved for those who need it to get or keep a job or to advance on a career ladder. As welfare agencies focus more on moving clients into jobs, goals and operations of the welfare  system have become increasingly similar to those of the work force development system. The two systems are working more closely to meet needs of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) clients. A review of seven state-sponsored studies and a recent nationwide study show that most adults who left welfare were employed at some time; many have returned to the welfare rolls. As welfare reform continues to evolve, attention should be paid to emerging challenges: develop ways in which systems can help the hardest-to-employ get and keep a job; enhance opportunities for low-wage workers to maintain employment and increase earnings; and develop ways to foster greater collaboration between the workforce development and welfare systems to meet employment needs of TANF clients.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to assess the rehabilitation counselor issues regarding the integration of spirituality into rehabilitation counseling. Rehabilitation counseling, from its inception, has espoused the concept of holism. The holistic approach to rehabilitation counseling recognizes the importance of working with the whole person, to include body, mind, and spirit. However, it is evident that the spiritual dimension of the client is totally excluded, rendering rehabilitation counseling comprehensive, but not holistic. Focus groups were conducted among public sector rehabilitation counselors to determine the issues related to the integration of spirituality. The sessions were audio recorded and later transcribed and analyzed. The data were arranged into dominant themes.  The emerging themes included: the need for relevant training; the complexity of the barriers to integration; the need to refer clients; the importance of maintaining neutrality; the importance of tailoring service delivery; the concern for legal issues; the importance of the counselors' own spiritual awareness; and the need for parameters and agency protocol. The consensus of the focus groups was that there was a definite need for the spiritual dimension to be integrated into the rehabilitation counseling process. The majority of the groups also indicated that integration was feasible, with the provision of academic or in-service training. Three appendixes provide a list of the questions used to guide the focus groups; a description of research procedures; statement of consent, agreement,  and attestation; and a form used to gather demographic information gathered from participants.

A technique that has been used in the learning literature was utilized, having participants write a letter to a friend describing in as much detail as possible how they had benefited from counseling. These written responses were transcribed and categorized according to their structure using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy categories of Prestructural, Unistructural, Multistructural, Relational, or Extended Abstract. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of the SOLO taxonomy for assessing the structure of learning outcomes  of counseling. The results suggest that an expanded SOLO known as the Structure of Learning Outcomes from Counseling (SOLOC) offers a promising and exciting way to view the outcomes of counseling within a learning framework. However, it should be noted that the data collection (Letter To Friend) used to classify clients requires a certain level of language and written expression abilities to complete. Other limitations of this study and future research are discussed. (Contains 25 references.) (MKA)",

Participants were asked to rate \"when you watch someone else smoke, how do they appear?\" on the following dimensions: inadequate, relaxed, anxious, physically fit, alert, energized, jittery, confident, inconsiderate, attractive, sophisticated, secure, immature, content, and intelligent. Significant generation main effects were found on 10 of the 15 characteristic dimensions. On all of these variables, faculty/staff perceptions were more critical than student perceptions. Significant smoking history main effects were found on  several variables. Ratings of perceived alertness, confidence, and physical fitness revealed former smokers to be more critical of smokers than those who had never smoked. In contrast, former smokers were less critical when evaluating the dimensions of anxiety, adequacy, jitteriness, and consideration of smokers. Significant generation by smoking status interactions were observed on three variables. On ratings of smokers' alertness and physical fitness, the faculty who had never smoked were more critical than their former smoking peers, whereas the most critical of all groups were those students who had quit smoking. This pattern was reversed for perceptions of smokers' maturity, for which former smoker faculty and those students who had never smoked were more critical than their  respective peers.

Participants completed a survey consisting of items pertaining to features and determinants of college students' smoking that measured their feeling associated with smoking behavior and perceptions of college-age smokers. Questions regarding smoking history were used to determine the participants' smoking status of never, former, or current. Across these three smoking status groups, no significant group differences were found on ratings of attractiveness, contentment, and sophistication. Attractiveness was rated similarly by all groups; raters generally perceived smokers as unattractive. Likewise, smokers  were viewed as generally unsophisticated and all groups perceived smokers as rarely appearing content. Overall ratings indicated that smokers were generally seen as rarely secure, intelligent, physically fit, or energized. On these variables, significant differences emerged among the three smoking status groups. However, although ratings of these characteristics were found to differ significantly across groups, no group gave these favorable characteristics a mean rating of rarely or higher, therefore indicating a pervasive negative view of smokers. On each of these four characteristics, current smokers gave the lowest ratings, which indicates that they hold the most negative views of smokers. Current and former smokers also gave more negative ratings of smokers' perceived confidence and  perceived alertness than those who never smoked. In contrast, on the remaining five characteristics, current smokers gave more favorable ratings than did the other two groups. Current smokers perceived smokers as appearing significantly less anxious, less jittery, more mature, more adequate, and more considerate than did the other two smoking groups.

Personal motivating factors examined were relaxation effects, image effects, competence effects, and stimulant effects. These personal reasons for smoking were indirectly assessed by measuring subjective feeling states that accompany smoking behavior. It was assumed that many of these states were desirable and that they played a role in shaping the smoker's motivation to use tobacco. The social factors investigated in this study were family income and parental smoking status. Results show that relaxation effects were rated more highly than image effects; image effects were higher than competence  effects; and competence effects were higher than ratings of stimulant effects. Smokers reported almost never feeling intelligent while smoking, yet reported that they quite frequently felt adequate during the process. No gender differences were found. Correlation was found between family income and student smoking status. In high-income families, 61.5% of fathers and 81.5% of mothers were nonsmokers, meaning that twice as many fathers as mothers were smokers. In low-income families, comparable numbers of mothers and fathers smoked; 66.7% of the fathers and 71.4% of the mothers were nonsmokers. (Contains 6 tables and 47 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"Instructional supervision is the use of monitored service for preservice training. It is supervision of more experienced students in order to teach less experienced ones. As a pedagogy of counselor education, instructional supervision is supervisory because it monitors an actual client, and instructional because it uses supervision as a pedagogic tool. In this study, prepracticum counseling laboratory students observed and participated in the live supervision of a practicum counselor. The counselor showed videotaped client sessions to a supervisor who was also the lab students' teacher. Students followed the practicum case over the semester, meeting weekly with the counselor and supervisor to observe and participate in supervision. The model of instructional supervision proposed  is a deployment of direct and vicarious learning opportunities defined as multiple roles and activities that vary for the same individuals. Roles are not assigned but emerge naturally as a result of overlapping tasks, interrelated perspectives, and group participation. The research of Goodyear and Bernard (1998) is used to examine the distinction between supervision and training. A brief review of instructional supervision literature within counseling supervision is presented. Finally, the model and theory of instructional supervision is described. The model is composed of four principal parts: target, purpose, format, and roles. Supported by the four principles, the model has the following attributes: vicarious and immediate observation; approximation; reflexibility and feedback; and  alternative constructivism. The model may be described in terms of development and individual differences, cognition, affect, and professional acculturation. (Contains 80 references.) (MKA)",

The predictor variables, which were procrastination tendency, self-efficacy, self-regulation, intrinsic value, outcome value, cognitive strategy, test anxiety, students grade goals, parent grade goals, and grade point average, as well as the criterion variable exam achievement, were measured for 168 college students. Using structural equation modeling, a best-fit model of college student motivation to achieve was determined. The model suggests that college students' self-regulation behaviors, intrinsic value for learning, and lack of test anxiety yield a level of self-efficacy for course achievement that combines with grade point average and parents' grade goals to influence student grade goals. The  combination of student grade goals, grade point average, and lack of test anxiety then demonstrate the strongest connection to achievement. (Contains one table, one figure, and 12 references.)

        "description":"This action research study examines the stressors that impact the lives of working mothers (N=11). Ethnographic field notes, personal interviews, and a series of eight weekly group meetings were used to collect data. The prevailing stress discourse does not adequately describe working single mothers' experiences of stress, but instead separates women's identities into dichotomies (i.e., work and family). The new conceptual framework for stress that guided the design of this study moved beyond dualistic models that isolate the working mothers' experiences toward a more complex analysis, learning about the cospecification of both work- and nonwork-related stressors. This analysis consisted of contextualizing the women's lives in relation to Newton's (1995) five themes: history,  gender issues, collective experience, emotions, and politics, as well as other interlocking variables such as age, race, class, and sexuality. Results indicate that dualistic models fail to describe the multiple realities in working single mothers' lives, and that the dominant stress discourse, which is individualistic, apolitical, and ahistoric, does not fully capture these women's experiences. A new conceptual framework that challenges the dominant stress discourse is presented. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/MKA)",

The statewide school survey monitors trends in substance use among public school students, identifies emerging problem areas, and serves as a basis of comparison for local school surveys which are conducted annually by various school districts throughout the state. The 1998 survey results were based on responses from 91,168 students from 66 participating school districts in the state. In addition to the prevalence of alcohol and drug use, this study addresses aspects of peer, parent, and school influences on substance use behaviors at a very early age when prevention and intervention is most effective. Chapter 1 is concerned with patterns of substance use and covers  tobacco, alcohol, inhalants, and marijuana. Chapter 2 provides demographic correlates of substance use. Chapter 3 gives protective and risk factors related to substance use. Appendix A is the survey instrument; Appendix B contains 15 prevalence tables; Appendix C contains 5 additional tables; and Appendix D is a description and history of the survey and describes its limitations.

The supervisor needs to look at two dimensions: personal lives of teachers and their professional growth in reading instruction. Reading teachers should make their needs known to the supervisor to strengthen the classroom environment, and conversely, the supervisor needs to be a good listener to problems in reading instruction as expressed by teachers. Reading supervisors need to be approachable; they should welcome teachers to identify reading problems faced in the classroom. The reading supervisor must  realize that the community has expectations that pupils will become better readers. Parents should have the opportunity to meet with both teacher and supervisor. The supervisor may be chairperson and organizer of inservice education, workshops, and faculty meetings involving reading instruction. Supervisors and reading teachers need to guide students in developing an attitude of respect toward themselves and others, in an atmosphere of democracy. Students could make suggestions as to what to emphasize and study. The supervisor needs to be well versed in different kinds of software as well as in criteria to use in evaluating these products.

There are advantages as well as disadvantages for whole language approaches in reading instruction. Needs differ from pupil to pupil. Thus a learner may need little or no phonics to identify unknown words, while another learner may need much phonics to become a proficient reader. If a pupil cannot identify a word, perhaps phonics instruction is needed at that point. Based on needs, the following individual programs of instruction should be adopted for a personalized program of reading instruction: (1) Reading Recovery; (2) basal texts (carefully  chosen); (3) library books; (4) Big Books; and (5) experience charts for early primary grade pupils. If the pupil's needs in reading are looked at, this might well minimize the debate on whole language versus phonics. (Contains 12 references.) (NKA)",

        "author":["Corso, Marjorie"],
        "description":"This paper discusses a multi-part longitudinal study which compared the developmental movement levels and the academic learning level in young children, noting that the relationship between movement education and academic education is based on the assumption that both realms of learning are dependent on the adequate development of the brain. The paper states that the focus in this part of the study is on the transverse midline. It explains that the concept of body-space awareness is that the transverse midline divides the upper part of the body from the lower part of the body; in paper-space awareness the transverse midline divides the upper half of the paper from the bottom half of the paper. The paper reports that there are some children in every primary classroom who  desperately want to learn to read and write, but they are not working up to grade level. This study suggests that children who have not mastered the coordination of their arms and legs in movement patterns have poor work habits and poor organizational skills in the classroom. The paper describes the process of developing the physiology of the brain and nervous system by starting with large muscle movements and proceeding to the small muscle movements. It also suggests how classroom teachers should proceed with children with organizational problems and outlines the types of activities and skills these children should practice. Contains several illustrations and 21 references. (NKA)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of commercially produced phonics software upon the phonemic awareness of students studying reading with the Herman Method for teaching reading. Participants were 13 middle school students in a self-contained or comprehensive developmental special education classroom. The control group of six students did not use the software, while the treatment group of seven students did. Pretests and posttests were given to each student. Every student received 25 minutes of reading instruction along with 25 minutes of handwriting instruction every day. Every student also received 25 minutes of computer time each day, with the treatment group using the interactive software program &quot;Curious George Learns Phonics&quot; three times a week. All of the students benefited from  receiving instruction in the Herman Method, as shown by an increase in scores on each of the subtests. The treatment group did not show a significant difference from the control group when statistical comparisons were made. All students, however, should have access to commercially produced phonics software within the classroom; students who used the software appeared to have less difficulty with rhyming words than those students who did not use the software.

The research took place in a transition class (a class between kindergarten and first grade for students who are not mature enough for first grade but who do not need to repeat kindergarten) in Knox County (Tennessee) Schools. The class was divided into two groups with seven children in each group. The letter books T and F were chosen for the research. The control group received instruction in the letter book and in traditional paper and pencil activities. The experimental group received instruction in the letter book, but they also received 20 minutes of computer instruction a day. The computer and traditional practice of the letters was done independently by the students with little or no  assistance from the teacher. The following hypothesis was stated: there is no difference in learning as measured on the teacher created pre-test and post-test between the children in a transition class who had used the computer software as a supplement to the regular reading curriculum and those transition students who had not used the computer software, at the 0.05 level. Statistically there was no difference between the control and the experimental group in the pre-test scores, thus proving that the two groups were equal at the beginning of the study. Post-test scores were analyzed and differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. (Contains 18 references and 2 tables of data.) (RS)",

In addition, it investigated the relationship between specific home and school parent involvement activities and student reading scores. Specifically, connections between reading comprehension achievement and the following parent involvement variables were examined: (1) homework involvement; (2) reading together; (3) monitoring of television viewing; (4) volunteering in the school; and (5) supporting school activities. Data for the study was obtained from surveys given to teachers, the Title 1 students, and their parents. Reading achievement scores were obtained from fall and spring  administrations of the reading comprehension subtest from the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and the gains between the two measures. Findings did not indicate any significant relationships between reading comprehension achievement and the total degree of involvement by parents, teacher, and students--individually or all together--on the learning compact. When specific parental involvement variables were examined, however, some differences among the groups emerged. A significant positive association was found between the degree of homework involvement and achievement while a significant negative relationship was found between the level of parental support and reading achievement. Parents' answers to the open-ended questions indicated that 38.8% of them would like less demands on parents or  changes made in the school climate. The usefulness of an unidimensional index of parental involvement is called into question and the results are discussed within the context of instructional implications.

The study incorporated an analysis of existing databases, a systematic review of the research literature on reading interventions, and the analysis of a survey of funded projects (Reading Recovery (tm), Early Literacy Learning Initiative, full-day kindergarten, and other early literacy interventions). Four research questions were addressed: What is the early literacy challenge in Indiana? Did the funded school corporations implement interventions with a high probability of success? What is the most appropriate way to evaluate the impact of the program? and How can  the administration of the Early Literacy Intervention Grant Program be enhanced to further improve program impact? Key findings indicated that: (1) the program reached school corporations that were in need of supplemental services; (2) the funded projects used intervention methods that have inherently high probability of increasing the number of Hoosier children who read on grade level by the end of third grade; and (3) the costs of these interventions were reasonable, relative to their anticipated effects.

        "description":"Although scholars have called for greater attention to informational texts in the early grades for some time, there have been few data available about the degree to which informational texts are actually included in early grade classrooms, and in what ways. This study provides basic, descriptive information about informational text experiences offered to children in 20 first-grade classrooms selected from very low- and very high-SES (socio-economic status) school districts. Each classroom was visited for 4 full days over the course of a school year. On each visit, data were collected about the types of texts on classroom walls and other surfaces, in the classroom library, and in classroom written language activities.  Results show a scarcity of informational texts in these  classroom print environments and activities--there were relatively few informational texts included in classroom libraries, little informational text on classroom walls and other surfaces, and a mean of only 3.6 minutes per day spent with informational texts during classroom written language activities. This scarcity was particularly acute for children in the low-SES school districts, where informational texts composed a much smaller proportion of already smaller classroom libraries, where informational texts were even less likely to be found on classroom walls and other surfaces, and where the mean time per day spent with informational texts was 1.9 minutes, with half the low-SES classrooms spending no time at all with informational texts during any of the 4 days each was observed.  Strategies for increasing attention to informational texts in the early grades are presented. Contains 100 references, and 5 figures and 4 tables of data. (RS)",

        "description":"A longitudinal research study observed 30 children between the ages of infancy and elementary age to determine if using large muscle motor patterns to master the three identified midlines that concur with the body planes used in anatomy is reflected in academic classroom learning levels. This third part of the study focused on the frontal midline. Results indicated that there was consistency between the four sources of data: (1) pre-kindergarten demographic data records reported by the parents; (2) the children's report cards analysis given by the teacher; (3) the physical education teacher's evaluation of the skill levels of the children; and (4) the parents evaluation of neurological development as specified by a given book. Findings suggest that these children tend to be mixed  eye/hand dominant or left-hand dominant, and reports that these children appeared to prefer to move backward. The paper suggests activities to aid these children in overcoming their difficulties. (SC)",

        "description":"This paper contends that a person's readiness for academic learning should be based on his/her developmental readiness, not on chronological age requirements. Human beings develop at their own neurological rates (biological clock). The paper first cites research on a \"sensitive learning period\" in which learning is mastered in a more efficient manner. It then traces three imaginary midlines used to better evaluate children's developmental levels both in body-space and paper-space, defines the terms used for different types of skills, and provides examples of these skills. The paper suggests activities to develop these different skills in combination with reading, writing, math, spelling, and social studies. It also offers the following insights: (1) use movement activities that  encourage the child to be active; (2) a child learns only when things interest him/her; (3) children enjoy playing because it is challenging to them, not because it is easy for them; and (4) some children learn primarily through the kinesthetic (moving and tactile) mode. The paper concludes with a list of messages that parents often send to young children about learning developmental motor skills and another list of messages that children often hear from their teachers at school.

Since Writer's Workshop is an essential part of this process, an examination of the effects of first graders' participation in Writer's Workshop was studied to determine whether or not this enabled them to become more confident writers, and also whether or not this enabled them to become more proficient in using descriptive words in their writing. It was hypothesized that first grade students do not become more confident writers, nor do they become more proficient in using descriptive words in their writing by participating in Writer's Workshop. This study compared the effects of Writer's Workshop on 24 first grade students in the East Brunswick Public School District. The  class consisted of 12 girls and 12 boys. The children participated in Writer's Workshop on a weekly basis and they were administered pretests and posttests to measure any changes in their attitudes towards writing. The results of the data showed that this particular class' participation in a weekly Writer's Workshop did permit the children to become more confident writers, as well as allow them to become more proficient in using descriptive words in their writing. The findings of this study did not support the hypothesis. Contains 32 references and 2 tables of data; appendixes contain pre- and post-test questionnaires and a writing rubric. (Author/RS)",

Five students from each classroom were interviewed in an attempt to determine their definition of spelling and their use of spelling strategies. Findings suggest that there is no one way to teach spelling; when teachers use programs that correlate highly with their beliefs about what is important in spelling  instruction, they consider their students to be successful spellers. Recommendations include: words in a spelling list should be related to a common generalization or rule; if students choose their own words to learn, several words should be selected from which additional words with the same patterns can be generated; students should be involved in word play activities; students should be involved in many opportunities to write for &quot;real&quot; reasons; and spelling grades should be determined on the correctness of spelling in written work.

        "description":"A writing instructor has grappled with how both to integrate and to complicate critical perspectives on technology in the writing classroom. In collaboration with another instructor, a computer classroom pedagogy was constructed emphasizing imperatives of cultural studies practice as outlined by James Berlin. The pedagogy is similar to Berlin's emphasis in its relationship to media and technological issues addressing both public and private space. The instructors assign the class to read and review a map concerning world-wide web connection regulations and to be prepared to discuss the map in relationship to cultural issues. These discussions prompted a student complaint that \"technology did complicate our lives and that it was making us all lazy thinkers.\" The class focused  intently on how technologies relate to cultural issues. Instructors realized that a personal engagement with the students was necessary in order to draw out their experiences with technology. Critiquing teachers' and students' narratives and metaphors of technology is a beginning point in a fluid, non-neutral process of engaging students in an effort to deconstruct oppressive power relations. Multiple mappings, shifting meanings, institutional pressures and ever-present risks are all parts of the electronic writing classroom. Contains 23 references. (SC)",

In southern education, liberal figures like college presidents William Louis Poteat (Wake Forest University) and Harry Woodburn Chase (University of North Carolina) readily fit the progressive label, along with education pioneers such as Wil Lou Gray, who started a vocational school that sparked the  technical education movement in South Carolina and Cora Wilson Stewart, a founder of the Kentucky Literacy Commission. The progressive movement in the South, however, meant &quot;progressive for whites only.&quot; The paper considers in detail the accomplishments of Laura Bragg, the first woman in the country to direct a museum, and of John Andrew Rice, the founder of Black Mountain College, and discusses the idea of the museum as a progressive educational institution.

        "description":"If an instructor teaches in a rhetoric and composition program, one of the most important ways to teach discourse study as a resistance to discourse theory is by tracing the fundamental founding dichotomies of discourse theory through the history of rhetorical theory, examining how assumptions of the legitimacy of such founding dichotomies has conditioned the development of the current understanding of rhetoric. A graduate course on rhetoric and hermeneutics explores the relationships between reading and writing as they are understood in today's theory and practice. The guide used is Kathy Eden's 1997 text &quot;Hermeneutics and the Rhetorical Tradition: Chapters in the Ancient Legacy and Its Humanist Reception.&quot; One controversy over disputed texts which Cicero cites is &quot;the  discrepancy between the writer's words and the writer's intention, routinely formulated as either 'scriptum' versus 'voluntas' or 'scriptum' versus 'sententia.'&quot; Eden traces this assumption back to Aristotle's &quot;Poetics.&quot; Augustine's description of the tropes as topics of interpretive invention rather than as grammatical deviations is possible because he never makes an ontological distinction between signs and things in the first place. Introducing graduate students to thinkers such as Augustine enables them to engage the history of discourse about discourse more critically. (NKA)",

The analysis began with student voices and experiences as the researchers tried to peel away the multiple layers of their teaching and learning--several high school students were contacted and asked if they would be willing to talk about their experiences with the writing curricula in their respective schools. Focus group sessions were conducted with two different groups (n=7), and the conversations were organized around their writing experiences in and out of high school, specifically on  the writing curricula. The conversations with the students are described and analyzed. First, the paper contextualizes the students' school experience and provides a review of their reactions to this highly structured, highly regulated writing environment along with their suggestions for how to improve their writing experiences. The paper then chronicles the cognitive dissonance these students are subjected to as a result of conflicting personal and institutional conceptions of writing and suggests that their experiences argue convincingly for a more postmodern, aesthetic writing curriculum. The possible consequences of not reconceptualizing the high school writing curriculum are explored. Contains 17 references. (NKA)",

The curriculum's six goals state that, as a result of education in grades K-12, students independently and collaboratively, will be able to: (1) choose and apply strategies that enhance the fluent and proficient use of language arts to construct meaning of written, visual, and oral text; (2) understand, appreciate, and respond to texts from many literary periods,  genres, and cultures; (3) apply knowledge of language structure and conventions to write and speak English proficiently to communicate ideas clearly; (4) create works using the language arts in visual, oral, written, and performance-based forums for a variety of audiences and purposes; (5) use available forms of media and technology as an integral part of language arts experience; and (6) gather, analyze, and respond to information from primary and secondary sources. The curriculum presents performance standards and assessment strategies and suggests instructional activities for each of the six goals in grades K through 12. Five appendixes offer: policy/belief statements; suggested instructional strategies; a written communication: grammar and usage matrix; an assessment overview; and 26  references. (NKA)",

For example, a student teacher and a cooperating teacher in a second/third grade heterogeneously grouped classroom first read a self-composed couplet aloud to their students who then brainstormed for rhyming words. After that, students volunteered to write couplets themselves. Students enjoy working with rhyming words and do see the connection between reading and writing. After composing the couplets, students can progress to triplets and quatrains. A limerick can also be read aloud to students, and the teacher can  then ask questions about limericks, alliteration, and onomatopeia. Students benefit from listening to and composing rhyming poetry and from word play. Phonics also stresses playing with sounds, phonemes, morphemes, and words. (NKA)",

        "author":["Zarnowski, Myra"],
        "description":"The current trend in adult nonfiction is to incorporate greater and greater amounts of fiction into what is marketed as nonfiction. This trend is mirrored in today's nonfiction for children. Sometimes fictional characters are introduced and their stories are meant to serve as a vehicle for keeping the young reader's interest; sometimes stretches of undocumented dialogue are included; sometimes liberties are taken with chronology. An idea that frequently emerges during discussions of fictionalizing is that fiction somehow provides a &quot;higher truth&quot; that can only be achieved when writers are not constrained by facts. A different way of seeing the changes in nonfiction is as a catalyst, as a means of deepening a reader's understanding of information. Even when telling the truth,  authors can use storytelling notions. Rhoda Blumberg's &quot;What's the Deal? Jefferson, Napoleon, and the Louisiana Purchase&quot; (1998) taps the reader's understanding of the well formed story by providing five scenarios which could have happened but did not, and similarly, in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1998), Diane Stanley uses the power of story to ask readers to imagine what it was like living during the Hundred Years' War. In evaluating the changes in nonfiction for children it has to be determined whether intermingling fact and fiction is a catalyst or a catastrophe.

The instructional goal later will be to teach toward a &quot;limited&quot; number of items exhibited by most of the class, those not attributable to the normal process of language acquisition (maturity) or to interference (in the case of bilingual students). Instruction should be concerned with those word choices which distinguish standard English from nonstandard dialects. Usage choices should be appropriate to the speaker/writer's purposes and  appropriate to the context. Classroom games can be used to teach usage forms in a positive way in elementary and middle schools so that students can develop better communication skills.

        "description":"A case study, part of a larger 5-year Excellence in English (EIE) research project, focused on the Dade County (Florida) School District's Division of Language Arts/Reading. Over a 2-year period, four middle and high school English programs in Dade County were studied as part of the EIE project; this part of the project focused on the professional lives of teachers and the practices that support student achievement, specifically describing the interactions between teachers and language arts/reading administrators in the Dade County schools. The study was carried out over one school year, September 1997 through June 1998. Results indicated that in the search for the philosophical base for interactions, three themes emerged: knowing what the research says and sharing it; knowing  and staying grounded in the classroom through ongoing dialogues and interactions; and knowing what is good for students and teachers and having a passion for doing it. Data showed that administrators support language arts/reading teachers in four important ways: by bringing experts to the teachers; by seeing the teachers as experts; by developing expertise together through professional dialogues and workshops; and by letting the teachers know they are special. Comments of teachers and students give a sense of the positive impact of the interactions between the central office and teachers and students; assessments used in the district and across the state give a measurable sense of impact of these interactions on teaching and learning.

Dodge Poetry Festival, during which thousands of people gathered for four days to listen to, read, discuss, and celebrate contemporary poetry. The packet can be used in arts and social studies classes as well as in English and literature classes. Featured poets represent different cultural perspectives, determined in part by differences in gender, age, and ethnic background. Included in the packet are &quot;poet cards&quot; (featuring poems, poets' statements, biographical notes, photographs, discussion questions, and suggested activities), time grid, selected bibliography, and a guide to building a core high school poetry collection.  It is recommended that teachers use the packet's materials in the following ways: preview the programs and read each poem carefully before making class assignments (there may be sensitive and/or disturbing subjects); decide which segment and/or specific poems to offer to the class, and use the time code on the folder to identify and cue each segment; become familiar with all &quot;poet cards&quot;; use quoted statements by each poet to spark discussion about the poet's perspective on poetry and/or about poetry in general; use the single, introductory question for each poet to help students enter a poem by reminding them that poetry connects directly to their lives; stimulate imaginative experimentation and cross-fertilization by modifying, adapting, and re-applying &quot;poet card&quot; activities to  students' capacities; consider the relationship of printed text to actual performance; and consult the &quot;Fooling with Words&quot; World Wide Web site for additional poems and expanded statements about poetry.

Twenty pre-freshmen students participated in the program. In addition to whole-class instruction, students met individually with instructional coordinators. During these meetings students graphed their self-efficacy estimates along with their actual writing scores. These graphs helped students become more accurate in monitoring their writing performance and employing useful strategies to improve their learning. Over time, students improved their writing skills and became more accurate in their self-efficacy judgments. Students who participated in the self-efficacy intervention outperformed the students who were  involved in the regular remedial summer writing course.

It considers four principles for teaching, the development of a model for teaching and application of that model, and a way to support students throughout the learning process without continual  attention from the teacher.

Research aims were to: identify the key factors of what effective teachers know, understand, and do that enables them to put effective literacy teaching into practice; identify the strategies that would enable those factors to be more widely applied; examine aspects of continuing professional development that contribute to the development of effective teachers of literacy; and examine what aspects of their initial teacher training and induction contribute to developing expertise in novice teachers of literacy. A questionnaire surveyed the qualifications, experience, reported beliefs, practices and preferences in  the teaching of literacy of a group of 228 teachers identified as effective literacy teachers. Observations of literacy lessons and interviews were conducted with 26 of these teachers, and a &quot;quiz&quot; tested teachers' literacy knowledge. Findings suggest that effective teachers of literacy: believe it is important to make it explicit that the purpose of teaching literacy is enabling their pupils to create meaning using text; centered their teaching around &quot;shared texts&quot;; teach aspects of reading/writing such as decoding and spelling in a systematic, structured way; emphasize to their pupils the functions of what they were learning in literacy; have developed strong and coherent personal philosophies about the teaching of literacy; have well-developed systems for monitoring children's  progress and needs in literacy; and have had considerable experience of in-service activities in literacy.

The two major reasons for this organizational decision are resource-based (i.e. due to the scarcity of computers in the classroom) and educational, stemming from an increased use of cooperative learning methods. In order to improve the quality of children's collaborative work at the word processor, it is important that some attention is paid to the nature of their interactions during the writing process. Such interactions can reveal important information about writing and learning processes and about the impact of the computer. In this paper we shall present and illustrate a newly developed analytic method, based on functional analysis, which can be used to  investigate the nature of children's verbal interactions during the collaborative writing process at the computer. The theoretical framework of the method will be briefly described and located in socio-culturally based ideas of learning. Possible applications of the analysis method will then be discussed and a possible agenda for research outlined. Contains 42 references. (Author/RS)",

        "description":"This research project began as a quest to investigate more effective ways of addressing the needs of Developmental Reading and Writing students by using non-traditional pedagogies. (By non-traditional pedagogies, the paper means an escape from the traditional model in higher education of addressing reading and writing as two separate content areas.) Traditionally, students enrolled in two separate developmental reading and writing classes as determined by their scores on the Texas Academic Skills Program (TASP) test. This is a state mandated and administered test in reading, and writing, and mathematics. Students who do not pass the test are required to enroll in developmental (non-credit) courses until they are able to successfully pass all three content areas. In the past, the  majority (79%) of developmental students could not break the cycle of failure. Furthermore, such students were in jeopardy of performing poorly in academic classes across the university. The paper centers on a theoretical discussion of the relationship between language and thought which lays the foundation for three perspectives vital to this study: Connecting Reading and Writing, Critical Literacy, and Feminist Theory. It argues that these three perspectives provide a useful framework to test the assumptions, design curriculum, and develop classroom methods to better address student needs. The second half of the paper concentrates on how these three perspectives guided instructors' decision-making and applications in the classroom. (Contains about 50 references and a table of data.)

        "description":"This paper examines students' practical knowledge to visualize and to design methods by which writing can be addressed across the curriculum. During two semesters of a teacher preparation course, Content Area Reading and Writing in Secondary Education, students discussed how Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) could be better incorporated by educators across the university campus in both traditional and non-traditional disciplines that are often not associated with writing. These secondary majors represented a wide variety of disciplines including Agriculture, Art, Business, Computer Science, English, Foreign Language, History/Geography, Home Economics, Industrial Technology, Health/Kinesiology, Mathematics, Music, Psychology/Philosophy, Science, and Theater. Even seasoned  educators have difficulty incorporating writing as a pedagogical tool across the curriculum, particularly in those content areas that traditionally do not emphasize writing. In fields such as music, industrial arts, kinesiology, art, and other non-writing classes, educators often face the problem of determining how writing may be utilized. One solution to this problem may be to look to students, rather than educators, for ideas on how writing may be incorporated in a variety of disciplines. Students' comments are discussed in relation to current theoretical assumptions about the relationship between writing and thought. (Contains 22 references and a table of data.) (Author/SC)",

The inquiry is a recursive and spiraling process. The goals and procedure arise through the research undertaken in conversation with experiences remembered and reconsidered. Narratives of the researcher's life as facilitator read through different forms and voices help draw his attention to his practice. By exploring these his identity can begin to be seen in the flux and flow of a spiral--no static &quot;I&quot; is written about nor is one &quot;experience&quot; focused on. Theater plays with forms of text and languages. Writing about the process of coming to know an  identity-in-process as a drama facilitator is an exploration of how the researcher is becoming what he is continually becoming. The processes of self discovery can only happen if both facilitator and participants are engaged in it. (Contains 15 references.) (NKA)",

It then responds in some detail to Kenneth E. Anderson's paper, &quot;A Code of Ethics for Speech Communication&quot; (&quot;Spectra,&quot; 1984). The paper offers materials for developing a code of ethics that binds communicators and provides a values framework and moral structure of multicultural communication ethics. It  also presents a model for developing a classroom speech to describe a multicultural collaborative interaction, including an audience collaboration questionnaire and assessment materials. The paper concludes with definitions of multicultural spoken interaction skills. Contains a figure, Multicultural Collaborative Communication, and 11 references. (NKA)",

        "description":"A study examined how to teach computer skills to future professionals in communications. The context of the study was the communications department in a mid-sized Finnish university. Data was collected on computer use and attitudes to computers and computer-mediated communication by means of surveys and learning journals during the Communications Technology Courses arranged in 1994-1998; follow-up data was gathered by means of email during spring semester 1998. Yearly improvement in the computer skills of university entrants was noted. An analysis of the journals revealed four types of learners: I-know-nothing-about-computers, computers-are-not-for-me, computers-are-tools, and I-know-just-about-everything-about-computers. Most of the university entrants with poor self-reported  computer skills and a negative attitude to computers reported better computer skills and a more positive attitude to computers within weeks or months after entering the university. Most of the entrants with good skills and a positive attitude reported better skills and even more positive attitudes. An analysis of the reasons for changes (&quot;turning points&quot;) in the students' computer use and attitudes highlights peer group influence (email contacts with friends and direct help from friends), access to computers, courses (the Communications Technology Course and other courses), and learning-by-doing. The students showed differences in perceived usefulness of the Communications Technology Course, in computer anxiety and in the adoption of an overly critical attitude to computers. In contrast,  gender differences were small. As future communications professionals, the students were highly motivated to become confident users of computers. Contains 13 references. (Author/RS)",

The data are collected from state education agencies, processed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and then verified by the National Center for Education Statistics. The report answers three basic questions: How many students were enrolled in elementary and secondary public schools in 1997-98? How many staff members were paid to teach, supervise, and provide support services for education? and How many students graduated from high school in 1996-97? All staff counts are in full-time-equivalency units. Results show that 46 million students were enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools in the 50 states and the District  of Columbia. Of these, 25.7 million were in prekindergarten through grade 6. Among the states, California had the most students and Wyoming counted the fewest. About 2.7 million full-time-equivalent teachers provided instruction, and among this group, 1,519,000 were elementary school teachers. In addition to the teachers, about 556,000 teachers' aides directly assisted teachers in providing instruction. An additional 35,000 instructional coordinators and supervisors helped teachers through curriculum development and inservice training. Some 2,341,000 students received regular high school diplomas, and an additional 185,000 students received other diplomas. (RJM)",

The article outlines prior consultations on reform initiatives and discusses the new funding model proposed by the legislature that wrested control of taxation away from the school boards and allowed the assignation of funds without further approval of the legislature. It describes the formulas used in the new funding model and how these formulas are seen as inferior to prior models. The paper  summarizes some of the court challenges to the new law, the chaos introduced by the constant changes to the law's implementation, and the problems raised by the new law, such as severe reductions in operating funds and new school construction. Changes to collective-bargaining procedures, teachers' pension plan, transportation, curriculum and funding, and special education are also discussed.

The Easton Model provides a means of understanding policy development from a micropolitical perspective and offers analysis of environmental influences on policy decision making and implementation, allowing the model to accommodate the fact that decision making, policy development, and implementation are influenced by the needs, demands, and quirks of outside influences. Drawing on the literature on women's leadership styles, the paper focuses on women as educational leaders, evaluating whether their leadership styles would have greater chances of success within Easton's systemic model of policy processes. It provides an overview of the Easton Model, offers an  example using the model, analyzes successful leaders using the model, discusses women's leadership styles, gives examples and amplifications of women's leadership practices, and discusses the representation of women in the Easton Model. The article concludes that although the model is superior to earlier models, it is still based on traditional concepts of leadership and organizations and thus ignores or diminishes the experiences and values of women who fall outside hegemonic norms, perpetuating the absence of studies on women's leadership practices and philosophies.

An overview of each of the three factors is provided. For the study, a closed-ended questionnaire was administered in 1997 to 930 teachers employed in schools located in northern Israel. Respondents were asked to refer to their current school principal when answering the survey. The findings show that teachers' perceptions of occupational prestige, self-esteem, autonomy at work, and professional self-development contribute the most to job satisfaction. This variable served as a mediating variable between  principals' leadership style and teachers' satisfaction. Principals' decision-making style was found not to affect teacher satisfaction significantly, though teachers preferred to work with a principal who exhibited a transformational type of behavior rather than a transactional one. The more teachers perceived their teaching job as a profession and central to their lives, the more they were satisfied with it. (Contains 40 references, 3 tables, and 2 figures.) (RJM)",

It focuses on the crisis of confidence as American schools struggle between two competing &quot;philosophies&quot; of education: the traditional and the progressive. The paper outlines the tension created by youthful rebelliousness and the conservatism of elders and how the counterculture of the 1960s foisted an unrelenting attack on established authority. The ensuing struggle between traditional and progressive approaches saw the ascension of progressive ideas--ideas that have generated controversy and weakened the social consensus necessary for effective schools. As a result, current educational practices may be seen as coalescing into two groups, depending on the approach taken for various dimensions of  schooling. Traditional education has become associated with concepts like subject-centered teaching, standards, examinations, structure, order, work discipline, memorization, mastery of subject content, order, and accountability. Notions that have attached themselves to progressive education include child-centered instruction, emotions, activity, relevance, discovery, critical thinking, growth, and creativity. The paper concludes that no matter what pedagogical reasons might be given to justify a given educational practice, there remain psychological and social implications that ultimately speak to the social values underlying traditional and progressive practices.

(2) How do rationales for entrepreneurial education in the U.S., the U.K., and Finland differ? and (3) How can the discovered ways of seeing be patterned as intertextual spaces of debate? Data for the study were selected from texts in all three countries, representing a wide array of positions. Following overviews of entrepreneurial education in each of the three  countries, the results of the study are presented. The findings indicate that in all three countries a free-market economy was the dominant metaphor underlying new developments in education. The educational reforms in these countries were connected to the same pressures that drove economic competition. This was particularly true in the U.S. and the U.K., where education has been blamed for failing in its mission. The report uses maps or &quot;social cartographies&quot; to represent each country's educational climate. (Contains 23 references and 4 figures.) (RJM)",

It presents the research on R&amp;W carried out to date and discusses R&amp;W's impact on research, development, and evaluation for school reform in general. The program is an extension of the Success for All whole-school reform model. R&amp;W took the existing reading, writing, language arts, preschool, tutoring, family support, and assessment components of Success for All, upgraded them, and developed a training infrastructure. The booklet outlines the R&amp;W program and offers details on its various components: early learning programs, reading programs, reading tutors, writing and language arts, mathematics, social studies and science, family support and integrated services, after-school programming, site-based management, facilitators,  and special education. Program evaluations of R&amp;W are offered for the pilot program in St. Mary's County, Maryland, and for the first school to implement the program outside of Maryland, in San Antonio, Texas. The report concludes that R&amp;W offers schools a comprehensive means of implementing research-based reforms in all academic subjects and all grade levels and shows what can be achieved in high-poverty schools willing to undergo and sustain whole-school reforms.

The paper focuses on alternatives for students who are at risk for school failure, dropout, or delinquency. Since few studies on the effectiveness of alternative programs have been conducted and results of studies that have been performed are difficult to generalize beyond their specific settings, the report provides an outline of research on the common features found in alternative-education programs and describes a model alternative program. The text discusses special-education students and general-education students who are in need of alternative education. It details the characteristics of alternative-education programs, such  as the reason for admission or attendance. It also provides descriptions of research-based, alternative-education strategies, which include a low ratio of students to teachers, highly structured classrooms with behavioral classroom management, positive rather than punitive emphasis in behavior management, and social-skills instruction. The report concludes with suggestions for establishing an alternative-education program, including tips on universal, proactive screening, on avoiding negative effects, and on obtaining support for implementing and evaluating the program.

It describes how educational planning processes often expose educators to a dilemma: public expectations pressure principals to create quick solutions for complicated educational issues, whereas their professional obligation is to produce plans that will address the complexity of these issues in an adequate and effective manner. To examine this dilemma, 163 Israeli school principals in 4 different districts were asked to define time perspectives for planning processes and plans related to 4 central policy issues in the Israeli educational agenda. The principals were also asked to prioritize future planning. The study was conducted shortly after a large influx of Ethiopian and Russian immigrants.  The results indicate that the principals believed that the four issues were highly complex. However, principals tended to simplify the complexity of issues when the urgency related to these issues is high. Public education was characterized by mixed-typed situations that presented dilemmas for educators. These dilemmas exposed educators to a contradiction between their desire to meet social and political interests and their professional duty to perform planning processes that enable them to address properly the complexity of educational issues.

        "description":"In this paper the work of democratic theorists is applied to an analysis of democratic decision-making in a public high school. The article opens with a brief description of democratic decision-making as a school-reform strategy. The data for the study were collected in 1998 and 1999 and were based on 52 interviews with teachers, administrators, students, and parents, and 45 observations of decision makers' meetings. The research focused on decision making as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a desired educational outcome, and centered on three questions: What is the appeal of democratic decision-making processes? What sorts of tensions arise from the processes -- what is difficult about democratic decision making? and How are the tensions attended to and/or resolved,  if at all? The findings show that democratic theory is useful in explaining the issues that teachers, students, parents, and administrators articulate and reflect the concerns expressed by democratic theorists. The paper highlights the ways in which democratic theory may offer answers that schools involved in democratic decision-making may find useful. It concludes by suggesting that there is a need for researchers to develop an assessment tool that can be used to evaluate democratic decision-making processes. (Contains 44 references.) (RJM)",

In response to inconsistent financial reports and a lack of automation, a project team was assembled by Oregon's Department of Education in 1997 with the goal of providing detailed school-level data for the 1997-98 school year in 16 Oregonian school districts. Among the project's many goals were to review, modify, update, and improve existing chart-of-accounts and identify chief factors influencing student performance. The report draws on these results to present a plan to streamline school-data collection and business processes, improve reporting, and increase the information available for educators, policy makers, and the public. The text outlines the development and implementation of DIP. It describes the  resulting education database, a web-based system that will eventually collect, store, and report on data from all the state's K-12 school districts and education-service districts. The article outlines the scope and assumptions of the project; the implementation strategy; implementation activities, such as managing the project; expanding the pilot-project database; enhancing reporting capability; confirming the technical architecture; and managing organizational change.

The report's findings provide a comprehensive picture of California's CSR initiative during its first 2 years, covering such topics as implementation, resources, teacher qualifications, teaching practices, parent involvement, and student achievement. The paper offers a synopsis of the legislative background of CSR and describes some of the responses to implementation of the law. For most schools, the greatest obstacle to implementation was a lack of space, followed by insufficient funding, insufficient time to plan, and a lack of qualified staff. The report offers an overview of how the teacher workforce changed with CSR.  Although teaching practices did not change significantly with implementation, teachers reported being able to spend more time with problem readers and less time disciplining students. Parents had more contact with teachers and expressed more satisfaction with their children's education. Small gains in children's academic achievement, regardless of ethnicity, income status, or English-language ability, were evident. However, CSR led to overcrowding in many schools, and poorer districts were unable to attract as highly qualified teachers as the better-off schools. (RJM)",

Some examples present noteworthy components of a district's overall program, whereas others illustrate how districts successfully addressed weaknesses. The report is divided into 10 issues that affect food services: (1) realizing that hungry children have difficulty learning; (2) deciding whether food services should be contracted to a private company; (3) identifying every student eligible for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program; (4) using  performance measures to improve operations; (5) seeing how purchasing and processing techniques affect costs; (6) hiring employees only for the time you need them; (7) using technology to protect student anonymity, improve report accuracy, and reduce duplication; (8) making school cafeterias desirable places to eat; (9) annually evaluating local policies and procedures that affect food services; and (10) using the food service fund balance to help cover overhead expenses, regularly replace equipment, and improve profitability. Overall, the review process revealed that the best-run food service operations carefully leveraged the food service fund balance to improve the operation of the entire school district. (RJM)",

The report examines numerous ways in which indicators can be used: (1) describe problems quickly and clearly; (2) help in monitoring and accountability; (3) assist with evaluations; (4) inform system improvement; and (5) advance policy agendas. The article discusses which  indicators should be included and describes how to use models to select the appropriate indicator systems. Also discussed are ways to use frameworks to construct indicator systems, tips on deciding how many indicators to employ in a system, suggestions for developing criteria for judging indicators, advice on using indicator systems' predictive and descriptive capabilities, and information on choosing how to use an indicator system. The paper closes with a discussion of the implications associated with the use of an indicator system. (Contains 55 references.) (RJM)",

It describes Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the reauthorization of the act and its intent to assist eligible local education agencies that experience unexpectedly large increases in their student populations due to immigration. The report discusses the students served by Title VII, the six states that educate the bulk of immigrant students, the special curricular needs for these students,  and what should be known about immigrant students. The report outlines the problems in trying to study immigrant funding and student outcomes--problems such as access to funds, the ambivalence brought about by flexibility in policy, and the difficulty in reliable accountability studies. As the primary strategist for the school district, the superintendent must be able to formulate major priorities, directions, general programs, projects, and conceptualizations for the administration of the district's mission and goals. By doing so, superintendents can enhance systemic reform. (Contains 32 references.) (RJM)",

It reports on a study that examined the relationship between the characteristics of Dutch schools and their staff, the actual use of change capacity during the implementation process, and the implementation of a school reform. In May 1997 and in December 1998 qualitative and quantitative data were collected in case studies of three comprehensive secondary schools. During the initial visits to the schools, a number of school documents were collected and 10 to 15 interviews were administered at each school. Interviewees included management, members of the coordinating group, student  counselors, and coordinators from several departments. During a second visit to the schools more documents were collected and four interviews were administered at each school. The results indicate that the extent to which a school possesses change capacity affects its ability to implement reform. However, no causal relation between this potential for change capacity and the schools' actual use of it was proven. Each of the three case-study schools is described by means of some general characteristics. The schools' vision, planning process, support of learning, and treatment of basic education are briefly elaborated. (Contains 17 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper explores gender-equity issues from three distinctive perspectives: numeric distribution, compensation, and sense of empowerment. It is based on large-scale national surveys--the School and Staffing Surveys--in which public-school administrators assessed the differences between female and male principals. Based on findings from the study, it appears that significant gains have been made in achieving gender equity among public-school administrators. From 1984 to 1994, female representation in the administrator work force increased from 21.4 percent to 34.5 percent. Among principals with fewer than 5 years of administrative experience, more than 38 percent are female. However, such gains are still not significant enough to offset the large gap in numeric distributions  between female and male principals; female principals continue to be underrepresented among public-school administrators. In terms of compensation, differences in annual salary between female and male principals seem to be statistically insignificant. However, it takes women longer to become principals, and they are less likely to be paid as highly as their male counterparts. Even so, female principals have a greater sense of empowerment, believing that they have more decision-making power in school matters than do their male counterparts. Seven tables provide data on gender distributions of principals and other information. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper offers selected stories shared by building principals and central-office staff as they began to chronicle their personal and professional journeys toward inclusive schools for children. For the study, 17 principals (5 high school, 2 middle school, 10 elementary) and 3 central-office staff participated. The data were collected through in-depth interviews using an open-ended protocol, and the taped sessions were transcribed, reviewed, and analyzed. The themes that emerged included promoting inclusive practices, creating a supportive environment for critiques, building capacity for trust, promoting a school-wide philosophy and climate of acceptance, encouraging risk taking, fostering confirmation of self, stimulating critiques, expressing and extending personal values,  using reflective dialogue and critical questioning, creating constancy of purpose, promoting specific curricular and instructional approaches, revealing incongruities in practice and philosophy, translating belief into practice, and developing creative finances. Overall, principals supported, facilitated, and actualized inclusive environments for students in many creative ways. Positive forms of influence that involved clarifying, coordinating, and communicating a unified purpose were more evident than displays of formal authority to promote change. Administrators shared their need for support and power as they reallocated both human and financial resources. (Contains 25 references and the semi-structured interview protocol.) (RJM)",

These recommendations address lagging achievement, a lack of focus on academics, unprepared teachers, and a need for leadership and sufficient resources allocated where they can do the most good. The report calls for states to review their standards and expectations to determine whether they are rigorous and challenging and to clarify what students should master. The text criticizes states for concentrating their efforts on the \"bookends\" of schooling: early childhood and higher graduation rates. It asks states to provide examples of challenging curricula and to  furnish information that schools, communities, and families can use to improve middle-grades education. It recommends a comprehensive framework with 10 critical elements that can help districts and schools move the middle grades forward. These elements include an academic core that is aligned with rigorous content and performance standards, a belief that all students matter, classroom practices that actively engage students in their learning, qualified teachers, and strong leadership. These actions can reverse the trend of eighth-grade students entering high school ill prepared. (RJM)",

A collaborative high school is a high school shared and operated by two or more city, local, or exempted village-school districts. The report explores why some districts have been attracted to the collaborative high school option and why none have moved beyond preliminary discussions. The following questions guided this report: What is the history of inter-district collaboration in Ohio? How would a collaborative high school be structured, governed, and funded? What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of forming a collaborative high school? and What strategies or incentives  might encourage the development of collaborative high schools? Some inducements that might foster more collaborative schools include increased state support for collaborative facilities; the prioritization of Ohio School Facilities Commission funding for collaborative facilities; a competitive grant for districts that form a collaborative high school; increased basic aid for districts establishing a collaborative high school; and increased awareness of the collaborative high school option. Schools that received money to expand or replace facilities were less inclined to join in collaborative ventures. (Contains 11 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This report presents the findings and recommendations of a study of New Mexico's financing of education. A task force, created in 1995 by the state legislature, was charged with reviewing public school funding for the purpose of introducing legislation to reform the system. For the study, hired consultants reviewed historical documents, held interviews, conducted an analysis of formula and nonformula provisions, reviewed and recommended revision of program unit cost indices, and assessed fiscal and program accountability procedures. The principal finding was that the New Mexico public school funding formula was highly equitable. Since state law did not permit local school districts to levy additional taxes, spending disparities in the state were less than those that were apparent  in other states. However, some perceived areas of unfairness were found and changes were proposed that included abolishing the size-adjustment factor for large school districts, among others. The task force endorsed the findings of the consultant and recommended some alterations, such as the creation of an at-risk factor in the funding formula to provide additional program units to school districts with students at risk of academic failure. An appendix lists the task-force members and contains a discussion draft of the proposed legislation for public school funding. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper explores high school leadership by examining how leadership was experienced and understood by students, parents, and staff members in two secondary schools. The general question that guided the research was: How do members within high school communities experience and understand leadership? A collective case study approach was chosen based on the belief that the perceptions of students, staff, and parents were instrumental in learning about leadership in high school communities. The study was conducted in two phases. The first stage consisted of independent investigations of two urban high schools. The study's second stage adopted the collective case-study approach. The major finding of the study was that staff and students at both schools regularly experienced,  understood, and could communicate their understanding of constructivist leadership. They perceived the gemeinschaft-like (community-like) qualities of the schools to be crucial in supporting the reciprocal processes leading to the \"sense-making\" and development of shared purpose. The multiple definitions of leadership were characterized by a confusion between leadership and management, an elusive understanding of the nature of relationships and influence within organizations, and a lack of consensus about the specific qualities that constitute leadership.

The steps are divided into three components: prevention, intervention, and enforcement. In prevention it is important to know the goals and objectives; to be proactive; to identify roles and responsibilities; to prepare a comprehensive plan; to establish clear expectations for students, parents, teachers, and administrators; and to address warning signs before they turn into trouble. In the intervention mode it is important to look for trouble before it erupts. The report suggests that various detection methods be used, that outsiders' access to students be restricted, that students be given strategies for  dealing with bad situations, that troubled families be identified, that individuals be in the right place to intervene, and that there be a plan of action, continually rehearsed, that is appropriate for various occasions. The third component of the school-safety plan, enforcement, suggests that there be no double standards and that the student code of conduct be used to set standards. Discipline management should extend inside and outside the classroom, and teachers and staff should have appropriate training in discipline-management techniques. (RJM)",

It compiles possible solutions to ineffective communications. To promote effective communication, administrators need to solicit opinions and be willing to listen to them. Most administrators tend to give direction instead of guidance, so they need to listen more, ask more questions, and encourage faculty members to come up with their own ideas and solutions. School leaders should also learn how to control their emotions and concentrate on what is being said. Likewise, since every organization has both formal and informal lines of communication, the idea of following a strict chain of command is unwise. Administrators can enhance communication by using the most  effective and efficient line of communication, depending on the situation at hand. Such efficient communication may involve the use of the latest technologies, such as local area networks; school leaders should set an example in using these technologies to bolster communication. Overall, administrators are the educational focal point within the school or local community, and they must be able to communicate effectively any concerns, ideas, or news. (RJM)",

The study found that certain conditions, such as the provision of state money to offset the costs of consolidation and good personal relationships among participants, helped the consolidation process. Although consolidation lowered administrative costs, there were no savings overall. Four appendices offer examples of services provided by ESCs and other information. (Contains 18 references.)

        "description":"The so-called \"Golden Age\" of women school administrators, that period from 1919 to 1950 when women held around 25 percent of county superintendencies and 10 percent of all superintendencies is contrasted to post-World War II conditions--a period during which a gender realignment in school administration occurred. Following the U.S. Civil War, county superintendencies west of the Mississippi River flourished; accompanying this expansion was a rise in the number of female county superintendents, a condition paralleled by women's attainment of other school administrative positions. However, after WWII, school administration experienced a significant period of restructuring that reaffirmed the masculine identification of the work, caused in part by schools' aggressive campaign to  find employment for millions of returning veterans. These veterans, aided by the GI Bill, gained an advantage when graduate education for school administrators became an important component of school administrators' qualifications. School boards also began to look for decidedly masculine traits among male applicants to counteract the widespread fear that homosexuals occupied educational positions. The number of women county superintendents dropped from 718 in 1950 to 366 in 1970, while, at the same time, a type of hypermasculinity became associated with the superintendency. (RJM)",

It is based on a study that explored how existing theories of effective leadership--purposeful leadership, transformational leadership, or moral leadership--compared to the practices of successful head teachers in times of change. The research was based on more than 200 interviews with heads (principals), staff, governors, parents, and students in 12 primary, secondary, and special schools. The methodology recognized that effective leadership was a highly contextualized and relational construct. A generic case-study protocol was designed in which each school was visited for two-and-a-half days. Analysis revealed that the various stakeholders shared a broadly similar  social construction of leadership that did not wholly endorse existing theories of leadership. The heads themselves operated on the basis of both internally and externally determined measures of quality control; their quality-assurance criteria had a broader agenda in keeping with a holistic moral vision of a good school and good teachers. Their leadership approaches did not neatly adhere to existing leadership theories, in part because the complexity of the role they faced meant that no one theory could explain existing practices.

The study included an intradistrict analysis of federal-education aid per pupil. The goal was to explicate the federal role in education and provide greater insight on issues of equal educational opportunity for children and youth in schools and classrooms by providing better finance data. The study employed a post-hoc design in which per-pupil federal funding was examined for the 1991-92 school year. The subject pool was the entire universe of 2,038 students in a rural school district in Virginia. Funding profiles  were developed for each student and compared to poverty using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results were grouped around such questions as What federal grants in aid were available in the school district? The findings show that total funding increased over time, but there was a sharp drop in the federal share of funds for elementary and secondary schools. Virginia's total federal revenue receipts were 7.7 percent in 1984 and 4.8 percent in 1994 of total aid received. (Seven tables present statistical findings.) (RJM)",

One case concerns the impact of a new matriculation policy on curricular directions in Israel. The second case concerns the development of a 5-year plan for educational renewal in the Arab sector in Israel. The article probes the conflicts and dilemmas accompanying educational reform movements emphasizing the power of individuals--such as Ministers of Education--political groups, or economic factors to shape, lead, or distort the nature of educational policies. The study focuses on the dilemmas and conflicts accompanying educational reform in a multiethnic and multicultural country  like Israel. The report portrays how a reformer, such as the Minister of Education, who started the process of matriculation reform in response to societal problems and influence, must face numerous struggles with the conservative establishment of teacher unions and universities. Reform can be successful as long as the &quot;policy window&quot; remains open and public mood is in favor of the intended changes. Results show that although reform can be delayed, popular forces in favor of reform can ensure its implementation. (RJM)",

A total of 220 students with severe disabilities who had been previously placed in private sites were selected to participate based on class communication between the public and private settings. Service delivery models varied from site to site and included merging reintegrated students into existing special education classes, development of new classrooms at a school, and the development of schools within an existing school. Results of the pilots indicated: (1) 43 percent of the students who reintegrated into public schools either graduated or were placed in general education classes, and 12 percent were returned to private school placements by the  local education agency (LEA); (2) each pilot site reported cost savings from the approaches they instituted that varied from $90,000 to $466,480; (3) pilot programs reported improved levels of communication, cooperation, and coordination between the LEAs and the private sites and increased levels of interaction between the involved public agencies within the community and the LEAs; and (4) pilot programs reported they felt the structure of the pilots helped improve parent involvement in the educational process.

In a qualitative study, interviews were conducted with five nearsighted students, their foreign language classroom teachers, and teachers of students with visual impairments. A case study approach was utilized in an effort to allow each participant to tell as much of his or her own story as possible. Topics discussed include foreign language theory and strategy, social skills and interaction with sighted teachers and peers, and strategies for obtaining access to adaptive technology and to materials in alternate formats that make study of a foreign language possible for students who are blind. Results of  the study indicate: (1) participants believed that the ability to communicate in a written format with regular classroom teachers who have no knowledge of Braille was of paramount importance; (2) participants believed that assertiveness and self-advocacy are important to succeed in the regular foreign language classroom setting; and (3) social skills and interaction with sighted peers were found to be important to participants; however, students took little responsibility for breakdowns in social interaction.

The first section is devoted to a detailed analysis of the legal framework of IDEA. Provisions relating to least restrictive environment, the Individualized Education Program, private school placements, due process protections, and discipline are discussed. This section is followed by a similarly comprehensive analysis of how IDEA can be used as a tool for obtaining AT, including basic eligibility criteria, evaluations, home use of AT, private insurance and Medicaid, and repairs and damages. Key court  decisions and their implications are reviewed. Some of the major issues involving maximization of a student's potential and uses of educational methodology are then discussed. The booklet also reviews obligations of school districts under Section 504, including legal responsibilities relating to least restrictive environment, due process and procedural safeguards, and AT. The final section of the booklet discusses remedies available when parents disagree with a decision made by the school and the remedies available when attorneys or advocates seek to address more systemic problems.

Twenty centers serving approximately 2,000 students and their families were visited over a 2-year period. Factor analysis identified five factors that accounted for 88.8 percent of the variance in implementation and outcomes. They were: (1) teachers' knowledge/familiarity with the Center; (2) teachers' active involvement with the Center; (3) family and community involvement with the Center; (4) the Center program's mission focus; and (5) teachers'  awareness of Center's mission. In general, teachers' active involvement with the Center was the most consistent positive predictor of educational outcomes. However, family and community involvement with Centers was inversely related to educational outcomes, a finding which suggests that putting effort into enhancing community supports and family connection with them is a long-term strategy that may not show results as immediately as involvement with the school.

Subjects (N=11) were nominated on the basis of demonstrated success in home, school, and community settings despite their SED. All the youths had demonstrated success in school, those over 18 were usually employed and therefore more  independent, and were typical for a SED population in their problem history and service history. Subjects and their families were interviewed regarding coordination and individualization of services and responses. Results suggested that the success of these individuals was not related to severity of impairment or circumstances. Findings did not suggest any single recipe for more effective support and service delivery. Instead, families identified different service characteristics as helpful, such as school program structure, guidance of the SED teacher, and mainstreaming. Future needs identified by families included continued counseling/therapy, financial aid, and job training. (DB)",

This particular study examined shifts in service delivery from the traditional diagnostic and treatment model to a more ecological orientation with a continuum of services. The study analyzed service delivery activities logged by 33 graduate students providing mental health services through the project. Findings indicated that about 40 percent of the graduate students' service delivery efforts  reflected non-traditional services such as program consultation and workshops, violence prevention efforts, ethnic-focused programming, consultation with teachers and other school personnel, and helping to define an in-school suspension program. Also, nearly 60 percent of students who received services were not identified as clients, suggesting that the project was providing services much broader than traditional mental health programs.

Interviews were conducted with 118 parents and 169 children were tested. Forty-five percent of the children had been homeless for more than 2 months and 40 percent had changed schools 2-5 times in the past 12 months. Overall, 45  percent of the children merited a special education evaluation, yet only 23 percent had ever been evaluated or received special education services. Specifically, about 25 percent of the children needed an evaluation for a behavior problem, 20 percent for a learning disability, and 8 percent for mental retardation. Results suggest that homeless children have a high level of unmet need for special education evaluation and services, but that procedures for determining eligibility and placement should be adapted to accommodate the extreme transience of this population.

At the model site, 12 students in grades K through 8 have had individual student support teams formed to assist in problem-solving and developing appropriate community-school collaborative educational services. Evaluation involved semi-structured interviews at the beginning and end of the school year with  the students with SED and their peers, parents, and regular and special education teachers, as well as analysis of completed surveys, questionnaires, and a behavior checklist. Results suggest that the project has had some initial impact upon all 12 students, their parents, educational and related service providers, community based service providers and businesses, and other community members. Educators and administrators strongly supported providing educational services for all children in the regular classroom environment, while parents felt strongly that education programs should address more than just academics.

The Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD) is a three-stage, multiple-gated procedure for mass screening to determine whether a child should be referred for psycho-educational evaluation. The procedure was adapted to assess level of risk status in a population generally at-risk due to psychosocial factors. Students (N=624) in 24 classrooms in two schools (one with predominantly Hispanic students and the other with predominantly African American students) were screened through three steps or &quot;gates&quot;: (1) teacher nomination of 10 children with externalizing behavior profiles and 10 children  with internalizing behavior profiles; (2) teacher ranking of the five highest children in each group on the Critical Events Checklist and the Adaptive and Maladaptive Behavior Rating Scale; and (3) use of observational measures in the classroom by trained professionals. Students were classified as low- (14 percent), moderate- (10 percent), or high-risk (4.5 percent) based on the number of gates passed. Concurrent validity was also evaluated. Results suggest the procedure is well suited for classification of risk status as well as identifying children for further evaluation. (DB)",

Children were from 31 different Head Start sites across the nation and were followed through the completion of first grade. They were 29 percent African American, 12 percent Hispanic, and 16 percent other ethnic identities. Subjects received a test battery to identify those at risk for emotional disturbance (ED), learning disability, and mental retardation and school records were reviewed for school identification. Identification by either research  diagnostic criteria or standard school processes were compared. In the ED category, 0.32 percent of students were identified as at risk for ED by research criteria and 0.95 percent identified by the schools with only about a 50 percent overlap. There was also a substantial overlap between disability categories for research criteria identification and school identification. Results suggest that children who have co-morbidity in which emotional disturbance or behavior disorder co-occurs with a learning or language problem are less likely to be identified in the ED category and may not receive needed mental health services.

Specifically, the study examined: (1) home visitor personal characteristics that influence turnover; (2) organizational characteristics that influence job satisfaction and turnover; and (3) the interaction between the home visitor and the organization. The study involved three survey interviews with all (N=46) home visitors employed in a well-established child abuse and neglect prevention program. The survey instrument evaluated the following individual and organizational constructs: satisfaction with work, supervision and pay;  overall job satisfaction; positive or negative affectivity; affect toward the home visitor role; satisfaction with life; locus of control; self-esteem; trust versus cynicism; belief in a just world; belief in a benevolent world; neuroticism; dysfunctional thinking; adult attachment; perceptions of work characteristics; and burnout. Responses were analyzed in terms of actual turnover. Job &quot;leavers&quot; were more likely than job &quot;stayers&quot; to report feeling &quot;upset,&quot; had higher self-efficacy scores, expressed greater overall satisfaction than &quot;stayers,&quot; were less satisfied with pay, and were less satisfied with supervision.

        "description":"This paper reflects on lessons learned from the implementation of KAN Focus, a demonstration project to develop a system of care for children with severe emotional disturbance in rural southeast Kansas. It notes trends toward providing more and younger children with community-based support services which provide family centered services, short-term, targeted approaches such as information and advocacy for parents, case management, attendant care, and home-based family therapy. Outcome data in Kansas are reported to show that children are progressing more rapidly, completing services sooner, and returning to services less often. A review of research found that when the primary risk factors are poverty, single family homes, and lack of medical care, health- and education-focused  home visitation programs can have dramatic positive effects. However, when the same risk factors are accompanied by mental illness, substance abuse, or family violence, success rates of such programs are much lower. Three specific lessons from the Kansas effort are discussed: (1) systems of care for young children are very different than the ones for children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance; (2) collaboration is worthwhile but hard work; and (3) good program evaluation improves collaboration, service effectiveness, cost efficiency, and sustainability.

The intervention aims to decrease criminal behavior, increase prosocial behavior, and stabilize psychiatric symptoms. The project's causal model focuses on three areas of risk: attachment and the nature of the parent-child relationship during early childhood; the nature of parenting skills and strategies to which the child is exposed; and the child's ecological and community context. The model links background risk factors, more proximal antecedent risk factors, the intervention itself, and target outcomes. Emphasis is on  skill building and behavior change in the youth's natural environment. Demographic and functional assessment data were gathered on 24 youth in the project and comparison youth. Analysis focused on diagnoses and history of treatment, intellectual functioning and academic achievement, overall functioning, school attendance, family involvement, admissions to juvenile detention, and new charges. This preliminary analysis suggests that the Prime Time model may be effective in facilitating more consistent monitoring and supervision of youth in this population, and in decreasing delinquent behavior.

Review of information from criminal offender records found that subjects had a total of 117 arraignments and 352 charges. Male gender, clinical record of court involvement, and younger age of admission to treatment were significant and correctly classified 79.3 percent of court involvement cases. Subjects were most likely to be charged at age 18, with most of the  charges coming between ages 17-20. The most common group of charges were for serious property offenses followed by serious offenses on persons. Charged subjects did not contest or were found guilty of 77 percent of all charges and 38 percent of charged individuals were sentenced to some prison time. Findings indicate that many youth served in intensive public mental health programs will have significant adult corrections involvement. (Contains references.) (DB)",

The groups were matched for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, grade level, type of offense, and number of adults in the household. The program met daily after school and on Saturdays for 3 hours each day for a 9-month period with a curriculum focused on causes and processes related to destructive behavior and strategies to prevent, reverse, and/or ameliorate these behaviors. Three instruments were  administered at intake and at program termination: (1) the Criminal Behavior Assessment/Reassessment of Risk (a cognitive outcome measure); (2) Profile of High School Students (a cognitive outcome measure); and (3) Program Evaluation Form (an affective outcome measure). At termination, three of STYP participants had reoffended (two misdemeanors and one felony) compared with the nonparticipating youth who had all reoffended with felonies. Findings also suggested STYP participants had improved behavioral self-control and expressed increased satisfaction with the STYP program over time. (DB)",

Data were obtained for more than 6,900 children, of whom approximately 61 percent were male, 73 percent were considered seriously emotionally disturbed, and 22 percent were judged to be at risk for SED. Approximately 73 percent lived with their biological or adoptive families and 78 percent  were Medicaid eligible. Outcome measures included: (1) days spent in the community, (2) school attendance, (3) number of child arrests, (4) functional level of the child, and (5) family satisfaction with services. Data are to be used for monitoring contract compliance and to inform the state for planning and long-term decisions regarding services, consumers, and the system of care.

Review of the program's first six months involved analysis of data on 333 children and adolescents who applied and were assessed for services during this period. Data summarized cover age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnostic category. Findings indicated: (1) as age increased, the percentage of youth accepted increased; (2) race did  not appear to be a factor in the eligibility determination process; (3) place of residence was related to eligibility status; (4) applicants with diagnoses of behavior disorders were less likely than others to be found eligible; (5) 89 percent were determined eligible; and (6) more than 90 percent of diagnoses were for psychotic disorders, behavioral disorders, or anxiety disorders.

The first analysis indicated that a number of CBCL items required additional clarification and analysis. The rating of  individual items on the original Toronto version and the modified Los Angeles and San Francisco versions found only 10 (of 48) items were equally acceptable across all three Spanish versions. Comparison of profiles of 10 Hispanic-American youth who completed the Toronto version with both Caucasian and Hispanic-American youth whose parents/caregivers completed the English version suggested that some differences in Hispanic-American parents' ratings were associated with the language used to solicit the ratings.

        "description":"This paper describes the development of a measure of ethnic identity among American Indian adolescents. Data were collected in nine high schools in four American Indian communities (N=1,592). The self-report survey included eight ethnic identity questions, seven items about social competencies, eight items on personal mastery and locus of control, six items concerning self-esteem, and six items about perceived social support. Factor analysis identified two major factors resulting in an eight-item Indian scale and a six-item White scale. Analysis found that respondents who identified with both White and Indian cultures tended to have the highest scores on the psychological measures of well-being. Results suggest that the use of this bicultural scale by mental health providers  might allow examination of the connections between patterns of ethnic identity and emotional/behavioral problems.

New welfare reforms required individuals to develop marketable skills and acceptable work behaviors and move along a path to employment. For individuals with disabilities in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) system, the path can be complicated by substantial barriers and insufficient transitional supports. Analysis of interview and focus group transcripts from 11 individuals receiving welfare who either have a disability themselves or care for a family member with a disability, 6 welfare agency caseworkers, 5 disability and welfare rights advocates, and 4 employers defined a five-step path to work through the  welfare system. Findings suggest a number of significant roadblocks were encountered on this path to work. Individuals with disabilities experienced some of the same roadblocks as the general population receiving welfare benefits, including the ongoing conflict between work and family, and challenges to building rapport in the individual/caseworker relationship. Several participants also described losing jobs due to disability and health issues and a lack of job accommodations. Others described the difficulties in finding child care that accommodates their children's disabilities. Issues in the disability determination process arose for both case workers and individuals applying for welfare benefits. The need for greater access and education, placement into jobs with better long-term  prospects, employer and peer support, and increased disability awareness is urged. (CR)",

Children (n=68) exhibiting externalizing or internalizing behavioral problems who attended Head Start Programs were targeted for this intervention. During the first 2 years of the project, a manual-based program was conducted. The last 3 years of the project involved delivery of the parent/teacher training program through a series of videotapes and accompanying manuals. Children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or no-treatment control group. Results indicated that both of the  treatment groups demonstrated improved behaviors within more cases when compared to the control group, and that the manual treatment group reported the greatest number of behavioral improvements. Direct behavioral observations did not indicate clinically relevant improvements in behavior; however, parent and teacher goal attainment reports characterized students as meeting their behavioral goals overall. Both parents and teachers also reported high rates of treatment acceptability and satisfaction with both the manual and videotape treatment programs. Appendices include the assessment instruments.

The study found that smaller schools, serving less than 400 lunches per day, had kitchens equipped with ranges, small steam-jacketed kettles, convection ovens, under-range ovens, and manual slicers. No school met the standard for all preparation equipment. Moderate sized schools serving 401-700 lunches were the most well equipped. Generally, as schools increased in size the adequacy of equipment decreased. No school met the standard for all eight pieces of production equipment or holding equipment for the large size schools serving 701-1000 lunches. Findings also  reveal the schools at the two size extremes to be the least equipped to prepare healthful foods to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) standards. The study recommends that Child Nutrition Programs evaluate their equipment based on the menu served, that emphasis be placed on helping schools evaluate equipment needs to meet DGA standards, and that managers should be encouraged to be creative in menu planning and use of equipment to meet DGA standards.

The impacts described include: noise; vehicular and pedestrian safety; air pollution; access; circulation changes in service area; and visual distraction. The cases illustrate the range of perceived impacts associated with various types of school/highway positionings and the range of mitigation measures utilized to minimize negative impacts and their relative success. Positive impacts on schools include increased vehicular and pedestrian accessibility, and visibility from the road. Negative impacts include noise, safety, air pollution, and  visual distraction. No perceived positive impacts are reported on the highway system from the school; negative school-to-highway impacts include traffic congestion, circulation, and decreased vehicular safety. Twenty-six broad recommendations are provided to minimize the adverse impact resulting from school/highway juxtapositioning. An appendix provides background and study objectives along with study methodology. (GR)",

        "description":"This report examines the history of California school construction financing and its past pitfalls, highlights the problems with pre-existing programs, and explores the history of bond initiatives during the past 5 decades. It begins by examining the State Allocation Board and its staff (the Office of Public School Construction) and reviewing the role of the Board which is responsible for establishing policies for the distribution of school facility financing funds. It also discusses how the Board has evolved during the past 5 decades from one that sets policy for various loan programs to one that today sets policy for grant programs. Other legislative or voter initiatives that have affected the Board's policies and procedures are examined, noting the Board's frequently changed  policies that adversely affected school districts' attempts at securing funding. How districts were forced to employ sophisticated personnel or contract with savvy consultants in order to secure state financing for their construction projects is also highlighted. The paper provides details regarding new financing programs, comparing them to earlier ones, and examines how the Board is required to respond to district requests. It concludes with options the State may consider to improve funding administration. An appendix provides descriptions of school district financing mechanisms. (GR)",

        "author":["Lackney, Jeffery A."],
        "description":"Environmental factors are being increasingly recognized as playing a role in school effectiveness and educational outcomes. Volume 1 examines what is known concerning the diagnosis, design, and management of environmental quality in schools, and the perceived relationship between environmental quality and educational outcomes, as revealed in an investigation of five elementary schools in the Baltimore City Public School System. The following issues are addressed: (1) the perception of the nature of environmental quality within the context of schools; (2) the attributes of environmental quality perceived to have an impact on educational outcomes; (3) the impact of facility management, if any, on the perception of environmental quality in schools; (4) whether environmental quality  can be assessed in local school contexts; (5) whether environmental-behavior research contributes to the improvement of environmental quality in schools; and (6) the effectiveness of action research in defining problems, providing solutions, and increasing knowledge and awareness of environmental quality in schools. Volume 2 provides a summary of the project objectives, problem and approach, and process and procedures of the Baltimore Environmental Quality Assessment Project. It provides the case reports of each school in the study, documenting specific aspects of environmental quality of concern. Each case study provides a brief analysis of the relationship between the attributes of environmental quality concerns and their potential educational impact. Areas addressed include the  school's physical comfort and health; classroom adaptability; safety and security; building functionality; aesthetics and appearance; privacy; places for social interaction; and overcrowding. Appendices contain the process manual for school environmental quality diagnosis, prioritizing of the environmental concerns found for each school, and data collection sheets for both environmental quality attributes and student academic performance.

Mac Connell Award from the Council of Educational Facilities Planners International. This case study describes the planning and design process. It discusses the rapid residential growth that initiated the school planning process to reconfigure the K-8 self-contained classrooms into elementary schools that contained kindergarten through fifth-grade and middle schools for the remaining sixth- through eighth-grade students. Also described is the reconfiguration of the traditional 9-month calender to a multi-track year-round calendar, and the joint planning of school sites with the park systems in the school district. Major elements of the planning process discussed are the Board of  Trustees' commitment to build community-based schools, community participation in the instructional program design, a comprehensive district facilities master plan, educational specifications designed to the district curriculum, and a participatory design process. The case study demonstrates that the process used to plan and design the school was effective in providing a school facility that met the school district's program needs, school staff, and school community. Appendices contain a collection of supporting documents that relate to the Heritage Oak Elementary School planning and design, and to the award received. (GR)",

He also discusses how to design an environment for fifth- and sixth-grade learners, including how to design a computer lab. Having clear lines of communication between diverse groups during the planning stage is stressed. Problems with lengthy planning stages creating diminishing returns and generating reports that are outdated are also  addressed as is the dubious value of planning reports that emphasize process over product. Final comments discuss the learning environments that are so extensive that the traditional school is nearly eliminated. (GR)",

The educational use of school grounds has positive affects on student attitudes towards their environment and can help pupils be better informed, responsible, and enterprising. Varied and flexible landscaping is important to afford many opportunities for learning by a diverse student body. Achievement of these goals requires communication and commitment of teachers, pupils, educational advisers, and landscape specialists. For new school sites, the landscape deserves as much attention as the building, and its financial  allocation should be adequate enough to be viewed as an external works budget with sufficient allowance for aftercare. Improving existing grounds should involve pupils and teachers at the earliest stages, allowing for long-term changes in the grounds in successive years. Finally, grounds management and maintenance guidelines should determine the type and pattern of maintenance with support of landscape staff. Appendices include a suggested landscape survey checklist, a list of possible site features, a landscape brief for a new school, a management policy statement of objectives, publications relating to each section for further reading, and useful organizations.

        "description":"A study examined (1) the decision-making processes used by Korean learners of English as a second language (ESL) to make requests in different situations, and (2) how the learners describe those processes. Subjects were 30 Korean students, 15 males and 15 females, enrolled in an intensive English program at a midwestern university in the United States. A written discourse completion test and immediate retrospection were used to elicit requests and, subsequently, thoughts about the decision-making process. The test included 12 situations varying in the familiarity and relative social power of the interlocutors. Analysis of student responses revealed six categories characterizing the learners' decision-making processes during request-making: assessment of the situation; monitoring  for appropriate sociolinguistic expressions; use of request skills; connection to personal life; cross-cultural comparison; and monitoring for language forms. Results suggest that the learners' interlanguage system was engaged in cognitively varied, complex processes in realizing requests, and that immediate retrospection as a data collection method produced rich information about what the learners had been thinking. The discourse-completion test situations are appended. (Contains 27 references.) (MSE)",

Pre- and posttests assessed etymological knowledge of English vocabulary, including root synonyms and prefixes at the beginning and end of the semester. In the interim, students were instructed in English vocabulary using an etymological approach. Results indicate that while the students of Latin-based language backgrounds performed better on the pretest, the highest posttest scores were obtained by students of non-Latin-based language backgrounds, suggesting that students of  Latin-based backgrounds do not have an advantage over others in this approach to English vocabulary learning.

First, the various roles of the classroom teacher as cultural storyteller, cultural healer, and cultural worker in the relationship between the schools and homes of bilingual students is explored, drawing on recent research and theory. A University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh program for English-as-a-Second-Language and bilingual education teachers, which attempts to train teachers to build bridges between cultures, is also described. It focuses on one course designed to engage teacher trainees in bilingual and language minority family research projects using narrative and ethnographic methods. Student projects culminate in written narratives of family lives,  which bring with them increased appreciation of cultural autobiographies as a teaching technique and a deeper understanding of the teacher's varied roles. Issues arising during the project included development of trusting relationships among participants in ethnographic and narrative research, techniques for gathering and arranging stories, ways of representing and interpreting the stories, and determining who the beneficiaries of the research are.

        "description":"A study examined language socialization in Dominica (West Indies), focusing on the use of a French-based creole, Patwa, in a situation of linguistic and social change. Despite claims that Patwa is integral to Dominican identity, rural caregivers choose to speak English to language-learning children, contributing to rapid attrition of Patwa. However, Patwa is still valued for intimate conversation among family and friends. Within this context are examined patterns of children's use of one Patwa affective marker within English speech, the imperative &quot;ga,&quot; a short form of the Patwa verb &quot;gade,&quot;&quot;to look at.&quot; The ethnographic study of six children, aged 2-4 years, was carried out over 12 months in a rural village. Results indicate that while adults use &quot;ga&quot; almost strictly within  Patwa utterances as an imperative or interjection to direct the attention of others to something in particular, children's use of &quot;ga&quot; is pervasively, although not randomly, used. Its use follows the same syntactic constraints as that of adults, but is used for impact and rhetorical force, to introduce new information, indicate a topic shift, or call attention to something or someone. It is used more often in play with peers and siblings than with adults. (MSE)",

Analysis of data from 51 interviews with indigenous highlanders, including parents, teachers, school administrators, and political leaders, reveals the existence of two conflicting Quichua language ideologies: one characterized by loyalty to Quichua and great value attached to the language, particularly in private and humorous situations and in traditional contexts; and the other characterized by the beliefs that bilingualism is onerous, by contempt for subordinated, non-standard languages (such as Quichua), and by a linguistic &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; attitude. Each element of this last, Western language ideology was also present in the  population interviewed. A belief that children prefer Spanish to Quichua was found, and Spanish was the dominant language of home use. Implications for endangered language communities are considered.

Data were gathered through discourse analysis of transcripts of 12 tutorials and interviews with the participants. Analysis of talk examined topic initiation, directive and mitigation type and frequency, and negotiation of acceptances and rejections of suggestions and evaluations. Also investigated were volubility, overlaps, backchannels, and laughter. Results indicate that tutors were less conversationally involved with their NSS students than with their NS students, and their behavior was more variable with NNSs, suggesting that tutors have yet to discover adequate \"frames\" for interactions with  NNSs. NNS student expected their tutors to behave as higher-status interlocutors, and interpreted tutor behaviors such as volubility, directive frequency, and forcefulness as consistent with their constructions of tutors as a type of teacher with inherent rights to such behavior. In contrast, tutors were largely critical of their own behavior and of their students' expectations that they behave authoritatively. (Contains 16 references.) (MSE)",

What constitutes theme in the clauses of the text is noted, and how words and nominal groups form TP is discussed. Considerations such as genre (a class of communicative events in which members share communicative purpose) and frames (inferences made from a body of knowledge in order to understand an utterance) are explored. After a discussion of TP and some of its shortcomings in application to the text in  question, the analysis concludes with suggestions for making TP more explicit in the teaching of English for Special Purposes.

Discussion of the development of first-language competence draws on the study of universal grammar and of development of attentional capacities and sensitivity to shifts in input. Children's metalinguistic development is explored through research on metacognition and meta- and epilinguistic awareness. Evidence of the utility of focus on form in assisting  adult second language learners in their quest for &quot;fluent accuracy&quot; is considered, and approaches to combining naturalistic language learning with this focus on form are suggested.

The resulting 480 compliment responses obtained were analyzed for strategy type. The most common was complaining about the object of the compliment. Other frequently-used strategies included complimenting the speaker, evasion, and humor. The relationship of gender and social distance in the use of each of these strategies, and the apparent intent of the strategies, were analyzed.

However, today's children appear to be low on emotional well-being. This has potentially negative consequences, not only for academic achievement but also for personal relationships. Literature has the potential of fostering emotional intelligence by providing vicarious emotional experiences that will shape the brain circuits for empathy and help the child gain insight into human behavior. Literature will also promote language learning by enriching learners' vocabulary and modeling new linguistic structures. Moreover, literature can provide a motivating and low-anxiety context for language  learning. Some successful literature-based strategies are offered to help teachers develop students' personal and emotional intelligence while also developing language skills, and demonstrate how these strategies can be adapted to different grade and proficiency levels. Emphasis is on the teaching of English as a second language. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/MSE)",

One is a Spanish bilingual version called &quot;Exito para Todos,&quot; in which students are taught to read in Spanish and then transitioned to English reading, usually in the third or fourth grade. The other integrates English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) strategies with English reading instruction. This report summarizes the results of both of these adaptations for students acquiring English. Experience shows that the effects of Success for All on the achievement of English language learners are, in general, substantially positive. In all schools implementing &quot;Exito para Todos,&quot; effect sizes for first graders on  Spanish assessments were very positive, especially when schools were implementing most of the program's elements. Even after transitioning to English-only instruction, &quot;Exito para Todos&quot; third graders performed better on English assessments than control students who were primarily taught in English. For students acquiring English receiving ESL instruction, effect sizes for all comparison groups were also positive. (Contains 34 references.) (MSE)",

Specifically, the study tracked, over a four-year period, the paths of college-qualified students who first enrolled in a four-year college or university in 1992-93. Major findings included: (1) low-income students and Black or Hispanic students were less likely than high-income students or White and Asian students to be at least minimally qualified for college; (2) there were relatively few differences among income groups in four-year persistence and attainment rates; (3) race-ethnicity was associated with persistence and attainment for college-qualified  students independent of qualification level; and (4) approximately 33 to 34 percent of highly college-qualified Whites and Hispanics earned bachelor's degrees compared with 14 percent of similarly qualified Black students. Following an introduction, data on characteristics of graduates qualified for college and enrollment are presented. In the next section, tables and data summarize persistence, nondegree departure, degree attainment, individual characteristics associated with attainment and persistence, and student debt. Discussion of controlling- related variables and a summary complete the report. Appendices provide a glossary and methodology details. (DB)",

The over 9,600 institutions included are grouped into the following classes: (1) whether or not the institution is eligible to participate in Title IV federal student financial aid programs (over two-thirds are); (2) the institution's degree-granting status (47 percent had granted at least one associate or higher degree in the previous year); (3) highest level of offering; and (4) control. Among the highlights are the following: 47 percent of all postsecondary institutions are operated on a for-profit basis, 23 percent are public, and 29 percent  are private non-profit; about 30 percent of institutions offer a program of four years or longer, 56 percent offer programs of two years or less; 73 percent of public institutions are under some level of state control; the most common ancillary services offered are academic and career counseling services, followed by placement services for program completers; and public two-year institutions have the lowest tuition rates, about half that of public four-year institutions.

The survey found that 30 states now have at least one of these two types of programs, up from 26 states the previous year, although some earlier programs have been abandoned. Nine states have both performance budgeting and performance funding, an increase of one. Sixteen states have performance funding, an increase of three; the net result of six new initiatives and three dropped programs. Additionally, 23 states (up from 21) have performance budgeting, the total representing six new initiatives and four dropped programs. The mixed findings suggest that performance budgeting or funding will not  replace traditional budgeting for public colleges and universities, although there is a growing belief in state capitols that performance should be related to allocation of resources to public education. Following the introduction and a description of the survey program, individual sections analyze findings on performance budgeting and performance funding, performance budgeting, performance funding, and performance reporting. These sections are followed by a discussion of future trends and a brief conclusion. The survey is appended. (DB)",

It offers 10 propositions for planning: (1) the ideal outcome of planning is planning, not a plan; (2) planning begins with a distillation of the institution's key values and purposes; (3) the widest possible universe of information should be made available to all members of the institution and should include ongoing feedback; (4) dissent and conflict are creative, healthy, and real; (5) linearity doesn't work in strategic planning, dictation, or collation; (6) the institution should budget fiscally and psychically for failure; (7) the considerable expense of time on the front end is an investment which is recouped, with interest, in the future; (8) the  executive is not demoted or minimized but ultimately is empowered by the planning process; (9) that which can be quantified is not to be overvalued, and that which cannot be quantified is not to be discounted; and (10) the future is a creation, not a prediction; this power of agency is the distinguishing context of human chaotic systems. These propositions are applied to case studies of four diverse institutions: Blue Ridge Community College (Virginia), Carson-Newman College (Tennessee), the University of Calgary (Alberta), and Red Deer College (Alberta).

It reviews the three decades since the introduction of the term &quot;enrollment management,&quot; noting the goals of: (1) defining the institution's nature and characteristics for appropriate marketing; (2) incorporating all relevant campus constituencies into marketing plans and activities; (3) making strategic decisions about the role and amount of financial aid for students and the institution; and (4) making appropriate commitments of human, fiscal, and technical resources. The need for enrollment management is thought to stem from two situations: first, the decline in the number of high school graduates and, second, the general public's erosion of trust in all types of public institutions.  The importance of enrollment management in assisting institutions toward attaining stated goals and remaining financially viable is stressed. Various models for administering enrollment management are also reviewed, as are the professional education and development of enrollment managers. The use of such enrollment management tools as predictive modeling, outcomes-based research and retention programs, and evaluation of student satisfaction is encouraged. (DB)",

        "description":"This study surveyed 111 women faculty in four-year nursing education programs who were also enrolled in doctoral study to determine the stresses involved in balancing the two roles of teacher and student. The theoretical framework was an extension of Cutrona and Russell's social support model which proposes that stressful life events impact particular life domains (role change, home achievement, time, family/friends relations, money, work/school achievement) and that types and sources of social support when matched with a particular life domain reduce the impact of stress within that life domain. Participants completed three instruments: the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire measuring types/sources of social support; the Life As A Doctoral Student Survey measuring changes  within life domains; and the Negative Affects Balance Subscale measuring stress. Taken together, the life domains accounted for 36 percent of the variance in stress, while matching types/sources of social support with particular life domains explained 16-19 percent of the variance in stress. Matching spousal aid support with both the role change and home achievement domains decreased stress, while matching friends' affect support with the work/school achievement domain increased stress. As a result of this study, a revised model was created to better reflect women's doctoral training experience. (Contains 36 references.) (DB)",

The study used e-mail surveys which queried: (1) what level of satisfaction the faculty had with their school's current ranking; (2) whether the ranking had affected the institution's fiscal resources, student applications, or faculty recruitment; (3) whether rankings affected faculty research; and (4) how rankings affected teaching. The 734 usable responses were evaluated using both descriptive and multivariate analyses. Findings indicate that the rankings were important to respondents with 70 percent reporting that their school would like to improve its current ranking. However,  faculty were unsure as to whether fiscal resources or faculty recruitment were affected by rankings. Differences in responses were also found according to faculty rank, sex, and school rank. Analysis of responses to an open-ended question identified four themes: less rigorous coursework as a result of feeling pressured to keep students satisfied; a resource shift away from PhD programs to Master's programs; a belief that the ranking methodology was flawed; and support for &quot;Business Week&quot; rankings. The questionnaire is appended as are tables analyzing responses. (Contains 57 references.) (DB)",

Relevant findings indicated: (1) the university charged federal sponsored research $19.3 million for  compensation in excess of what it paid first-level postdoctoral researchers for comparable work; (2) foreign GSRs received a larger proportionate share of total tuition and fee remission costs charged against federal grants than did resident GSRs; (3) no conclusion could be reached concerning proper tax treatment of tuition remission provided to GSRs; and (4) HHS ensured that the institution had not requested GSR compensation to exceed certain caps.

Among 11 resources identified as essential for undergraduate and graduate nursing education are sites which provide care along a continuum, work with multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams, and practice case management. Among 11 resources identified as essential for faculty practice are redefinition of the nature of partnership and collaboration with clinical agencies, incorporation of faculty practice into faculty work, and access to patient  data. Among five essential resources for research are funding, intra- and interdisciplinary collaboration, and access to patient populations. Barriers to these essential clinical resources are also identified and include differences in regulations and expectations, differences in cultural values, system and organization issues, and costs. Four recommendations focus on the relationship between education and practice, the nature of partnership, and the shared mission of nursing education and practice. (Contains 24 references.) (DB)",

The essay goes on to note that a feminist history of art emerged in the 1970s, led by the publication of Linda Nochlin's essay \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\" It explains that feminism, art, and arts activism have gone hand in hand since the early days of the contemporary women's movement. In 1980s feminist art history continued to investigate women's  achievements, as well as focusing on challenging the traditional assumptions of art history itself; in the 1990s authors and publishers were attempting to include women artists in survey texts. The feminist perspective has also influenced pedagogy, leading to more interaction and collaboration between teachers and students. (Contains 125 references.) (MDM)",

It explains that gender bias exists not only in who traditionally has been expected to do science (namely white males), but also in what counts as science, noting that \"home economics,\" which started as chemistry and public health, was separated from those sciences and thus devalued primarily because the disciplines had been founded and was practiced by women. The essay goes on to note that feminist critiques document the way that beliefs in \"natural\" gender differences have permeated even molecular biology, distorting our understanding of how  cells and organisms function in health and disease. It examines gender-based naming, which describes certain hormones as \"male\" and others as \"female,\" and studies that claim that homosexuality is biologically determined from birth. The study concludes that gender bias in biology and other sciences demonstrates that the dominant group's values and interests strongly influence which models are chosen and where research funds go.

It reports that feminist literary criticism took definitive shape in the late 1960s as part of the women's liberation movement, and that a central concern of this first generation of feminist scholars was to expose the gendered formation of what was being presented as &quot;the&quot; literary tradition. The essay goes on to explain that feminist critics were the first to question the values of gender in the canon of men's writing, to investigate its configurations as historically specific products, and to study the cultural processes by which literary texts were accorded value. It reviews the influences of the &quot;French&quot;  school of feminist literary criticism (based on deconstructive and post-structuralist theories) and Marxist-feminist ideas on the field, and notes that the standard British literature anthologies still contain relatively few women writers, though there has been significant improvement since the 1960s.

        "description":"This essay examines the ways in which economics, as a discipline, has been influenced by feminist scholarship in the field. It explains that feminist work in transforming economics began to gain ground only in the early 1990s, and that the impact of feminist or multicultural insights on the core research assumptions of the discipline has been minor. The essay notes that economics differs from most other social sciences in that it is built around a single, highly influential core paradigm. The mainstream of economics is built around the neoclassical model of human behavior which assumes that all activity is a result of rational, self-interested choices by autonomous individuals. Feminists have challenged all of the underpinnings of this model, along with traditional teaching and  research methods. A less gender-biased discipline would use characteristics associated with both sides of the old dualistic thinking about gender (such as reason versus emotion and self-interested versus other-interested) to analyze the behavior of both men and women.

It explains that foundational studies by feminist scholars have examined sexual differences in identity and ways of knowing, and have challenged the arrogation of feminine experience and viewpoints to generalizations of male experience. The essay goes on to look at the education curriculum, focusing on access and equity, pedagogy, and narrative and identity, noting that autobiographical writing has become an important process in teacher education. It notes that feminist scholars have challenged traditional research paradigms of researcher/researched, knower/known, and subject/object, and have questioned the boundaries that separate public from private by  insisting on the political nature of all inquiry. Many of the issues embroiling public education reading instruction in the early grades, the role of parents in determining curriculum, single-sex schools, and the power of teachers in relation to administrators, legislators, and parents are addressed in the thought, research, and teaching of feminist scholars.

It explains that historians continue to challenge assumptions that have long obscured women's places in the economic, social, and political histories of Europe, especially in regard to ideological and economic factors that shaped the gender division of labor. The essay goes on to report that feminist historians have been active participants in efforts to rethink European history through the lens of cultural analysis, using the tools of anthropology, literary theory, and cultural studies. It examines recent scholarship on the body, sexuality, and identity in European history, noting that the new literature on  sexuality has also included many studies of homosexuality. The essay notes that feminist scholarship has led to critiques of such historical conceptual paradigms as the \"golden age\" of classical Athens, the Italian Renaissance, and the French Enlightenment, and that women's history has also called other standard historical categories and paradigms--class, modernity, capitalism--into question.

Geographers are paying increasing attention to the ways in which gender interacts with other social categories, such as race, ethnicity, class, nationality, immigrant status, and life course stage, to understand the complexities of relationships between women and men and among women. Feminist geography is pluralistic in its theoretical and methodological stances. A great deal of research has been done using in-depth interview  strategies. (Contains 17 references.) (MDM)",

There is growing evidence to support the assertion that access to health care differs in accordance with gender, race, class, and age, and excessive focus on male research subjects and the definition of some diseases as \"male\" diseases has led to the underdiagnosis and  undertreatment of these diseases in older women. It also notes that the exclusion of women of color and lesbians (and their health care needs) from clinical research has often resulted in inadequate or inappropriate theories and conclusions being drawn from the data.

Feminist scholars' rejection of the mind-body split has modified several areas of musical understanding, such as the recognition that \"real\" women (and men) perform music; acknowledging the physical response to music; linking musicality with sexuality or pleasure; and admitting the physical  experience of performance as significant to music's meaning. Feminist musicology has challenged conventional wisdom in regard to the concept of musical greatness or genius, the primacy of Western art music in the canon, the periodization of music history, and the musical form's relation to (gender) ideology.

It explains that in the 1970s feminist philosophers introduced questions regarding personal life and sexuality as matters for philosophical analysis, and that scholars began to challenge the notions of the Western canon. Feminists argued that understanding philosophical texts required reading symbolic and metaphorical language to discover subtexts that held philosophical reasoning in place. The essay goes on to discuss the radical interpretive techniques, such as deconstruction, used by feminist philosophers, and explains that scholars have begun to question the very identity and root impulse of the discipline of philosophy. The essay concludes that the use  of feminist materials in philosophy courses can lead to deep change in the way that philosophy is conceived of and taught, because women's work in philosophy has tended to be grounded in existential issues, critically self-reflective of its methodology, and open to interdisciplinary enrichment.

Noting that feminist psychologists have challenged the assumption that psychological science is value-free, it cites ways in which values have affected psychological theory and method. The view that men's behavior is normative underlies the historic marginalization of research on women in psychology. The best example of androcentrism and devaluation of women is found in Freudian theory, which defines being female as both different and deficient. Many \"gender effects\" on behavior can be accounted for by power differences between women and men; feminist psychologists have pointed to the usefulness of descriptive research that does not seek to generalize about  all human behavior.

The essay notes that in addition to critiques of traditional sociology, feminist scholarship has transformed the discipline by developing the study of sex and gender as a subfield of sociology.

        "description":"This essay examines the ways in which U.S. history, as a discipline, has been influenced by feminist scholarship in the field and by research on gender and sexuality. It notes that the recognition that gender matters revolutionized the thinking of scholars who forged the field of women's history. Feminist scholars have expanded the definition of historically significant topics to include the private domain of family, domesticity, reproduction, sexuality, and public activities such as voluntary social service. Studies of women, particularly working-class women and women of color, are central to reconceptualizing the actors, events, sources, chronologies, and vocabularies in U.S. history. The essay also wonders whether women have \"experienced\" the great events of the nation's past  in the same way as men, asking whether women did in fact have an American Revolution, an Age of Jackson, or a Reconstruction. Also noted are two issues in the experiences of women that continue to be debated: the first is the question of continuity versus change; the second is that of commonality versus differences. A 71-item bibliography contains information on works cited in the essay; selected readings for faculty on frameworks and overviews, work, politics, conquest and colonization, and women and revolution; selected readings for students; electronic resources; and other resources.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the design of effective lesson plans using the Internet. Effective lesson design helps students to explore ideas, acquire and synthesize information, and frame and solve problems. The creative problem solving which depends upon context, interrelationships, and real-world activities is available through Internet projects. Communication among schools, home, and community will increase with collaborative projects. The paper explores a multi-level, interdisciplinary problem solving scope and sequence for integrating technology into the curriculum. This framework depends on a multi-tiered conceptual framework. The framework helps teachers visualize how the World Wide Web can be incorporated into a class where students are at various levels of ability in using  computers. The structure can be summarized in five steps: (1) learn to search; (2) create a hotlist; (3) create a guided tour; (4) create an HTML file; and (5) post your Web Page. Conceptual frameworks are also presented for guided tours, scavenger hunts, Internet discoveries, CyberInquiries, and WebQuests. An annotated list of Web sites for lesson plans and additional resources is included. (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"A pilot program initially designed for a 12-year-old girl with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities in higher order computer tasks was developed for a larger group of students with similar disabilities enrolled in fifth and sixth grades (ages 9-12) at three different schools. An examination of the original pilot study was undertaken to determine critical aspects that led to its success. This paper discusses why further research is needed into the effects of computer interventions in this area, and then focuses on development of the program for the larger group. The first stage of the intervention involved bringing participants together and introducing them to easy-to-use software. Students' interests and needs were ascertained and recorded along with their levels of prior  computer experience. Once students worked through several months of less structured, easier computer tasks, they moved on to more structured activities using Microsoft Publisher. Peer tutoring needed to be continued after different steps were mastered. As skills developed, more emphasis was placed on thought-provoking elements of design and how the overall product related to students' interests. During the final stages of the program, SCALA MM200, a multimedia authoring package, was used to further advance the progress of the group, and the same instructional strategies were used with this software.

Learning through simulations, either by creating simulations or by exploring existing ones, helps learners develop a deeper understanding of the concepts being simulated. Learning about simulations is also important since simulations are frequently employed to make predictions or test ideas by scientists and policy makers. This paper describes a number of simulations that have served as tools for a variety of lifelong learners, ranging from elementary school students to professionals. These simulations were all created with the Visual AgenTalk language (VAT) employed by the AgentSheets system. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/AEF)",

Five group case studies consisted of various configurations selected from a cohort group of students and teachers representing two city school systems, five county systems, and one private school. Participants were teachers and female students representing grades 5 through 8 from a purposive sample in a lab-type setting where they engaged in group inquiry with the assistance of networked computers, peers, teachers, and other resources available on a university campus. A qualitative approach to research was implemented using the constant comparative method of data  analysis. Data in the form of observational field notes, transcripts of video tapes, artifacts, and photos resulting from a two-week summer workshop revealed interesting findings regarding student behaviors while interacting with computers in a single-sex environment. Results from the study indicated that female students--when interacting within a single-sex environment--display similar behaviors as male students do when engaging in technology-enhanced activities. Additional findings show that the classroom teacher, operating within a theoretical framework and personal educational philosophy, can either hinder or enhance student processes.

The BEN:LINCS project envisioned a community-based network of local organizations making their educational resources available over the World Wide Web. Highly motivating learning activities would be developed that were relevant to the community and that could engage students in school or at home. This paper begins with an overview of BEN:LINCS and its partners. Ten projects are then described in the following categories: (1) SMART Net, projects that involve the SMART Discovery Center (a  local science museum) and Lehigh University's Electron Microscopy Laboratory; (2) Local Library Web, a Web-based means to contact and search local library catalogs; and (3) Close-to-Home Curriculum, network-enabled activities using local history, music, and science resources and organizations. Implementation issues of leadership, vision, staffing, technology, curriculum/education, and change are also discussed. The BEN:LINCS model suggests that extensive technological resources may not be necessary to begin a community education network; the only critical need is for basic Internet connectivity. The model also suggests that it may not be necessary to hire expensive full-time staff. (AEF)",

These programs are not constructed by typing text or arranging icons, but by taking actions in this world. Robots can be trained, birds can be given messages to deliver, and so on. This paper describes the design and preliminary testing of an interactive puzzle game that functions as a ToonTalk tutorial. Children are presented with a series of interactive puzzles in a game-like narrative context. The puzzles gradually introduce programming constructs and techniques. Each puzzle presents the player with a very limited selection of ToonTalk objects. Even some very young children are able to solve the puzzles because the search space is so strongly constrained, and  yet players do not behave as if the puzzles are too easy--the children are clearly challenged. The sequence of puzzles is carefully designed to gradually introduce new concepts, one at a time. Testing has shown that both children and adults enjoy the puzzles and have learned some sophisticated programming skills. (Contains 11 figures and 7 references.) (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"A computer-based questionnaire was developed to help parents who have not received specialized training to determine whether their young children need further assessment for diagnosis of developmentally at-risk status. The computer automatically determines a starting point for a series of questions according to the child's chronological age. The computer also sets the basal point according to the child's functional level. When the child reaches a certain ceiling point, the computer stops asking questions, calculates the total numbers of \"yes\" and \"no\" answers given by the respondent and presents a graphical representation of the child's development. The questionnaire items are written in simple language and use pictures where possible. The validity of the instrument was examined  to see how precisely the parent-completed questionnaire assesses children's development as compared to the Child Developmental Inventory, a standardized assessment tool. Results suggest that the parent-completed computer-based questionnaire is a valid tool in screening 15-month-to 36-month-old children's development. (Contains 32 references and 3 tables.)

(2) Does the use of a shared, intranet environment increase learner metacognitive reflection? and (3) Do gender differences emerge with the use of a shared, intranet science environment for problem-solving ability and metacognition? A quasi-experimental design randomly assigned 9th and 10th grade biology classes to traditional or shared intranet learning environments. Pilot-test World Wide Web-based distance education software created the simulated intranet learning environment and provided user movement tracking ability, while the visual learning software, Inspiration, was used to generate concept maps and measure  learner metacognitive reflection. A modified ecology curriculum provided contextualization and science content for the shared, intranet and traditional learning environments. This shared, intranet learning environment posed one model which science classrooms can use to create equal opportunity for both genders. Tracking learner movements within a Web-based, science environment has metacognitive as well as problem-solving implications for all learners. (AEF)",

The first section describes the original course which was adapted to Internet delivery. The next section focuses on the major objectives and approaches to the online course design. Three major instructional strategies that would be unique to the online version of the course are described, i.e., class cybersociety, online student portfolios, and self-guided online labs. Hardware and software resources are also addressed in this section. The third section describes the course implementation and how well the implementation met the design  objectives in terms of student demographics, instructional strategies, and resources. The ultimate goal was to provide an enriched educational experience, subject to economic and related technological limitations. It is concluded that, while the accessibility of the course was successfully maintained, several of the teaching methods meant to enrich the experience were hampered by the shortened time frame in which the course was offered. The course materials are currently in revision for a future offering during a regular 15-week semester. (Contains 13 references.) (AEF)",

        "description":"Beginning in 1987, a reform movement was heavily funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to change the teaching of calculus. Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) received seven NSF grants over an eight-year period, allowing the college to: establish a state-of-the-art calculus computer lab; purchase calculators, graphing calculators, and laptops; send selected faculty to workshops and run workshops for faculty; and hire half-time college lab technicians and support staff. This paper presents results of an assessment of how BMCC's students feel about themselves in pre-calculus and calculus classes and, in particular, how they feel about the use of computers, graphing calculators, working in groups, and creating written research projects and portfolios of their  work. Students were asked, through a questionnaire and interviews, on a scale of one to five, how strongly they agreed with 15 statements; comments were also solicited. Data were analyzed for the whole cohort and then by gender to see if women responded differently than men. Results are discussed for each of the 15 statements, and student comments are reproduced. One implication of the study is that there needs to be increased sensitivity in order to make women equal partners in the classroom and laboratory. (AEF)",

Evaluation methods included use of the Scales of Concern Questionnaire in the application of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model, as well as visits to each of the 23 funded project consortia, during which observation, interviews, focus groups, and document analysis took place. The major sections of this evaluation report address: interactive video technology adoption; perspectives of partners and content providers to schools; impact statements; the need for resources and availability; thoughts about value-added contributions of the technology from the field; and examples of Telecommunity activities. The  following four key findings and related recommendations are presented in the executive summary: (1) Telecommunities appear to be moving through similar stages of technology adoption; (2) providers of content expertise and other resources are unsure how they can best participate with their school partners in deploying interactive learning technologies; (3) there are a number of significant learning impact indicators that go beyond what standardized measures will achieve; and (4) increasing pressure has been placed on the Telecommunity program to demonstrate cost-effectiveness.

It summarizes the inquiry made by FOCAS members into the many issues surrounding information literacy, including what information literacy is, why we need an information literate society, measuring information literacy, and how schools, business, and governments can work together to promote information literacy. Following the summary of deliberations, the report outlines six initiatives suggested by FOCAS members that might be developed further to advance the cause of information literacy. The proposed initiatives include: (1) take idea leadership to promote awareness of information literacy; (2)  assess and hold educators and political leaders at all levels accountable for students' proficiency in information literacy; (3) give teachers the preparation and support they need to do a better job; (4) involve parents more deeply in their children's education; (5) develop a dramatically different technology-based educational alternative; and (6) increase funding for research in education and information literacy.

Examining the extent to which students have access to computers at school and at home may be an indicator of how well prepared students will be to enter an increasingly technological workplace. Between 1984 and 1996, the percentage of 4th, 8th, and 11th graders who reported using a computer at school at least once a week increased substantially. The youngest students were more likely than older students to report computer use in schools. In 1996,  79% of 4th graders, 91% of 8th graders, and 96% of llth graders reported using a computer at home or at school to write stories or papers, a substantial increase from 1984.

The document is the result of deliberations by a working group consisting of district and state technology experts and administrators. It draws upon their knowledge and concerns for the state of teaching and learning in Colorado schools and from national, state, and local standards developed by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and Jefferson County School District One (Colorado). The guidelines' organization has  been adapted from ISTE's National Standards for Educational Technology, and the teacher competencies are taken from all three documents. The technology skills needed by teachers and school library media specialists are divided into three areas: basic computer/technology operations and concepts; personal and professional use of technology; and integration of technology into a standards based curriculum. Essential and extended technology skills are outlined for each of these areas. The appendix includes more advanced skills needed by the individual(s) responsible for maintaining a school's technology infrastructure. (AEF)",

The survey consisted of four main sections focusing on demographics, non-technical soft-skills (writing and teamwork), business concepts, and technical knowledge/skills/abilities. The fourth area on technical knowledge was further subdivided into  eight job clusters: computer programmers; systems/business analysts; computer engineers; database administrators; computer support specialists; network specialists; telecommunications analysts; and Internet specialists. Part 1 of this report provides an overview of the study and demographic results. The companies that participated in the initial site visits and focus groups are described in part 2.

The following elements drive the design of the program: NLS offers a free library service; NLS is consumer-driven; NLS pays no royalties to copyright holders; the program is accessible to a wide variety of users; and the program's primary focus is the recreational and informational reading needs of patrons. Three assumptions have been made in planning for the next-generation talking book system: the system will be digitally based; the current cassette system will be in use for another seven to ten years; and a standard or slightly modified version of a widely-used consumer product/technology will be used to gain cost benefits  of mass production. A National Information Standards Organization effort is underway to develop a standard to ensure compatibility of digital books, magazines, and playback equipment across national and agency boundaries. At the same time, four immediate tasks of the inhouse NLS group are: simulate a digital talking book using a personal computer; develop a computer-based life cycle cost analysis tool for the NLS system and candidate digital system; design and build a prototype digital collection accessing and archiving system; and design or select digital mastering and playback systems.

First outlined is the &quot;public relations nightmare&quot; that the Internet is creating for the administrators and the library staff. It is suggested that libraries pick a common sense approach that involves the library staff and community and that an honest approach to problems is necessary. The paper then goes on to discuss librarians as information consultants whose service should be compared to service provided by other professionals where identification is used to establish the rapport needed to fully assist their clients, to be available for follow up information, and to be accountable for the information provided. Presumptions behind the model of librarians as educators are  outlined and the role of social ethics is discussed. Discussion then moves to copyright law in the digital age. The paper suggests that the moral value of information can be realized only by bringing the standardized classification system into accord with library patrons' specific self-understanding, life situation, and personal needs. It concludes by outlining strategies librarians can use to achieve this objective of accord, focusing on reference service, local cataloging, and public service projects. (AEF)",

The CMC is a special library resource supporting the curriculum of the School of Education at Adelphi, and graduate and undergraduate students preparing for careers as teachers are its most frequent users. It is an area that houses items quite different from the usual library collection, and the display and organization of these items offer special challenges to a librarian. Some of these challenges are related to the tension between the purposes of curriculum centers and the organizational schemes of libraries, of which they are a part. Background information is provided  about curriculum centers and library organization to allow for better understanding of the reasons for changing the shelving of the nonprint materials in the CMC from the traditional library arrangement to a bookstore type of display.

        "description":"The strong emphasis of technology is slowly diminishing the importance of the human element in libraries. The current changes in population demand cultural sensitivity training in all walks of life. Libraries and librarians have a role to play. They need to cope with the multicultural environment by understanding the basics of multiculturalism and applying them in the library setting. Librarians can achieve better relationships with their patrons and colleagues by gaining more insight into the differences that exist between cultures and applying them to their work environment. Cultures differ in many aspects: sense of self and space, time and time consciousness, communication and language, relationships and associations, mental processes and learning styles, work habits and  practices, beliefs and attitudes, values and norms, dress and appearance, and food habits. Each of these areas is discussed, followed by suggestions on how libraries can approach the issues in regard to library staff and patrons. Lists are included of what library associations, libraries, and librarians can do to apply multiculturalism in their organizations. (Contains 49 endnotes.) (Author/AEF)",

Based on a review of literature, the research hypothesis is that there is a disparity between job competencies as taught and the job competencies as required by selected school library media graduates in their jobs. A survey instrument was developed and distributed to graduates of three library science programs at large urban universities. Results of the study indicated that the responding library media specialists show similar assessment of competencies taught to them or stressed in their library science programs regardless of length of time served in their present  positions, years since graduation, or amount of equipment. Competencies used on the job, however, are perceived as needed \"often\" or \"to a great extent\" more frequently among respondents who have been out of the university program and in their positions longer than among those more recently graduated and employed. Several responses indicated further need for training at the university level in the areas of public relations, planning and teaching library skills, and practical daily management and organization. The survey instrument is appended. (Contains 93 references.) (AEF)",

This report contains the results of an evaluation of coverage issues regarding the ALS. Its objectives are to determine the accuracy of coverage based upon the following five categories: (1) policy, i.e. survey organization, timeliness, and structure; (2) collecting library data, i.e. survey design/data elements; (3) universe of participants coverage; (4) field representation and quality of data collection, i.e. coordinator  interviews; and (5) public versus private institution reporting. Suggestions are made to identify potential ways of improving the process of collecting academic library information.

        "description":"The Council on Library and Information Resources' (CLIR's) College Libraries Committee began its study of the innovative uses of technology on college campuses in the spring of 1998. A letter was sent to heads of libraries of colleges and mid-sized universities in the United States encouraging librarians who felt their institutions had used technology in a way that significantly enhanced teaching and learning and who were willing to host a study team for a site visit to apply to the project. Nine campuses were selected out of the 41 applicants and site visits were conducted between September 1998 and January 1999. A two-day conference in March 1999 focused on the environment that is most conducive to organizational change. Representatives from each of the nine case study sites  were present to discuss which features of the programs they studied had been most successful. Sites included: (1) California Institute of Technology, Sherman Fairchild Library - A New High-Tech Library; (2) Carnegie Mellon University - A New Electronic Archives; (3) Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis - Librarian-Scholar Collaboration in Learning Communities; (4) Lafayette College - An Interdisciplinary Team Approach; (5) Point Park College and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Library Center - A Public-Private Library Partnership; (6) Southern Utah University, Gerald R. Sherratt Library - One Librarian Introduces EAD (Encoded Archival Description) Finding Aids; (7) Stevens Institute of Technology - Electronic Access, Not Subscriptions; (8) Wellesley College, Margaret  Clapp Library - A New High-Tech Center; and (9) West Virginia Wesleyan College - Laptops for Every Student. Four speakers provided additional perspective on the case studies. William Haden opened the conference by noting that with rapid developments in information technology, colleges today face new pressures to remain relevant, competitive, and effective. This was followed by two presentations, by Susan Jurow and Barbara Hill, on making change in higher education. Brian Hawkins then prepared participants with observations on the transformation of higher education. The presentations are provided in part 1 of this report, as are summaries of the ensuing discussion and recommendations for follow-up activities. Case studies appear in part 2 of the report. The CLIR Belmont conference  participant list is appended. (AEF)",

This document proposes a process for identifying the need for applied baccalaureate degrees, including a request for proposal component. This paper describes the background and context, as well as addresses the need for an applied baccalaureate degree. This process is expected to provide benefits to the community colleges, universities, Board of Regents, and the citizens of the state. The process assures that identified needs for  applied baccalaureate programs in the communities served by the college will be seriously addressed. The most desirable outcome will be for a public or private four-year university to come forward and address the need. Only if this fails to happen will the possibility of a community college offering the applied baccalaureate be considered. (JJL)",

        "description":"This presentation aims to explain the practical application of the World Wide Web as a primary tool for creating a learner-centered classroom. Based on Terry O'Banion's book, A Learning College for the 21st Century, a model that places learning and the learner first is proposed. Six key principles are explained and are utilized as the guiding assumptions in Maricopa Community Colleges' learner-centered paradigm. The six key elements of the learning classroom are as follows: (1) The learning classroom creates substantive change in individual learners; (2) The learning classroom engages learners as full partners in the learning process; (3) The learning classroom creates and offers as many options for learning as possible; (4) The learning classroom assists learners to form and  participate in collaborative learning activities; (5) The learning classroom defines the roles of learning facilitators by the needs of the learners; and (6) The learning classroom and its learning facilitators succeed only when improved and expanded learning can be documented for its readers. In this paper, the concept of a learner-centered paradigm is specifically applied in a freshman composition classroom by primarily using the World Wide Web. Student-created websites are employed as interactive learning tools. These websites assist in academic writing and publications, connecting with classmates and others, and practical learning skills. Some benefits from such technology include allowing for active participation and collaboration, and providing immediate feedback. (JJL)",

The report begins with an introduction, a description of students needing developmental courses, the purpose of the study, a description of the actual participants, an identification of instructional models and student characteristics, the findings for successful instructional models (i.e. for reading, mathematics, writing, ESL, and other developmental programs) and for student characteristics, conclusion and recommendations, and references. The Invest Learning system, an integrated learning system, was the key  instructional strategy implemented by all the programs in the study. The evidence clearly shows that the Invest system, when used properly, can be an effective instructional tool for developmental programs. Fourteen exemplary models emerged that illustrate a variety of successful applications. Students generally enjoyed working with computers, and student characteristics commonly considered to be obstacles to success in computer-based instruction, such as the comfort level with computers and typing, appear to have little impact on student success.

The Commission evaluated two programs leading to a Diploma of Collegial Studies (DEC), and programs leading to a Certificate of Collegial Studies (AEC). The programs leading to the DEC respond globally to the Minister of Education's objectives and Quebec employers' needs. It was recommended to the Minister that mastery of a second language and aptitude in data processing be included in the objectives of the programs. The Commission also recommended to the Minister that general and multi-disciplinary skills be included in the programs. Many of the institutions showed a need to improve graduation rates. The colleges should also raise  their criteria of admission to training programs. The evaluation suggests that a quality training program is usually a good indicator of a quality program and that many training courses should be of a longer duration. The Commission believes that the colleges should, in certain cases, develop their own course options and that, generally, the programs leading to an AEC respond to local needs. There is a call for a more liberal interpretation of a collective agreement, which currently limits the hiring of teaching staff who are active in the labor market. Appendices include data by institution and evaluation criteria. (BJ)",

During the same time period, the number of associate degrees awarded by CCSF decreased by 10.6 percent, while the number of certificates awarded increased by 24 percent, compared to 8.1 percent and 7.4 percent increases from community colleges across the state. Course completion rates for CCSF students increased by 0.4 percent during these two years, while the rates for community colleges in California was unchanged. Course completion rates for CCSF students decreased in the apprenticeship and advanced vocational courses, but increased for introductory vocational courses. Statewide, vocational course completion rates increased for all three areas. Finally, CCSF students in the 1995 cohort outperformed the statewide average for basic skills improvement. (JJL)",

        "description":"With the advent of accelerative learning changing the teaching paradigm, it is important to establish more effective ways of evaluating and assessing learning competencies. Alternative assessments are necessary because: (1) all learning needs to be placed into the larger context of the real world; (2) the ultimate purpose of education is for the learners to be productive contributing members of society; and (3) assessments are not tricks, hurdles, or a mere \"spitting-out\" of memorized facts, but simply feedback to learners and educators that learning has occurred. Alternative and authentic assessments are defined as methods of measuring the end product of learning and competencies in real-life or simulated real-life situations. This paper examines how they impact the role of the  teacher as facilitator and coach to the learner in sharing the \"big picture.\" It also discusses how educators can develop authentic alternative assessments by starting at the end, recognizing assessment as positive feedback, building in continuous learning, measuring characteristics of learning, and planning logical learning steps. Alternative assessment examples are provided, such as rubrics, portfolio, projects, performance, games and competitions, and multiple evaluators. Questions to consider in creating and selecting assessment methods are presented, as are the benefits of using alternative and authentic assessments. (VWC)",

Although the transfer rate of community college students to ASU is good, with a little over 32 percent of ASU upper division students having completed 48 or more credit hours at a community college, problems still exist. There is a recognition that the changes (or lack of changes), additions, and deletions made in the curriculum or degree requirements at the community colleges and at the university impact both institutions and, perhaps more importantly, the students served by both institutions. Therefore, the two institutions decided to assess the policy, procedures, and practices at both institutions that govern or influence  articulation. This paper presents the mission overlap of ASU and MCCCD, and sets forth a policy that begins with the premise that the institutions will collaborate and cooperate and not compete with each other in ways that will negatively impact students. It examines the need to define procedures and practices in terms of communication and decision-making that is characterized by the following: faculty driven with administrative support, faculty-to-faculty participation, sufficient time for discussion, precise definitions, checks and balances, appeals, and accountability. The paper also asserts the need to define terms, and looks at addressing other areas of concern, research/data analysis, and dissemination and training. (VWC)",

This policy statement was written in order to make assessment a year-round opportunity for all faculty and staff. The assessment process should begin with the establishment of goals and objectives, and the entire faculty should be involved in determining how to measure progress toward these goals. The policy encourages an increase in effectiveness at every level, from the individual within the department to the entire college. Assessment efforts are linked to the college planning process so that the Executive Council and Cabinet will consider recommendations, and resources will be made available for their  implementation. The policy defines an integrated Annual Assessment Cycle, which will become an ongoing aspect of the planning and evaluation process throughout the college. Issues related to development, scope, and oversight of institutional effectiveness, resources, and assessment and planning, are discussed. The levels of institutional assessment are presented in three parts: (1) assessment of the college mission and goals; (2) assessment of units, divisions, departments, and committees; and (3) individual assessment.

In all but two area groups, the Fall 1996 District average WSCH/FTEF was below previous District averages. In most cases all of the colleges in Fall 1996 were below previous District averages within each program area and generally were below state figures. In the three largest program areas, English, Math, and Social Sciences, the District average WSCH/FTEF had fallen from the previous high average by 17 percent, 16 percent, and 22 percent respectively.

The report tracks WSCH, FTEF, and the WSCH/FTEF ratio from 1993 through 1997. ESL, PACE, GAIN, and some other special classes within the various disciplines have been identified for organizational purposes. All WSCH figures shown in tables, and those used for the calculation of WSCH/FTEF, include positive attendance and daily school contact hour (DSCH) type classes. Noncredit classes and  apprenticeship courses are tracked in this report, and are shown under their appropriate departments or divisions. The intent of this report is not only to show trends on selected variables, but also to facilitate the positing of &quot;what if&quot; questions such as the production of WSCH at various levels of faculty FTE and WSCH per FTEF ratios.

Included in the document are the background for creating the course, a memorandum to the dean at Prestonburg Community College proposing the course, the class syllabus, a list of assignments, a copy of the course evaluation, a profile of the 15 students who enrolled in the course, and profiles of the individual students by the three instructors. The course mission was multifold: a teaching experience that would enhance learning, improve retention, help students understand how courses fit together, and increase student interaction. The course encouraged active involvement of students during  class discussions and the completion of course activities, and prompted students to form meaningful relationships with other students and faculty, as well as to make clear connections between disciplines, participate in service learning, and complete credit hours of General Education coursework. Despite the extensive planning needed to design the course, the benefits far outweighed the disadvantages. The paper stresses that three things are necessary for such courses to succeed: (1) support from the college administration; (2) commitment on the part of participating faculty; and (3) an adequate amount of time for planning, preparation, and scheduling.

        "description":"The Assessment Faculty Guide from St. Louis Community College provides guidance for faculty members about how to implement outcomes assessment. The handbook is divided into five areas: (1) assessment rationale, including history, definition, principles, and questions and answers; (2) the structure of assessment, providing a description, organization chart, and current membership of related campus committees; (3) the assessment process; (4) faculty responsibility and participation; and (5) necessary forms. The guide emphasizes the paradigm shift that has taken place in community colleges that shifts the focus from teaching to learning. Student assessment is taken to mean the systematic collection, examination, and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative data about student  learning and the use of that information both to document and to improve student learning. St. Louis' program is faculty-driven, ongoing, designed to refocus institutional attention on quality instead of enrollment growth, and is separate from faculty evaluation. Under the plan, the primary work of assessment is performed by the assessment units--such as instructors, academic departments, career program offices, and college service units--with the support of the campus assessment committee. The assessment process itself employs a five step model of outcomes assessment: (1) identify mission and goals; (2) identify outcomes; (3) determine an appropriate means of assessment; (4) collect the results; and use the results to improve student learning. Sample forms are included. (CAK)",

The Planning Task Force employed several methods of inquiry in order to determine areas of concern regarding non-credit English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) and Transitional-Studies (TL) programs and develop an action plan. Four goals were established: (1) increase student, staff, faculty, administration, and community awareness of available college programs and services; (2) improve access of ESL and TS students to appropriate programs at CCSF and in the community at large; (3) establish linkages among CCSF programs and  outside agencies, and provide adequate resources to maintain them; and (4) conduct systematic research to evaluate non-credit programs. Part 2 of this report reviews available information about non-credit English-as-a-Second-Language and Transitional-Studies students and their educational goals, completion rates, and satisfaction with CCSF programs and services. Part 3 presents a discussion of areas of concern in the CCSF non-credit program, and part 4 presents goals, objectives, and actions proposed by the Planning Task Force.

Part 1 reviews general findings of the fall 1997 technology survey: (1) the level of computer expertise among faculty, staff and administrators appears to be increasing; (2) in comparison with the results of the 1994 survey, the 1997 survey shows a strong trend toward the adoption of computer technology by the CCSF workforce; (3) use of e-mail and the Internet has increased, though the majority of respondents indicated a low to moderate self-rating of skills and experience using the Internet; (4) most survey respondents use a computer at least once a day, and the majority of their Internet use was to access materials. Part 2 of  this report focuses specifically on instructional faculty, who have both the highest and lowest levels of computer expertise at CCSF. It was found that instructional faculty are less likely than other college employees to rate department colleagues as important sources of computer and technology information, which may be related to the frequency with which faculty use technology off-campus. Part 3 focuses again on instructional faculty, revealing that enjoyment of teaching, access to new resources, and creativity are perceived as the major benefits of instructional technology. (JJL)",

The projections are statistical extrapolations of current trends in enrollment by campus, based on unduplicated headcounts of full-time and part-time students enrolled in regular session day or extended-daycredit courses. Included are students in programs leading to a bachelor's degree or higher, students in programs leading to associate degrees or certificates, and unclassified students. Historical data are included in the tables and charts to facilitate comparison and analysis. They were compiled from the Student Enrollment Reports, the Academic Crossover Studies and the Course Registration Reports. Findings  show that the enrollment of regular students for the University of Hawaii measured 45,251 in Fall 1997, a 3.9% decline from Fall 1996 and the third consecutive year of decrease. For Fall 1998, UH system enrollment is forecast to decline slightly, to just over 45,000. This projection is somewhat lower than that made last year and takes into account the recent enrollment decline across the UH system. Recommendations are made in response to findings that the UH system will experience little or no overall growth in enrollments. (JJL)",

The enrollment projections are based on unduplicated headcounts of full-time and part-time students enrolled in credit courses. Included are classified students enrolled in liberal arts or vocational programs as well as unclassified students. Unlike previous reports, these projections also include projected headcounts in continuing education credit courses offered by Honolulu Community College, beginning Fall 1999. Historical data are included to facilitate comparison and analysis. Appended are historical and projected enrollment of Hawaii public high school seniors by school district. (JJL)",

        "description":"This report presents information on the residence and migration of first-time freshmen for the State of Hawaii for the Fall 1996 semester. The information presented is for first-time freshmen only. The first-time freshmen population discussed in this report is divided into three groups: (1) those residents of Hawaii who chose to main in the State to attend either a University of Hawaii (UH) campus or private degree-granting institution; (2) those Hawaii residents who chose to leave the State to enroll in institutions on the U.S. mainland; and (3) those first-time freshmen who came to Hawaii from other states or from foreign countries. Information is further broken down by type of institution attended: public versus private and four-year versus two-year. Findings show that UH  seems to be the first choice for most Hawaii-resident first-time freshmen. The vast majority of students in-migrating to Hawaii attend private rather than public UH institutions. In contrast, slightly more than half of out-migrating students attended private institutions. The percentage of Hawaii resident first-time freshmen remaining in the state and proportion of first-time freshmen enrolled in the state who are Hawaii residents have declined since 1992. Overall, 21.9% more students left Hawaii than entered. Appendices include lists of U.S. mainland institutions with ten or more Hawaii resident first-time freshmen enrolled in Fall 1996, as well as lists of the 50 states with the number of Hawaii-resident first-time freshmen enrolled in each state.

Attempts are being made in all states to measure performance and institutional value, although each state varies in its ability to collect data due to state laws and procedures. Some states have created links between Unemployment Insurance (UI) data and community college records to track student economic outcomes. This digest summarizes the tracking systems that have been developed by four states: Washington, North Carolina, Florida, and California. Each state  system uses a combination of state employment and workforce data with college records to assess various measures of post-attendance success and progress. These states are working to communicate information on student outcomes to concerned constituencies to better understand the values of specific programs and institutions. Contains 12 references.

        "description":"This digest discusses shared governance in community colleges and identifies issues highlighted by recent shared governance experiences. Governance structure in public community colleges tends to have many variations at both the state and local level. Shared governance is a pattern of self-government in which decision-making is shared among constituencies affected by the decisions. In community colleges, the decision-making responsibility may be shared among governing boards, administrators and faculty, with participation by staff and students. Ideally, a shared governance structure accurately recognizes the needs of all constituencies and fosters partnership and vested interest in the successful policy outcomes. Several examples of shared governance models are cited to  articulate the actual advantages and disadvantages. The examples suggest that shared governance can be successful in increasing participation in the decision process and interaction within the college community, but also may lead to challenges. Shared governance may: 1) promote turf wars between constituencies; 2) fragment budgets; 3) promote distrust and resistance to change; 4) be unsound in terms of legal accountability; and 5) be too slow. Successful shared governance requires a committed and focused effort from all participants and clearly described missions and goals. Contains 14 references. (RDG)",

        "description":"Universalizing primary education for girls and children in disadvantaged areas remains the most challenging task for developing countries in Asia and the Pacific. This evaluation report reviews the processes and outcomes of the Pilot Project on Promotion of Primary Education for Girls and Children in Disadvantaged Areas in Gansu Province, China, a UNESCO-sponsored project through the Asian-Pacific Program for Education for All implemented between 1991 and 1995. The report is presented in three parts. Part 1 describes the planning procedures; the target areas; and the project objectives, scope, activities, and evaluation plan. The major activities of the pilot project involved mobilizing influential persons in the community to ensure community participation, providing family  education to parents, training educational personnel, developing supplementary learning materials combining functional literacy with vocational skills, and providing preschool education. Part 2 details educational deficits in the targeted area's available school facilities, outlines the specific intervention procedures and additional studies undertaken, and presents outcomes. Findings indicated that the enrollment rate and retention rate have been raised by 11 percent and 3 percent, respectively, and the repetition and dropout rates have been reduced by 8 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Girls' participation increased steadily in all counties involved. Part 3 of the report discusses the implications of the study, concluding that the pilot project proves that with well-designed and  implemented interventions, serious disadvantages can be overcome to make a difference in the lives of girls. Part 4 outlines problems with the project and makes suggestions for future programs. (KB)",

The program is particularly helpful in serving children from linguistic minority backgrounds and their families. The program's strategies are also appropriate for teachers and parents of children in the 2- to 4-year-old range who are developing typically. The &quot;Language Is Key&quot; model draws upon three solid research bases: early language is critical to later academic success; parents can use simple language facilitation strategies after brief training; and strengthening a child's first language--the language spoken at home--will also support the development of English. Following an introduction, the manual  presents brief descriptions of the program's recommendations to train staff to use language strategies with children, train staff to train parents/families, and train parents/families. The third section details the program's conceptual framework and the three language facilitation strategies: Comment and wait; Ask questions and wait; and Respond by adding a little more (CAR). The fourth and fifth sections of the manual outline specific agendas for six training sessions for staff and for families, respectively, and provide important support for the content in the videotapes. The final section of the manual lists references and resources. Background information for trainers and reproducible handouts for each training session are appended. The two companion videotapes provide specific  language building strategies that will enhance typical early childhood classroom routines and parent-child interactions. The first videotape shows how parents and teachers can facilitate children's language while looking at picture books; the second focuses on language facilitation during play. (HTH)",

The issue describes the certification process, the process for evaluating candidates, and components of the evaluation materials. The May 1998 issue  focuses on implications of disruptive behavior disorders for the child care community. This issue differentiates disruptive behavior disorders from normal developmental changes, provides guidelines for identifying children with potential behavior problems, discusses the advantages of obtaining an official diagnosis, and describes possible courses of action. The Children's Relationship and Emotional Skills Training Program is also described. The November 1998 issue focuses on challenges faced by early childhood educators when they consider referring young children for special services because of suspected developmental difficulties. The issue also discusses understanding parents' needs, collecting information about the child, the parent-teacher conference, and referring a family to  appropriate services. Each issue of the newsletter includes resources related to the issue's focus for child care administrators, including training opportunities and materials available through the Child Care Connections library.

Based on an analysis of books, magazines, newspapers, radio, television, film, videotapes, software, and the Internet, and interviews with over 200 key professionals in fields such as communication research, parent education, journalism, and public relations, this report identifies strengths and weaknesses in media coverage of parenting. The report first reviews historical and social forces that have produced the expanded media interest in parenting. Strengths in the media's role are then identified, including the following: (1)  parenting is a staple topic in many print media; (2) parenting initiatives within electronic media are expanding; (3) parental demand for media information is substantial and increasing; and (4) media can have a significant impact. Identified weaknesses are then listed, including the following: (1) easily accessible sources of information for media on parenting are scarce and scattered; (2) media parenting advice is often confusing and conflicting; (3) parents of adolescents receive less information and support from media than parents of younger children; and (4) entertainment television has been overlooked as an influence on parenting and as a vehicle for supporting and informing parents. The report recommends that the knowledge base about parenting be strengthened by holding  consensus-building conferences and that a comprehensive, integrated communications strategy be implemented to disseminate the emerging consensus about parenting in ongoing and targeted ways.

        "description":"The Minnesota Early Care and Education Financing Partnership, seeking financing solutions for their state, sponsored a meeting in mid-1998 among prominent thinkers from the early care and education and higher education financial aid communities. The meeting produced two sets of results. The first was a set of pivotal lessons concerning the application of higher education financing methods and strategies to early care and education. The second was a framework for a system of financing early care and education services, reflected in ten major recommendations. This report details discussion and conclusions from the meeting. The report's recommendations are: (1) explore methods of adapting key features of the higher education financial aid system through research and consultation  with higher education financing and financial aid experts, and use demonstration projects to test system models that integrate these interdependent financial aid strategies; (2) require that programs participating in the system adhere to quality criteria; (3) cultivate diverse revenue sources to support early care and education programs; (4) develop additional funding sources and vehicles for aid to families, while increasing the contribution levels and flexibility of current sources; (5) develop dedicated public funding sources for infrastructure support for a coordinated early care and education system; (6) improve consumer information and increase demand for high-quality early care and education; (7) promote early care and education as part of the education continuum and as the  foundation for subsequent education and life success; (8) expand research and data capacities to provide information about the benefits of early care and education and to highlight unmet needs for services; (9) move toward establishing a national organization of early care and education organizations to unify public policy and lobbying efforts; and (10) build a national consensus within the early care and education community about the design and implementation of a financing system.

Over 400 married Koreans were asked if they had any understanding of each proverb and to rate the degree to which they agreed with its underlying value. Findings indicated that subjects showed a high level of understanding of proverbs representing affection toward a child, importance of a child's education, and filial piety; the degree  of agreement tended to be relatively high but varied with subjects' demographic variables. Age and education were particularly influential variables with all proverbs. Older subjects tended to agree with expressing affection toward a child, the difficulty of child rearing, preferring boys, and authoritative control and filial piety.

Participating were 37 families with infants and preschool-age older siblings who were observed in the laboratory at 3 time points and followed-up 3 years later. Findings indicated that parents' early marital relationship was associated with more positive sibling involvement and teaching, and less sibling conflict and rivalry 3 years later. Fathers who were more controlling of their children's emotions during preschool had children who later demonstrated less sibling teaching. Mothers' sensitivity with infant siblings was associated with positive sibling relations 3 years later, but fathers' sensitivity correlated positively with later  sibling conflict and negatively with later sibling teaching. Older siblings who were securely attached to fathers provided more care to younger siblings 3 years later, while older siblings' early emotion understanding was negatively associated with later caretaking. Multiple regression analyses revealed that parents' early marital love and their sensitivity with infant siblings were the most consistent predictors of all sibling relationship measures other than instrumental caretaking. The findings underscore the importance of the early affective family environment in shaping sibling relationships over time as well as the importance of examining both parents' contributions to sibling relationships.

The goals emphasize early literacy, numeracy, and the development of personal and social skills. Presented as six areas of learning, the goals provide a foundation for later achievement in Key Stage 1 of the National Curriculum. The report's introduction defines the six learning areas: personal and social development, language and literacy, mathematics, knowledge and understanding of the world, physical development, and creative development. The report delineates common features of good practice to support children's learning and key features underlying effective partnerships with parents. The bulk of the report shows in a  tabular format how the desirable outcomes or learning goals in each area relate to National Curriculum Key Stages 1 and 2. (KB)",

Students greatly enjoyed the opportunities to learn more about themselves and receive peer support and guidance from interested adult facilitators. The combination of instruction about leadership characteristics with individual assessment group exercises was effective in promoting the development of leadership skills in youth.

It suggests that the following constructs are key to understanding parents' involvement decisions: (1) parental role construction frames what parents believe they are supposed to do with respect to their children's education; (2) parents' sense of efficacy for helping the child succeed in school defines how effective parents believe they can be in influencing their child's educational outcomes; and (3) parents' perceptions of general invitations, opportunities, and demands for involvement from the school shape parents' beliefs about the school's  expectations for their involvement. The study tests the utility of these constructs in predicting parents' involvement activities. The results provide empirical confirmation of the theoretical prediction that role construction, efficacy, and perception of teacher invitations influence parents' involvement decisions. Post hoc analyses suggested that parental role construction appears to be a mechanism through which efficacy influences parent involvement activities. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications for improving parent-school partnerships. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables, and 48 references.) (JDM)",

Language and cognitive differences, differential access to books, and inequalities in schooling are possible causes for differential achievement rates, a type of educational research addressed through ethnography. The rigor represented in codified ethnographic research methods produces scientifically valid and  reliable data, as do descriptive and correlational methodologies and their combinations. Ethnographic, correlational, and descriptive methodologies demonstrate a value added nature which increases their potential contribution to educational research.

        "description":"On the basis of a comprehensive best-evidence synthesis of the literature on the effects of multigrade and multi-age classes, Veenman (1995) concluded that there were no significant differences between multigrade and single-grade classes in cognitive or achievement effects. Subsequently, Mason and Burns (1996) challenged Veenman's conclusion, claiming that multigrade classes have at least a small negative effect on achievement, as well as having potential negative effects on teacher motivation. Multigrade classes are used extensively within Victorian primary schools, sometimes by choice but at other times as a result of the combined pressures from staff-student ratios and enrollment numbers at particular grade levels. The issue of their contribution to effective learning is thus  a critical, practical one, as well as an interesting research question. Analysis of data from the Victorian Quality Schools Project, a large, comprehensive, three-year, longitudinal study of school and teacher effectiveness, revealed some significant negative effects on achievement associated with multigrade classes and some non-significant effects. Results differed between data collection occasions (1993 and 1994) and between subject areas: literacy and numeracy. In order to illuminate the processes at work, the issue of multigrade classes became one of the research questions investigated in the qualitative phase of the project in 1995. Principal and teacher perceptions of the level of learning difficulty in multigrade classes (for all students and for particular subgroups) were sought  through interviews, together with information about school policy on multigrade classes and the processes of allocating students to such classes. The results indicate the directions that could be taken to maximize effectiveness of teaching and learning in multigrade classes, as well as directions for further empirical investigation of the effects of multigrade classes on students' learning outcomes.

During the first stage of this project, preschool teachers were asked about their concerns relating to young children's literacy development. Their responses revealed little access to recent thinking concerning emergent literacy, either through their initial training programs or through subsequent professional development opportunities. Their understandings and beliefs with regard to early literacy rendered them unable to provide for this development in their programs. Stage 2 of this project included these teachers and their assistants in an action research professional development cycle which informed and supported them in reviewing and changing their practice. Stage 3 followed  the children from these preschools to the end of their first year in school.

        "description":"One approach in the teaching of reading that is criticized a lot is the round robin procedure in which the teacher, generally in a heterogeneously grouped classroom, forms three reading subgroups for instruction purposes. Each of the groups is as homogenous as possible. The teacher teaches one subgroup, while the other two are profitably engaged in related learning activities. Each subgroup takes its turn in sequence. A basal textbook is used, and each subgroup reads a short section silently and is then quizzed about content. Round robin reading had its day of emphasis in reading literature, but today it is considered outdated. It is still popular in some schools because it provides the teacher an opportunity to notice the quality of oral reading students and it is an orderly way  of teaching small groups. However, it becomes too routine if used excessively as a teaching activity, and it separates students into specific groups rather than keeping them together in reading achievement. Other effective approaches for reading are the &quot;Big Book&quot; approach, the individualized approach, and a contract system which emphasizes a psychological approach in reading instruction. There needs to be a balance between reading for meaning and word recognition techniques, such as phonics. Phonics should be taught as needed to individual or small groups of students. (NKA)",

The introduction to the report discusses the charge to the panel by Congress, establishment of the panel, the panel's approach to achieving its objectives of its charge and initial topic selection, regional public hearings, and adoption of topics studied by the panel. The report then presents a methodological overview and the findings and determinations of the National Reading Panel by topic areas: alphabetics (phonemic awareness instruction and phonics instruction); fluency; comprehension (vocabulary instruction, text comprehension instruction, and teacher  preparation and comprehension strategies instruction); teacher education and reading instruction; and computer technology and reading instruction. The report concludes with a discussion of research needs (\"next steps\") and reflections of the work of the panel. An addendum discusses the processes applied to the selection, review, and analysis of research relevant to reading instruction. (RS)",

        "description":"Increasingly, reading proficiency is being measured in terms of outcomes based data. This drive for accountability supports the growth of National Profiles, Literacy Benchmarks, and statewide assessments such as the Diagnostic Net, which record the numbers of students who fail to make the grade. In the face of widespread concerns about perceived low literacy standards, governments have responded by providing increased funding for students experiencing difficulty, introducing specialized programs and personnel, and revamping syllabus documents. But are these responses based on an authentic assessment of the situation? Outcomes based data cannot adequately reflect the complex issues addressed in school contexts. Perhaps further questions should be asked, including: What is the  nature of reading support? How is it planned and provided? What actually happens in support programs? How do students perceive the support they receive? This paper presents the rationale and methodology of current research investigating policies and practices in reading support across years 1-3 in two Queensland schools. The research is designed to identify the critical elements contributing to success in these contexts recognized for their provision of highly effective reading support. It features an emphasis on qualitative methods of investigation, an exploration and analysis of teacher theoretical orientations and their effects on planning and practice, and comprehensive description and analysis of the actual experiences and perceptions of the students receiving various types of  reading support. If we want to get answers that matter, we must ask the right questions. (Contains 47 references.) (Author/RS)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a series of three studies designed to assess the effectiveness of a metacognitive approach to teaching word identification and reading comprehension skills to upper primary poor readers, and to investigate effective methods for implementing the metacognitive program in the regular classroom. To improve word identification skills, experimental subjects were trained to: consider the context; compare with known words; and carve up the word parts. To help monitor and control the use of these strategies, subjects were taught to: look for the cues; be flexible; and ask does it make sense. Reciprocal teaching procedures, incorporating the word identification strategies, were used for comprehension training. Subjects in control conditions received: (1) reciprocal  teaching of comprehension skills and traditional methods of word identification; (2) normal classroom reading activities; or (3) normal classroom activities plus phonics-based remedial instruction. Measures of word identification, metacognitive awareness and monitoring of word identification cues, and comprehension were taken on several occasions in each study. Results of repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant improvements in most measures for all conditions. However, there were significantly greater improvements for subjects in the experimental conditions. Also, a model of implementation in which teachers were entirely responsible for implementation was more effective than one in which the experimenter initially set up the program and the teachers gradually took over  responsibility for its implementation. The implications of these findings for classroom practice are discussed in the light of current research. (Contains 40 references and 11 figures of data.) (Author/RS)",

        "description":"In educational research the problem of student description is eternal. On what basis do researchers make decisions about aspects of students' material lives to count as data, interpretive categories, contextual information, results? This paper focuses specifically on the problem of &quot;background&quot; in researching the student subject. The paper argues that young people's life-worlds and experiences are by no means &quot;background&quot; in their access to and take up of educational provision and school literacies, and that indeed there is a substantial case to be made in foregrounding student and school differences as research is conducted about new literate practices in new times. While &quot;background&quot; is used across research paradigms and approaches, the paper argues that the word (with its  attendant abstract adjectives) may unleash powerful, at time dangerous, effects in educational sites, and that it is increasingly problematic in terms of what it implies about students' (and teachers') lifeworlds and subjectivities. The paper aims to open up a discussion about a specific discursive practice--the use of &quot;background&quot;--and to consider its effects in actual sites and to explore possible alternatives. Through an analysis of teachers' descriptions of their students, it discusses the limits and the dangers of employing &quot;background&quot; as a construct in these times, and it turns briefly to recent and current &quot;naming&quot; dilemmas to be faced in working with teachers and students in schools serving poor communities.

        "description":"Recent debates focus on literacy curriculum as if it is separate from teachers' other work, almost at times as if teachers and their contexts are irrelevant to what is the most appropriate literacy pedagogy. Perhaps learning to read and write is not hard work, but teaching is, no matter which theoretical orientation about literacy is adhered to. The multiplicities of other functions that teachers enact leave them positioned in contradictory ways against their imagined ideal literacy classroom. These contradictions sent one researcher into disadvantaged schools to talk with and observe teachers at work. This paper is a first exploration of these investigations in one school. The paper considers, through the stories and classroom discourse of teachers and their students, the  question: What kinds of literate cultures do teachers construct in a disadvantaged school? It offers texts from everyday school and classroom life to reconsider what teachers do as they develop a literate culture. It describes the kinds of literate work that children do and discusses the dominant discourses that surround the construction of literate cultures at school. The paper provides examples of the ways in which these teachers make spaces for other kinds of literate cultures and the ways in which classrooms are sites for multiple and at times contradictory literacies which compete for time and priority.

It then discusses teachers' discursive practices in literacy lessons and offers an analytic framework for investigating teacher talk from a Foucauldian perspective, with power as productive and discourse as constitutive. The discussion in the paper stems from 18 months observation in 4 classrooms during literacy lessons in 1 disadvantaged school and explores normative discursive practices  where teachers exercise power in managing the class to be made literate. The focus is on the impact of macro discourses upon what teachers say and do and how they constitute &quot;the student&quot; in the local, micro everyday institutional practices of schooling.

        "description":"Despite the considerable attention given to literacy assessment, there has been very little examination of one of the most common assessment and reporting practices; namely, the teacher written report card. What kinds of literate subjects are constructed in teachers' written assessments of students and what are the effects for different students? This paper considers what counts officially as literacy in one small school serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged community. Through the examination of teacher written report cards, the paper shows how literacy assessments draw on a multiplicity of discourses in compiling the literate student. In the paper, this analysis indicates the ways in which educational discursive practices have specific local effects on the assessment of  children's literacy and consequently on the ways in which students' identities are constituted in terms of success and failure. In particular, the paper traces the primary school career of one student as documented in the report archive. A post-structuralist discourse analysis of the local up-take of forms of &quot;official knowledge&quot; can provide hard insights concerning the differential material effects and unanticipated consequences of discursive practices on students' educational trajectories. Using such an approach in the paper demonstrates how children may be unwittingly disadvantaged despite teachers' best intentions and commitments to progressive pedagogical theories.

        "description":"This paper explores the way teachers make use of and work on theory to disrupt and ultimately improve everyday educational practice. The paper argues that teachers working on and with theory can and do generate new forms of educative practices in the field of literacy education, which are based on explicit standpoints towards social justice in specific localities such as diverse and low socioeconomic communities. To make this case and to illustrate particular practices and effects, the paper draws briefly on the author's own history as a teacher-researcher in the 1970s, but mostly it refers to subsequent collaborative research with teachers and the work of two teacher-researchers. According to the paper, use of the phrase &quot;teachers working on and with theory&quot; signals the  preference to avoid theory/practice dichotomies generally and also suggests the importance of teacher agency in regards to the production and use of theories. The paper is informed by multiple theories, assembled over time in different professional roles and relationships to research-models of action research and teacher research (Kemmis and McTaggart, 1988), Foucault's (1983, 1984) constitutive theory of discourse, feminist theories of teachers' work (Acker, 1995; Weiler, 1988), and Bourdieu's theory of practice (1977, 1990).

Schools and teachers need to make &quot;ready&quot; for different children in a very different world than that in which many people grew up. The interest in the paper, however, is not only in individual difference but in the kinds of differences in children's linguistic, social, economic, and cultural capital, in what capital different children &quot;bring to school&quot; and are able to use in schools, and in how this affects what they take up from what schools make available. Although the main focus is literacy, the paper uses examples which also touch on numeracy and technology. It is in the tradition of &quot;kid (and teacher) watching,&quot; as there is much to be learned from being  in classrooms. It is organized in three parts: first, two children are introduced and followed through a morning in the last months of their preschool lives, raising questions about what might await them in school; then a number of classrooms and events where teachers have consciously constructed a &quot;permeable curriculum&quot; are examined; and finally, the two children are looked at again to see what they are making of school and what it is making of them. The paper argues that early childhood curricula and pedagogical practices need to be informed by a commitment to social justice for socioeconomically disadvantaged and culturally diverse communities of children who are present at school, &quot;ready or not.&quot; (Contains 22 references.)

The paper first re-examines some pervasive and dangerous myths about who the &quot;all&quot; (as in &quot;Literacy for All&quot;) are and how the &quot;all&quot; already include divided populations. Second, it turns to how institutions confer credits  (or otherwise) on different children differently for what they bring to school. Third, the paper argues that in these times it is absolutely necessary that the literacies made available to young people in schools are multiple, inclusive, critical, sophisticated, and pleasurable. It suggests that schooling is and should be about more than just literacy in any narrow sense of the concept. The paper concludes with six questions to think about regarding literacy practices.

        "description":"A study explored how Retrospective Miscue Analysis (RMA) is successful, using discourse analysis of the questions and discussion strategies used during RMA. Seven readers with successful RMA sessions who represented several age/grade groups, ethnic groups, and linguistic backgrounds were chosen, and their discourse was analyzed over a period of 8 months. Examining what aspects of the RMA session support the readers' development of a positive view of himself or herself as a reader, over time, 4 subcategories emerged: procedural, language used, interactional, and ownership/control. Examining also what language the reader uses to talk about his or her reading process and strategies, over time, the study found 2 subcategories: reading process and metacognition. Findings show that a  common thread through all of the readers' RMA sessions is their movement toward central roles in the dialogs, toward equanimity and parity with the teacher/researcher's contributions. This increase in discussant role goes hand-in-hand with an increase in the ability to talk about reading. As readers become more fluent in the language of reading, their confidence in their ability to learn about the reading process grows, and they become more in control of the RMA sessions. It is precisely this control over the reading process which influences reading proficiency. Teacher/researchers also learn how to discuss the reading process with each individual reader. RMA sessions tend to progress from a primarily teacher/researcher-driven dialog in the beginning sessions to a conversation between  equals in the middle and latter sessions, during which it is frequently the reader who drives the session.

Classroom educators and special educators should therefore establish a learning environment that builds resilience in all learners. Educational resilience is defined as \"the heightened likelihood of success in school and other life accomplishments despite environmental adversities they face in their environments.\" There are various criteria and instruments that teachers can use to identify students who are resilient and nonresilient, and to gather data about students' behaviors. After identification and assessment, teachers should consider a variety of strategies that foster  resilience in all learners. Six literacy-oriented strategies are: (1) read aloud appropriate children's literature; (2) encourage the selection of a wide variety of authentic literature; (3) give extra support to individuals who experience difficulty selecting appropriate resources; (4) provide time for pleasurable reading and writing; (5) engage learners in interactive activities that help them think about their thinking; and (6) ask questions that stimulate responses from all children.

        "description":"Based on the belief that learning to read is an ongoing process that continues into the upper grades, this guidebook is intended as a \"starter kit\" to help teachers, literacy specialists, and administrators design strong literacy programs that span the secondary grades. The guidebook maintains that as learners encounter unfamiliar and complex text, they need instructional support from teachers in all disciplines to gain the skills necessary to tackle these challenges. The guidebook seeks to answer these questions: What does the proficient adolescent reader look like? What are the best practices in the teaching of reading? What professional development will provide teachers the support they need to work wisely with the adolescent reader? What professional development do teachers  need to build strong reading instructional programs for all students? What is available to assess the reading performance of adolescent readers? What resources will help a school develop a quality reading program? Following an introduction, the guidebook contains 8 sections: (1) Position Statement on Adolescent Literacy; (2) Portrait of an Adolescent Reader; (3) Best Practices; (4) Comprehension Strategies; (5) Assessing the Adolescent Reader (including An Assessment System, Classroom Reading Assessments, A Few Reading Inventories, Matrix of Published Reading Tests, and Sample of NWREL's Traits of a Reader); (6) Quality Programs; (7) Professional Development; and (8) Resources on Adolescent Reading (including references to 69 books and journal articles, a list of 8 professional journals  for literacy educators, and 8 Web sites of interest).

This particular study focused on 7 kindergarten classes that started the study in the fall of 1999 and continued throughout the entire academic year. Students were taught selected themes using the resources and procedures contained in the \"Harcourt Reading\" program. Teachers received training from experienced consultants in methods of implementing the program. Instruction included a broad sample of reading skills from the strands of decoding, vocabulary, and comprehension. Students were administered the Harcourt program's \"Reading Inventory\" as a pretest and posttest. Results indicated: (1) average scores increased consistently and  increases were statistically significant from the beginning of the year to the end of the year; (2) increases rose at a sharper rate in the second half of the year, suggesting that the longer the students remained in the program the more their scores increased at a higher rate, and also suggesting that teacher familiarity may have played a part; and (3) students would have almost certainly shown a greater increase; however, a ceiling effect with many students achieving near perfect scores on the posttest may have prevented an even more significant score increase.

Early childhood education needs to embrace literacy programs that actively employ storytelling to bridge students' established oracy skills and their newfound literacy skills. By doing this, children will encounter a broad range of language: new words, archaic expressions, puns, phrases, rhymes, metaphors, and more. This establishes an extensive oral language base which builds literacy skills, such as word recognition, spelling, grammar, literary conventions, and comprehension. It is essential to present storytelling and literacy experiences that are meaningful to the children, and therefore their social and cultural experience needs to be reflected  in the choice of stories and the choice and use of text. Teachers should cultivate the development of children's literacy skills by providing opportunities to play with words, with story, and with text. (Contains 16 references.) (SR)",

        "description":"This paper considers the concept of English as a global language in the context of South African educational policy. The paper first notes that the richer a country is the more possible it is for the rulers to take the social costs of language policy into account, i.e., the Netherlands and Canada can spend vast sums on different aspects of language policy, especially on the learning of foreign languages and on the accommodation of the languages of immigrant minorities, whereas most African countries are constrained to implement language in education policies that might seem irrational. It points out that for reasons that have to do with the modalities of colonial oppression in the 19th and 20th centuries, it seemed as though every newly independent African state was doomed to  take the same language policy detour by accepting in practice the primacy of the ex-colonial language. It also discusses the existence of what has been called the &quot;ESL industry&quot; and its marginalizing effects on the African languages and the consequent disempowerment of the speakers of those languages. The paper then concentrates on the new language policy in education in South Africa and discusses the dilemmas and the problems to which this has given rise. It states that the most important features of the policy in regard to language medium is its commitment to an additive bilingualism approach as the desirable norm in all South African schools. The paper discusses the implications of this policy in detail. (Contains 31 references.) (NKA)",

        "description":"To examine the forms that English instruction takes in programs identified as exemplary, a 2-year study was conducted of the working lives of four English/language arts teachers in two schools in Dade County, Florida. The four teachers and the two schools in which they work were identified as &quot;exemplary&quot; by national education leaders, state education officials, and local district leaders. Data were generated by attending the teachers' classes, audiotaping them, and taking copious field notes. Issues such as the following were explored: what the teachers' professional and personal networks were; where they got their ideas for lessons; whether and how they refined these ideas and adjusted them to the needs of their students; how they determined these students' individual needs;  what they thought was important for their students to learn in English class; how they taught both literature and writing; how they prepared students for standardized tests; how they assessed, formally and informally, student work; how they interacted with colleagues; how they were affected by being in schools affiliated with the Coalition of Essential Schools; how they changed as educators over time; and where they thought they were going as educators. Findings suggest that the four teachers see it as their mandate to provide a rich array of literacy-related activities and experiences in their students--activities/experiences that revolve around wide reading, wide writing, expansive and prolonged thinking and problem solving, and ample opportunities for conversing about and presenting  what they are learning to faculty as well as to one another.

        "description":"William Perry argued that adult development can be marked by a progressively refined set of questions focused on how Authorities like teachers can support multiple right answers and still maintain that there are wrong answers. When prospective English teachers view right and wrong answers as relativistic, they seem to view themselves as purposefully neutral, as prospective discussion hosts charged exclusively with facilitating turn-taking and the creation of an emotionally safe context that encourages all to participate. They expect to coach students' thinking, to inform it, and shape it, even though they are fully aware that there is no one right answer out there. A study explored data taken from a broad, longitudinal study of English majors as they developed subject matter  knowledge. The larger study focused heavily on prospective English teachers' personal histories as readers. Prospective teachers (n=12) were interviewed early in their sophomore year and again in their senior year. Data were taken from study participants' responses to a sub-set of the corpus of interview tasks and questions; this sub-set includes a teaching task involving Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Raven,&quot; a literary criticism evaluation task, and a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; teaching task. Students' varied responses to these tasks illustrate how intellectual development is different for each person. Each prospective teacher experienced his/her role projection as the norm. They were unaware of their position on a continuum of development and satisfied with their way of understanding the role of an  authority in a literature classroom.

Steps involved in planning a MWW-LP lesson include: (1) select a multisyllabic foundation word and identify its letter patterns and individual letters, writing those letters and patterns on the MWW-LP form; (2) choose additional letters and patterns; (3) plan a series of words to be made from the letters and patterns; (4) devise semantic, syntactic, and structural clues to aid students  in identifying the words; (5) identify transfer words which students could decode and spell using the letter patterns; and (6) plan extension activities using the letters, patterns, and word sets.

Six nonfiction genres are identified: recount, report, procedure, explanation, persuasion, and discussion. Like the prompting of dialogue in speech, young writing students benefit from prompting by their instructors in the writing process. Two models are suggested for writing instruction, including the steps: (1) demonstration (teacher modeling); (2) joint activity (collaborative writing); (3) scaffolded activity (supported writing, in one model only); and (4)  independent activity (independent writing). Writing frames are also suggested as particularly useful for average writers and those with writing difficulties, and they constitute a basic outline given to students to guide their nonfiction writing.

Students become familiar with the genre of the research article through reading the journals. However, as novice research writers, they need mentoring through the process of writing a journal article in their specialized area by supervisors who are familiar with the rhetorical conventions of the genre in the particular field. Experienced supervisors who have published have an intuitive grasp of the structure of the research article and are able to suggest restructure of unsuccessful drafts. The process by which the supervisor's implicit  knowledge is made explicit, i.e., how an academic supervisor analyzes and revises the structure of a student's draft article, has not been widely studied. Second language research, most notably J. Swales', has analyzed the explicit product of this implicit understanding, i.e., published articles. A think-aloud protocol was used to record the supervisor's revision of an NESBC student's draft journal article. The revised paper was analyzed to see whether Swales'\"moves\" were present, and the recorded text was analyzed to see how and why the supervisor rearranged the draft. This paper is collaboration between an engineer and an applied linguist. It describes the process of reorganization of a professional journal article which an NESBC postgraduate student and his supervisor went through to  arrive at format suitable for publication.

The targeted population consisted of first, fifth, and seventh graders located in northwestern Illinois. The problems of deficiencies in social skills were documented. Data were collected from discipline referrals, teacher journal entries, and student surveys. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students lacked social skills in the areas of respect, empathy, self-control, responsibility, and conflict resolution. Review of the literature suggested that students lacked appropriate social skills due to increased negative social pressures. Other causes that were identified were lack of values taught in the home, student  mobility, and the fact that social skills were not given the same emphasis as other academic skills. A review of solution strategies resulted in the decision to improve social skills development through the use of children's literature, direct instruction, and cooperative learning. Post intervention data indicated social skills instruction resulted in improved student behavior and conflict management. Classroom teachers reported that students' use of appropriate social skills increased after the intervention. (Contains 30 references, and a table and 5 figures of data.

The study concerns an evaluation of the effects of the program &quot;I've Already Got a Book,&quot; which was broadcast once a week on Dutch television in 1995 and included interviews with authors and reviews of a wide range of newly published books. The purpose of the series was to promote reading. There is much confusion about the Dutch term for reading promotion (&quot;leesbevordering&quot;), because every institution in the field gives a different  interpretation of the term. Attention is paid to the various definitions that can be distinguished and the argument is focused on &quot;I've Already Got a Book.&quot; The study evaluated whether the books that were dealt with in the series were actually bought or borrowed on account of the series, and if so, by whom. A survey was therefore carried out in 13 large Dutch bookshops and borrowing figures were collected in libraries. A summary of the results of this study is given and some conclusions are provided concerning the promotion of reading by means of the television series.

Teachers should make the spelling curriculum meaningful for students by maintaining their attention, showing them the purpose and value of learning spelling, and providing necessary tools for correct spelling. Several spelling instruction plans may provide for individual differences in spelling achievement. What is important in differentiated instruction is assisting each student to achieve as much as possible through teaching methods or philosophies such as individual spelling lists, methods/learning activities, contextualized situations, experimentalism and problem solving, or realism and mastery.

        "description":"The Australian Catholic University has developed a collaborative project for one of its personnel to move into a school to take responsibility for some of the school's professional development programs and to conduct action based research related to the project. One key aim of the project is to develop literacy skills across the curriculum for the staff as well as for the university person to act as &quot;an educator in residence&quot; for particular areas of professional development. This paper looks at the development of the new collaborative project between the university and the school and the developing role of the university and school personnel. It explores the issues of developing new research agendas and relationships in a professional setting outside the University. The paper  explores the way in which the project has been shaped by the work of the university person interacting with the school community at three different levels. The first level is working at the whole school level through meetings and a staff development day with staff and parents. The second level of involvement is working in small groups of teachers to develop their skills in teaching literacy skills in their particular subject area. The third level is being achieved by working with teachers on a one-on-one basis in the classroom demonstrating the teaching of text types as well as working in designated release time. The outcomes from each of the levels of involvement are described in the paper. Another aim of the project is to ensure that action research would be generated as a result of the  project.

        "author":["Thwaites, Trevor"],
        "description":"The New Zealand Curriculum Framework identifies seven Essential Learning Areas, namely, Languages, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Technology, Health and Physical Education, and the Arts. These have been in the process of development since 1993, with the Arts section written in draft form in 1998 and released for consultation in 1999. Being positioned last in curriculum development implies that the Arts are at the bottom of a preferred hierarchy of knowledge promoted by the state. This has been further reinforced by the increased drive to promote literacy, numeracy, and information technology in schooling. The &quot;knowledge economy&quot; catch-cry in New Zealand totally ignores the notion of a &quot;creative knowledge.&quot; In an effort to increase the perceived value of the arts, the  writers of the draft &quot;Arts Curriculum&quot; embraced the concept of multiple literacies, which seeks to broaden the understanding of literacy in teaching and learning and to acknowledge a multiplicity of discourses within the school curriculum. Literacy should imply a mode of meaning other than the purely linguistic, it needs to incorporate visual, aural, gestural, spatial, and multimodal meanings (The New London Group, 1996). Literacies in the arts are developed as students learn in, through, and about different arts forms within the arts disciplines and use its languages to communicate and interpret meaning. This paper details the development of &quot;The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum&quot; and the acknowledgment within the curriculum  of the notion of literacy in the arts. It takes the view that  the concept of multiliteracies might be a direction for the arts to take in order to counter the pro-literacy canon embraced by the state. The paper discusses the potential of such a concept in preventing further marginalization of the arts in New Zealand schools. (Contains 22 references.) (Author/RS)",

The paper considers their contributions to teaching and teacher education--all of these women founded schools to educate women. While these women paved the way for all women educators today, their stories portray the perspectives of white women in 19th-century America, since women of color were marginalized and were not allowed to tell their stories. The paper concludes that the road to literacy for women has been a &quot;bumpy one filled with gaping potholes.&quot; It finds that numerous political, social, and economic factors have stood in the way of a woman's right to be an educator and enjoy effective  teacher training programs.

        "description":"Questions about the implications of the new technologies for literacy, literacy teaching, and literacy practices provoke diverse and contradictory responses in the media, in policy documents, in state and national assessment surveys, and among teachers themselves. On one hand, the need for literacy to be reconceptualized and redefined in the face of rapid change seems overwhelming. On the other, definitions of literacy, particularly as they are enacted in curriculum and assessment policies and in schools, for the most part remain largely print based. A pilot study with four teachers in two secondary schools in Australia explored the implications of the new technologies for literacy and the English curriculum. The focus was on what it might mean to extend the range of texts  studied in English to incorporate games, on the nature of computer games as narratives and text, and on changing constructions of literacy as they were reflected in this instance in the planning, teaching, and evaluation of the unit on computer games as texts of the new technologies. Joint planning sessions were held with the teachers. Findings suggest computer games in the classroom do bring &quot;mayhem,&quot; not least in the technological, copyright, and classifications (ratings) involved. Yet at the same time, there is also &quot;magic&quot; in the texts themselves in the engagement of many students more commonly bored or marginal with traditional texts and subject matter.

        "description":"Increasingly in Australia, attention is being given in English or language education to core or functional literacy conceived as print mastery, alongside literature, and critical literacy. The Queensland Years 1 to 10 English syllabus evinces an attempt to organize such qualitatively distinct &quot;literacies&quot; under a burgeoning conceptual and theoretical umbrella. The result is a syllabus which many regard as &quot;unwieldy, if not incoherent, bursting at the seams, and often palpably unsuccessful&quot; at the level of classroom implementation. This paper considers a different approach to understanding literacy in general and critical literacy in particular. This approach aims to transcend the earlier kind of compartmentalized view and develops a sociocultural view of literacy as necessarily  involving three dimensions: &quot;operational,&quot;&quot;cultural,&quot; and &quot;critical.&quot; According to the paper, an integrated view of literacy in practice and in pedagogy addresses all three dimensions simultaneously; none has any priority. The paper describes and discusses the three dimensions in detail. It outlines the elements of a framework for critical literacy and relates them to some examples encountered around Brisbane of young people exploring new technological literacies in varied settings. Examples in the paper involve school students and young adults who worked within a community-based space called GRUNT during 1995-97. The paper concludes by envisaging possibilities for a critical literacy pedagogy built around the use of new technologies. (Contains 33 references.) (NKA)",

The paper builds upon an academic married couple's respective and conjoint experiences and the ways in which they have reflected upon these in the light of contemporary theory, scholarship, and research. It addresses levels and domains of &quot;we-ness&quot; implied in the topic and foregrounds the context which they personally work day by day. The paper cites three conceptual principles which can serve as the basis of ethical human discourse in research: (1) That something would harm someone else is always a good reason not to do it; (2) A person always has the ethical obligation to try to explicate any social practice that there is reason to believe brings personal advantage  or privileges his/her group over other people or other groups; and (3) The distinction between &quot;use value&quot; and &quot;exchange value&quot; is an especially important consideration for research activity under contemporary Australian conditions. The paper then discusses research participants, in process concerns, &quot;back end&quot; concerns, and research supervision. Noting that research always inhabits a larger context than the immediate research practice itself, the paper names some actual and potential deleterious moral consequences for researchers and their work present in the current Australian context.

        "description":"When educators lack the knowledge, understanding and acceptance of their students' language and culture, especially when it differs from their own, a huge mismatch can and often does occur between school and home. What happens to African American children who are raised speaking Black English but schooled in standard English? How do teachers help students who differ from the mainstream mediate socio-cultural tensions and navigate demands of two cultures and speech communities? This qualitative study examines the socio-cultural context of language, diglossia, and diversity in two fourth/fifth grade, predominantly African American classrooms in Waterloo, Iowa. A nesting design was selected for this study to situate Black language interactions within each classroom, the school  district, the Waterloo communities and language classification in American society at large. The ethnographic techniques of participant observation, audiotaping, and interviewing were used to collect data. Historical data was collected to understand the historical and political contexts of the African-American community in this city as it connects to the Delta of Mississippi as well as to larger society. The code-switching and diglossia of four focal students was given particular focus to understand children's negotiation of the language demands of several communities. Data analysis led to three major categories: inventing classroom culture, language choice decisions, and culturally-relevant pedagogy. This investigation suggests that certain strategies employed by two teachers facilitate  the language learning of the African American students they teach: teachers' attitude of acceptance, a direct behavior management style, the use of antiphonal response, code-switching, acceptance of standard English approximations, and recognition of the verbal nature of many African American students. Based on James Banks' theory about multicultural education, a language equity pedagogy model was developed from the study's findings. This model explains how two speech communities, one Black English-speaking and the other standard English-speaking, overlap in the classroom and demand a pedagogy that meets the specific language and culture needs of these students.

        "description":"The clamor to integrate computer-based technologies into curriculum generally, and language and literacy education specifically, is a hallmark of current education policy in many countries. A perceived need for education to keep pace and in &quot;sync&quot; with labor market needs is obviously an important part of the story. Technology and progress have become indissolubly linked in the minds of many parents, students, educators, and policymakers. Expressions of pressure to equip classrooms and the need for teacher professional development to enable them to use the technologies are encountered on an everyday basis in Australia. This paper addresses three main questions: What kinds of differences can be found in different peoples'&quot;ways&quot; with similar computing hardware and software as they  pursue social and cultural purposes in a range of settings? Can these differences usefully inform education policy and practice? and Do they have significant implications for language and literacy education specifically? The paper uses four &quot;snapshots&quot; drawn from larger case studies of computer-mediated practices in different sites; one draws on a year 5 classroom in a country town, while the second and third snapshots depict contrasting ways of producing computer-generated slide show presentations, and the final snapshot focuses on some characteristic ways a group of students from an inner city state school were participating in activities at a nearby community and youth space. It concludes that whatever else is done pedagogically with the new technologies, the aim should be to integrate  them into informed practices of critical social literacy. (Contains 29 references.)

        "description":"This paper explains that an interdepartmental writing across the curriculum course at Syracuse University was developed and proposed by a writing teacher and a professor of experimental psychology and psychopharmacology. The paper states that the course, Perspectives on Drug Experience, was to be offered in both writing and psychology and sought to involve students in discussion, argument, and discovery, incorporating writing as a vehicle for exploration, intellectual development, and the sharing of knowledge. It lays out the course in four units: (1) Reading, Discussing, Responding; (2) The Science of Drug Action; (3) Drug Users; and (4) Policy Debates. The paper relates that the course featured as its centerpiece dialogue over texts, problems, and issues and that an open  discussion format took the participants through territory that a content course using writing-to-learn is unlikely to tread. It presents a discussion of some of the factors built into this environment, which seem to have been productive--they center around three themes: the diffusion of authority, the significant positioning of a rhetorical perspective, and the discussion forum as a collective setting.

        "description":"Offering 16 essays by presenters at the first Middle School Mosaic (held in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997), this book connects the themes of literacy, reflective practice, and the special characteristics of middle level teaching. In the first section, Literature and Literacy at the Middle Level, the authors examine questions of literacy by looking at ways to improve reading, broaden the definitions of literacy and literature, and address important issues through choices of literature. In the second section, Reflective Practice in the Middle, the authors focus on ways in which teachers can learn more about themselves, their students, and the ways to support students so that students can, in turn, learn more about themselves and each other. The writers in the third section, The Nature  and Needs of Students at the Middle Level, give readers a glimpse of middle level concerns and address the needs of both middle level students as they struggle with who they are, and educators as they struggle with the day-to-day growth of their students and provide a learning environment conducive to a population in transition. Essays in the book are: (1) \"When Reading Is Stupid: The Why, How, and What To Do about It\" (Jeffrey D. Wilhelm); (2) \"From Hall Talk to Classroom Talk to Book Talk: Helping Struggling Readers Connect to Reading\" (Kylene Beers); (3) \"Teaching Literature through Thematic Units\" (Mary Santerre); (4) \"Nonfiction and Young Readers\" (Robert C. Small, Jr.); (5) \"Literature and Lessons of the Holocaust: Theory and Practice\" (Marlene B.

The book is intended to spur other teachers to reflect on how they might incorporate Family Message Journals into their programs, in their own ways. The author analyzes how two primary grade teachers implement Family Message Journals in their classrooms, illustrating that the journals are a workable, realistic, and effective strategy for literacy and content learning. She focuses on journal entries of four representative students and their families; questions widespread assumptions about teaching  writing; and identifies teachers' and families' roles in helping elementary students appropriate new genres, topics, and purposes for writing. The book's 7 chapters are: (1) Challenging Assumptions about Learning To Write and Teaching Writing; (2) Why Family Message Journals? The Intersection of Writing Instruction, Writing To Learn, and Family Involvement; (3) Family Message Journals in the Classroom; (4) Writing for a Purpose: Writing as a Tool across the Curriculum; (5) Writing for an Audience: The Functions of Children's Messages; (6) Families' Perspectives and Replies; and (7) Family Message Journals Document Growth.

        "description":"Schools stopped teaching any grammatical system some time ago, as they probably should have. But the schools also, at the same time, stopped teaching grammatical terminology, a mistake which has had lasting consequences. Students need to be told what &quot;infinitive,&quot;&quot;preposition,&quot;&quot;case,&quot; and &quot;predicate complement&quot; mean. They need the tools to think about and analyze their sentences. This paper argues that students should have a vocabulary for discussing language. The paper contends that if students know the meanings of grammatical terms and phrases and have practiced identifying the concepts, they will then be able to recognize the structures in their writing, and educators will enable them to improve their work. The paper outlines the problem, considers why the problem arose,  discusses traditional grammar (1675-1950s) and descriptive linguistics (1950s and 1960s), and suggests what is to be done now.

        "author":["Comber, Barbara"],
        "description":"All over the world educators work towards social justice in a variety of classroom projects. How might teachers of English language arts be informed by this variety of projects--all of which involve young people and their teachers exploring relationships between language and power? Theoretically, protagonists of critical literacies have many different origins--coming from feminist standpoints, critical linguistics, poststructuralist theory, anti-racism, the work of Paulo Freire, and more. These theoretical starting points are about shaping young people who can analyze what is going on, who will ask why things are the way they are, who will question who benefits from the way things are, and who can act to make things more equitable. To do so requires a literacy curriculum which  has young people engaged in socially perceptive reading, listening, viewing, and speaking, writing and producing texts which represent their rights and the rights of others. This paper discusses some of the fears, questions, and doubts educators may associate with critical literacy. The major part of the paper offers an account from one classroom--the story of how one group of children and their teacher negotiated critical literacies in practice. The paper concludes by making a case for critical literacies in English language arts classrooms at this time--literate practices that go beyond &quot;nice-n-normal&quot;--but it also raises some questions and challenges which accompany such work.

This action research project was designed to determine the effect of incorporating multiple intelligence strategies into the language arts curriculum. The targeted students were in the second, third, and fifth grades, in a western suburb of Chicago, Illinois. The documentation to prove low achievement included chapter/unit tests and quiz scores, teacher observation of low time on task, limited work completion, state standardized test scores, and other teacher assessments. Upon analyzing the probable causes, it was discovered that reading was the lowest academic area tested on the Illinois Goal Assessment Program (IGAP). Further concern was indicated through teacher observation of  student performance. Other factors that impact low student achievement are mobility, lack of teacher training and support in implementing existing curriculum, and teachers not addressing students' various learning styles. After reviewing possible interventions from current literature works, Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences repeatedly appeared as a suggested solution. The selected intervention led to a comparison between traditional methods of teaching and multiple intelligence strategies. Post intervention data indicated a general trend toward an increase in achievement through the use of multiple intelligences strategies. A major increase was seen in students with Individual Education Programs (IEPs) and lower achieving students. An improvement was also noted in homework  completion, quality of homework, student time on task, and student enjoyment of activities. (Contains 25 references, and 10 tables and 4 figures of data.

        "description":"This practicum was designed to use directed writing strategies to teach writing skills to middle grades language arts students who frequently failed to make average or above scores in essay writing assignments. The program included three specific strategies. The first strategy was to teach higher-order thinking and metacognitive strategies related to the writing process by modeling writing techniques and directed writing activities. The second strategy was to use cooperative learning in small groups while working on writing assignments. The third strategy was to teach word processing and writing skills by using computers. The goal and expectations were for students to improve their writing skills so that they would attain higher grades. An analysis of the data revealed that  students did improve their writing skills, but not significantly. Students also improved their knowledge of word processing by using the computer.

        "description":"The computer-mediated communication (CMC) learning environment focuses on children's interaction with the computers and their mastery of the technology as potential for learning. Peer interaction mainly in cooperative and collaborative learning environments (CL) focus on the contribution of peers to literacy and writing development. A study examined writing development and perception about writing of Arab and Jewish elementary school children in Israel within each of the above learning environments and within an integrated method of CL-CMC. Each of the three methods was carefully designed and implemented based on the theoretical model of the six &quot;mirrors&quot; of the classroom (Hertz-Lazarowitz, 1992). The central research question was to find the differential contribution of each of  these learning environments in children's writing development. Research was conducted within 20 fifth and sixth grade classrooms in six schools, three Arab and three Jewish. Data were collected from 599 students (210 Jewish, 389 Arab) twice in the school year, and multivariate repeated measures analysis was conducted on this data. The CL-CMC learning environment created the larger gains with time in scores for the students. In the CL only, the scores decreased slightly; in the CMC no gains were found in all of the measures. The important finding is that CL-CMC equalized and enriched significantly Arabs and girls groups which usually gain less. In addition, the contribution of CL-CMC to the affective domains of children's writing is prominent. (Contains 4 tables, 5 figures, and 58  references.) (NKA)",

It discusses which books, films, records, etc. are totally banned in Germany, and the reasons for this occurrence, noting that the main ground for book banning is Nazi propaganda. It also states that the restrictions on the publication and distribution of &quot;suspicious material&quot; in every genre of popular culture demonstrate the desire and the different and often subtle forms of governmental, religious, and social censorship. The book then suggests three books which focus on the  media in Germany for further information about the structure, conditions, and function of censorship. (NKA)",

        "description":"Talk remains by far the most used medium of instruction and classroom action. Classroom talk is typically dominated by triadic dialogue or an I-R-E (Initiate-Response-Evaluation) pattern of talk noted in the literature as consistent across grades and subjects. Studies seem to indicate that teachers utilize traditional forms of talk, even though they know about, and have been trained in the use of, alternative forms. This paper offers some analysis of a group of teachers in South Australian schools who participated in a research project in which they studied classroom talk--the paper's researcher developed a meta-analysis of the kind of curriculum and pedagogy the teachers were practicing. The paper explains that the researcher's analysis was critiqued by the teachers who approved  its general direction. The paper discusses in turn, in two sections, the different factors teachers considered and the discourses that appeared to be constituting teachers' decision making. It finds that this analysis also revealed the complexity involved in changing classroom practices in relation to talk. (NKA)",

        "author":["Li, Mingsheng"],
        "description":"It has been widely acknowledged in language acquisition research that cultural learning is an inseparable part of language learning. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the culture of classroom learning which involves both teachers' and learners' cultural values, beliefs, roles, expectations, and conceptions of teaching and learning. Communication challenges become obvious when teaching methodologies developed in one educational context are exported to another educational context. This paper reports on the findings from a case study conducted in 1997 in the People's Republic of China where pedagogical communication conflicts between English native speaking teachers and Chinese university English language majors became acute. The paper focuses on the problematic  area--the discourse of participation that was highly valued, promulgated and practiced by native speakers teaching English in China. It will point out some of the discrepancies between this discourse and the Chinese culture of learning. In transplanting Western educational models to Chinese classrooms, participants did not sufficiently acknowledge the cultural distance between these models and the Chinese local sociocultural and educational realities. The discourse of participation was strongly resisted by Chinese students, and teaching by native speakers often failed to achieve the desired results. In spite of the &quot;good&quot; intentions on the part of both native teachers and Chinese students, there existed a vast gulf in their perceptions of what constituted &quot;good&quot; teaching and learning, of  what appropriate roles they were fitted in, and what they expected of each other. The paper argues that the gulf, the hidden source of the pedagogical communication problems, can be bridged through creating a cultural synergy in which common interests are to be found and shared, sources of problems identified, cultural differences understood and respected, and learning maximally enhanced.

Creativity embraces form and structure as well as freedom of thought and expression, and within it, the processes of ideas and practicality can operate in unison. Highly creative children have different learning patterns and divergent thinking skills, and many children in the classroom exhibit high creativity. Teachers must take this into account and utilize a creativity approach, teaching children that to be creative and different is to be  truly outstanding. (Contains 14 references.) (EF)",

        "description":"This study presents an empirical investigation of basic processes in the perception of speech sounds. The experimental methods applied have their roots in two different psycholinguistic research paradigms; i.e., &quot;categorical perception&quot; and &quot;dichotic listening.&quot; In the categorical perception paradigm, listeners' categorization of speech sounds is compared with their ability to discriminate speech-like stimuli forming a physical continuum (such as the range between a T-sound and a D-sound). In the dichotic listening paradigm, differences in listeners' identification of speech stimuli presented to either left or right ear are interpreted as the result of hemispheric lateralization. Extensive results include the following: (1) the acoustic consonant-continuum revealed a high degree  of categorical effect; (2) when the same acoustic continuum was presented in the dichotic listening experiment, subjects showed a markedly better ability to identify stimuli presented to the right ear than stimuli presented to the left ear; (3) on the other hand, the acoustic vowel-continuum revealed no categorical effect at all; and (4) similarly, no general dichotic effect was found when the same vowel-continuum was presented in the dichotic listening experiment. Findings suggest that there exists a clear connection between the categorical and the dichotic effect. (Contains 211 references and 51 figures of data. An appendix contains acoustic analyses of synthetic vowel-continua.) (SR)",

It examines the case of Kincaid v. Gibson, which decided that restriction on school-sponsored expression expounded in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier applies to college and university expression. Based on research questioning the effectiveness of those state scholastic freedom of expression laws, it appears to be unlikely that similar laws protecting the First Amendment rights of college students will be as effective as proponents might expect.

Usable surveys on press freedom in the schools were received from 138 advisers and 84 school principals in 47 states. The findings paint a clear picture of a high school student press that is not free, that is controlled mostly by advisers, but also by principals, and that views editing of the paper by the faculty adviser as the norm.

In contrast to previous priming experiments that focused on the effects of television news stories, this study experimentally tests the power of print media to produce priming effects. In addition, it tests whether the inclusion of photographs can enhance the impact of newspaper articles on subsequent evaluations of foreign countries. The participants in this study were 199 undergraduate students from a large private university on the East Coast. The findings indicate that reading stories about terrorism that directly linked the issue to Iran primed participants to judge this nation on the basis of  anti-terrorist attitudes. Similarly, reading stories that linked the war on drugs to Mexico and Colombia primed participants to evaluate these nations in terms of anti-drug attitudes. In contrast, stories that indirectly primed thoughts about terrorism or drugs had no effect on how participants subsequently judged these nations. The study also found that priming effects did not depend on the presence or absence of photographs. (Contains 40 references and 6 tables of data.) (Author/RS)",

It focuses on the micro-politics of language, arguing that economic globalization is a social achievement that generates and requires new language and literacy practices. Workplace language and literacy practice changes to accommodate the demands of global networks of accountability (for instance, various quality documentation mechanisms) and associated management structures like cross functional teams and these changes have a significant impact on work practice, work identities and constructions of working knowledge. Enterprise-based language and literacy teachers can be implicated in the  social and political processes by which new working identities and new working knowledges are constructed. The paper draws on an intensive 8-month study of a restructuring textile manufacturing company as the company attempts simultaneously to achieve a QS 9000 rating, to establish a cascading set of cross functional teams, and to implement an Action Learning Team training program.

Results indicated that news directors would welcome the wisdom and contributions of mid-career interns.

The paper covers this aspect of journalism education: (1) from the initial gathering of information, (2) through the actual writing of stories, (3) to the final evaluation of performance.

The summary presents findings and highlights of the study, which illustrate the dual role media play. Results indicated: media often offer girls strong, positive role models; and media often reinforce female stereotypes, with appearance shown as more important for women than for men, and with the message that relationships are more important for women than occupations or  careers. The study provides evidence of the mixed--sometimes limiting--messages that media are sending to girls. It demonstrates that the messages sent in even one television show, movie, magazine, advertisement, or music video do not stand alone, but become part of a larger sphere of influence in girls' lives, and thus have the power to reinforce--or the potential to challenge--all other messages girls are sent.

The pamphlet discusses key findings, which illustrate the dual role media play: media often offer girls strong, positive role models; yet media often reinforce female stereotypes, with appearance shown as more important for women than for men, and with the message that relationships are more important for  women than occupations or careers. Key findings further show that: children believe television provides positive role models and messages about gender; children are aware of ways in which television reflects and may reinforce gender stereotypes; girls want to look like characters they see on television; more girls than boys think the kids on TV are like them and their friends; and girls turn often to many different types of media. The study provides evidence of the mixed--sometimes limiting--messages that media are sending to girls. It demonstrates that the messages sent in even one television show, movie, magazine, advertisement, or music video do not stand alone, but become part of a larger sphere of influence in girls' lives, and thus have the power to reinforce--or the potential to  challenge--all other messages girls are sent. Ending notes offer information about the content analysis methodology; survey methodology; and about the sponsoring organizations. (SR)",

        "author":["Bjork, Christopher"],
        "description":"This paper examines the structure of administrative authority in Japan and America and explores how differing conceptions of the principal's role influence instructional guidance provided to teachers. In the United States, administrators are viewed as facilitators of a school's educational program and are expected to take an active part in professional growth. In Japan, however, principals are seen as managers rather than as directors of an instructional program. To understand these differences, 25 Japanese principals were interviewed. All of them emphasized the organizational facets of their positions over the educational responsibilities. The Japanese principal is more of a coordinator than a leader, whose primary responsibility is to maintain school harmony and ensure that the  institution runs smoothly. Therefore, conflict avoidance ranks high on the principal's agenda so they do not press people to improve their performance or to reach specific professional goals. It is believed that if the principal creates a harmonious environment for teaching and learning, members of the community will naturally achieve excellence. Furthermore, the principal's location at the sideline creates a space for teachers to develop and publicly demonstrate their professional expertise, while encouraging faculty members to develop strong bonds with their teaching colleagues.

        "description":"This paper discusses the Collaborative Action Team (CAT) process, which was initiated by the U.S. Department of Education, and which encourages the development of partnerships among families, community members, school personnel, and students in communities with histories of ongoing and underserved needs. CAT is based on a set of core principles and includes four stages of team development: Team Identification, Team Mobilization, Project Development, and Project Implementation. The core principles are representative membership, shared leadership, consensus decision-making, and action focus. The article focuses on whether collaborative partnerships among the school, home, and community can be developed and sustained as a result of the CAT process. CAT participants from Arkansas,  Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas were included in the study. The findings show that over 90 percent of the sites under review had completed the majority of activities in the first stage of the CAT process. Teams were comprised of representatives from the home, school, and community, though family members other than a parent, teachers, higher education staff, and civic organizational personnel were less likely to be a member of the CAT. Overall, the results show that the development of school-based collaborative efforts is a time intensive, multifaceted endeavor.

        "description":"This paper discusses the misuse of power among boards of education, central office and building administrators, teachers, and the media. It describes several cases: members of a board of education who hired a family member; an assistant superintendent who, out of jealousy, organized a smear campaign against a new principal; a high school principal who hired an underqualified assistant principal so that the former would look good by comparison; and a teachers' union president who undermined a new evaluation process. Experience shows that some questionable practices can be unique to a particular school, whereas some practices are commonplace. For example, the career track among upwardly mobile educators frequently emphasizes advancement over what is best for students. To lessen the  frequency of such actions, the article suggests that schools move toward shared decision making. It states that proper training is important in this type of decision making. The paper also relates how one school system invited consultants who helped the district secure volunteers who would serve as representatives for each school, held a weekend retreat for board members so that they could learn more about shared decision making, and organized site-based teams that gave districtwide presentations on what is possible with a shared vision.

        "description":"This brief, which is part of a series of concept papers on educational partnerships, focuses on changes in leadership. The paper offers strategies for addressing turnover in key personnel in both existing and developing alliances and provides some suggestions for sustaining collaborative partnerships over time. It states that leadership transitions do not have to be disruptive, and that by bringing in a new member, planning ahead, and building a more sustainable alliance, partnerships can cope with a transition in leadership. The article suggests that leadership is not restricted to personnel at the top--it can be any person who plays a guiding, mobilizing role. When a key person leaves, successful alliances immediately acknowledge the void and begin to find ways to work through  the transition. By expressing and resolving different viewpoints about the departure, partners can develop a clearer understanding of their vision. In addition to responding quickly, they should develop a strategy for identifying the next steps to take and then focus on reducing tensions created by the change. When a new leader is brought into the partnership, he or she should be provided the background of the partnership and be given time to become familiar with how the partnership works.

Chapter 2 looks at the many administrative issues involved in integrating technology in schools that affect  students, faculty, and staff. Chapter 3 recommends developing an AUP expressly for employees to set the stage for a smooth-running network. Chapter 4 examines how new laws are developing to address the rights of creators, the public, and schools related to digital works.

Using an epidemiological approach, the article analyzes the perceptions of home-school leaders and others involved in the movement, focusing on the substantive influence of events on the home-schooling movement. It discusses how well-publicized incidents of violence in schools and the poor academic performance of public schools serve to push students away from the public school system. It asks whether these repellant characteristics necessarily translate into an increase in the number of those who are home schooled. It then presents stories and circumstances that have portrayed home schooling in a positive light and asks if such exposure also  leads to an increase in the number of home-schooled children. The text cites various stories that reflect an increase in the number of home-schooled students following tragic events in schools, particularly the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado, and how concerns over safety prompt parents to opt for home schooling. The paper concludes that the positive pull of home schooling, combined with the negative push of public schools, has increased the number of those who are home schooled. (Contains 30 references.)

It focuses on The Learning Connections Lab (LCL), which began in 1997. The LCL was a partnership between St. Cloud State University and two elementary school sites. To measure the effects of the collaboration, a qualitative case-study methodology was used. Data were collected from semistructured interviews, teacher journals, and surveys. Results show that, overall, the elementary school teachers and university faculty were positive about the collaborative nature of the LCL. They appreciated the opportunity to get to know colleagues and felt that collaboration aided their thinking. Teachers also felt  more empowered throughout the collaboration process. However, the collaboration continued at just one of the sites. Whereas the successful site saw a strengthening of prior relationships with the university, the failed site featured strong personalities, inadequate personal boundaries, inflexible attitudes, unclear roles, a lack of trust, and a lack of respect. Findings underscore the importance of basing collaborations on honest, trusting relationships, and it is recommended that future collaborations begin with partners taking time to build relationships, establish a shared vision, and define their goals.

The paper reports that the state supreme court ruled that the following components of the general-fund formula were unconstitutional: the one-fourth mile rule, where a necessary school can only exist if there is no other school of the same type or classification within one-fourth mile; the small-school adjustment, where smaller schools receive a graduated rate per student; the small-school district adjustment, where any district with fewer than 1,351 students receives special compensation; and the regional cost of living adjustment.

The purpose is to review how time was used in 48 randomly selected high school Algebra 1, Biology 1, English 2, and U.S. History classes. Of the 48 classes, 12 observations were conducted for each course. The findings revealed a predominance of teacher-centered instruction across all courses. Teachers spent the majority of time presenting content and monitoring student seatwork, while students primarily listened to the teacher, responded to teacher questions, and completed seatwork. The most used teacher and student materials (overhead, chalkboard, textbooks, worksheets, notebook paper) further pointed to a teacher-centered environment. Results of checklists  revealed a moderately high level of student engagement, little or no individualization of instruction, and a mixed use of thinking indicators. When teacher and student time allocations were compared to expert estimates, large discrepancies were found which further accentuated the lack of student-centered instruction included in the lessons. After 4 years, most teachers had not adapted instruction to take advantage of the longer blocks of time. Implications indicate that teachers needed clear, measurable goals related to instructional strategies and the best use of 90-minute blocks of time. (Author)",

The paper focuses on the nature of political and bureaucratic responses to competition and describes the short-term consequences of competition and how such consequences might influence the long term. Data were gathered through interviews with educational participants and observers, visits to public and private schools, archival searches of newspaper coverage, and an extensive review of school-system documents, board minutes, private papers, statistical data, and secondary documents. The paper offers a history of the troubles that the Cleveland Public School (CPS) system has endured and describes both the beginnings  of the voucher program and the turmoil that has rocked this program. Findings suggest that teachers and administrators in the CPS did not view the voucher program as a serious threat. As a result, public schools were not motivated to alter their practices. The limited size, early difficulties, and bleak political and legal prospects of the voucher program all undermined any competition the voucher system could have offered. It is claimed that competition is crucial to promoting school improvement. (Contains 68 references.) (RJM)",

Drawing on published sources and interviews conducted from November 1997 to March 2000 with 46 Arizona educators and policymakers, the paper details the conditions that prompted the broad push for charter schools. The text describes the state's political landscape, the concerted effort that was required to pass a charter school law, and the confusion that surrounded the sudden implementation of the law. It describes how charter operators were relatively unconstrained in determining their curricula, the variation among schools, and the type of students who typically attend these schools. Information on oversight and accountability is supplied, along with descriptions of  efforts by public schools to compete for students and the negative responses engendered by such competition. The article claims that the Arizona experience vivifies the significance of charter schooling, and it outlines how the political success of charter school advocates reshaped the way policymakers and educators discuss accountability and schooling, encouraging those wishing to put more emphasis on outputs and less on inputs. However, it is not yet clear whether charter schools do a better job of educating students than do district schools. (Contains 27 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper describes the United States' first public voucher program, which was launched in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1990. It discusses the three phases that school competition has undergone in the Milwaukee Public School (MPS) district. These phases are a period of minimal competition from 1990-95, the passage of new charter-school legislation and a dramatically expanded voucher legislation in 1995, and the city's final push into charter schooling in 1997-98, which launched increasingly visible competition. Competition has neither had any systemic effects on teaching and learning in MPS schools and classrooms, nor has the presence of limited competition refocused teachers or principals or changed how they do their jobs. Competition has produced some new efforts to raise  standards, increase choices, and open new schools, albeit there is little evidence that these moves have affected classrooms. Furthermore, charters have provoked symbolic reactions from MPS and leaders of the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association, creating the potential for meaningful change and permitting new schools to form. The paper concludes that there is no evidence to suggest short-term market forces have ended inefficiencies in Milwaukee, although there is reason to believe competition has stoked entrepreneurial energy in MPS.

        "description":"This booklet describes the rationale, design, and structure for conferences organized for school principals. Drawing on the experiences of New York City's Community School District 2, it describes standards-based professional development for school leaders. It opens with a description of the District Network for Standards-Based Reform--a project that provided four new superintendents with the example of District 2--and the instruction and support needed to host effective leadership conferences. Examples of effective activities from these districts' leadership conferences are used throughout the paper. It discusses the research-based structure of the effective standards-based leadership conference and focuses on the particular behaviors that the superintendent should be modeling  during his or her design and presentation of leadership conferences. Subsections on each of those components address such topics as setting and communicating clear expectations, helping all leaders to be learners, engaging conference participants as active and cooperative learners, going to where the most informing work is being done, focusing on instruction and learning from the experts, engaging in and demanding accountable talk, and saving the administrative items for last. The paper closes with a brief conclusion that emphasizes the importance of clear expectations, communicating these expectations to principals, and focusing on instruction and standards.

        "author":["Lubienski, Chris"],
        "description":"This paper examines various claims made by charter-school advocates that charter schools are publicly funded, open to all, are chartered by public entities, and thus are a form of public schooling. It addresses this subject by comparing the rhetoric of Michigan's charter-school reformers with that of the common-school reformers of the 19th century, particularly Horace Mann. The analysis finds conflicting definitions of what constitutes public schooling. Whereas both types of reform support tax-funded schools and open access, the common-school reformers emphasized political-democratic forms of control. Charter-school advocates actively challenge such control and claim that market mechanisms of consumer choice and competition among providers are the primary means of authority.  Furthermore, proponents of charter schools seek to &quot;redefine&quot; popular conceptions of what constitutes public and private education. In doing so, they frame education principally as a consumer good, and thus effect a privatization of the purpose of public education that contrasts with the common-school reformers' stated concern for democracy and the public good. The paper suggests that the rhetoric of charter-school advocates promotes depublicization and a redefinition of the &quot;public&quot; in education away from that of an institution of and for the public good.

        "description":"This digest offers a snapshot of the standards movement: its origins, the definitions of standards and which ones matter, its successes at the district and state levels, the backlash against the movement, and possible policy directions. While a broad coalition of constituencies has embraced standards-based reform as a means of improving public schools' accountability, preparing a globally competitive work force, and decreasing the achievement gap among various racial ethnic groups, equally vocal groups are arguing that the tough standards movement is flunking too many students and detracting from classroom learning. Critics say the standards movement has been &quot;reduced to a single policy--high stakes testing&quot; linking one set of standardized tests scores to promotion, high-school  graduation, and even educator salaries and tenure decisions. Moreover, states pushing for higher standards must provide massive funding for the remedial, tutoring, and professional-development programs needed to enhance students' success. As of early 1999, only 11 states offered such funding. Drawing on pioneering districts' initial successes, educators are advised to make learning (not testing) the goal, provide special assistance for disadvantaged students, set realistic failure rates, invest in wide-ranging reforms, make retention a last resort, capitalize on publicity, and concentrate on urban high schools.

        "description":"This report discusses the results of the third year--1998-99--of California's Class Size Reduction (CSR) program. Assessments of the program show that CSR was almost fully implemented by 1998-99, with over 92 percent of students in K-3 in classes of 20 or fewer students. Those K-3 classes that had not been reduced in size were concentrated in districts serving high percentages of minority, low-income, or English-learner (EL) students. The average qualifications of California teachers declined for all grade levels, but the declines were worse in elementary schools. Although the qualifications of K-3 teachers continued to decline, it was at a slower rate than in the past. Declines in teacher qualifications were mirrored in grades 4 and 5. Curriculum and instruction were mostly  similar regardless of class size, though teachers in reduced-size classes spent more time working individually with students during mathematics and language arts lessons than did their counterparts in nonreduced-size classes. Student achievement did improve in the reduced-size classes, and these positive gains were evident with all students, regardless of their backgrounds. These positive effects continued in grade 4 and regular-size classes. Finally, programs serving EL students and special-education students were affected by the transfer of teachers from these areas into regular classes. (RJM)",

Based on the research on school change, the survey provides information to schools, districts, and state departments about the implementation of the CSRD program. To create an instrument grounded in the research on school change, CSRD staff consulted the literature, specifically on the implementation phase. A wide array of factors were identified for inclusion in the survey instruments. It was found that the references in this paper deepened understanding about what needs to occur in schools for such programs to be successfully implemented. These annotations are  being published to facilitate the work of other researchers, state CSRD coordinators, school district staff, principals, and teachers who want to increase their understanding of the mechanics of change and implementation of new programs. Although the bibliography is not exhaustive, it focuses on and includes those references that identified successful implementation correlates. (DFR)",

It requires leadership to muster the energy and resolve, often in resistant environments, to try something new. It requires crafting a working model, identifying mistakes, refining the system, and establishing reporting systems to track progress and success. Important features of successful tutor programs include the following: planned partnerships with schools, research-based practices, structured sessions, a variety of strategies and materials, ongoing training, and evaluation for  continuous improvement. A single person, the program director, usually orchestrates all of these startup elements and activities.

Previous programs allowed teachers seeking administrative licensure to complete the program at their own pace. The Meadows Model shortens this process to 15 months. This model incorporates a number of specific features, which have had a significant impact on the process of preparing administrators: (1) selection for the program on a competitive basis; (2) internship as a significant and early part of the program; (3) inclusion in a cohort group at the start of the program; (4) focused initial study on the principalship and related skills; (5) specialized study in communications and intergroup dynamics; (6) an introduction to the culture of the principalship;  and (7) participation in staff development activities with practicing principals. This paper lists several initiatives to look at the impact of the Meadows Model over the years of operation. These include a case study approach, annual evaluation, postprogram design, and open-ended responses on questionnaires. Conclusions drawn from the studies and recommendations for the future of the program are presented. (Contains 10 references.) (DFR)",

ABC is not a financial reporting system to serve the needs of regulatory agencies, but a tool that tracks costs from the general ledger statement to work activities and then to the actual output of those activities. It mirrors the work of people and equipment; it documents costs as an organization actually consumes financial resources. ABC seeks to answer four very different questions: (1) What activities are being performed by the organization? (2) How much does it cost to perform those activities? (3) Why does the organization need to perform those activities? and (4) How much  of an organization's money does each activity consume in the production and delivery of products and services? The paper presents a case study of how ABC was applied to a communications center at a community college in order to reduce costs. Finally, the paper details why such factors as the cost structures of schools, the pace of change, and the cost of processing data have created an interest in ABC. (DFR)",

Major school reforms in four selected industrial countries that differ significantly in terms of educational institutions and cultures are examined using school reform literature, related government reports, and newspaper articles. Japan and Korea have highly centralized school governance systems and homogeneous educational values. Conversely, in the United States and England, education governance is decentralized, and educational values are relatively heterogeneous. In the latter two countries lack of focus and accountability were identified  as major deficiencies of their educational systems, and efforts were made to standardize curriculum, tighten assessment practices, and introduce market-like competition. Similar political and economic challenges in Japan and Korea, on the other hand, resulted in policies to differentiate curriculum, diversify assessment, decentralize school governance, and make the system more diverse and democratic--enhancing whole-person education.

Nonetheless, little empirical research has examined how educational organizations respond to competition. This paper hypothesizes that administrators are likely to respond by adopting governance reforms--particularly decentralization and staff-empowerment measures--advocated by educational reformers. This study further suggests that they are most likely to pursue decentralization when the costs of persuasion and monitoring are low. The study uses data from Arizona to assess the effects of charter-school competition on empowerment in a sample of 87 public schools (959 teachers). Charter-school competition increased teacher empowerment in  traditional schools by slight to moderate amounts from 1994-95 (before charter schooling was introduced) to 1997-98, but only in schools where teachers were already somewhat empowered prior to competition. At least in the short run, the effects of charter schooling in public-school governance depend on public-school structure and culture. (Author/DFR)",

        "description":"Structural reforms in New Zealand attempted to remove teacher unions from any policy role, and these reforms sought to remove the unions from any involvement in education policy. Ten years later, in spite of a highly charged media campaign and the active anti-unionism of the industrial legislation, teachers still have an important voice in education through their union. The unions accomplished a difficult strategy moving between various definitions of being a union and a profession, between accommodation and resistance, and between militancy and compliance. This paper focuses on the teacher unions active in the state schools sector--the New Zealand Education Institute and the Post Primary Teachers Association. Various state policy initiatives, such as the push for a professional  body, the New Zealand Teacher Registration Board, and the search for a teaching code of ethics, pointed up the continuing reliance of the State on teacher involvement. This paper reports Phase One of the historical development of the unions' positions, discusses some of the interview data, and suggests the possible future conflicts that the education unions may face in their dealings with the new government.

        "description":"This study looks at the interview responses of teachers and administrators in five secondary schools in Ontario (Canada) to government-initiated accountability strategies. Several questions were posed: (1) What were the perceived effects of these strategies? (2) What motives did teachers and administrators ascribe to the government for introducing them to begin with? (3) How likely was it that teachers and administrators would consider such strategies a priority for implementation in their own setting? Results indicate that the majority of respondents attributed noneducational motives to the government, though a few teachers and almost half of the administrators saw motives they could support. Similar results were apparent concerning effects of the initiatives, effects considered  to be mostly neutral or negative. These same data were also examined using a theory of motivation. Conditions shaping the motivation of respondents to make the best of the accountability initiatives in their schools were mostly negative. Results are summarized in Table 1 concerning context beliefs. (Contains 25 references.) (DFR)",

        "description":"This paper examines how the Texas charter-school law is being implemented, with particular attention paid to issues of equity and social justice. It focuses on the demographic composition of students and staff in Texas' charter schools, provisions for oversight and accountability, early indices of student performance, ongoing controversies, analyses of trends, and recommendations for ensuring equity in charter schools. Compared with their overall enrollment in public schools, African-American and Hispanic students are over-represented in charter schools, while their Anglo counterparts are underrepresented. In addition, charter schools serve fewer numbers of special-education and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students than public schools statewide. This raises serious questions  of equity and social justice, particularly insofar as children labeled as &quot;special ed&quot; or LEP are considered by many educators to be the children most difficult to educate. Another equity area concerns the subject of staffing and governance. Tables present student demographics and percentage passing the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills for charter schools and public schools. An appendix contains a summary of key provisions of Texas' Charter School Law. (Contains 38 references.) (DFR)",

The principal research questions were the following: (1) Do principals plan and act locally to implement global policy strategically envisioned by district policymakers? Or (2) Do they plan and act locally in response to local needs and retroactively fit the local plan to a global model? (3) Is there a corresponding difference in the content of their school action plans? An embedded case study method was applied for descriptive and theory-building purposes. The research strategy included personal interviews of 5 administrators, 8 principals, and 13 teachers, and examination of district documents. The result of statistical analyses indicated that the differences in the  variables tested were not significant in relationship to the principals' approaches to alignment.

        "description":"Discipline--the most serious problem faced by teachers today--has consistently appeared at or near the top of the public's attitudes toward the public schools. This paper discusses the difficulty of discipline and one of the most perplexing problems facing administrators today--the use of suspension as a discipline alternative. Out-of-school suspension (OSS) offers only a temporary solution to maintaining order because of legal restrictions on its length. Moreover, such suspensions are likely to increase discipline problems. An in-depth examination of in-school suspension programs (ISS) is presented, including problems with ISS programs, some effective models of ISS, and specific ideas for program improvement. ISS programs have great potential for success; however, given the way  they are currently implemented, they need to be improved. If properly designed and administered, with an evaluation phase, professional intervention by the counselor and administrator, and assignment requirements, ISS programs can go beyond mere eviction to accomplish something positive on behalf of students. ISS programs accomplish everything that OSS programs do--they remove the troublemaker from the class, but do not reward the student for bad behavior with a vacation from school.

Major findings include the following: there appears to be a sufficient number of qualified teachers, yet there are still a number of unfilled positions that vary dramatically among regions. The population of Illinois teachers is aging, and the projected number of teachers reaching retirement age is expected to double over the next 5 years. In terms of number of jobs, the top four projected areas of high demand in Chicago are self-contained classrooms, Title I remedial reading, learning disabled, and cross-categorical. The top five projected areas of high demand for downstate school  districts are self-contained classrooms, learning disabled, behavior disordered, speech and language impaired, and physical education. When the reserve pool is taken into consideration, undersupply for specifically trained teachers exists in early childhood special education, gifted education, and languages other than English. An oversupply of educators exists in self-contained classrooms and social science.

Three major events are occurring in Hawaii related to the decentralization; that is, the  school-community-based management of the school system. First the Department of Education is being restructured to make it a two-tier rather than a three-tier organization by eliminating the district intermediate level. Second, a governance study is under way with a format to accommodate the restructuring of the education system. And finally, schools are being empowered to allow more principals, teachers, students, parents, and community members to make decisions. (Contains 12 references.) (DFR)",

Action mapping serves as a meta-process for moving schools toward desired ends; it calls upon school leaders to move into action, to reflect upon such actions, and to collect stories for future reflections. This process could be helpful to a school going through accreditation with the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Action mapping could be used to consolidate a school's WASC self-study findings into a schoolwide action plan. This monograph challenges current planning processes, and posits instead a sense-making process that allows organizations to transform themselves in seemingly chaotic environments. Action mapping assumes that organizations value networks that  support the flow of information throughout its system. In action mapping, those responsible for producing success share the responsibilities of developing wisdom for an entire organization. It presupposes that change requires support from the organizational hierarchy, and it strongly believes that each participant in a system has a capacity to contribute ideas that enhance and sustain the system.

The study focused on small-school administrator and teacher perceptions of the effects of block scheduling on student achievement, school climate, and teacher methodology. Only those schools that had implemented some form of block scheduling during or before the fall of 1996 were considered for the study. Principals of 101 high schools that met the definition of a small high school were mailed questionnaires and asked to randomly select three teachers. The questionnaire was divided into four categories: student achievement, school climate, teacher methodology, and an overview section. A total of 62  administrators and 152 teachers participated in the study. The results indicate that teachers and administrators generally believe block scheduling has improved student achievement. Educators perceived an improvement in the quality of student work, depth of subject matter covered, student retention of material, and an increase in enrollment in advanced courses. However, when teachers were divided by subject area, math/science teachers did not necessarily agree with this general assessment. Overall, it was felt that block scheduling improved the teacher-student relationship, stimulated changes in teacher methodology, and improved school climate. (Contains 15 references.) (RJM)",

Victimization at school declined from 1995-99, though rates for fighting and weapon threats remain steady. Students seem more secure, and gang activity decreased; however, in grades 9-12, the number of students offered drugs on school property is up 24 percent since 1993. This report uses independent data from a wide number of sources regarding fatal and nonfatal victimization, safety perceptions, gangs, and hate-related language. Combining homicides and suicides, schools reported 60 deaths from July 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998. Students are more likely victimized by such crimes as rape, sexual or aggravated assault,  and robbery away from school. At least one violent crime was reported in 1996-97 by principals at 10 percent of public schools, and 47 percent experienced a less serious violent crime. From 1994-98, teachers were crime victims at a rate of 83 incidents per 1,000 teachers. The percentage of students fearing attack at school declined from 9 to 5 percent. Data from students indicate declining weapon possession and gang activity, steady alcohol use, and rising marijuana use; about 13 percent of students are victims of hate speech.

        "description":"This document presents findings from a 5-year study of the effect of the standards-based reform movement on students with disabilities. The study used pragmatic evaluation strategies that integrated both quantitative and qualitative collection methods of data and site visits to 10 high schools in six districts (including urban, rural, and suburban districts) and three states. Findings addressed three main issues: first, the extent to which students with disabilities are included in standards-based reform; second, factors that affect the inclusion of students with disabilities in standards-based reform; and third, interactions among special education programs and policies with district- and school-based reform efforts. The report offers seven major recommendations which address:  (1) the Individualized Education Plan as the basis for decision making regarding inclusion; (2) development of a decision-making matrix by states and districts; (3) teacher training in the philosophy of inclusion; (4) ongoing professional development on integration of standards with curricula; (5) experimentation with interdisciplinary models of instruction; (6) certification standards that include content-specific course work; and (7) role of administrators as instructional leaders.

The system's model incorporated: (1) on-going training, follow-up and technical support for teachers, and an on-site technology support team; (2) team-based technology assessment for children with moderate to severe disabilities; (3) technology integration into the classroom curriculum; and (4) transition into public school programs. The project's major findings indicated positive outcomes for children, increased technology skills among teachers, efficacy of the on-site technology teams, and conditions that promoted maintenance of the system after completion of the funding cycle. Following an executive  summary and introduction, the description of the project details components of the Early Childhood Comprehensive Technology System, methodology for accomplishing goals, and problems and their solutions. The following section summarizes results relevant to teacher outcomes, child outcomes, policy, and maintenance of a comprehensive technology system. Concluding sections address lessons learned, implications, and recommendations.

Coaches are urged to first, review the student's assessment data; second, determine the student's ability to benefit from coaching; third, determine that the student has enough motivation to improve his/her academic performance; fourth, identify the student's academic strengths and weaknesses; and finally, develop an action plan to teach techniques needed to improve academic performance. Techniques may cover such skills as organization and study, test preparation and test taking, note taking, goal setting and career planning, problem solving and conflict resolution, and transferring  learning into daily practice. Coaching in such skills is likely to provide valuable life skills as well as enhance academic performance. Two case studies are offered to illustrate the techniques and effects of academic coaching with twice exceptional gifted students. Academic coaching is seen as more flexible than psychotherapy and better accepted by society. Noted is possible insurance coverage of academic coaching under some circumstances. (DB)",

The purpose of the project was to assist states, agencies, and local problems to develop and maintain high quality services for unserved and under-served children with disabilities and their families, particularly children birth to three years of age. Specifically, the project: (1) assisted state educational agencies and lead agencies in planning, developing, and implementing their comprehensive service plans for young children with disabilities and  their families; (2) increased public and professional awareness of the need for early intervention; (3) provided in-depth training, ongoing follow-up, and mentoring to early interventionists; and (4) developed and disseminated materials to further the implementation of best practices of working with children and families. The project's activities affected over 1,800 personnel and 12,000 children. The report discusses the conceptual framework of the project, activities, evaluation findings, and the impact of the program. Appendices include evaluation and workshop materials. (CR)",

For each of the three project years, BCSC supported fellowships for educators and family members to participate in a special university-based 4-course professional development sequence. Additionally, the first three of the courses each year were offered over EDNET, Oregon's 1-way video, 2-way audio distance teaching technology. Courses included: &quot;Curriculum  Planning for Students with Severe Disabilities I and II,&quot;&quot;Classroom Management &amp; Program Improvement,&quot; and &quot;The Role of Families in Bringing School Inclusion to the Community.&quot; Over the three years, BCSC supported a heterogeneous mix of 149 professionals and family members from over 27 different school districts. These participants studied at various locations around the state at 21 different EDNET downlink sites and worked in class alongside preservice teachers and masters degree students.

A total of 26 counselors, 11 of whom were African American, reported their views in structured telephone interviews. In general, there were more similarities than differences in counselor views. With some minor exceptions, White and African American counselors had similar views on their skill level, client-counselor interaction, and most useful skills, techniques, resources, and referral sources. There were differences by counselor race regarding help-seeking patterns, job and rehabilitation expectations, effects of adverse personal and socioeconomic factors, and ideal client characteristics. African  American counselors increasingly stressed use of family and community resources, and were more likely to look to other professionals in seeking help. African American counselors believed that Black clients had higher job expectations but were less likely to be successfully rehabilitated. In contrast, white counselors believed that black clients had lower expectations and saw no difference in rehabilitation rates. Counselors felt that harnessing client motivation and positive expectations, and employing a family- and community-oriented attitude was the best approach to rehabilitation. The survey is included.

The seven members of factor B, \"Devout Followers,\" see themselves as directed by God and willing followers of God. As \"Special Caregivers,\" the six members of factor C make it clear that there is a distinct difference between individuals with mental retardation and those who are without disabilities.

Part 1 allows evaluators to generate a broad profile of an individual's communication skills and behaviors. \"Part II: Designing an Intervention Plan,\" is designed to be used to develop appropriate communication goals for the individual, based upon the ratings obtained in Part 1. Its usefulness is enhanced by numerous examples and descriptions of goals and interventions that can be considered for application in the school, community, and home.

This report looks at the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) enforcement activities from 1990 to 1999 of four key federal agencies: the Department of Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Communications Commission. Findings indicate that while the Clinton Administration has consistently asserted its strong support for the civil rights of people with disabilities, the federal agencies charged with enforcement and policy development under ADA have been underfunded, overly cautious, reactive, and lacking any coherent and unifying national strategy. In addition, it is  found that enforcement agencies have not consistently taken leadership roles in emergent issues. The following recommendations are made: (1) the Department of Justice should provide assertive leadership for ADA implementation and develop a strategic vision and plan for ADA enforcement across the federal government; and (2) the Departments of Justice and Transportation, the EEOC, and the Title II referral agencies should strengthen methods for the timely and effective enforcement of ADA.

It also emphasizes that, in considering any changes to its IEP-related requirements, a state or local education agency carefully consider the impact of such changes on both compliance with other IDEA requirements and on ensuring that children with disabilities receive the services they need in order to be involved and progress in the general curriculum, to prepare for employment and post-school independence, and otherwise to achieve to high standards.

The project has involved a preliminary analysis of all current charter laws to examine the inclusion of students with disabilities and a more focused investigation of charter schools in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Currently the project is conducting in-depth case studies of 7 of the 15 states to develop a set of policy recommendations that will be presented for review and validation at national meetings of general and special educators, parents, and representatives of charter schools. Findings to date have identified seven general categories pertinent to special  education in charter schools: (1) state charter school laws, (2) the charter granting process, (3) charter school governance, (4) admissions and enrollment, (5) operational (staffing, technical assistance, facilities, and transportation), (6) finance, and (7) data collection and accountability. Findings suggest that charter schools fare better if they are \"totally-linked\" or \"partially-linked\" with a local district special education infrastructure and become part of a state or local \"continuum of service.\" The somewhat disparate visions of charter schools and special education are seen as a major issue.

        "description":"This brief paper describes a literacy program for adults with mental retardation in the Boston metropolitan region developed when more than 300 individuals formally requested literacy services. Several cognitive and literacy assessments were reviewed and implemented. No one assessment was found to be sufficient to assess ranges from pre-literacy to high school. The Brigance and Diagnostic Assessment of Reading (DAR) were found to be the most helpful in determining literacy level, learning style, and type of instruction. The most successful instructional approach included a combination of phonics and whole language. The single most significant variable in reading success was learning across settings more than once a week. Learners who received literacy help at home or at work in  addition to classroom group instruction showed the most improvement in word meaning. Program participants gained from .5 to 2.5 grade levels in one year of instruction. It was concluded that adults with mental retardation have the greatest reading success when they follow the same steps in reading development as adults in community-based adult education programs.

During the first phase of the research, case studies of five school districts were constructed based on information obtained through in-depth interviews, focus groups, observations, and extensive document reviews. The second phase of the research focused very specifically on teachers and the classrooms. Research during Phase 2 focused on four of the original five districts. Findings from the study indicate almost every  teacher and every school were aware that all students were expected to participate and learn the content of the general education curriculum; however, access was dependent on a number of conditions, including teacher ownership and teacher knowledge, understanding what access to the general education curriculum means, and the perception that teachers have that they must cover more subject matter material in the same amount of time. The report concludes by calling for professional development for general and special educators that promotes mutual understanding of students and curricula. (CR)",

The benefits and drawbacks of using spelling, single meaning pictures, and semantic compaction (Minspeak) are described. The paper finds that for access to core vocabulary, research suggests a ranking of semantic compaction, spelling, and single meaning pictures in order of effectiveness. For access to extended vocabulary, the order would be spelling, single meaning pictures, and semantic compaction. The paper stresses, however, that total communication requires access to both core and extended vocabulary and that monitoring the language activity of highly effective  users of AAC has indicated that they use a combination of semantic compaction and spelling, sometimes with word prediction. The paper concludes that for most people who rely on AAC and have a language age of two years or more, the use of multiple language representation methods results in the most effective communication. Those methods include semantic compaction for core vocabulary access and spelling and/or single meaning pictures for extended vocabulary access. (Contains 12 references.) (CR)",

A subset of Praxis III criteria was identified through a survey of experts and used to explore whether the selected skills of beginning teachers with high levels of preparation in CRT differ from the skills of those with low preparation in CRT, and whether selected CRT skills of special education beginning teachers differ from those of general education beginning teachers. Observations of 35 special  education beginning teachers and 33 regular education beginning teachers found there were no significant differences among the teachers due to preservice preparation level, but there were significant differences between general education and special education teachers on three criteria: knowledge of students' backgrounds, fairness, and extending students' thinking.

It attempts to \"mediate\" the debate by adopting the structure of mediation. It begins with a background chapter offering a historical basis for conflict resolution in special education. It then examines the positions held by both proponents and opponents of permitting attorneys and advocates to participate in special education mediation. These positions include, for proponents, the ability of attorneys and advocates to overcome power imbalances, provide a valuable viewpoint, and facilitate settlement and, for opponents, the possibility that attorneys and advocates may undermine collaboration by using adversarial approaches. It then considers the interests and  concerns shared by advocates of the two opposing views. These include that each side should enter mediation capable of understanding and representing its rights and interests and that mediation should foster a fair, candid, and respectful dialogue during the incipient stages of a dispute. Examples of innovative practices in various states are offered. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations that attempt to satisfy these common interests. Three appendices provide federal legal documentation. (Contains approximately 100 references.) (DB)",

Statistical analysis was used to determine if there was a significant positive relationship between a child's chronological age, the language score age equivalent, and the social skills age equivalent. Analysis did not find a significant relationship between the children's social skills and their language ability. A possible reason for this finding was the restricted range of functioning in the participating children. (Contains 45 references.)  (DB)",

The &quot;Inclusion Attitudes and Beliefs&quot; survey instrument was administered to 100 preservice and inservice regular classroom teachers enrolled in a postgraduate program before taking a special education course. Results indicated that the teachers' attitudes toward inclusion could be classified as either: (1) acceptance of primary responsibility for included students and the positive effects of inclusion, particularly in the social domain; or (2) strong reservations about work load, skills necessary to teach diverse students, and fear of eliminating the continuum of placements. No statistically significant differences were found between Spanish preservice and inservice teachers'  beliefs and attitudes. The paper concludes that continuous teacher education focused on perceptions and attitudes is needed to enable teachers to work effectively with special needs students. The survey, with teacher responses for each question, is attached. (Contains 15 references.) (DB)",

Background information covers topics such as the nature of ADD/HD, symptoms of special learning problems, factors that might complicate recognition, why students learn differently, consequences of ignoring the fact that students learn differently, and student evaluation. Special considerations for internationally mobile families are organized into suggestions for before and after the move and anytime. Schooling suggestions cover international  schools, host country or national schools, choosing a school, techniques for teachers, the computer as a teaching aid, continuing education for teachers, and tips for college-bound students.

The plan is organized around two key elements; first, a new paradigm of disability that sees disability as a product of the interaction between individual characteristics and the environment, and second, an emerging universe of disability with new disabling conditions, new causes for impairment, changing frequencies of some impairments, and new consequences of disability. Section 1 provides an introductory chapter and a chapter on current dimensions of disability. Section 2 focuses on the NIDRR research agenda with individual chapters on employment outcomes, health and function, technology for access and function, independent living and community  integration, and associated disability research areas. Section 3 addresses priorities for related activities. These include: knowledge dissemination and utilization, capacity-building for rehabilitation research, and enhancing NIDRR's management of research. Four appendices provide abbreviations and acronyms, detail on the planning process and participants, a list of steering committee members, and a summary of NIDRR program mechanisms and funding patterns.

The study found that students with &quot;severe and/or high cost&quot; disabilities are not randomly distributed across school districts, thereby requiring development of an appropriate funding adjustment. A &quot;severity service multiplier&quot; was developed to allocate supplemental severity funding to some localities based on the characteristics and quantities of services received by their special education students. This approach was  adopted by the California legislature and is now used as a severity adjustment to special education funding. The section following the introductory section considers the challenge of defining students with &quot;severe and/or high cost&quot; disabilities, two models for making this concept operational, analysis of the randomness of distributions of these students, and calculation of the severity service adjustment. A concluding section discusses the approach used and implications for other states. An appendix provides details on deriving special education cost estimates per student. (Contains 14 references.)

It establishes a statistical connection between daylighting and student performance and between skylighting and retail sales. Using multivariate linear regression analysis, the study examined 21,000 school records from 3 school districts in 3 states and daylighting conditions in over 2,000 classrooms. Data indicate students with the most classroom daylighting progressed 20 percent faster on math tests and 26 percent on reading tests in one year than those with the least. Similarly, students with the largest windows progressed 15 percent  faster in math and 23 percent faster in reading than those with the least. In classrooms where windows could be opened, there was a 7 to 18 percent faster educational progress than those with fixed windows, regardless of air conditioning. These findings are reported to be consistent regardless of curricula or teaching styles. Appendices provide data charts, a report from one of the classroom-level analyses, sample illumination readings, classroom plans and sections, and photographs of schools and classrooms. (GR)",

        "description":"This study looks at the effect of native speaker (NS) teacher input on limited-English-proficient (LEP) students' access to classroom speech events. It seeks to determine whether content area teachers modify their talk when interacting with LEP students in the classroom. The study also seeks to describe such modifications and establish whether they determine the level of interaction by LEPs in the classroom. It builds on similar research conducted on the casual interaction of NS and LEP individuals in the workplace, where it was found that certain NS modifications hinder the LEPs participatory role in the speech event. There is evidence to support the belief that NS content area teachers are modifying their discourse in interactions with LEP students in ways that reduce the  students' opportunities for interaction. If this is indeed the case, then current research should be expanded to devise a training agenda that can teach content area teachers to alter their discourse strategies in talk to LEPs to create more productive and responsive speech environments. Numerous data tables and charts are included. (Contains 20 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the usefulness of the labels \"native speaker\" (NS) and \"non-native speaker\" (NNS) in the field of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). The researcher's anecdotal experience is that NNSs bring under-appreciated strengths to teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). The recent research in this field is reviewed and the issues are raised when speakers of a language are divided into the NS and NNS categories. Excerpts from discussions and interviews with TESOL students, graduates, and professors are included to show the range of opinion on this subject. It is concluded that attitudes in the TESOL field are shifting, and NNSs are seen in a more positive light as their contributions to the teaching of ESOL are increasingly  recognized and appreciated. This is especially true when NNS teachers teach students who share their first language and culture. It is suggested that greater openness and wider discussion of the contributions of NNS to the field and to their students is needed and should in time result in greater use of and opportunities for NNS teachers.

        "description":"This paper is an in-depth investigation of classroom language learning motivation in a Korean high school. Understanding the source of motivation and development of motivation is very important for educational and pedagogical purposes. This study surveyed 192 Korean high school students' orientations for learning English to discover what kinds of orientations could lead to motivations, and how these new cognitive variables are related to English-as-a-foreign-language motivation. The results indicated the following: (1) there were more elements than traditional integrative motivation; for example intrinsic/extrinsic and instrumental-knowledge motivations; (2) intrinsic motivation was most salient among them; (3) there existed multiple tracks of orientations vs. motivations vs.  achievement; (4) all orientation factors should first be internally controllable by or for students before leading to motivations or vice versa; (5) intrinsic/extrinsic motivations were mainly related to formal classroom-related factors; and (6) self-confidence construct was associated with either intrinsic or instrumental-knowledge orientation rather than the integrative one.

Although the purposes may vary among various practitioners and audiences, overall this handbook is intended to provide guidance in how to capture students' language proficiency in reliable and valid ways through instructional assessment activities. This handbook is built around a series of rubrics that serve as documentation forms for varied methods of assessment. The rubrics, representing holistic scales and focused-analytic matrices, cover four basic areas of language proficiency: listening; speaking; reading, and writing. Whenever possible, the connection between language and content is made. The instructional  assessment ideas described suggest pathways towards second language learners' attainment of Illinois state English language learning goals: reading with understanding and fluency; writing to communicate for a variety of purposes; listening and speaking effectively in a variety of situations; and using the target language to communicate within and beyond the classroom to reinforce knowledge and skills across academic, vocational, and technical disciplines. To this end, each section/rubric contains the following: an overview and theoretical background; ideas for obtaining information; procedures on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information; student samples with analyses; peer and self-assessments; student or class reporting forms; and caveats and suggestions. A glossary is  appended. (Contains 13 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"This paper offers insights on how to facilitate student-student interaction in the science classroom. These insights derive from the education and the linguistics literature. Cooperative learning research offers a means of understanding what helps groups of students interact successfully. Systemic functional linguistics provides tools for analyzing how people use language to achieve various aims. In this article, cooperative learning and systemic functional linguistics are first described. Next, they are used to analyze a transcript of student-student interaction from an elementary school science classroom. Then implications are suggested as to how these two areas of inquiry can inform improved teaching practice. Particular emphasis is placed on the teaching of collaborative  skills. Interaction plays a crucial role in learning, and even at an early age interaction is crucial. Successful interaction depends a good deal on skill on the part of the interactants. With specific reference to learning at school, constructivist and Vygotskian views both stress the value of student-student interaction. Ideas are illustrated and disseminated for enhancing interaction. The paper is divided into three sections: the first presents a brief introduction to cooperative learning (CL) and systematic functional (S/F) linguistics; the second focuses on using early CL and S/F linguistics to analyze a small bit of interaction of 3 primary school students; and the final section suggests how insights from CL and S/F can in tandem inform pedagogy.

The idea is that in place of buying expensive and restricted commercially produced authoring packages, a teacher with limited computer skills can make his or her own tailor-made materials. The article begins with tips on using Microsoft PowerPoint to produce simple yet effective listening comprehension packages and goes on to suggest ways of using Visual Basic for reading, listening, and writing comprehension. The paper concludes with some simple comprehension work requiring students to download their own information from the Internet. The point is made  throughout that it is especially important for the teacher to know precisely what he or she wants to do with the software package. Intensive and deliberate teacher planning and preparation are essential for computer uses in education to be effective and productive. Screen captures appear as needed throughout the text to make matters as clear as possible for the instructor.

        "author":["Young, Richard F."],
        "description":"One of the ways in which language testing interfaces with applied linguistics is in the definition and validation of the constructs that underlie language tests. When language testers and score users interpret scores on a test, they do so by implicit and explicit reference to the construct on which the test is based. Equally, when applied to new understandings of the way people use language, the challenge for language testers is to develop tests that embody these new understandings. This paper puts forward a relatively new theory of spoken language use in face-to-face communication--\"interactional competence\"--and discusses the implications of the theory for the design and interpretation of tests of oral communication. The theory of interactional competence seeks to explain the  variation in an individual speaker's performance from one discursive practice to another. It is concluded that in validly assessing interactional competence, close attention must be paid to exactly what happens during performance assessments so that it is known exactly what configuration of interactional resources apply to the practice of assessment. It is also concluded that such testing provides a principled way of generalizing from performance in the discursive practice of a performance assessment to performance in other non-test contexts. Second language acquisition researchers must pay careful attention to the contexts in which they elicit interlanguage data. (Contains 32 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"There are growing numbers of students enrolling in university-level English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) courses who are not international students but are products of American K-12 bilingual education programs. These immigrant or refugee ESL learners are not required to demonstrate a specified level of English language competence by scoring 500 or higher on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL); their American high school diplomas are considered proof enough of English language competence. There is reason to believe that the needs of and level of proficiency of these students are different from the typical international student, but there is little empirical data. This paper is an attempt to draw a clearer picture of one immigrant learner's English literacy development  (&quot;Jeng-Da,&quot; a Chinese immigrant) and his initiation into the university. It is hoped that his experiences will shed some light on the curriculum needs of the growing numbers of immigrant ESL students at American universities. It is concluded that L2 language proficiency should be measured for immigrants in a way comparable to that which is done for international students; strategies for academic achievement should be explicitly taught to provide a sort of scaffolding during the transition from survival to academic English; and instructors should be made aware of the likely enormous familial and societal demands on immigrant students, pressures that international students are less likely to face.

        "description":"This paper presents a descriptive examination of the effects of high school learners of Spanish who complete a series of Internet-based assignments using a popular online Spanish tutorial. The study is designed to measure the knowledge acquired from the World Wide Web by administering and comparing a pretest and a posttest to both a sample and a control group. The entire study is conducted in a suburban Michigan high school. Much of the rest of the thesis summarizes and analyzes the answers to a questionnaire used to ascertain students' (n=100) opinions and feelings regarding their computer-based assignments in the Spanish foreign language class. Extensive quotations from the questionnaires reveal students' varied frustrations and praise of their computer assisted learning  experiences. Overall, the students had positive comments and experiences about the use of the Internet. Early enthusiasm for Internet-based assignments waned as the novelty of the experience wore off. It is concluded that using the Internet and the World Wide Web to teach Spanish to American high school students was a success as it is useful in accommodating different learning styles and in fostering language learning. Students more disposed toward more independent learning styles benefited the most. Technical difficulties and uneven access to the Internet mean that a live foreign language teacher remains essential. (Contains 15 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"This paper seeks to build on the growing body of literature demonstrating the value of a dialogical process in second language learning, especially in work with students who are not part of the dominant cultural or linguistic group. It identifies and describes the ways in which bilingual secondary students engaged in dialogical processes begin to challenge the power relationships within their schools and communities, and explores the role of dialogic pedagogy in transforming the work of teachers. Three principle research questions are addressed: (1) In what ways can a critical, dialogic process come into being in the lives of students and teachers, and how does this affect their lives in and out of school? (2) What can be the role of a university teacher education program in  fostering such a dialogic process? (3) What part can a critical, dialogic pedagogy play in supporting the academic achievement of bilingual students, particularly those at the secondary level? It is concluded that dialogic pedagogy in which students' linguistic and cultural understandings are sources of knowledge and bridges to the curriculum will benefit bilingual students academically and socially. Bilingual students become more interested in the academic content of school and more motivated to master the linguistic tools that will allow them a full participation in society.

        "description":"This paper investigates the potential relationship of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) to gesture and second language learning. It is asserted that the ZPD is both a tool and a result, not a tool for result; it is both product and process at the same time. The process of learning a new language/culture in the case of a person who is living in a country where the second language is dominant is at least in part a transformational process. In this process, there is an unavoidable element of play and drama, where the individual struggles to &quot;play&quot; him or herself in the new language and culture. Gestures are an integral part of this inevitable drama and play acting. Gesture is in general highly linguistic in nature, a finding that needs to be considered in conjunction  with verbal accounts of language learning. This study documents many cases in which gestures become lexical items repeated by both interactants as the interlocutors scaffold each other in their efforts to co-construct meaning. Clearly gestures are an important means of enhancing communication and facilitating comprehension, and are therefore a necessary part of sound pedagogical practice. (Contains 15 references.) (KFT)",

In discussions of how to teach a foreign language, the participants outlined the need for teachers to provide a language-rich environment in which students are guided to use the foreign language to express themselves and obtain information from others. Methods  courses supported these ideas. However, during the participants' field experiences, contextual constraints entered into the equation, and many opted to abandon these practices when they encountered a negative reaction from their students and mentors. Although teacher educators have an opportunity to ground preservice teachers in the theory and practice of foreign language education in methods courses, they should recognize that corresponding field experiences seldom represent idealized language learning situations. Despite a base of foreign language pedagogical content knowledge, what preservice teachers really need is continued support in order to learn to adapt their teaching methods to whatever circumstances they encounter.

        "description":"Communications technologies such as Web-based conferencing and chat are being used increasingly around the world by instructors and students in either face to face or distance learning courses. While some discuss the affects of this phenomena, others are more focused on how these technological tools can be used in specific courses to achieve desired learning outcomes. This article shares experiences in using electronic conferencing in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher education courses. It discusses strategies that have been used with electronic conferences, lessons learned, and implications for further research. Covered topics include instructional strategies for the WebBoard, WebBoard orientation, book reviews, chat rooms, and lessons learned. It is  concluded that the technology involved remains only an enabler and facilitator of instruction. That all this can be meaningful and productive for the learner is a function of pedagogy; more specifically, skill in exploiting technology for language learning purposes and not of technology in and of itself. The WebBoard makes sharing and collaborating and engaging in high-level learning tasks feasible. The WebBoards not only facilitate learning, but they can redefine roles for the student and instructor, allowing students to be designers of their own learning by setting, regulating, and achieving goals that they have a large role in deciding.

The entire construct of motivation is reviewed and defined. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the implementation of the whole language approach affects student motivation in an English as a foreign language (EFL) university setting. Results show that the whole language approach had two effects on EFL university students' motivation: (1) all subjects were able to achieve their goals; and (2) 65 percent put in greater effort than in previous EFL studies, whereas 30 percent put in equal effort. The whole language approach had a positive influence on the students' motivation. The subjects reported several possible reasons for  the positive results, including the following: the continuity of the course, being able to learn new material, enjoyment of the course and class activities, being able to keep up with the rest of the class, few opportunities to get off-task, higher expectations, interesting content, and improvement of language skills. The role of teachers and the attitudes of students were also held to be important factors. (Contains 25 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"This article examines English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) textbook telephone dialogues against the backdrop about what is reported about real telephone interaction based in research in conversation analysis (CA). An analysis of eight ESL textbooks reveals that the fit between what conversation analysts say about the nature of natural telephone conversation and that found in textbooks is unsatisfactory. Sequences such as summon-answer, identification, greeting, and how are you, often found in naturally occurring telephone exchanges, are absent, incomplete, or problematic in the textbook dialogues examined. The article argues that as the focus in language pedagogy increasingly turns toward the development of teaching materials that are informed by studies in discourse analysis, it  may be important for materials writers and language teachers to pay attention to interconnections among language (or talk), sequence structure, and social action. The opening of a telephone conversation is an interactionally demanding task, not one done effortlessly or automatically as in textbook dialogues. The juxtaposition of natural telephone conversation with textbook conversation displays the tension between linguistic competence and linguistic performance, between understanding language as process and language as product.

        "description":"Extensive reading (ER) programs involve students in silently reading large quantities of material. Research suggests that extensive reading is associated with gains in first and second language proficiency. Further, extensive reading can help learners develop a reading habit and increase their level of autonomy. This paper begins with a discussion of the benefits for second language learners of combining the solitary activity of reading with group activities in which students share with classmates about what they have read. Cooperative learning is recommended as a source of principles for organizing these post-reading group activities. These cooperative learning principles include positive interdependence, individual accountability, equal participation, and simultaneous  interaction. The heart of the presentation consists of a variety of post-reading group activities. The way these activities embody the cooperative learning principles is explained. Different post-reading activities are suggested for when the entire class reads the same book, when a group of students reads the same book, and when each student reads a different book. A Web site on extensive reading in second language instruction is also provided, which includes an annotated bibliography, research articles, and ideas for beginning an extensive reading program.

This study investigated such out-of-class academic collaboration among Singaporean polytechnic students as they worked on assignments in which their instructors had made collaboration mandatory. Data were collected via questionnaires completed by 232 students, interviews were conducted with 10 instructors, and observations were done on 8 student groups as they collaborated on mandatory out-of-class collaborative assignments. Variables of interest included frequency of out-of-class collaboration (very frequent), how such work is assessed (usually a combination of group and individual grading), group size (most often 4 or 5), who decides on group composition (usually the  students), and factors students and teachers believe contribute to successful group work (e.g., keeping focused, allocating work, and sharing ideas). Suggestions are made on how to guide students to make greater and more efficient use of group study outside of class (e.g., team-building activities and training in group skills) and to help instructors gain new ideas for organizing and facilitating out-of-class academic collaboration among their students (such as conferences with groups to help them structure their collaboration).

        "description":"Today's teachers need access to a wide range of information to function in the classroom. They need a thorough understanding of how language figures in education, and for that reason they must receive systematic and intensive preparation in educational linguistics. A thorough grounding in linguistics would support teachers' undertakings overall, and in particular in teaching literacy skills and working with English language learners. If approached coherently, such preparation would also cover many of the desired teacher competencies, relating to skills in assessing children, in individualizing instruction, and in respecting diversity. This paper lays out a rationale for why current and prospective teachers need to know more about language, and what specific sorts of knowledge  they need. Requisite knowledge about oral language, oral language used in formal and academic contexts, and written language is discussed. In the final section, courses are suggested that teacher preparation programs should offer to teacher candidates. This course list may also be seen as specifying aspects of an integrated, in-depth professional development program for inservice teachers. A glossary is appended. (Contains 53 references.) (KFT)",

CLT views language as a vehicle for communication, and it recognizes as its aim the teaching of communicative competence, which includes grammatical, sociolinguistic, discourse, and strategic competence. In communicative classrooms, the teacher's role is that of facilitator, while students become communicators. Practical ideas and suggestions are offered for applying this approach. The paper is divided into 3 parts: approach, design, and procedure. Part 1 includes a discussion of a theory of language teaching and learning (including teaching grammatical, sociolinguistic, and communicative competence). Also included are  discussions of authentic classroom practice, the nature of the language classroom, the information gap, criteria for selecting activities, the use of the native language, and being eclectic. Part 2 discusses weak and strong versions of communicative language teaching (according to Howatt, Ellis, and Holliday), course syllabi, teaching materials, and the teacher and student roles as communicators. Part 3, focusing on teaching procedure, discusses strong and weak CLT procedures and engages the research of Finocchiaro, Brumfit, Littlewood, and Rivers.

The example of the recently enacted Human Organ Transplant Ordinance in Hong Kong is used to show how legal rhetorical objectives can be realized through a series of forensic tasks that connect with the real world concerns of both medical professionals and the lay relatives of transplant recipients. Underlying the paper is a philosophy of ESL teaching that prizes the interdependence of language and content, and the need to raise students' language awareness to maintain clear  relevance to their legal studies--an approach aimed at sustaining student interest while raising their awareness of why ordinances are structured the way they are. Real-world case studies are used rather than textbook grammar exercises in order to weave the linguistic agenda into authentic contexts and purposes.

Specifically, the study examined the types of activities that the paraeducators engaged in, the input they had in classroom instructional activities, the assistance they received from teachers and others, and the factors that detracted from or fostered collaborative relationships. The 32 participants in the study were drawn from two large Southern California public elementary schools that serve primarily working class Latino limited English speaking students. Findings reveal that a lack of interaction between teachers and paraeducators allowed little time for paraeducators to ask questions of the  teachers or for the teachers to assist the paraeducators in the development of effective teaching strategies. Both parties indicated that more opportunities for interaction would be beneficial. It was also found that school cultures are not structured to support collaboration between teachers and paraeducators, and that a hierarchical structure of social relations prevailed in the teacher-paraeducator relationship. A critical finding is that teachers are not aware that paraeducators possess a knowledge of the students' culture and community that is essential for tapping into students' prior knowledge and interests.

This program evaluation involving observational research design was implemented in a Wheaton, Illinois, school district. An innovative, self-contained elementary ESL program located at two of the district's elementary schools was evaluated through a matched-pairs research design that compared the experience of students in this program with the experience of similar students in the district's ESL pull-out programs. This report describes the observational research methodology and the  results. A statistical analysis found significant differences between the level of engagement and teacher student interaction in the two program models, with the results favoring the experimental pod of the ESL program. These results are illustrated with qualitative data, collected through ethnographic narratives, which are presented in the report in the form of case study comparisons.

        "description":"There is growing evidence that the needs of adult and child or adolescent learners are very different. A recent study of adult learning and literacy suggests that participants who have goals in mind are likely to persist in their studies, and changing a goal through experience appears to be a positive decision. Effective adult learning programs today strive to provide meaningful, learner-centered instruction that is informed by the learners' needs, interests, and goals. Tailoring instruction to class needs and class goals can be accomplished through class curriculum negotiation whereby students negotiate course content and set class goals. Such a process gives the learners a voice in their instruction and improves practice and instruction through a better understanding of adult  learners' needs. This increases learners' motivation and confidence and leads them to commit more time to their studies--a valuable outcome for busy adults. This guide is designed to help the English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) teacher do this effectively for a class of 20 or more individuals. The guide helps teachers and learners define goals, helps teachers and learners work together to define individual short-term goals, suggests instructional steps, helps teachers make class and individual goals and planning compatible, suggests ways to carry out plan progress and monitoring, and suggests ways to evaluate and document progress. Blank forms and worksheets are included. (Contains 20 references.) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse for ESL Literacy Education) (KFT)",

        "author":["Kitay, Julia Farthing"],
        "description":"The short-wave radio provides an excellent and cost-effective tool for teaching English as a Second Language (ESL), especially in remote or poor areas where Internet access may not be readily available. It allows the learner to hear multiple native English speakers talk in normal speed in a variety of accents. It also allows students to encounter new terms, expressions, and geographical locations. Radio is highly portable and relatively inexpensive. This paper addresses the advantages and disadvantages of using the radio, how radio propagation works, and suggestions for using the radio in the ESL classroom. The Internet and the World Wide Web have many advantages over radio use such as speed, interactivity, specialized site and chat room offerings, and other advantages, but these  advantages are moot if this technology is out of reach for financial reasons for many who wish to learn English. Short-wave radio may be a much older technology, but its much lower cost makes it a viable pedagogical tool. A sample reception report is appended.

        "author":["Cunningham Florez, MaryAnn"],
        "description":"This document is a narrative of one experienced English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) teacher's struggle to improve the English language learning skills of her beginning level students. She found this difficult to do in a situation where the learners spent only 4 hours a week in class, and only 2 of those in her class. Rather than focus on how to do more to help the students learn English, the teacher decided to change strategies and see what she could do to help them take more of the responsibility for learning and thus increase their capacity to learn. The teacher turned to works such as Rebecca Oxford's research on language learning strategies and O'Malley and Chamot's Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA). The article goes on to describe the teacher's efforts to  ascertain what language learning strategies were typically used by her beginning level adult English language learners. She found that her students were resourceful strategists in the classroom and appreciated the opportunity to discuss openly various learning strategies. She found a variety of strategies in use, namely: socially-oriented strategies; resourcing strategies; strategies based on prior knowledge and experience; and repetition and coping strategies. It is concluded that knowing about and understanding the learning strategies of the learners allows the teacher to make more informed decisions about what instructional strategies are likely to be the most effective.

        "description":"This brief asks the question of what happens if the instructor isolates verbs and uses them in lesson plans for English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students at the beginning and intermediate levels. The discussion is based on the experiences of one ESL teacher who found that the most pressing practical need of her students was a better command of English verbs for use in the workplace. She planned her lessons around certain verb forms and functions. She started by collecting verbs that were especially useful in the workplace, accomplishing this by asking her students to describe their jobs. The verbs were categorized and listed on the board. As the students began to better understand the importance and usefulness of the verbs, they began to ask questions about when and where to  use particular common verbs, such as the difference between \"make\" and \"do.\" Whether at the beginning or intermediate level, it was found that students comprehended more quickly when certain functions were taught in separate lessons. Graphics such as timelines, charts, cluster maps, and also games effectively reinforced the forms and functions of verbs and helped to evaluate student comprehension. Overall, these lists of everyday, practical verbs and the graphics have proved valuable pedagogical supplements to the standard ESL curriculum.

        "description":"This practitioner brief focuses on the question: What happens when beginner-level English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students work in small groups? This question was pursued because the ESL teacher wanted to make use of small self-directed groups during class time. She found that the students needed a lot of structure from the teacher to make productive use of the time. In order to solve this problem and to support the learners as they pursued their goals within the small group, the teacher decided she needed to know more about what went on in those small groups--specifically how learners interacted to complete assigned tasks. To gather information, the teacher enlisted the aid of another observer, interviewed students in their native language, and kept notes on her observations  and reflections. It was found that the students do in fact work well in groups with minimal structuring on the part of instructor. They did not always do what the teacher expected, but they got their work done. They assumed their participation roles and identified areas where they needed extra practice. The instructor needs to provide resources, tools, and opportunities and to encourage students to take risks in English. Finally, the instructor learned that there is a lot that goes on in class that she does not and cannot know about, but that this situation can be fine and productive nonetheless.

        "description":"The focus of this practitioner brief is: How do adult English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students manage their learning? The adult ESL instructor found that his students wanted more opportunities to speak English in class, and to practice actual oral communication skills in English, but felt too much of their time and effort was directed into rote memorization, written translation, reciting, and checking dictionaries. To help make this happen, the instructor engaged in learner interviews, class observation, and looking over student notebooks. The data showed that the adult ESL learners managed learning as a coordination of their personal needs, cognitive strategies, and previous learning experiences. Their personal needs usually consisted of their comparisons of English to the  structure of their native languages, or social needs arising from problems in conducting daily routines such as shopping. Cognitive strategies generally included recall and comprehension practice. What was missing from nearly all of these learning strategies were higher strategies such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse for ESL Literacy Education) (KFT)",

This learning strategy was tried by one teacher of adult English as a Second Language (ESL) because the students in his class were either too far above or below the language ability norm in the class or were not making adequate progress in their English language learning. The instructor decided to give students time and resources in class, as well as strategies to work on their goals outside of class, so that each student's individual needs would be met. In addition, he arranged to have higher and lower students work with volunteers, used tiered cooperative learning activities so  that all were working within their skill level, provided multiple level reading exercises, had extension activities ready for students who finished their work quickly, and matched students with computer software appropriate to their needs and learning level. In the end, the teacher's strategies for supporting and encouraging learner-directed learning did not work. Students recognized where their weaknesses were, but they could not on their own productively use the extra time and resources to make progress. Using volunteers, computer software, and textbooks was more effective. (KFT)",

According to this teacher, when people came to the center, the primary message they received was one of reassurance. Most of the people who come to the center are foreign born adults who need to learn English and adjust to life in the United States. The supportive reassurance they receive from the staff and from each other is a significant motivator.

Until recently, however, little attention has been paid to personal trauma and domestic abuse. Acknowledgement of the prevalence of violence generally, and of that experienced by those in the adult ESL and literacy community specifically, is critical to the development of instructional approaches that make classrooms safer and learning more possible for adult immigrant learners. This digest describes trauma and abuse in immigrant communities (concerning mainly women and children), discusses the effects of trauma on learning, and suggests ways in which practitioners can modify their practice to facilitate learning among victims of trauma  and violence. A long list of implications for practice are discussed, and among the suggestions to teachers are the following: listen to learners and allow their concerns about violence to surface in one form or another; offer content and activities that allow learners to share as much or as little information as they want; allow learners to choose their level of participation in classroom activities; find out about community resources; and avoid the assumption that all immigrant learners are victims of traumas. It is concluded that although strides have been made in raising public awareness about the prevalence of violence in all forms and its effects upon learning, work remains to be done.

        "description":"As part of broader national effort, 510 Pennsylvania adults were randomly surveyed in order to examine their attitudes toward higher education. In addition, a focus group was held in suburban Philadelphia. The four major findings of the research are that Pennsylvanians believe: (1) higher education is vitally important for success; (2) the process of earning a degree is inherently valuable to building the character of students and is not merely a symbolic exercise; (3) the main responsibility for success in higher education rests with the student, but institutions should help students who exhibit strong effort; and (4) paying for college is difficult but doable. The Pennsylvania survey complements a national telephone survey of 1,015 adults. Analysis showed that Pennsylvanians'  attitudes do not differ significantly from those of the nation's as a whole, except that Pennsylvanians feel that poorer students have an easier time than middle-income students attending a four-year college; Pennsylvanians also strongly support making student loans from the federal government available more often. Three tables present statewide and national response data; a final section describes the methodology. (RAB)",

Opinions centered around the following: (1) higher education is generally perceived as extremely important, especially to parents of high school students, and African American and Hispanic parents give education a higher priority than do white parents; (2) the process of earning a degree is inherently valuable and is not merely a symbolic, largely meaningless exercise; (3) the public tends to emphasize the individual responsibility of college students in areas such as remediation and financial matters,  but feels that schools should assist students who are legitimately having difficulties; (4) paying for college is difficult, especially for the poor, but most people believe that anyone who really wants a college education can get one; and (5) although a majority of respondents believe higher education is delivering a valuable service, they are largely unfamiliar with details of higher education administration and financing often debated by the nation's leaders.

The goal is to stimulate the creation of state policies that enhance opportunity and achievement for all Americans who aspire to higher education. The report card will be prepared and released regularly, with the first release scheduled for fall 2000 and subsequent releases planned either annually or biannually. The initial report card will include two major sections: a summary of state-by-state performance results within a national context; and detailed information on each state's results. Grades will be  measured on performance in five categories: (1) preparation of students for education beyond high school; (2) provision of opportunities for participation in postsecondary education; (3) affordability; (4) persistence and completion of certificates and degrees; and (5) educational gains and returns, e.g., the benefits that accrue to a state as a result of a more highly educated population.

The benchmarks are divided into seven categories: (1) institutional support; (2) course development; (3) teaching/learning; (4) course structure; (5) student support; (6) faculty support; and (7) evaluation and assessment. The study seeks to ascertain the degree to which the benchmarks are actually incorporated in the policies and practices of the institutions, and how  important the benchmarks are to faculty, administrators, and students. Quantitative information for the study was derived from a Likert-scale survey, and qualitative information was derived from in-depth interviews. The report concludes that, for the most part, the benchmarks are considered important and that the institutions strive to incorporate them into their policies, practices, and procedures.

The information is based on a series of follow-up surveys of bachelor's degree recipients and community college graduates conducted one year after graduation by the Maryland Higher Education Commission over the past 20 years. The analysis covers data only from Maryland public institutions because data from independent institutions has not been consistently available. The items on the questionnaire have remained the same over the entire period of the study; students were asked to identify their: (1) academic major; (2) residency status at the time students initially enrolled; (3) residency status one year after graduation; and (4) place of employment. The data show that at least 85  percent of bachelor's degree recipients who were Maryland residents at enrollment remained in Maryland, and at least 31 percent who were out-of-state residents at enrollment remained in Maryland. However, there are considerable differences when the data is examined by academic major. In general, the percentage of community college graduates who remain in Maryland is higher than the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients.

Part 2, titled &quot;College Missions, Faculty Teaching, and Student Outcomes in a Context of Low Diversity,&quot; analyzes the content of mission statements of top selective liberal arts colleges; discusses the experience at Macalester College; and summarizes the case for diversity. Part 3, &quot;The Educational  Possibility of Multi-Racial/Multi-Ethnic College Classrooms,&quot; attempts to understand the outcomes that result from interactions among diverse students by describing a qualitative study of specific interactive classrooms. Three overarching themes emerge: (1) racial and ethnic diversity is necessary but not sufficient for creating the most effective educational environment; (2) racial and ethnic diversity increases the educational possibilities of the classroom; and (3) multiracial/multiethnic classes enhance educational outcomes. Appended, as Part 4, is the faculty classroom diversity questionnaire, which focuses on faculty attitudes toward diversity at their institutions and in their own classrooms.

To determine the extent to which that is true, the study addresses the questions of who is teaching in classrooms and what teaching load they carry. Data is from the 1992-93 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93), a nationally representative sample of instructional faculty and staff, excluding teaching assistants. The results showed that, contrary to perceptions, a majority of senior and tenured faculty were involved at least to some extent in undergraduate instruction. However, those of higher academic rank, or with higher degrees, were less likely to teach undergraduates and to teach them exclusively. Undergraduate  teaching loads varied widely across and within institutions; in general, they were lighter at four-year doctoral institutions than at four-year nondoctoral institutions. In turn, these teaching loads were lighter than at two-year institutions. Professors who taught only undergraduates had a much higher undergraduate teaching load, and there were similar differences for those who taught only lower-division students against those who taught upper-division and graduate classes.

These hospitals necessarily have higher costs than do nonteaching hospitals. Prior to 1997, the higher costs were absorbed by all payers in the state. Subsequently, changes in federal and state legislation, deregulation of rates, and changes in Medicare, led to reduced reimbursement to hospitals, incentives to reduce the number of residents, and to shift funds from specialty to primary care programs. The study addressed two questions for the period January 1, 1995 to February 28, 1999: (1) whether the three teaching hospitals had adequately planned for the  reductions in funding; and (2) whether they had reduced the number of residents in their GME programs and increased the percentage of residents who were in primary care programs.

        "description":"This study examines higher education reforms in the 15 European Union member states and 3 European Free Trade Association countries between 1980-98, identifying trends, convergences, and divergences between the countries and changes in the management and control of higher education institutions, particularly as they relate to financing and quality control. After an introduction, Chapter 1, &quot;Legislation for Change,&quot; examines policies underlying reform and instruments employed to formulate and enforce these policies. Chapter 2, &quot;Management, Finance, and Control,&quot; discusses reforms affecting higher education management, financing, and quality control, noting the responsibilities of higher education institutions and regional and national governments. Chapter 3, &quot;Access and Wastage,&quot;  highlights changes in entry requirements and access routes for nontraditional students. Chapter 4, &quot;Financial Aid to Students,&quot; examines major changes in public financial support for students. Chapter 5, &quot;Curriculum and Teaching,&quot; examines changes in the structure of higher education, course planning, teaching methods, student assessment, and faculty training. Chapter 6, &quot;Internationalisation,&quot; discusses the opening of higher education to international influences (e.g., course provision and cooperation and exchange of students and staff). Chapter 7, &quot;Conclusions and Future Perspectives,&quot; discusses possible future reforms. A small companion document titled &quot;Profile of...Two Decades of Reform in Higher Education in Europe: 1980 Onwards&quot; offers brief discussions of the motivation for the  study, methodology, entrepreneurial culture in higher education, quality evaluation, student diversity, structural renewal, and higher education in the Europe of tomorrow.

The paper begins by examining the effect of affirmative action on women's progress, focusing particularly on their advancement to top administrative positions in higher education, and looking for the root of these problems in differences in leadership styles between females and males; disparities in access to professional development, in opportunities for publication and advanced degrees, and in salary. In reviewing the effects of Title IX, the 1972 federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education  programs, on women's athletic programs, the paper finds positive and negative effects: women have benefited from more athletic participation opportunities and more equitable facilities, but a major area of concern involves equality of salaries. A final section of the paper reviews the role that mentors play in women's career development. The paper also offers work shadowing and a sense of humor as factors that can help women advance in their careers. (Contains 30 references.) (CH)",

Interviews were conducted with 17 respondents selected from 4 institutions of varying size, location, type, and funding source. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed several common themes: (1) faculty believe that clear institutional values and expectations are important factors in the socialization process; (2) faculty also perceived that one barrier in the socialization experience was senior faculty not showing new  faculty the ropes of the institution; and (3) faculty also identified heavy workloads as a major barrier in the promotion and tenure process.

Specifically, the models examined the impact on explained variance in eighth-grade students' college predisposition decisions and sought to identify patterns among the selected variables for sub-groups of students. Data for the model was drawn from the National Education Longitudinal Study 1988; the sample consisted of 300 students randomly drawn from unweighted groups of White,  Hispanic, and African American students. This study reinforced the contributions of mentoring and community involvement for all sub-groups of students and also highlighted the generally indirect nature of their influences on eighth-grade predisposition. For African American students, the circuitous route of effects ran from community involvement and educational mentoring to grades, to parental expectations, and lastly to predisposition. The study also reinforced the central role of parental expectations on students' early decisions regarding college. (Contains 18 references.) (CH)",

A secondary purpose of the study was to investigate the role of international students in the internationalization process. The study was conducted in two selected departments of a large Midwestern university in which the administrative mission to internationalize had been institutionalized for five years. Data was gathered through interviews with 4 administrators, 6 faculty, and 12 foreign graduate students and from institutional strategic plan documents. Responses were coded according to three categories: participants' perceptions of the mission to internationalize, descriptions of daily experiences, and  perceptions of the role played by international students in the educational process. Comparative analysis revealed disjunctions at three levels between articulated institutional goals and implementation at the departmental level; these were: perceived importance of internalization to all academic fields, desired scope of internationalization, and perceived role of international students. The paper concludes with several recommendations for implementing internationalization, noting that internationalization must be undertaken as a comprehensive university-wide effort, that it must be adopted as part of the on-going &quot;normal&quot; process of education, and that feedback between hierarchical organizational levels is necessary.

The paper argues that the emphasis in most examinations is on the lower mental skills, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy, and is evidence that university training is little more than a four-year rote learning program. It charges that the university examination system groups students into classifications and measures performance level within a narrow criteria that does not recognize improvement of student thinking skills as the primary goal of education. The research design coded examination questions and papers using one  independent variable (the academic faculty or department) and six dependent variables that corresponded to Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation). Analyses of the data were conducted separately for each of the seven departments. The results indicated that most examination questions in this representative state university dwell on lower-order mental processes, although examinations in applied fields had higher-order questions. The paper offers the suggestion that university instruction be redesigned to focus on the quality of graduates rather than on the quality of entering students. (Contains 31 references.) (CH)",

The paper then presents a hypothetical model of a technology subsystem, with faculty, support staff, student services, and libraries as the other subsystems. Central administration is shown as a subsystem to manage and control other systems. The interactions of these subsystems influence the outputs of the university by adding distance education, interactive video  conferencing, and computer literate graduates to more traditional outputs.

        "author":["Hativa, Nira"],
        "description":"This study was initiated in response to perceived behavior problems of undergraduate law school students at a research university in Israel. It was found that increasing numbers of students stopped attending classes on a regular basis, were not reading assigned materials, avoided participating in discussions, studied only superficially for exams, and were reluctant to study theory, preferring to concentrate on practice. Interviews and questionnaires completed by a representative sample of faculty and students attempted to identify similarities and differences between professors' and students' thinking about and perceptions of goals in teaching, the responsibility for student learning, and problems in the teaching/learning/student assessment situation. The study identified major  gaps between faculty and student perceptions concerning all aspects of the academic environment. A dividing issue is faculty emphasis on theory in teaching as opposed to students' wish for a more practical orientation. Views also diverge on who is responsible for students' failure to learn. While faculty perceive themselves as satisfactory teachers, students are highly critical of faculty's teaching, with students criticizing faculty's information-transmission approach to teaching despite students' preference for a more student-centered orientation. These findings are compared to similar observations made at a U.S. law school. Four data tables are appended. (Contains 53 references.) (CH)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the author's personal experiences in developing and implementing a problem-based college mathematics course for liberal arts majors. This project was initiated in response to the realization that most students are dependent on \"patterning\" learning algorithms and have no expectation that self-initiated thinking is a characteristic of learning. The problem-based version of college mathematics presented here uses no required text; instead a packet of activities and project assignments accompanies material designed to add structure to the course. The paper addresses concerns about increased faculty workload in teaching for critical thinking and the additional time required for formative assessment. Using examples from the author's own experience in the  classroom, it compares advantages and disadvantages of instructor-graded formative assessment with the suggested self-grading technique. The latter allows the instructor: (1) to see the learner's initial response, (2) to see what information the learner has gained from the discussion session, (3) to measure the learner's level of comprehension, and (4) to review only one set of papers in order to make small adjustments in the learner's understanding. A graphing activity and a self-assessment rubric are appended. (CH)",

This cross-foundation, retrospective evaluation examines 35 projects of $100,000 or more funded between 1985-95. Study information was based on qualitative data and approaches, with the majority of project activities and results self-reported by grantees. Written surveys and review of annual progress reports submitted by grantees were augmented by follow-up telephone inquiries and e-mails. Four international projects are included in the evaluations. Most projects used approaches involving classroom learning, community service, and reflection on service within the context of coursework. The report notes that overall about 90 percent of WKKF-funded  service learning efforts continued beyond the life of the grant. Projects leveraged over $14 million in additional support and in-kind contributions. Service learning was implemented successfully in a wide range of higher education institutions nationwide, often becoming an integral part of, and sometimes the catalyst for, revision of curricula and development of new programs. Service learning projects were seen to meet students' needs for relevance and application, as well as a range of community needs. Findings support service learning as a powerful educational tool that can help develop students' leadership skills and sense of civic responsibility. (SM)",

Chapter 1 sketches the general history of Lake Forest College. Chapter 2 describes the years from 1955-65, a generally very conservative period with rules governing many aspects of women's lives. Things began to change at the end of this period, as the campus reacted to the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy's assassination, the gathering momentum of the civil rights movement, enrollment of liberal students from the East, and the Vietnam War. Chapter  3 examines the years between 1965-75, a key period during which the campus experienced drastic changes sparked by national movements. The civil rights movement expanded, the Vietnam War escalated, the peace movement began, and the women's movement emerged. Women struggled to change their lives, abolishing dress codes and dorm rules, fighting for education about and the right to have birth control and abortions, and pushing for equality in athletics.

At the postsecondary level, where adults are amassing and assimilating huge volumes of information, the inclusion of computer technology serves as an anchor of support for learning and contributes to the activation of cognitive instructional strategies. Previous reasons for computer exclusion are no longer justifiable. The current issue may actually be one of knowledge, skill, and manpower, all of which are resolvable by teaching and training teaching assistants (TAs) to incorporate technology within the instructional  setting. Raising the knowledge and skill levels of future professors means a direct transfer of knowledge and skills to the teaching environment. It may also mean increased competency for conducting research, which is expedited by using technology. When the instructional setting for TAs also becomes a training ground for utilizing technology, the first step will have been undertaken toward building a solid partnership between education and training. This is no longer an option. It is a necessary requirement for preparing the next generation of professors for successful futures. (Contains 46 references.) (Author/SM)",

These models are designed to promote and enhance high school science education, particularly in remote Appalachian high schools that lack ready access to either extensive laboratory equipment or computer resources, and to help high school teachers utilize computer technology in the classroom.

Respondents--mostly deans and education faculty--were asked to rate their institutions in terms of a variety of indicators of capacity, including course work, technology facilities and support, skills of graduates, and field experience opportunities. The tentative recommendation of the survey was that teacher training institutions should concentrate on increasing integration of technology throughout their programs through faculty staff development and field experiences rather than on developing additional technology courses. In 1999, a follow-up survey was conducted of those institutions that had above-average ratings on all four factors of technology integration,  facilities, field experience, and application skills. Types of responses for each survey item were tallied to identify common themes. Ten tables show the numbers and percentages of respondents providing each type of answer to each question, and the discussion following each table includes excerpts from the narrative responses. Two tables show ratings the respondents gave for the usefulness of various sources of technology training and for technology plans. Responses to the 1999 survey tend to support the theory that infusing technology into teacher preparation requires a comprehensive approach that attempts to balance facilities, faculty professional development, course work, and field experience.

        "description":"When competing with mass media and other forms of information delivery, a verbal lecture does not have enough sensory impression. What students read in a passive framework is barely remembered, less so in pre-examination cramming. Weaker students have difficulties in reading, most notably with abstract and mathematical concepts. These problems are magnified in computer graphics, where mathematical expressions/structures and programming projects may prove too formidable. In this paper, active learning models are applied to computer graphics. Lectures are augmented in real time with student activities, inquiry-based reasoning, and other methods of initiating student contribution to the learning experience. This approach promotes a more comprehensive, deeper, and more memorable  understanding of the theory, principles, and methodologies of computer graphics. A progression of such activities is presented as they are applied in the course. Six figures illustrate the text. Contains 14 references. (AEF)",

The participants have embarked on a series of training modules designed to develop their skills with a variety of software applications and the integration of technology within the curriculum. Participants--administrators and classroom teachers--receive training and a new laptop computer with Windows(R)95 for use in their respective jobs. An initial study was conducted to frame a benchmark for evaluating the success of the project in providing the teachers with the technical skills, knowledge, and motivation necessary to integrate technology within the curriculum effectively and efficiently. A follow-up evaluation was also conducted. Results are discussed in terms of  the following questions that formed the focus of the evaluation: (1) What technology related skills do participants in the project already possess? (2) What concerns do participants currently have regarding the integration of technology within the curriculum? (3) How are teachers currently using technology within the classroom? (4) At what Level of Use are participants in their current use of technology and its integration within the curriculum? (5) What technology related skills are students currently acquiring through their teachers' use of technology within the curriculum? and (6) What is the perceived impact of current technology use by teachers on students? Recommendations based on conversations with project participants are also given. (AEF)",

Though applied at the undergraduate level, the framework may be adapted to primary through graduate levels. The course is co-taught by two faculty: one from computer information systems (CIS) and one from marketing. Experimenting, creating, revising, discussing, publishing, and reflecting on works of their own, students are able to understand theory through action and experience the business value of technology through its application. Following discussion of the conceptual foundation, the instructional strategy is outlined, based on  the five instructional principles suggested by Marzano and Reid et al. These include: Motivation: The Engagement Phase; Acquiring and Integrating Knowledge: The Exploration Phase; Extending and Refining Knowledge: The Transformation Phase; Using Knowledge Meaningfully: The Presentation Phase; and Productive Habits of Mind: The Reflection Phase.

Subjects were first-time 9th- and 10th-grade biology students from three public high schools. An evaluative analysis of the CourseInfo software (Blackboard, Inc., 1998) was undertaken, and the tracking capabilities of the CourseInfo software were evaluated through measurement of: number of log-ons to the threaded discussion; number of threaded statements; number of threaded dialogue statements of response to other student statements; and number of threaded dialogue statements of response to teacher statements. Analysis of tracked user movement within the shared Web-based environment was  investigated as one possible model of evaluating learner academic behaviors within, and as a result of, Web-based environments. Results of the study support tracking user movement as an avenue of quantifying the effectiveness of Web-based learning initiatives. (AEF)",

It also examines how teachers themselves comprehend and convey their roles and thus search for a new paradigm of opportunities that encompass these roles. Image is proposed in this study as a construct to understand teachers' particularistic knowledge in the context of teaching with computer technology. This study incorporates the utilization of teachers' metaphors as a tool to investigate teachers' images of computer-assisted instruction. Data were collected in three steps. Teachers were instructed to write down  personally constructed metaphors in the form of explicit metaphorical statements. This was followed by their creation of narratives of selected metaphorical statements. The last step involved the teachers' derivation of metaphors for the statements. Findings indicate that these underlying images are significant and should be embraced by technology trainers and teacher educators to help better prepare teachers for using technology in instruction.

It is a story of the technology, in this case video recording, the theories applied to its educational use, and a specific teacher training method--microteaching. The historical context of microteaching with video recording feedback is presented. The further evolution of this technology in self-reflective methods is explored by considering the combination of inner development of the individual teacher with the outer, critical examination of social contexts of teaching. The final part of the paper constructs a critical framework for utilizing both inner, self-reflective models of video feedback with models of critical video ethnography,  used in overseas educational development work in Africa, that examine situational practice. The paper explores the theory foundation of these models in search of common principles to inform the practical use of video in new models of critical inquiry and reflection in professional development.

If that were the case, there would be room for future studies to determine if \"education economics\" could contribute to the development of better evaluation tools for investments in IT. The first section discusses coincidences and similarities between the benefits from IT and the benefits from formal education, including: IT and  formal education are power decentralization and opportunity democratization factors; IT and education allow/happen in less hierarchical environments; and IT and education are important flexibility factors. Difficulties involving the investment in IT and formal education are addressed in the second section, including: depending on the industry, the impact of the investment may vary greatly; and difficulty in isolating the benefits directly related to the investment in education or in IT from those caused by other factors.

However, the nature of differences and the needs of individuals can slow or, at times, completely stop learning for the rest of the classroom. Teachers are also encouraged to teach higher level thinking skills, although standardized tests are often composed primarily of lower levels of questioning. By taking advantage of new technologies as they become available and combining them with old methods that are effective, teachers can accommodate individual learning differences and help develop higher thinking skills.

The experiences of the Boone Community School District (Iowa) were the focus of the case study, from the formation of a technology planning committee to the implementation of an expanded use of technology in upper-elementary classrooms. Components of the research include document analysis of a district technology plan, interviews with technology plan committee members, fieldwork observations, and interviews with teachers. The study demonstrated that effective technology planning can lead a district through establishment of a technology infrastructure, including a district-wide network, Internet access to all classrooms, and  high quality staff development. Findings suggest that teachers need curriculum integration support, beyond what is often provided in the technology plan, in order to take full advantage of available technology.

Similarly, increasing accountability has placed added pressure on teachers to meet stated objectives and ensure student performance. How can teachers optimize available technologies and related content to support classroom efforts? Effective decisions are based on a clear understanding of the challenge or challenges to be addressed, selection of software based on the identified challenge, dedicated classroom usage, and evaluation and implementation modification as required. The 4DIEM Model supports teachers as they engage in selection of technology-based content. This paper identifies five categories of software and  Internet-based experiences, i.e., tutorial, drill and practice, simulation, productivity (tools), and informational (tools). The following components of the 4DIEM Model are then detailed: (1) describe the objective; (2) determine the type of software; (3) decide on several appropriate software titles; (3) test drive the software; (5) integrate the software into lesson plans; (6) evaluate its effectiveness regularly; and (7) modify use as needed.

This paper describes the development of an assessment system and a World Wide Web-based portfolio system to help students take responsibility for their learning and their competence at three consecutive integrative assessments. The introduction provides background on the EFA and summarizes three ideas that provide the basis for the program: students need to be capable of managing change; students need to be given responsibility; and students have a considerable degree of freedom in filling out the details for their own learning processes. The central concept of meaningful learning is discussed in the second section, including authentic learning in  professional education and the phases of the learning process (i.e., orientation, planning, execution, and evaluation). The third section describes program facilities in relation to these learning processes. The following program facilities are presented in detail in the fourth section: (1) orientation (the role of competency descriptions and moments of integrative assessment); (2) planning (the role of contracts); (3) execution (learning practices and the role of resources and metawork); and (4) evaluation (the role of the portfolio).

Such encounters are very common in traditional learning environments and can be used successfully in social environments in which students can discover and construct knowledge through a process of dialogue, negotiation, or sharing. In the context of these casual encounters, the INCA system was developed which informs the user who accesses a World Wide Web site of the presence of other participants and the messages they have exchanged with each other. The system allows students to interact with other people reading course-related documents within the site at the same time.

The group collaboration process was mediated by information and communication technology, and the work was done on the presumption that each group member had access to his own computer. The groups collaborated through the network by means of a groupware program called TeamWave Workplace, a program that offers the participants a joint workspace and tools that allow users to collaborate, show and exchange files, have common databases, write/draw on the same screen, etc. The  assignment was to create a room in TeamWave Workplace that enables learning of a specific subject.

Many IHEs are grappling with ways to implement and manage online instruction by using local personnel and resources, purchasing some components of management, or outsourcing distance education entirely. While each institution will make decisions that meet its unique needs, it is important to know about the range of possibilities available to university administrators today. The major problems confronting IHEs are twofold: the lack of technical skill among faculty members to convert their courses into online formats; and the need to support and manage distance education.

Content analysis and analysis of emerging themes were used to analyze the data. Themes from the questionnaire were grouped into four categories: class perceptions, technology, self, and professor. Themes that emerged from the journals were  divided into three categories: class, problems, and feelings. The interviews revealed that students come to class with a set of ideas and assumptions that situate them more or less in the constructivist paradigm or in the traditional paradigm.

Distance learning (DL) enables the transfer of knowledge from one place to another. There are different methods of operating DL (videoconference, Internet, satellite), each with its advantages and disadvantages. DL is accepted as an innovation in the field of education and instruction. However, any change in education is only as effective as the ability of the teachers to successfully accommodate the change. This study evaluated the level and quality of the teacher-learner interaction and included three phases: (1) defining the circumstances and situations where the research can be performed; (2) constructing research tools and proving  their reliability and validity; and (3) operating the research--collecting information on the teacher-learner interaction. The first phase examined the connection between the teacher's willingness to adopt innovations and the personality trait of risk-taking. The research sample was made up of 80 teachers. Risk-taking and attitude toward innovation (computer) in education questionnaires were administered. Five different teacher-learner interactions (i.e., social, procedural, expository, explanatory, and cognitive) were defined. The research data was used to construct a matrix for evaluating the teacher-learner interaction. (Contains 26 references.) (MES)",

Concurrently, faculty modeled technology application as a part of the curriculum and helped their students develop lesson plans for K-12 classrooms. The teachers then implemented these lessons and provided online feedback to the  preservice teachers. (MES)",

The courses were taken by 16 post-baccalaureate students during fall semester 1998 and spring semester 1999. The primary goal of the project was to determine whether distance education courses can actually be aligned to pedagogical practices that serve the needs of a rapidly-evolving, technology-assisted, information-driven society. Data were gathered from students and professors, as well as from ExCET test (state licensure exam) results. This paper reports findings regarding student interactions with World Wide Web-based lessons, including learning community discussion via a  threaded message board, posting primary data, posting lesson plans and textbook evaluations, book club discussions, analysis of current issues, and simulation. The outcomes of the case study supported the belief that online courses could be interactive and problem-solving in nature, making use of the student's teaching placement. Consideration of current issues in teacher preparation and access to a laboratory for real-time assignments supported the success of the students in their work environment and on their required exam for certification.

Findings indicated that there is a combined effect of gender, computer literacy course type, whether any computer-related course was taken before, previous computer attitude, and possession of home computer on  student-teachers' post-attitude towards computers. Follow-up study results also supported the results related to student-teachers' perceptions about the computer literacy course they attended. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/MES)",

Online discussion within any learning environment can provide the opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful, content-based conversations about the topic under study, which may result in deeper understanding and greater learning gains. A content analysis of student discussion in listserv-based (electronic-mail) discussion, World Wide Web-based threaded discussion, and chat discussion in an educational technology course at American University (District of Columbia) is presented. Three main research questions guided the study: (1) What type of discussion takes place in each setting? (2) How much discussion takes place in each  setting? and (3) What is the quality of the discussions in each setting? A student survey conducted at the end of the semester assessed the effectiveness of the discussions in terms of understanding and perceptions of course content. Findings indicated that the computer-mediated discussions can be a valuable component to any traditional technology course. (Contains 11 references.) (MES)",

        "description":"This paper describes the basic knowledge necessary to promote the students' ability to analyze, design, and construct information systems. The curricula and the practical teaching material are proposed with which students can experience information system development by applying the basic knowledge of lectures. The subjects of the basic knowledge are programming, software design, information system development, database, and network. Retail management is taken up as one of the practical teaching materials for students to learn the relationship between basic subjects; students study the requirements of a wholesale shop and design a new system. Until now, students have stayed within the fragmentary knowledge of lectures. Yet, with this teaching material, they can acquire practical  ability doing concrete analysis, design, and construction.

        "description":"The design of teacher education programs, including the preparation of teachers for working with information and communication technology (ICT), requires balancing of multiple considerations. Attention should be given to characteristics of students, requirements of education authorities and prospective employers, broader community aspirations, and local institutional imperatives, including university policies and resource constraints. The process of preparing for the re-accreditation of teacher preparation programs at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) provided an opportunity for review of the provisions for teaching and learning about ICT in the light of a changing policy environment for education. This paper describes how the existing degree program incorporates  learning about ICT and discusses some adjustments being proposed to ensure that the revised program may better meet the needs of graduating teachers in the new millennium. The first section discusses the policy environment for ICT in teacher education, including mandated standards. Existing provision of ICT in teacher education at USQ is described in the second section, including three program elements (i.e., the core curriculum, optional minor study, and integration of ICT into general studies in education) and program deficiencies. The third section addresses integrating ICT in a revised teacher education program, including modeling the integration of ICT and facility needs. Contains 12 references. (MES)",

Realizing the vision of the ministry, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia's teacher education curriculum was reinvented. New, efficient, and cost-effective learning methods were used to supplement conventional teaching methods. Computer-based learning (CBL) materials were used because many research studies that looked into the effectiveness of CBL on adult learning about information technology have proven to be successful. Based on this observation, the possibility of improving Malaysian adult teachers'  knowledge of and attitude to IT in education by giving them access to a flexible and user-friendly interactive multimedia courseware package, Computer-based Educational Resource and Development in Information Technology (CERDIk IT), is examined.

In six undergraduate and four graduate teacher-education technology classes, students designed multimedia courseware using HyperStudio/ToolBook with three different storyboarding methods--index cards, paper forms, and PowerPoint. The evaluation scores on four criteria--screen display, interaction possibilities, orientation, and navigation--were compared. Repeated measures were used for data analysis. Differences were found among the groups with different storyboarding methods. It was concluded that, for both undergraduate and graduate teacher education students, using PowerPoint as the storyboarding tool will produce better design in a multimedia  application. Screen display, interaction, orientation, and navigation designs were significantly higher using PowerPoint than for the designs using index cards or paper forms. Contains 10 references. (MES)",

        "description":"This paper describes an alternative approach to traditional instructional design models by suggesting that participatory communication theory (PCT) creates a process that values the learner's voice. As a student develops a critical awareness of his or her environment, participatory media becomes a catalyst for cognition. Learners use media tools to influence their own lives. PCT suggests that learning is political as well as psychological and that dignity is a fundamental component of learning. The paper first defines participatory communication and its theoretical constructs. Second, an explanation of how it works is given. Third, several examples of participatory communication projects are presented. Fourth, a rationale for employing PCT is suggested, a rationale anchored in  self-efficacy research as well as socio-constructivist approaches to learning theory. Finally, the paper explores the uses and ramifications of PCT in an instructional design model. Contains 15 references. (MES)",

        "description":"Teachers have acknowledged the richer learning environment and interactivity of multimedia teaching, its flexibility to different learning styles, and learner control that allows the learner to fully engage in the learning process. However, they still have problems in courseware design because their work is mainly centered on exercises and not on what the machine can do best. This is why a new audio segmenting device, called Virtual Recorder, has been derived from the LAVAC (Laboratoire Audio-Visuel Actif-Comparatif) toolkit to allow them to use videos. The video sequencer can complete real-time automatic segmenting of sound and images and automatically insert an answering time span after each sequence. Coupled to IBM ViaVoice, the teacher can speak during this time span to  create the transcript from which the necessary textual help will be derived for easier aural comprehension. A 5-minute video requires no more than a few minutes' work from the teacher to produce a 2-hour student session.  (Author/MES)",

Three most basic considerations are content knowledge, pedagogical skill, and higher-order thinking dispositions. Transferring content to an online environment requires technological expertise, and facilitating growth in a student's knowledge base through interaction of literacies requires mindfulness. The workshop is intended for teachers of adult learners who are truly concerned with building thinking persons. The following principles of best practice learning are summarized: student-centered; experiential; holistic; authentic; expressive; reflective; social; collaborative; democratic; cognitive; developmental; constructivist; and challenging. A  model to guide teachers in designing online courses to increase learning through improved teaching is presented. (MES)",

Those tools support, extend, and strengthen the establishment of teacher learning communities and their collaborative inquiries. Those inquires are part of larger design experiments aiming at studying teacher learning when deep understanding is the goal of the knowledge-building activities that pre-service, in-service, and teacher education educators engage in. The objectives of the paper are: to described the online information and communication practices of teacher learning communities that are emerging at two of the TL-NCE (TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence) sites at  McGill University (Quebec) and Laval University (Quebec); and to point to the early converging results of collaborative inquiries that have been carried out into both Anglophone and Francophone networked classrooms. The practices at the TL-NCE sites illustrate the transformative processes underway in teacher education when collaborative use of information and communication technology is made in networked classrooms.

The authors have developed on a DVD (Digital Video Disc) a prototype of counseling materials to assist both in the training of college students and in-service teachers learning counseling skills. Multi-angle scenes depicting client, counselor, and complete classroom views were made of three counseling cases. The teachers, by using these DVD materials in training, can observe and analyze counseling sessions from a multilateral perspective by using the multi-video function to select and observe three-angle sequence, the multi-audio function to select and hear  comments by expert supervisors, and the subtitle function to show aims and technique of each counselor during each counseling session. Evaluation results showed that this was an effective approach for learning counseling skills with the use of DVD-video. Contains 10 references. (Author/MES)",

Research will use data collected through students' e-mail assignments and projects collected. E-mail submissions will be classified into one of the following categories to determine the kind of suggestion: graphic design issues; usability/navigation; and functionality. In addition, the study will track changes to students' multimedia projects so that copies of the projects at various stages of  development will be retained.

Developed in 1997 by the Science Libraries at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), DBA is a Web-based front-end to bibliographic and full-text databases to which UCSD has remote access. DBA allows the user to specify terms, then automatically performs a keyword search of all profiled databases. When teachers, students, or library staff begin a research project, it is not always obvious which database would be the best resource to locate information on a topic. As K-12 schools rely more and more on databases via the Internet, a search tool such as DBA will be essential. This paper provides a description of how DBA works, the equipment  and resources necessary to implement it, where to get the source code, and why K-12 schools should consider the product. (MES)",

Limitations arise from using a closed network; factors such as cost to establish and operate the network with video compression or satellite technology can potentially affect programming. Desktop video conferencing is an alternative to expensive and site-restricted technologies. This paper reviews the process that is involved in selecting desktop video conferencing as the &quot;next generation&quot; distance learning technology. In addition, the paper discusses the creation of a multi-site desktop video conferencing network designed to serve central Louisiana and provide an array of program possibilities including  courses for credit, teacher, certification, and training to participating sites. The desktop video conferencing system at Northwestern State University (Louisiana) is highlighted. (Contains 13 references.) (Author/MES)",

Data were collected through structured interviews, group discussions, and participant observation. The findings indicate that instructional adequacy is the most important criterion both from the theoretical and from the practical perspective; a second factor mentioned was that effective instructional software should include real-life examples and simulations of abstract concepts. Criteria considered as having secondary importance were the variety and number of exercises, the aspect of developing students'  creativity and critical thinking capacity, presentation of accurate information, being free from scientific errors, individualizing learning, being in accordance with the pedagogical level of students, and being enriched through the use of a variety of sound effects, images, videos, and animations.

Information on personality type, age, gender, grade level, years of teaching, computer experience, and self-reported skill levels was collected from 123 teachers participating in a federally funded teacher training grant. This information was correlated with four constructs concerning teacher perceptions of the multimedia development process: teachers' perceptions of the individual stages of multimedia development, based on their development of multimedia projects within teams; teachers' perceptions of the individual stages of multimedia development, based on the  integration of self-authored multimedia into their classrooms for student-created projects; teachers' attitudes toward the cooperative activities required by the grant; and teacher attitudes toward integrating self-authored multimedia into their curricula. Analysis found few significant correlations between the attitude constructs and teacher characteristics. Only self-reported skill levels were consistently and positively correlated with teacher attitudes toward multimedia development. The conclusion is drawn that confidence in one's ability to utilize the software and hardware necessary to create self-authored multimedia projects is the primary factor in predicting attitudes and perceptions of multimedia development. It is suggested that such confidence can be fostered by proper  training. (Contains 15 references.) (MES)",

        "description":"This study investigated student teachers' perception and practice regarding computer use during the practicum in terms of their teaching styles. The following questions were investigated: (1) What are the student teachers' perceptions of the teachers' role in the classroom with computers, measured in terms of teacher-centeredness and student-centeredness? (2) How did the student teachers use the computer during their practicum, measured as teacher-centered computer use and student-centered computer use? and (3) Are there any differences between the student teachers' perceptions of the teachers' role and their practice of computer use during the practicum? The results of the study showed that there was no significant difference between student teachers' perceptions of  teacher-centered roles and their perceptions of student-centered roles teaching in the classroom with computers. The student teachers indicated that they would engage teacher-centered activities and student-centered activities on an equal basis while teaching in classrooms with computers. Nevertheless, results showed that there was a significant difference between the student teachers' teacher-centered computer use and their student-centered computer use during the practicum. The student teachers used the computer significantly more as a teacher-centered tool than as a student-centered tool. (Contains 21 references.) (MES)",

        "description":"This paper examines why the number of high school mathematics teachers who integrate computers into their math classes remains relatively low by analyzing the attitudes of prospective high school mathematics teachers. Data were gathered from written questionnaires and class discussions of four classes of prospective high school mathematics teachers in a course on integrating computers in the teaching of mathematics. Analysis of pro and con arguments about integrating computer activities in their future teaching of mathematics revealed a two-dimensional theoretical framework of cognitive, affective, and social factors according to the five categories that represent the class's components; i.e., the learners, the teacher, the learning material, the class atmosphere, and the  learning environment. The paper briefly explains what each category means and presents pro and con arguments in each category as presented by the prospective teachers. (MES)",

A purposive sampling technique was used to select the school and the teachers involved in the study. A constructivist approach was used to understand the perceptions of the teachers about computers and computer-related applications in their classrooms. All participants were interviewed about their perceptions of computers and were observed using them in their classrooms. Kvale's six steps of analysis method was used for the interview analysis. The data revealed an overlying theme of using computers as tools for different purposes. Computers are perceived as teaching tools, classroom management  tools, and communicative tools.

Case study data from exemplary technology integrators, representing various levels of teaching and technology-use ability, led to the formulation of five assertions about ways these teachers taught with technology: (1) the ways technology was used determined the teachers' personal definitions of technology integration; (2) teachers at the lower levels of either technology use or teaching ability altered their planning habits when planning for technology inclusion; (3) teachers taught with and about technology according to their own personal learning strategies; (4) teachers' individual definitions of technology integration directed  their management of student computer use; and (5) teachers at the lower levels of either technology-use or teaching ability altered their perspective on assessment when assessing student use of technology. Differences observed among technology-use practices were associated with individual levels of teaching expertise.

In their investigation, students were engaged in activities such as data search, data sorting, making inquiries, project writing, and construction of a new computerized database related to the subjects of their investigations. Students were encouraged to write personal reflection notes after each session throughout the five-month period of their work. Studying these reflections improves understanding of the way students think about themselves as learners, about the task's demands, and about strategies that are needed to deal with the demands. A tool for analyzing the reflections based on Flavell's metacognitive components is proposed. Replicas are analyzed according to 18  dimensions. This tool enables comparison of different patterns of reflections among students, as well as detection of dominant dimensions within the student's own protocols of reflection.

Pre- and post-survey instruments were given to course participants, measuring personal confidence (22 items) and instructional confidence (21 items) using technology. A modified version of an instrument developed by Dawson (1998) was used to gather data. Factor analyses were performed to group items into like factors, followed by repeated measure analysis  of variance to test for significant differences. Results indicate that students' confidence levels significantly increased, across all factors, as a result of taking the course.

An earlier study identified three main obstacles that could have limited ICT uptake by student teachers in 1996/97: student access to computers; the ICT policy adopted by initial teacher training providers; and the lack of encouragement for students to use ICT in teaching practice. This paper presents a comparative study of the ICT competence and attitudes of a similar cohort of student teachers in the 1999/2000 academic year, attending a one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Education course to teach in United Kingdom secondary schools. It argues that, while the overall sample of 1999/2000  student teachers appeared to be more competent and confident in the use of ICT than in 1996/97, female and younger students lagged behind their male and older peers. This issue needs to be addressed in the ICT policy adopted by initial teacher training providers. (Contains 31 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"This paper is a report on findings of a study conducted with the purpose of assessing the level of technology skills of graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in the teacher education program at Eastern Kentucky University. The study revealed both strengths and weaknesses in relation to a new technology standard for teachers recently adopted by the state of Kentucky. A survey focusing on computer skills needed by adult users of computer hardware and software was administered to three cohorts of undergraduate students: (1) all students enrolled in the first course in the language arts sequence for elementary and middle grade majors; (2) all students enrolled in the elementary blocked methods classes; and (3) all students enrolled in middle grades methods classes. Marked  differences were found among the three groups. These differences were analyzed and used as a basis for recommended changes in the teacher education program. (MES)",

(2) How can preservice teachers be engaged in the process of teacher reflection? (3) How can this case study be made different from a video by exploiting the use of multimedia? (4) How can preservice teachers be engaged in the mathematics of the lesson and encourage them to anticipate possible student strategies? (5) How can instructors be supported who are planning to use the CD-ROM in their classrooms? and (6) What technological  boundaries will need to be overcome? The design goal of the project was to create a means for helping preservice teachers observe the complexity of the teaching and learning process through the use of innovative multimedia tools. The research goal was to document how the different versions of the case have been implemented in various teacher preparation courses and then report which features of the case were found to be consistently efficacious in supporting the teacher educators' curricular goals.

Studies indicate that CBI can have promising results, but they do not provide insights into the theoretical justification for using CBI. An earlier paper (Risko and Kinzer, 1994) identified five theoretical constructs for CBI: anchored instruction; reflective thinking; situated cognition; generative learning; and the ability that CBI has to prepare teachers to deal with the ill-structured nature of teaching. This research project studied the nature of these theories in a 16-week literacy course for preservice elementary education majors that used CBI in order to extend the theories themselves and reconsider their viability for CBI. Data included information about classroom interactions, the instructor's  reflections about class activities, the instructor's reflections about the theories, students' answers to study guides as they analyzed the cases, videotapes of each class session, students' lesson plans and reflections from their concurrent field experiences, and audiotapes and notes from individual interviews with each student at the end of the semester.

During 1998, the need to introduce elements of flexibility in this course was identified. As a result, a virtual classroom was used as a communal resource base and a construction site where learners collaborate. To date, two cycles of this project have been executed. The new Web-based approach to the course has led to substantial improvements in teaching practice. Furthermore, benefits have emerged well beyond the original aims of the project--the process that was set in motion at fourth-year level has begun to transform the broader curriculum. This paper reflects on the first two cycles of an action  research project. It deals with the impact of the World Wide Web on a traditional curriculum. Changing teaching and learning methodologies are discussed. (Contains 16 references.) (Author/MES)",

A level of technological proficiency was determined for each school that participated in the research through the use of a series of surveys, teacher interviews, and observation. Once a level of proficiency was determined for each case, specific strategies used at each school to promote technology integration were evaluated. Data collected and analyzed for each case indicated that strategies for strong technology integration must address three specific areas: the school's vision of integration; the leadership at each school; and the training method used for staff development. Results indicate that public schools that addressed all three areas adequately were  able to achieve a higher level of technology integration, with improved acceptance and attitudes towards technology in everyday use by both teachers and students.

It is based on a number of new theories, including activity and systems theory, and upon previous evaluations of large scale educational technology programs by RMC Research Corporation, notably the Boulder Valley Internet Project. The paper presents the Integrated Technology Adoption and Diffusion Model, describing a learning/adoption trajectory, i.e., a cyclical process in which teachers evolve from learners (teacher-trainees), to adopters of educational technology, to co-learners/co-explorers with their students in the classroom, and, finally, to a reaffirmation/refection decision. The evolution of the model to  include a fifth stage, i.e., teacher as leader, is described. (Contains 14 references.) (MES)",

In this ethnographic study, new models for support were developed by examining support for technology and the use of technology in three third and fourth grade classes. Data were collected through teacher interviews, informal conversations, observations of classes, and observations of meetings. The multiple observations of students giving support were analyzed, and the following categories emerged: playing; sharing; reading; small help; becoming expert; teaching; and other. Reading, small help, and teaching involved direct support from a student to either a student or a teacher. Sharing and becoming expert involved indirect support that students give. Playing included times that the  students offered support in order to play. (MES)",

The project's overarching goal is to build the capacity of individuals and institutional structures to support the infusion of technology throughout the UNLV's (University of Nevada, Las Vegas's) teacher preparation program. This will be done through: (1) a series of inservice workshops for university faculty, administrators, field supervisors and mentor teachers; (2) one-on-one follow-up support provided by project staff and advanced undergraduate students; (3) a mini-grant program in collaboration with the UNLV's Teaching and Learning Center to  support the development of technology-based modules for teacher education courses; and (4) expanded opportunities for students to apply technology in their courses and field experiences. Overall, Project THREAD seeks to implement a systematic planning model and move from &quot;pockets&quot; of technology integration toward widespread infusion throughout UNLV's teacher preparation program.

Several ongoing projects are described that include the development of discipline specific technology courses, collaborative projects involving students and faculty, and technology projects in elementary education content courses. Challenges of technology diffusion are discussed related to guaranteeing basic computer skills for preservice teachers, supporting faculty technology integration, and the  comprehensive nature of the program.

Experienced teachers team with a small number of less-experienced teachers to form a partnership. The partnership plans a project that the teachers will execute together in all the partners' classrooms. The partnership submits a project proposal to Challenge 2000, and approved proposals are eligible for equipment and software grants and stipends. The partnership model was evaluated using four data sources: a survey of participating teachers; observation of partnership meetings; teacher interviews; and classroom observations. There were three sets of findings. The first set indicated that the  model was successful in helping teachers develop in their capacity to use technology and more generally as teachers; evaluation data showed that the model is effective in building technology, pedagogy, and leadership skills and collaboration practices that support teacher learning. The second set provided insight into the aspects of the model that were crucial to its success, including: the application process; focus on a project; self-selected, voluntary, local partners; flexibility; and multimedia fairs. The third set related to connections between the partnership model and other kinds of teacher professional development and support. (MES)",

This framework integrates content, context, and technology with primary documents for the &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot; Civil War Web site. Data were collected through interviews with selected students and the teacher, the students' and teacher's reflective journals, student reports, in-class observation supported by research notes, and evidence of participation in activities. An emergent design was used to analyze the observational and reflective journal data. Findings indicate that students were highly engaged in the activity and obtained a deeper understanding of American Civil War history though a designed reading, writing, and concept mapping  instructional activity.

The online or print-based Web site evaluation standards published by educators for students and other educators are found to be most useful to meeting the need of guidance for K-12 teachers in selecting quality Web sites for their students. A good educational Web site needs to consider not only the format (e.g., user friendly, aesthetically courteous, and aesthetically appealing), the content (e.g., credible, useful, rich, and interdisciplinary), but also the learning process (e.g., higher-order thinking, engaging, and multiple intelligences or talents).

It is a follow-up study, seven years after the original year-long 1993 investigation (Goss, 1995) of Internet use in K-12 schools and regional support centers. In the 1993 study of turn-key users of the Internet, six key factors emerged that determined the success of their scale-up efforts: access, skill building, ongoing support, equity, time, and costs. This follow-up study revisits those early Internet adopters. Participants responded to an online survey that addressed current use, intended use this year, linkage/relevance at site, internal support, and external support. Through analysis of survey and interview data, the study sheds  additional light on earlier findings, while illuminating the successes of those with broad-based administrative support and a thoughtful technology dissemination plan. Benchmarks of successful turn-key technology integration are presented. (Contains 10 references.) (MES)",

The main objective is to show that there is not a single angle from which to examine the issue. There must also be, as a starting point, the assumption that to deal with the new configuration of the world and the relations established by and under its mainstreams is to deal with the existence of human beings from an ontological point of view. In this sense, the paper argues for the imperative necessity of a philosophical approach in discussing the ways the contemporary world has brought knowledge to bear. (Author/MES)",

        "description":"Interaction and collaboration have been identified as desirable components of an effective learning environment; however, it is not clear from research how they improve the quality of learning in a distance education setting. While studies have addressed the types of technologies that impact on collaborative interactivity, little has been written about other drivers and their influence on ensuring successful student learning. The following drivers of collaborative interactivity are described: assessment; student characteristics; technology confidence and prior knowledge; role of the instructor; and interpersonal knowledge. A tentative model for conceptualizing these drivers is proposed. The model in the shape of a pyramid describes a progression of improved learning outcomes made  possible by technology-mediated interaction. This paper examines whether such a model can support an investigation on effective collaborative interactivity resulting in successful student learning. A research program at the University of South Australia that will examine the impact of these drivers on various levels of interaction under the pyramid model is described. (Contains 34 references.)

The focus was on identifying functions on the sites that students perceived as supporting and fostering their learning experiences. Subjects were 142 students responding to a 60-item questionnaire and open-ended questions. Findings indicated an overall positive perception of the quality and usefulness of the course Web sites. On average per typical semester week, 64 minutes were spent on conducting searches on the Web, 40 minutes on downloading and printing material, and 34 minutes on communicating with faculty and teaching assistants. Highest ratings of instructional quality were on the visual appeal and readability of sites and the importance of the  material on the site. Lowest were on the clarity and purposeful introductions to each segment on the site, clarity of the connection of each new section on the site with course objectives, and general taste in color of the pages. Highest ratings for perceived usefulness were on the use of visuals to recall or present new information and the opportunity to ask questions online. Lowest were the use of links to review/recall prerequisite material and instruction on how to navigate the site. Greatest barriers to use were access to computers and to Web site addresses, perceived in adequacy of their Internet skills, motivation to use the site, and time constraints. Greatest facilitators of use were guidance, quality of content, availability of material, access to material, faculty, peers,  teaching assistants, experts, and ease of communication. Overall impact of course Web sites was time saving qualities, 24-hour accessibility to resources, facilitating preparation for class, and increased understanding of class expectations and objectives. There appeared to be a negative relationship between residential distance from campus and perceived usefulness of sites and a possible relationship between courses and students' perceived instructional quality on functions related to clarity of purpose and objectives. Also, there appeared to be a general lack of motivation to use the sites, possibly due to their lack of mandatory use and what students reported as a lack of incentive to use them for specific course requirements.

        "description":"Change efforts should be guided with a systemic understanding of the context in which they are undertaken. Depending on the circumstance, or as the implementation effort progresses, it may be most effective to focus interventions on a particular component of the framework at a time. This ERIC digest presents a sequence for approaching the major perspectives, or &quot;models,&quot; of educational change in the research. Anyone trying to improve schools may look to &quot;The New Meaning of Educational Change&quot; (Fullan and Stiegelbauer, 1991) to decide where to start. From there, &quot;Systemic Change in Education&quot; (Reigeluth and Garfinkle, 1994) can be read to consider the system being changed. Once the change process has begun, &quot;The Change Agent's Guide&quot; (Havelock and Zlotolow, 1995) can be read for  discussion of how to guide and plan future efforts. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (Hall and Hord, 1987) provides tools to &quot;keep a finger on the pulse&quot; of change and to collect the information needed. &quot;Strategies for Planned Change&quot; (Zaltman and Duncan, 1977) can help narrow down the cause(s) of resistance to change efforts. &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot; (Rogers, 1995) identifies the most influential attributes of an innovation, and the &quot;Conditions for Change&quot; (Ely, 1990) can help address obstacles that arise from the environment in which change is implemented.

This report draws on that survey to describe teachers' use of education technology in their classrooms and schools, availability of this technology, their training and preparation for their use, and barriers to technology use they encounter. Additional data sources are used throughout the report to provide background information on these topics. Findings indicate that about half of the teachers with computers available in their schools used them for classroom instruction. Teachers' use of technology was related to their training and preparation and work environments. Teachers were more likely to use  these technologies when the technologies were available to them, available in their classrooms as opposed to computer labs, and available in great numbers. Teachers who reported feeling better prepared were more likely to use these technologies than their less prepared colleagues. (Teachers who spent more time in professional development reported feeling better prepared than their colleagues.) Teachers who perceived that lacking computers and time for students to use computers as great barriers were less likely than their colleagues to assign students to use computers or the Internet for some instructional activities. Appendices include standard error tables for text tables and figures, survey methodology and data reliability, and the survey questionnaire. (AEF)",

        "description":"The second of the Pew Symposia in Learning and Technology, whose purpose is to conduct an ongoing national conversation about issues related to the intersection of learning and technology, focused on policy issues related to the development and ownership of online courses and course materials. This paper builds on the work of participants, and captures the discussion and general conclusions. First presented as adaptations are each of the four cases examined at the Symposium to raise awareness of the issues and to stimulate discussion. The Arthur Miller case and the Unext.com case represent two sides of the same issue: the transfer of intellectual property from individual faculty members to organizations other than the home institution. The CaseNET case and the Math Emporium case  represent two approaches to the commercialization of technology-mediated materials and methodologies. Following these cases, the paper discusses the context of online courses and course materials, and examines the two scenarios that are contributing to the state of anxiety in higher education. Discussion then moves to the law and why there is a lack of clarity when it comes to ownership of course materials. The paper concludes by exploring what kind of policy is needed. (AEF)",

That is why Congress established the Web-based Education Commission that for the past year has been chairing an effort exploring ways in which the Internet is changing the delivery of education. This report reflects the cumulative work of the Commission and a consensus of its findings. The Commission was able to identify the key barriers that are preventing the Internet from realizing its full potential for enhancing learning. Based on findings, the Commission issues a call to action in this report to: make powerful new Internet resources, especially broadband access, widely and equitably available and  affordable for all learners; provide continuous and relevant training and support for educators and administrators; build a new research framework of how people learn in the Internet age; develop high quality online educational content that meets the highest standards of educational excellence; revise outdated regulations that impede innovation and replace them with approaches that embrace anytime, anywhere, any pace learning; protect online learners and ensure their privacy; and sustain funding via traditional and new sources that is adequate to the challenge at hand. The report is divided into three main sections: &quot;The Power of the Internet for Learning,&quot;&quot;Seizing the Opportunity,&quot; and &quot;Moving from Promise to Practice: A Call to Action.&quot; The second section is further divided according  to the following: &quot;Access to Broadband Technologies: Bridges Across the Digital Divide&quot;; &quot;Professional Development: How Technology Can Enhance Teaching&quot;; &quot;Correcting a Paucity of Research and Development&quot;; &quot;Compelling Online Content&quot;; &quot;Removing Regulatory Restrictions to E-Learning&quot;; and &quot;Privacy, Protection, and 'Safe Streets.'&quot;; and &quot;Funding for e-Learning: A Continuing Challenge&quot;.

Statewide annual growth and openings are expected to be the greatest in service occupations, especially those requiring short-term on-the-job training. A large number of vacancies is also expected for occupations relating to general office support positions. Computer related occupations are also predicted to have large vacancies. Childcare workers and elementary school teacher vacancies are also expected to be high. The  majority of the top 25 industries in Adams County are trade or service related. Many of the top 25 industries in Boulder County are also related to trade and service. The Denver workforce is employed in a very diverse service industry. In addition to transportation, retail and lodging/food services, Denver's economy is also supported by biotechnology and other high technology industries. The service and mining industries are well-represented in Jefferson County's economy. Larimer County has a economy that emphasizes service and manufacturing.

In the September 1995 issue, faculty members explore sensitive faculty issues: Is tenure's time up? When will part-time faculty finally receive the respect they deserve? Should the 175-day academic calendar be killed? In the November/December 1995 issue, faculty members, fundamentalists, state government, and Assembly member John Vasconcellos voice their vision for the community colleges' future. The February 1996 issue explores &quot;Tidal Wave II,&quot; a term coined by the authors of a report from the California Higher Education Policy center for referring to the new students who will flood higher education in the  next decade. FACCTS looks at who they are, their attitudes, the job market they are entering, and their vision of the future, in their own words. The May 1996 issue includes stories of some of the keynote speakers and recipients of the 1996 FACCC Awards at the 1996 FACCC Conference. A few statistics about faculty members at the state's community colleges are followed by a wide range of faculty issues. Each issue of the Journal also contains various features such as letters to the Editor, Legislative Report, FACCCTS Survey, and Book Review. (JA)",

        "description":"The paper discusses some policy issues facing community colleges in the 21st century: remedial education, K-16 initiatives, and workforce preparation. Identifying social needs and then determining appropriate policies to address them happens within an historical and cultural context. Within our capitalistic and democratic society, four cultural or social values dominate in determining educational policy: choice, quality, efficiency, and equity. Realizing that these values sometimes conflict with one another will help community college leaders better understand why some policies arouse so much controversy. The provision of remedial education at the college level results from the two social values of equity (access) and quality (excellence), two values that are often seen as\"mutually exclusive.\" Policies regarding K-16 initiatives reflect the cultural values of efficiency (easing the transition from high school to college and quality concerns over the rigor of dual enrollment courses). The primary social value behind legislation that allows for two-year colleges to be providers of short-term workforce training designed to result in a job is efficiency or the desire to \"reduce duplication and expenditures for operating workforce development programs and services.\" As much as this kind of legislation benefits two-year colleges financially, there is some risk that the legislation will indirectly lead to an undermining of the community college's transfer mission because of a preponderance of short-term training programs.

        "description":"The paper addresses the impact of welfare reform on the community college and discusses how community colleges are responding to this important social and economic issue. One of the main tenants of the 1996 Welfare Reform Bill is to shift the responsibility for welfare to the states, requiring that half of all able-bodied recipients find work by the year 2002. Many have looked to the community colleges for answers. Dakota County Technical College in Minnesota, in conjunction with federal and state agencies, local industries, and Minnesota colleges and universities, received a grant to improve the skills of those current workers whose training has become obsolete and to develop lifelong learning techniques among the workers. These improvements will not only improve the wages of  the workers and promote retention, but will ensure that the workers have the basic skills necessary to adapt if the job landscape shifts. Some experts note several barriers that have impacted the transition of welfare-to-work programs: problems with transportation; the lack of child-care; problems of alcohol and drug abuse; and the elevated prevalence of learning disabilities in these populations. Information sharing will help community colleges with novice programs learn from the experiences of other colleges. (JA)",

By 1970, Rhode Island Junior College was the fastest growing college in the state and the largest junior college in New England, with an enrollment of 3,577. For the fall 1999 semester, students in the under-20 age group accounted for 20 percent of the headcount enrollment. Of this age group, 69 percent were full-time students. Since the peak year of 1992 (1,260 transfers), transfers to other colleges in Rhode Island  decreased by 142 students or 11 percent. In the fall of 1999, there were 284 continuing, full-time faculty members at the college. For this group, the most common set of characteristics was holding a master's degree, being a full professor, and having been with the college for 15 or more years. The expenditure of the general education funds are classified according to the following five categories: personnel services, operating expenditures, student aid, capital, and other. (JA)",

Statistics imply an employment demand for six AMT graduates to fill  six additional entry-level positions, with perhaps another 22 openings for grads as a result of entry-level workers moving up to fill 22 additional journeyman positions. Within 12 months, respondents expected to hire 19 new entry-level employees. Respondents rated &quot;Good Work Attitude and Good Work Habits&quot; as important work skills. &quot;Team Player&quot; and &quot;Basic Mechanical Skills&quot; were also rated consistently high.

The researcher designed computer-based simulation/gaming instruction that aimed to increase motivation, attention, and retention of learning. Data were used from course grade-point averages, final-examination scores, and attitude surveys to evaluate results from the practicum solution. Two computer-based instructional aids were designed and developed: (1) an interactive wall-section game; and (2) an interactive delivery-truck and storage-building game. The study designed the wall-section game to help students learn 34  construction-terminology phrases that were basic to architectural technology. The truck and storage game was designed to help students learn the rules for organizing construction components into 16 industry-standard categories. Students used the two programs over an eight-month academic year in two different courses. An analysis of data revealed that the practicum solution achieved two outcomes. Two of the nine successful outcomes measured student satisfaction with learning and final examination grades. The student attitude survey used in this study is at the end of this monograph.

        "description":"The paper examines an assessment method for measuring students' writing performance. Does Primary Trait Scoring reliably and validly accomplish the administrative, instructional, and evaluative purposes of the writing assessment? The Primary Trait Scoring guide has a few underlying principles: identification of qualities of effective writing; formulation of different criteria for different tasks; recognition of variables that affect students' writing; and examination of students' performance on a variety of writing tasks/use of multiple samples. Primary Trait Scoring is based on the idea that different modes of discourse place different demands on the writer in terms of audience and purpose. Its focused nature means that scorings can be replicated quite closely, and this approach  can provide diagnostic information not available with the other scoring guides. The major drawback to this system is that papers are scored for one specific primary trait although the guide may have secondary traits. If a school district seeks in-depth data about students' performance in a specific discourse, then Primary Trait Scoring is valuable. If, on the other hand, broader information is sought, then Primary Trait Scoring would not be appropriate unless provisions were made for evaluating secondary traits as well.

To help students acquire a sense of recognition by their instructor, a personal note from the instructor acknowledging a student's improvement or expressing concern about a student's lack of progress can be attached to a returned test or paper. The sense of connection between individual students is also important. For classroom projects involving small groups, the instructor can post \"project partners\" on a Web site and assign specific topics for each group to explore. Online courses work particularly well with partners or groups. Digital cameras offer another medium for interaction in online classes. Photos of individual  students can be included on the Web page for that class, and during the semester, students can put a \"face\" to an e-mail address. Finally, chat rooms offer students an opportunity to engage in relevant discussions with classmates. They can be incorporated in the requirements for a conventional class as a means of fostering open communication among students and instructors. Chat rooms also offer the closest approximation to a conventional classroom discussion for students in online courses. (JA)",

Most interviewees reported that they commenced their studies at a community college with the intention to transfer to a university. Respondents gave a number of reasons for commencing their postsecondary studies at a community college first and then transferring to university, rather than entering university directly. Students were usually very attentive to the question of  transferability. For the majority of students interviewed, the mechanics of the transfer process did not present an overwhelming source of distress. Of all the issues associated with transfer, the decline in grade point average after transfer was the most significant and the one that consistently caused students the most anxiety. The key disadvantages involved adapting to two different institutions and the extra demands placed on transfer students that were not expected of students who commenced their studies at the university. The report concludes with a list of recommendations for improving the transfer process. The report also includes interview questions used in the study, tables of sample bias, and the interview coding scheme in the appendices. (Contains 18 references.)  (VWC)",

        "description":"The report shows how Simon Fraser University (SFU), Canada, evaluated transfer credit for those students who transferred from colleges or university colleges in British Columbia in 1998. Transcript analysis of approximately 400 students revealed that they successfully transferred 85.2% of the credits they earned at college. On average, 8.3 earned college credits per student did not transfer to SFU. The primary reason for loss of credit on transfer was that the course did not appear to be a university level course or its content was clearly technical or vocational in nature. Other reasons were that the students had already transferred the maximum allowable credit, so some credits were superfluous. Some SFU courses were weighted with fewer credits than the equivalent college  course, some courses were unarticulated for reasons that are unclear and some courses do not receive transfer credit if taken on their own, but must be taken in combination with other courses to receive transfer credit. The vast majority of students who choose to take courses that will not transfer to their intended university do so with full knowledge of this fact. (Contains one appendix.) (JA)",

Included in these transfers were 237 students who transferred to SFU with a BC associate degree. In all courses reported, the average grade received by all BC college transfers was consistently lower than the grade received by BC grade 12s, except in some education courses. When looking only at those who transferred 55 or more credits to SFU, the BC college transfer students had a higher graduation rate (60%) than  the BC associate degree transfers (54%). The top three programs from which transfer students graduate are business administration, psychology, and economics. Over the five-year period, 1,251 students were admitted to SFU under other bases of admission, such as BC grade 12, mature student, special entry, university transfer, etc. The majority of students with college experience came to SFU from lower mainland colleges (80%).

Not only is the subject matter unique and relative to the needs of the audience, but also the manner in which the subject matter is presented is a revolutionary idea. The TL2C2 cohort breaks away from the linear curriculum to a more integrated curriculum. This offers students exposure to the wide variety of related course subject matter simultaneously, helping to put the individual subject matters into a broad, realistic perspective. Combined with a student-selected specific topic of interest, termed a &quot;local initiative,&quot; this program offers a true value-added educational  experience relevant to the realities of current and future work environments. This paper discusses the background of TL2C2, the hypotheses which led to the potential development of the course and a brief overall description of the program, the needs of community college faculty identified through focus group studies, the program mission, how integrated curriculum exemplifies learning principles, other program strengths, how cohort members appreciate program uniqueness, local initiatives, and the future of the program and implications for using the integrated curriculum as a model for other programs.

As one of a series of plans that interrelate and establish a vision for the Colorado Community College and Occupational Education System (CCCOES), this plan is driven by the Board's Cornerstones. To ensure effectiveness, this plan and those eligible recipients receiving resources under this plan must adhere to the Cornerstones which mark the CCCOES: Accessibility, Learning and Learning-Centered, Community Connectedness, and Market Alignment. This report contains the following sections: Introduction to the Plan, which  includes an overview and a discussion of the system cornerstones, regional work teams, and research; Planning, Coordination, and Collaboration, which includes information on public hearings and consultation and activities to allow participation in the state planning process; Program Administration, which looks at activities designed to meet or exceed state adjusted levels of performance and how students' academic and technical skills will be improved; Accountability and Evaluation; Special Populations and Other Groups; Tech Prep; and Financial Requirements, which discusses such items as assurances, compliance, and fund allocation.

        "description":"The report summarizes the results of the British Columbia (B.C.) Council on Admissions and Transfer's efforts to define various student flow patterns into and through university colleges and community colleges in British Columbia (Canada). The purpose of this working paper is to provide baseline data to the Council for its use in order to promote transfer effectiveness and access equity. From 1988 to 1990, Grade 12 enrollments grew 1.5 percent; college academic enrollments grew 31.0 percent. In response, students are staying at college longer before transferring and, as a result, transferring more credits into universities. It appears that direct entry admissions are increasingly destined for university science and science-related faculties. By contrast, college transfers are  increasingly destined for arts and education. Roughly 25 percent of all college transfers are admitted into spring and summer sessions. Of all leavers from college academic programs in spring 1991, 13 percent were admitted for the first time to a B.C. university in fall 1991. Overall, direct entries continue to earn higher second-year university GPAs than college transfers (2.70 vs. 2.58). Between 1983 and 1991, the number of first undergraduate degrees awarded to direct entries increased roughly 18 percent while the number awarded to college transfers increased 64 percent.

        "description":"The paper discusses retention models for the nontraditional student population, including transfer students, older adult learners, commuters, part-time students, graduate students, women, students with disabilities, and ethnic minorities. Since 1975, leading research in the field of postsecondary student retention has been grounded on Tinto's (1975) argument that the student-institution &quot;fit,&quot; or the students' social and academic integration into the institution, is a good predictor of dropout or persistence. Other models of student retention focus on student involvement and the institution's responsibility to promote student retention. In the 1980s, attrition models were modified to address some of the shortcomings of previous schema. Similar to traditional student models, most  models that try to predict non-traditional student retention are concerned with student-institution &quot;fit.&quot; Benjamin's &quot;Quality of Student Life&quot; model, however, focuses on conceptualizing satisfaction as a multidimensional construct involving the interaction among personal, interpersonal, social and contextual factors and/or processes. It attempts to grapple with the complex and dynamic nature of students within postsecondary systems, and recognizes that competing demands of parents, friends, romantic partners, employers, and others, as well as financial and health problems, can influence students' coping abilities and life decisions. Discussed are the challenges faced by particular groups of non-traditional students, and the factors that affect the attrition rates of these students.  Contains 164 references and 18 figures. (JA)",

        "description":"This study examined the first-year postsecondary experiences of students through an action research project with small groups of students at three postsecondary institutions (one community college, one university college, and one university). The paper reviews the action research design method and highlights its utility in analyzing the effects of institutional policies, resources, and strategies that facilitated or constrained student success. In the spirit of action research, each student was encouraged to keep a weekly journal to help him/her reflect on dilemmas. Common issues were discussed in weekly or bi-weekly focus groups where students participated in seeking solutions, offering alternatives, and confirming current strategies. The paper presents data generated from focus  groups with students and interviews with personnel at each of the three institutions in this study. The report finds that, despite having in place comprehensive programs and services to assist students with their first year, students at all institutions were either reluctant or unable to access those resources. Second, given the availability of resources, personnel at all institutions assumed students could and would make use of them, even though this was often not so. Finally, the overwhelming feeling experienced by students in all focus groups was one of powerlessness and isolation. The paper concludes with recommendations for practice, policy, and further research. (Contains 54 references.) (VWC)",

        "description":"This paper examines the historical development and current structure of transfer mechanisms within British Columbia (Canada), as reflected in a selection of reports, research studies, policy documents, and conversations with post-secondary education specialists in the province. It reviews the growth of the higher education system in British Columbia since the early 1960s. In tracing the trajectory of educational expansion, consolidation, and revision, this report demonstrates how transfer policies and practices have evolved. Clearly, the recommendations set forth in the MacDonald Report in 1962 were so instrumental in shaping the higher education system that they have had significant implications for transfer effectiveness and for the kinds of transfer-related problems with which  students and institutions have had to deal. In particular, the MacDonald report's recommendation that universities and colleges function as autonomously as possible has meant that the need for significant and ongoing effort in ensuring co-ordination and articulation among the many institutions within the system has been considerable. However, a number of persistent problems remain. Many committees associated with the issue of transfer, and existing policies and practices, have focused on honing and refining--rather than completely overhauling and rebuilding--the system. The paper also features an annotated review of materials on transfer research and policy in British Columbia. (Contains 42 references.) (VWC)",

There was little difference between full- and part-time faculty in their demographic characteristics. More surprisingly, there was also little difference in academic background. In both groups, a little over one-third held a Ph.D., with almost all the rest holding a master's degree. And, in both groups, roughly two-thirds had earned a graduate degree in physics. During the 1996-97 academic year, some 120,000 students took physics at two-year colleges. Thirty-one percent were women and 15% who were members of minority groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science. Most two-year college physics  students were enrolled in the same type of introductory physics course that is taught in four-year schools and universities. Few faculty indicated that they had developed ties to or received regular input from potential employers of two-year college graduates. The major problems cited by full-time faculty included students' weak math backgrounds, insufficient funds for equipment and supplies, and inadequate space for labs/facilities outmoded. The study found extremely high levels of career and job stability. There was a major discrepancy between full- and part-time faculty salaries.

        "description":"This paper claims that transfer is increasing in popularity among community college students due to a re-emphasis of importance by community college administrators, more convenient transfer policies and procedures, and beneficial credit transfer. Research for this position was conducted at Tulsa Community College (Oklahoma). The research included yearly enrollment and graduate reports produced by the college and a survey of undergraduate students attending a four-year university in Oklahoma. The literature obtained for this study concludes that the transfer function is not perfect, but remains important for students wishing to pursue their education past the community college level. The statistics show increased interest and success with transferring students, and the efforts  made by administrators encourage students to take advantage of the transfer function. The original purpose of the transfer function at the community college level has remained the same. The desire for students to attain their lower level collegiate education in order to pursue studies at a senior institution will always be present in higher education. Overall, the study concluded that the transfer function continues to be important and valuable. Its presence as a convenient means of pursuing a higher education beyond the community college level allows students the chance to earn baccalaureate degrees. (Contains 10 references.) (VWC)",

The single most valued document in the advising process is the print Transfer Guide. Access to the online Transfer Guide was rated as the most &quot;potentially&quot; valuable resource. Most advisors feel that students do not have a good understanding of the transfer system.

Block transfer is the process whereby a block of credits is granted to students who have successfully completed a certificate, diploma, or cluster of courses that is recognized as having an academic wholeness or integrity, and that can be related meaningfully to a degree program or other credential. This document describes ten models of block transfer currently in use in British Columbia and provides a checklist to assist departments in their negotiation and assessment process involved in Block Transfer Agreements (BTAs). In typical BTAs, the transfer agreement refers to a specific program at  the receiving institution. For example, a social work diploma program may receive block transfer towards a social work degree. The credits earned this way may not be applicable to a different degree unless they are transferable on a course by course basis. The British Columbia Council on Admission and Transfer is working to encourage the development of more innovative, flexible and efficient transfer arrangements. The Council has developed a set of &quot;Supplemental Principles and Guidelines for Flexible or Innovative Transfer.&quot; Students should be able to complete all lower division degree requirements at a college, provided that the college offers a reasonable variety of courses in their chosen discipline.

Transfer in BC is essentially a bilateral process in which sending and receiving institutions negotiate credit for a course or program. One of the assumptions that underlies Charting a New Course, the strategic plan issued in 1996 by the BC Ministry of Education, Skills, and Training, is that every academic course a student takes at a sending institution should transfer automatically to a receiving institution because it has been ratified by the sending institution. By virtue of the institution's membership in the public system, the ratification should extend to each and all facets of that  system. Although block transfer is well established in the professional areas, there are few examples of its application to academic programs. There are a number of different block transfer models: system-wide transfer; general education core curriculum; standardized pre-major program; flexible pre-major program; learning outcomes; and descriptive pathways. Any successful revision, if needed, will require the full agreement of all partners in the system. (JA)",

The Block Transfer Project grew out of statements in Charting a New Course that assigned to the British Columbia (BC) Council on Admission and Transfer the responsibility for implementing a system of block transfer for the BC postsecondary system. The Council decided to launch an investigation into what block transfer might mean in the context of arts and science degrees, and to determine whether precedents for the application of block transfer principles in arts and sciences existed in other jurisdictions. Twenty-four respondents answered that block transfer should &quot;supplement&quot; the current course to course transfer system. Nineteen respondents  preferred Descriptive Pathways model, and fifteen respondents indicated support for Flexible Pre-Major model. Twenty-two respondents indicated that legislation was either unthinkable or unworkable for implementing block transfer. One of the frequent themes that emerges from an examination of responses is that articulation committees perform a valuable function.

The Transfer Study Committee has developed four specific recommendations designed to improve UW System transfer opportunities for WTCS students. Recommendations for improvement include: (1) the revision of the 1989 statement on principles governing student transfer from the WTCS; (2) a commitment to develop multi-institutional program articulation agreements; (3) a proposal  to create several alternative baccalaureate completion programs within the UW System for WTCS associate degree graduates; and (4) an agreement to expand the WTCS general education credits that UW System institutions would consider for transfer. In 1999 the Wisconsin Act 9, the Legislature required, as part of the report on efforts to facilitate transfer opportunities from the WTCS to the UW System, a plan to coordinate the transfer of credits for additional programs and a timetable for implementation of the plan.

The report presents the findings by the gender and race of the respondents. The survey found that a larger percentage of white respondents (89%) had computer access than black respondents (79%). However, the differences among different racial groups at NVCC were not as marked as those observed in some national studies. Male respondents were more likely to have access to a home computer. Additionally, male respondents used a home computer more frequently and for more hours during the week than female respondents  did. However, female respondents who had computer access at home were more likely to have e-mail access than were male respondents. Black respondents had the largest percentage of access to a computer at work (69%). Of students with computers at home, Hispanic males had the largest percentage of Internet access (100%), followed by Asian female respondents (91%). Black male respondents had the lowest Internet access (73%). (Contains 31 tables.) (JA)",

        "description":"The report summarizes the preliminary findings from the Institutional Self-Study Follow-Up Survey of the faculty, administrators, staff, and students at South Texas Community College (STCC). The follow-up study was intended to address areas that were found to be of sufficient concern in the committee reports of the original Self-Study Survey as to warrant recommendations in the Institutional Self-Study. In the original Self-Study Survey, administered in fall 1998, 59 percent of the faculty respondents answered positively to the question regarding the adequacy of the on-line catalogue at the Learning Resource Center. In the Self-Study Follow-Up Survey, administered in spring 2000, the figure rose to 82 percent. Findings for administrator respondents indicated an improvement in the  proportion reporting an understanding of the duties of the president and other administrators since the original survey. Findings for staff showed an improvement in satisfaction with training in the use of computer software (58 percent to 72 percent). Students continue to be well satisfied with most areas receiving recommendations in STCC's Institutional Self-Study. Over 80% of the student cohort in both the original and the follow-up survey responded that STCC adequately defines what is meant by a major or an area of concentration. (JA)",

Over 93% of the student respondents from all five campuses indicated that the course met their goals and/or expectations. There was little difference in the levels of satisfaction with course instructors expressed by students from the different campuses. Among the five campuses, between 73% to 85% of the students ranked their instructor as &quot;excellent.&quot; Except for students from the Alexandria Campus, most students learned about the continuing education course through a flier or brochure. These students  mostly registered for the course by phone. At the Alexandria Campus, a greater number of the students indicated they learned about the course through &quot;other means&quot; (e.g., another continuing education course, the NVCC Web site, etc.). Forty-four percent of the students on this campus indicated that they registered in person for a course.

It includes a historical account of the development of transfer policy, noting those policy decisions that laid the groundwork for current practice. The contributions of the Council are documented with particular emphasis upon actions to ensure greater public confidence in the transfer process. Further comment is made respecting the Council's efforts to develop more flexible and innovative approaches to current transfer arrangements  with reference to the role of articulation committees, and to the debate over block transfer and the status of the associate degree. At the time of writing, detailed data respecting transfer students were available only from the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Victoria. Analysis of these data indicated that opportunities for transfer students to enter those universities were not increasing. In general terms, student achievement justifies public confidence in the transfer process. The report ncludes a number of suggestions to ensure successful public policy in the transfer process.

This translated into 84.9% of credits earned at the college that were granted transfer credits at UBC. In the cases where students were not granted transfer credits based on college credits earned, there were eight explicit reasons why this occurred: college course was not articulated at UBC; college credits were weighted less at UBC; student exceeded maximum number of transfer credits permitted for a specific UBC program; student exceeded maximum number of transfer  credits in a specific subject area; equivalent or duplicate courses were completed at the college and credit was granted for only one of those courses at UBC; high school level (or equivalent) course was completed; no credit was granted if college course was taken on its own; and college course was not given credit in a specific UBC program.

It sought to determine the nature of transfer; portray experiences surrounding the transfer process; document difficulties and successes encountered before, during, and after transfer; highlight advantages and disadvantages of transfer; and offer recommendations for improving the transfer process. Most interviewees reported that they commenced their studies at a community college with the intention to transfer to a university. Respondents gave a number of reasons for commencing their post-secondary studies at a community college and then transferring to a university, rather than entering a university directly. Students  were usually very attentive to the question of transferability. For the majority of students interviewed, the mechanics of the transfer process did not present an overwhelming source of distress. Of all the issues associated with transfer, the decline in grade point average after transfer was the most significant and the one that consistently caused students the most anxiety. The key disadvantages involved adapting to two different institutions and the extra demands placed on transfer students that were not expected of students who commenced their studies at university. The paper includes the interview coding scheme. (Contains 10 references.) (VWC)",

It examines the extent to which BC college credits were transferable/transferred to UVic and the reasons why they were sometimes not transferable/transferred. Key findings of the analysis are presented. Students attempted an average of 51.18 credits at the BC college(s) they attended. BC college transfer students applied to UVic with 48.76 potentially transferable credits on average. Fewer than 5% of all attempted BC college credits were ineligible for transfer to the University of Victoria. About 11% of potentially transferable credits were not granted transfer to UVic. The  primary reasons for this lack of credit transfer were that the courses were not articulated at UVic, the courses were transferred but at a reduced credit value, and an equivalent or duplicate course had already been granted transfer. About three-fourths of the credits that were successfully transferred mapped to specific UVic courses; one-fourth were granted unassigned transfer credit. The credit transfer patterns described above varied somewhat by BC college and by UVic faculty of admission. (VWC)",

Nearly 82% of respondents were employed in a job related to their community college career program, and 10% were working in an unrelated job. The overall average annual salary reported by males was 7% higher than that reported by females ($31,387 vs. $29,411).  Approximately eight out of ten respondents reported improvement in their self-confidence, decision-making skills, and time management skills as a result of their community college experiences. The vast majority of employers were satisfied with the preparation of the career program completer in their employ. Nine out of ten rated the overall job preparation as excellent or good, and less than 2% of employers rated any aspect of their employee's job preparation as poor. Appendices contain tabled findings, completer and employer surveys, and comparison of initial mail and telephone responses. (Contains 37 tables.) (JA)",

The overall JCCC attrition rate for classes starting on or before the 20th day of the fall 1999 semester was 12%. During the fall semester, students dropped 4,846 classes. The Science, Health Care, and Math Division recorded a 17% attrition rate, the highest of all the academic divisions. The Business and Technology Division recorded the lowest attrition rate (9%). Work schedule conflicts (21%) and personal problems (18%) continue to be among the reasons most frequently cited for dropping classes. Reasons over which JCCC may have some control, such as course difficulty, course scheduling, and instructors, also  appeared to contribute to decisions to drop classes in a substantial number of instances. Course &quot;too hard/bad grade&quot; was the third most frequently cited reason for dropping a class overall (17%), and the most frequently cited reason in the Science, Health Care, and Math Division (27%). A high attrition class is defined as a class with an enrollment of 10 or more and an attrition rate of 40% or higher. Of the classes offered in the fall semester, less than 2% were high attrition classes. Appendices contain tabled findings. (JA)",

        "description":"This report presents information about students who transferred from Cabrillo College (California) to one of three local universities. It is intended to aid in planning the expansion of the Watsonville Transfer Center at Cabrillo College. Transfer data came from four sources: final transcript requests submitted by Cabrillo students, data from the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC), data from San Jose State University (SJSU), and data from Cal State University at Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Watsonville Center students enrolled in at least one course offered at the Center between spring 1993 and fall 1999. Over half of all Cabrillo College students from either the Watsonville Center or elsewhere transfer to UCSC or SJSU. The proportion of Watsonville Center student transfers  appears to have been declining relative to the proportion of the total enrollment at the Watsonville Center. Further, the proportion of Watsonville Center students who stated that transfer is their goal has been consistently less than other Cabrillo students. The city of Watsonville supplies the largest number of students to the Watsonville Center. Over half of Cabrillo's Watsonville area students are enrolled through the Watsonville Center and proportionately more of them are Hispanic and female. (Contains 1 table and 6 figures.) (VWC)",

Other Innovation Incubator sponsored activities have included discussion groups, development projects, and Net Site Bookmarks. Each project starts with an innovative idea proposed by a faculty member. The idea is then investigated and developed into a test project. Projects are implemented in some classes, measurements are taken, effects of the idea on learning are determined, and results are communicated throughout the  college. Innovation Incubator projects have investigated the effects of various types of computer software, the internet delivery of courses, the student control in evaluations and course requirements, and the applications of course material to research or nonacademic pursuits. Instructors found higher attendance rates and student satisfaction in innovation groups. A study investigating the effects of Internet delivery of the CIS 100 curriculum, for example, provided evidence that the method of course delivery chosen by the student does not negatively affect student performance. However, the Internet-based students (innovation group) tended to contact the instructor more often than the paper-based control group. (JA)",

It provides an overview of existing practices and helps to inform a discussion of whether or not transfer rate data should be collected from British Columbia (BC) public postsecondary institutions and how transfer rates should be calculated. The issue of how best to calculate a transfer rate depends in part upon the purpose underlying the collection of such information. If the rate is to be used as a measure of college effectiveness with consequences that follow for the institution depending upon its &quot;success,&quot; then how the rate is calculated becomes very important. The key difference in the  calculation of various transfer rates rests in the precise definitions of entering or exiting student cohort, time frame for transfer, minimum number of college credits completed, type of curriculum studied, and student intent to transfer. The report looks at transfer rates and the BC postsecondary system and discusses possible transfer rate models in the BC context: entering student cohort model, exiting student cohort model, transfer readiness model, and transfer of credits model. Some recommendations conclude the report. Contains 10 references. (VWC)",

The majority of interviewees in Phase 1 of the project, who had transferred from community college to university, reported that they commenced their studies at a community college with the intention to transfer to a university. For some, difficulties occurred in trying to work out an acceptable schedule that satisfied the necessary transfer requirements, determining whether the information was current, and trying to understand what the information meant. Overall, however, most students satisfactorily transferred most or all of their credits. The decline in grade point average (GPA) after transfer was the most significant issue,  the one that consistently caused students the most anxiety. Phase 2 offers insight into the perceptions of students who had not yet transferred from community college. Most students in this study appeared to employ a very unfocussed approach to transfer. Student participants in Phase 1 and Phase 2 offered three similar recommendations to improve transfer policies and practices: development of a user friendly Transfer Handbook for Students; written explanation from the receiving institution for each course that was not fully transferable; and mandatory advising for all students intending to transfer.

        "description":"This report examines the dimensions of transfer problems in the British Columbia college system from a number of perspectives. For the last 3 years, in an annual student outcomes survey, 16 percent of students have reported that they had transfer problems. For the receiving institutions, the challenge of including clear entry points for transfer students, in innovative and unique degrees, cannot be overstated. Lack of consultation or advance warning regarding changes in curriculum or in program requirements can create serious difficulties for sending institutions and their students, especially when more than one receiving institution is making those changes. Understanding the &quot;system&quot; is one of the difficulties students have related. Many students expect a coordinated system of  postsecondary education (like the K-12 system) where institutions will have similar regulations, curricula, programs, etc. A relatively new problem for the system relates to the changing expectation of students and the public about what ought to be transferable. Lack of capacity in the system to accommodate students in degree programs can create another problem. Accrediting agencies external to institutions have, in many cases, the power to set curricular requirements which can affect transfer relationships between institutions. Overall, the problems related to transfer fall into four categories: complexity, communication, administration, and articulation. (JA)",

Just less than half of colleges and institutes offering the associate degree program collect data on the number of students exiting institutions with a minimum of 60 credits. The number of associate degrees awarded between 1993/94 and 1997/98 has generally increased each year for the system as a whole. However, the number of such credentials awarded by individual institutions varies considerably from year to year. There is no consensus of opinion among registrars as to why students choose to pursue or not to pursue an associate degree. Only two BC postsecondary institutions have conducted formal studies of the associate degree, resulting in disparate conclusions. Students  see the degree as improving their employment prospects, although it is not very useful. Roughly 60% of institutions surveyed promoted the associate degree beyond publishing it in their institutional calendars, and do so through a variety of means. There appears to be no correlation between promotion of the credential and the number of credentials awarded. There is no consistent practice of registering students in an associate degree program. The majority of registrars agreed that it was time for an associate degree review and recommended that a number of aspects be given consideration. (VWC)",

        "description":"This paper reflects the results of the consultative and research activities of a joint Charter Working Group drafting on a new charter for Ontario, Canada colleges. The purpose of the Capacity and Charter Project, initiated by the Association of Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology's General Assembly, is to develop a new charter framework to ensure that colleges can continue to be leaders in economic development and prepare qualified graduates. The charter framework includes the following elements: a new charter that commits to opportunity for access, describes the broad college mandate and imbeds system-wide elements and institutional differentiation; increased board authority within a broad accountability framework; a commitment by government to progressive and adequate  funding; and establishment of colleges' right to grant applied degrees. There is strong support for one charter that articulates common system-wide elements with flexibility for institutional differentiation incorporated into the legislation. Several principles emerged from the feedback from colleges and stakeholders: access, funding, accountability, board authority, and institutional flexibility and credentials. These principles guided the development of the charter framework, as well as identifying areas which require further work. The paper also describes postsecondary reform in four other jurisdictions and the resulting structures established to support the changes.

Chapter 1 discusses demographic factors, including population trends and life expectancy. Chapter 2 focuses on children's health status, reporting on child mortality rates, abortion, birth rate, family planning, perinatal health problems, congenital anomalies, accidents at or around the home, traffic accidents, chronic conditions and handicaps, asthma, diabetes mellitus, vision, hearing, developmental problems, mental deficiency, and mental health. Chapter 3 presents information on lifestyle influences on children's health, including breastfeeding, dental health, leisure time, cigarette smoking, alcohol, drugs, and teenage sexuality. Chapter 4 discusses aspects of the  Netherlands' health care system, including access to health care, organization, financing, obstetrical care, maternity home help, preventive child health care, preschool and school health care, vaccinations, general practitioner consultation rates, specialist service use, and hospital admissions. Chapter 5 focuses on social welfare and discusses pregnancy leave, breastfeeding at work, parental leave, child benefit, day care for children, youth welfare work, and youth care. Chapter 6 discusses education, focusing on play groups, compulsory education, and schools for special education. Chapter 7 presents information on children at risk, including preterm children, ethnic minorities, children of refugees, adopted children, child abuse, and school dropouts. The report concludes by noting that  children in the Netherlands enjoy a better state of health than their predecessors a generation ago. However, more attention needs to be paid to problems associated with smoking, drinking, and drug abuse, living environment, accident prevention, lack of exercise/sport, and mistaken nutritional habits.

The project, funded through the Bernard van Leer Foundation and managed by ISPES (Instituto per la Promozione dello Svillupo Economico e Sociale), is carried out in five Italian regions: Basilicata, Calabria, Emilia Romagna, Lazio, and Sardegna. This document consists of the following reports on the project: (1) &quot;Resources Families Project,&quot; describing the social and political context for the project, local implementation, project impact, and perspectives; (2) &quot;Proposal for the Second Phase,&quot; including goals and strategies and a  working plan; (3) a report describing the 1995-98 implementation in Sardegna; (4) a report describing the 1994-98 implementation in Calabria; and (5) a report describing the annual plan for the Basilicata region. Three kinds of action took place: (1) co-planning activities and services, involving cooperation among health, education, and welfare agencies and the participating families; (2) community service management; and (3) support for families with difficulties in order to enhance their integration in the community. Report 1 notes that the project had positive results for families' perceptions of themselves as a strong component of a new form of social citizenship and had a positive effect on agencies' professional staff.

Noting that there is a long way to go before the first of the National Education Goals--that all children will start school ready to learn--is achieved, this report identifies barriers to changing the current &quot;nonsystem&quot; of early care and education and describes ECS's role in addressing this issue. Although many states have invested resources in preschool programs and have taken steps to improve the quality of early care and education programs, the  challenge is to knit together the piecemeal efforts to create a well operating system. The 2-year ECS Early Learning Initiative is described as complementing the work of other national organizations by serving the needs of ECS policymaker, education, and business constituencies by: (1) engaging business communities in early learning as an investment in the development of the future workforce; and (2) making systemic connections between early learning and elementary education. The report delineates the goals for the initiative and identifies ways state policymakers, educators, business leaders, parents, and advocates can contribute to and benefit from the initiative. The report concludes with a list of resources and a list of the members of the Early Learning Advisory Council.  (KB)",

Completing the questionnaire were non-home-schooled students 14 to 18 years of age from 1,334 households in a nationally representative sample. To permit regional comparisons, the questionnaires were mailed to representative households within each of the nine United States census regions. The report summarizes findings \"at a glance\" in 11 categories: (1) schools; (2) student environment; (3) courses important for future success; (4) attitudes; (5) opportunities; (6) effort and grades; (7) role models; (8) family relationships; (9) outside activities; (10) top career choices; and (11) the future. Survey findings are discussed under the following headings: (1) the academic  environment-- evaluation of current experiences; (2) opportunities and effort; (3) life beyond the classroom; (4) the future; (5) future education; and (6) career and family. Among the key findings, the report notes that most youth appear to be meaningfully engaged in their schooling, viewing courses as very challenging (58 percent) and seeing them as \"definitely preparing me for the future\" (67 percent). Ninety percent reported that there is \"at least one teacher or administrator who personally cares about my success.\" About three quarters of the sample are connected to at least one school-based co-curricular activity. High percentages of both boys and girls reported close relationships with parents and high percentages reported being connected to three or more friends. The report  includes 31 data tables. (KB)",

Information on programs and initiatives was obtained from nomination forms sent to over 300 key informants, including child care officials, Head Start collaboration directors, governors' early childhood policy advisors, national organizations, researchers, and welfare, child welfare, and mental health administrators. Thirty-five programs and initiatives were nominated, 11 of which were studied in depth. In-depth conversations were held with staff from these 11 programs and initiatives, and with policymakers, foundation officers, and others involved with these efforts. The report is organized in four sections. Section 1 sets the  context, describing the importance and the challenge of integrating child and family development strategies with welfare policies and practices. Section 2 presents the findings in three parts: (1) describing six overall approaches to integrating child development and family support with welfare reform; (2) analyzing specific strategies that emerged across the sites; and (3) presenting an overview of common themes and concerns. Section 3 of the report offers some reflections and observations based on insights of the informants. Section 4 draws out the implications of the findings and observations for TANF administrators, early childhood program leaders, staff, and others seeking to enhance outcomes for young children and to implement welfare reform effectively. The report's three  appendices summarize the characteristics of the programs and initiatives studied, provide profiles of individual programs and initiatives, and list resources for programs and agencies.

This report details the project's examination of child well-being in the context of five distinct state welfare programs. Part 1 of the report describes the process by which researchers, state administrators, and evaluators came to agree upon a common core of measures of child outcomes. Part 2 highlights features of the states' demonstrations and evaluations that presented challenges and opportunities for assessing child well-being and integrating findings across the five evaluations. This part describes the waiver  policies in five states (Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota), describes their evaluation designs, discusses the implications of variations in the states' policies and evaluations for the synthesis and integration of findings across the five evaluations, proposes analytic strategies, and describes how findings from the project can increase understanding of welfare reform policies and their implications for child development. The report notes that the project will allow a comparison of various policy packages which anticipated provisions in the 1996 national welfare legislation and will permit an examination of the processes mediating the impact of welfare policies on children.

Three yearly student cohorts (1997-98, 1998-99, 1999-2000) have participated in the study evaluating the Language Enrichment Activities Program (LEAP) as the curriculum. During Year 1, the English LEAP curriculum was used; the Spanish version was implemented in Year 2. Preschoolers received the curriculum in the language in which they were most proficient; children with mixed/undeterminable dominance or with limited English proficiency received the Spanish version. For Years 1 and 2, evaluation data were obtained on language growth in English and Spanish. For Year 3 of the study, the Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of  Learning-3 (DIAL-3) in Spanish was used to assess students' progress in the following domains: motor, concepts, language, and total scores. Findings from Year 1 indicated that English Dominant students showed a nonstatistically significant increase in English language skills. The Spanish Dominant students evidenced significant growth in their English skills. The mixed dominant group showed significant improvement in English and significant declines in Spanish skills. Year 2 findings indicated that the English Dominant group did not show significant English skill growth. The Spanish Dominant group showed significant improvements in English and Spanish. The Mixed Dominant group had 14 and 12 point increases in English and Spanish, respectively. Year 3 findings indicated that the Spanish  Dominant group showed significant growth in motor, concept, and total domains, with no change in language skills. The Limited English Proficient group showed significant growth in motor and total domains only. (KB)",

        "description":"Recognizing the relationship between homework completion and academic achievement, this action research project targeted eighth graders in all subject areas who failed to complete homework assignments and provided them with creative strategies to improve homework completion. Participating in the project were eighth graders from a small, suburban, Midwestern town. Homework completion problems were documented from existing grade reports, teacher anecdotal records, and surveys from parents, students, and teachers. The intervention program emphasized student personal responsibility by requiring assignment notebooks to be completed with current assignments. All homework assignments were graphed in the assignment notebook to show students and parents the students' personal homework  progress. Afterschool study sessions were required for students receiving failing grades. Creative homework options replaced traditional worksheet methods that made it more attractive for students to complete their homework independently. The impact of the intervention was assessed by means of student surveys, grades, homework records, and teachers' anecdotal records and journals. In addition, student pre-algebra grades from the 2000 class were compared to those from the 1999 class that had not used assignment notebooks. Post-evaluative measures indicated that students completed more homework when required to keep a daily assignment notebook and when given homework options in place of traditional homework. Pre-algebra grades were higher and the number of missing assignments were fewer for  the 2000 class than for the 1999 class. Graphing of homework results and use of after school study sessions were not perceived as useful in reaching the goal of increasing homework completion.

Participating in the study were students from one fifth-grade public school class, one fifth-grade class in a private school, and one second-grade public school class. The problem of low social and emotional behavior skills in the areas of responsibility, motivation, self-confidence, and cooperation was documented by means of teacher, parent, and student surveys. The intervention program focused on cooperative learning activities, team building, and character education activities implemented around weekly themes: caring, listening, courage, courtesy,  fairness, review, honesty and truthfulness, kindness and helpfulness, respect, responsibility, manners, work ethic, and review. The effects of the intervention were assessed by means of a teacher tally system and parent, teacher, and student surveys administered on a pre-post basis. Findings indicated that for public school fifth-graders, teachers noted a slight improvement in student behavior, with slight decreases in verbal and physical inappropriateness. Students reported a noticeable increase in cooperation but decreased responsibility and self-confidence. Parents reported a slight increase in positive school attitudes. For private school fifth-graders, teachers reported slight improvements in student behavior, with slight decreases in group and verbal inappropriateness but increases  in physical inappropriateness. Students reported decreased responsibility, motivation, self-confidence, and cooperation. For second-graders, there was little change in student responsibility, although there were improvements in motivation and self-confidence.

This action research project examined the impact of a program for improving social competence through improving listening skills, cooperation, respect for others, and respect for authority. Participating in the project were 72 students across 2 kindergarten classrooms and 1 first grade physical education classroom from 2 schools located in a suburban community. Students' lack of social competence was documented by means of teacher and parent surveys, teacher anecdotal records, and behavioral checklists. The intervention had three components. First, a safe, caring, environment was established for the students. Second, direct lessons were  provided involving role modeling, role play, and problem solving to teach cooperation. Third, direct lessons were used to teach conflict resolution. Lessons were taught throughout the school year. Effects of the intervention were assessed over 4 weeks through examination of students' discussions, parent surveys, teacher surveys, and the use of behavioral checklists and anecdotal records by teachers to assess social skills. Post intervention data indicated that the students exhibited more socially acceptable behaviors. Children began to learn the concepts needed for cooperative learning and the language necessary to resolve conflicts in a positive fashion.

Students' lack of social skills was documented by means of teacher and parent surveys, teacher anecdotal records, and behavioral observation checklists. The intervention had four components. The teacher directly taught social skills beginning in the first 3 weeks of school for 10 minutes daily and periodically reviewed throughout the semester. Cooperative groups were used at least twice a week for a total of 40 minutes. Conflict resolution instruction was implemented 10 minutes daily and reviewed as needed. A weekly newsletter was sent to families, and monthly family activities and a book depicting the monthly theme were also sent home. The impact of the  intervention was assessed using pre-post parent surveys regarding their child's social skills, teacher surveys, teacher anecdotal records, and the use of a student behavior checklist. Findings indicated that parents identified an improvement in prosocial behavior, with the most substantial increases in following rules, resolving conflicts, and saying please, thank you, excuse me, and I'm sorry. Most negative behaviors declined, with the exception of talking back to parents. Staff also noted a marked improvement in children's prosocial behaviors. The behavior checklist findings indicated a decline in behavior incidents. Throughout the 20-week intervention, teacher anecdotal records noted a marked decrease in the number and severity of negative behavior incidents.

Approximately half of the programs in the 1999-2000 broadcast prime time entertainment programming exhibited some diversity in their opening credits casts.

The study examined 10 &quot;mixed&quot; programs (character set included a mix of racial and ethnic characters) and 10 &quot;only one&quot; programs (all characters but one in program character set belong to the same racial group). Two additional programs with predominantly African American casts were selected for comparison. The first three episodes were recorded for each program and coded. Among the major findings are the following: (1) African American characters overall  were more likely to be integral to primary storylines in situation comedies than in dramas; (2) Asian Pacific American characters were seen the least frequently; (3) the few Latino characters were more often integral to secondary dramatic storylines than to primary ones; (4) characters of different races frequently interacted professionally, sometimes socially, rarely romantically; (5) many shows adopted a colorblind approach to interracial interactions, with the exception to colorblind portrayals being racial humor and stereotyping by characters of one race toward characters of another; (6) much of the racial humor and stereotyping targeted Asian Pacific Americans and Latinos; (7) characters of color tended to be shown at work/school or home, whereas white characters were shown in both  environments; (8) nonwhite characters, particularly African Americans, were likely to be portrayed as successful, good, and competent, whereas white characters were more likely than nonwhite to be shown as unsuccessful, bad, or incompetent; and (9) programs featured many African American characters that could be positive role models for viewers.

        "description":"This report is designed to inform the Kentucky Governor, the General Assembly, and the public about the quality of child care in the state. Chapter 1 presents data suggesting that at least one third of Kentucky preschoolers are currently in child care, more children are likely to enter childcare as female labor force participation increases and welfare reform unfolds, and the quality of care has a fundamental impact on children, parents, and the wider public. Chapter 2 presents data on the availability and affordability of quality child care in Kentucky. While data suggest that many parents are satisfied with the availability and affordability of high-quality care in their communities, expert assessments of caregiver-child ratios, group size regulations, training requirements,  and compensation reveal that much of Kentucky child care is of questionable quality. Further, more educated parents are much less likely to be satisfied with the availability and affordability of high-quality care. Chapter 3 deals with ways to improve Kentucky child care. A statistical model was used to estimate the relative contribution of various factors to Kentucky child care, and then hypothetical scenarios were generated to estimate the effects of changing ratios, training levels, group size, and pay rates on program quality. Findings point toward caregiver-child ratios, training requirements, and wage rates as targets for enhancing program quality. An expenditure increase of about $10 per child per week was estimated to make marked quality improvements, but over $20 per child per  week was necessary to create the highest quality program.

This report presents case studies of 12 families, all EHS participants, who agreed to be followed throughout their participation in the program so that their stories could be updated as they unfolded from one year to the next. The case study families were interviewed in August of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Four of the families had participated in the first two interviews but had withdrawn prior to the third interview. Additional information was obtained through conversations with family support specialists in May 2000. Common themes in the  families' stories regarding EHS's role include: (1) assistance from caring staff; (2) reassurance from home visits and child development; (3) help in becoming good parents; (4) help with personal goals; (5) help with daily life; and (6) socialization opportunities for children and parents. During the study, most families made progress to widely differing degrees. Although somewhat apprehensive about life without the safety net of EHS, all eight families seemed much more confident than earlier, had some knowledge and understanding of their children and themselves, and had articulated and taken some steps toward achieving personal and family goals.

The brief then presents a framework for community investments based on an ecological view of child development. This framework considers factors related not only to the child but also to the child's family, early childhood care and education, schools, and neighborhood. (Contains 43 references.) (EV)",

This report presents the findings of the 1999 national survey to assess the impact of credentialing on individuals' careers and professional development. A sample of 4,993 CDAs was randomly selected from those credentialed in five selected years (1998, 1997, 1996, 1993, 1989), yielding three groups for comparison: (1) recently credentialed; (2) mid-level; and (3) veteran. The response rate was approximately 20 percent. The major findings indicate that half the respondents received the CDA between 26 and 40 years of age. Respondents were more diverse with regard to race/ethnicity than the U.S. population as a whole.  Thirty percent had been Head Start parents. Over 40 percent had some college education at time of credentialing, with all groups tending to attain degrees after credentialing. There was an increase in the percentage who were teachers or held supervisory positions between the time of credentialing and the survey. Increases in salary over time were reported by all groups. Most respondents reported receiving training through coursework, pre- or inservice training, and continuing education units. Over 60 percent reported not having to pay for any portion of their CDA training, with the percentage receiving financial support decreasing over the past 10 years. Changes directly linked to credentialing were most often increased salary or promotions. Seventy-seven percent of veterans were still in  early childhood education, compared to 81 percent of mid-level group, and 90 percent of new CDAs. (KB)",

        "description":"Although California has the world's seventh largest economy, the state has one of the nation's highest childhood poverty rates and one of the worst income inequality gaps. This report advocates the use of a state earned income credit (EIC) for low-income working families to reward work and to offset the payroll and sales taxes that disproportionately burden low-income workers. The report argues that with a budget surplus of at least five billion dollars for the current year (2000-2001) and the prediction of a continued strong economy, California has more than sufficient resources to establish a state EIC. Further, the report maintains that since the majority of poor children have a parent who works, the EIC is an effective strategy to help working parents provide the basics for  their children. The report describes the establishment of the federal EIC and how it works for families, discusses the persistence of child poverty in California, outlines the establishment of state EIC in 12 other states, and delineates by county the percent of California tax filers receiving the federal EIC for the tax year 1997. The report concludes by asserting that the need for long-term policies that support working families remains compelling in California and that the passage of a state EIC would affirm values of individual responsibility and fairness, while investing in children's future through their working parents.

Child advocates are increasingly recognizing the need to build and mobilize constituencies for children and are working to develop new and effective approaches toward this goal. The NACA has undertaken a range of efforts to assist child advocates in identifying successful approaches to constituency building and in identifying the components necessary for success. Meeting participants described their own community mobilization efforts and discussed the factors they deemed essential for effective campaigns to increase community  involvement.

        "description":"Licensing requirements are often regarded as minimum standards that result in only a basic level of care. In fact, the minimum standards that licensing requires can be as high or low as licensing rules permit. Further, in almost all cases, licensing requirements provide a foundation upon which higher standards can be built. The relationship between licensing requirements and higher quality standards can be illustrated by exploring the role of policies, procedures, and practices in child care settings. These serve as mechanisms that permit programs to achieve a certain level of care and to continually raise that level by encouraging best practices on a daily basis. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) show a relationship between licensing requirements and higher quality standards  and illustrate how meeting licensing requirements can be a first step toward achieving high quality; (2) distinguish among policies, procedures, and practices and show how they can function as bridges between licensing requirements and higher quality standards; and (3) illustrate a practical, cost-effective way to increase program quality on a daily basis. The paper details two examples of how policies, procedures, and practices that meet licensing requirements can be enhanced to embody higher standards. (EV)",

        "description":"Canada is experiencing a dramatic growth in interest in and implementation of the middle school concept. Currently needed is information on the specific characteristics of the middle school as it develops in Canada and information validating the practices that are accompanying restructure efforts. This study investigated the relationship between 18 middle school attributes and student achievement at the grade 6 level in Alberta. The middle school attributes of concern were: (1) continuous progress; (2) multi-material approach; (3) flexible scheduling; (4) social experiences; (5) physical experiences; (6) intramural activities; (7) team teaching; (8) planned gradualism; (9) exploratory studies; (10) guidance services; (11) independent study; (12) basic skill instruction; (13)  creative experiences; (14) security; (15) evaluation; (16) community relations; (17) responsiveness; and (18) cooperative learning. Participating in the study was a stratified random sample of 10 schools in Alberta, drawn from 45 surveyed public schools containing grade 6 in some combination with other grades up to grade 9 but not below grade 4. Student achievement was measured by scores attained on the four Grade 6 Provincial Achievement Tests released in August 1998. Combined scores and gender-specific scores for each of the four subjects were investigated. The Middle School Attribute Survey (MSAS) measured the level of implementation of middle school programming in the sample schools. Findings indicated positive relationships between several middle school attributes and student  achievement, most notably between overall implementation of middle school programming and language arts achievement for boys and social studies achievement for both genders. (Eight appendices include the MSAS, definitions of middle school attributes, and data collection forms. Contains 107 references.) (KB)",

The seven program components are: cognitive, psychomotor, affective, parent participation/education, curriculum, staff development, and community collaboration/participation. An annual evaluation was conducted for the 1996-97 school year. A total of 300 students attended the program at 1 of 10 sites. The Prekindergarten Saginaw Objective Reference Test assessed student achievement on a posttest-only basis. The Affective Rating Scale was used on a pre-post basis. Findings indicate that MSRP students attained all the cognitive and affective objectives and three of the  four psychomotor objectives. Over 80 percent of families participated in the classroom or on field trips. Over 90 percent of families participated in parent meetings and completed home activities with their children. An early childhood education curriculum committee met to discuss literacy for young children and revised first grade report cards to reflect change in reading and writing. The program supervisor met with the Michigan Department of Education Interagency Advisory Council and the Health Education Advisory Board. All staff attended at least 75 percent of the inservice sessions offered. It was concluded that the MSRP in its eighth year of operation was very successful, having maintained 25 of 26 objectives.

        "description":"The Michigan School Readiness Program (MSRP) is a state-funded prekindergarten program in Saginaw for 4-year-olds from the inner city with the goal of providing an environment that develops school readiness skills. The seven program components are: cognitive, psychomotor, affective, parent participation/education, curriculum, staff development, and community collaboration/participation. An annual evaluation was conducted for the 1997-98 school year. A total of 300 students attended the program at 1 of 10 sites. The Prekindergarten Saginaw Objective Reference Test assessed student achievement on a posttest-only basis. The Affective Rating Scale was used on a pre-post basis. Findings indicate that MSRP students attained all the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective objectives. All  objectives related to parent participation through classroom participation, parent meetings, and completion of home activities with the children were met successfully. The Early Childhood Education Curriculum Committee met four times and discussed benchmarks in language arts, social studies, science, and mathematics. The program supervisor participated on county level committees. All staff attended at least 75 percent of the inservice sessions offered. It was concluded that the MSRP program in its ninth year of operation was very successful, having achieved all 26 objectives. It was recommended that building results be examined and that inservice education be expanded in the area of language enhancement.

Section 1 of the document describes the collaborative grant process in Florida with the goal of improving early childhood services and outlines eight key components of collaboration: (1) formalized partnership agreements; (2) collaborative staff development; (3) simplified system of entry; (4) outreach initiatives to increase family access to comprehensive services; (5) sharing of funding sources; (6) effective transitions; (7) inclusion of children with disabilities; and (8) use of validated information to enhance quality. Part 2 of the booklet presents a rationale for the collaboration  process and discusses benefits and difficulties of collaboration. Part 3 examines the five factors critical to program success: the interagency council role, the partnership coordinator, quality, transition, and streamlined system of entry. Part 4 identifies lessons noted over the 6 years the collaboration grants have been in place. Areas of concern that interfere with the project coordinator's effective functioning relate to turf, time, and training. Transition issues relate to documentation and tracking, and bureaucracy and turf. Challenges presented by quality relate to monitoring and training. Impediments to producing an effective simplified system of entry include turf and bureaucratic issues. Concerns related to evaluation of the collaboration grant process center around planning  and methods. Part 5 of the booklet asserts that collaboration has proved to be an effective tool for change and has improved resources for children and families in Florida.

The kit includes questions for candidates, ideas for action within individual communities and states, voter statistics, public opinion information on children's issues, and resources related to advocacy. Section 1 of the kit provides tips for posing questions to candidates and lists sample questions in the following areas: (1) general children's issues; (2) child health; (3) child welfare; (4) early care and education; (5) devolution/welfare reform; and (6) juvenile justice/prevention. Section 2 presents statistics and facts to use with  candidates on education, the family, health care, race, welfare and poverty, crime, and child care. Section 3 details techniques that child advocates have found effective in the past and suggests ways to connect nonpartisan politics to children's policy. Section 4 discusses what nonprofit organizations registered as 501(c)(3) organizations can legally do, including lobbying and election-related activity on the Internet, and federal law governing election-related advocacy. Section 5 provides statistics on voter registration, demographics, and voter turnout. Section 6 delineates the number of openings in each state for the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and governors; describes each state's term limits; and discusses the problems with term limits. Section 7 discusses strategies for  following up and monitoring elected officials by analyzing governors' first budgets or whether the implementation of programs follows candidates' promises. Section 8 lists resources. (KB)",

The targeted population was sixth- through eighth-grade students in a Midwestern suburb. The problems of disruptive behaviors and lack of respect were documented using teacher and student surveys, teacher checklists, teacher interviews, and anecdotal records. Analysis of probable causes at each site and a review of the literature indicated that several factors contributed to the problems occurring in the classroom, including family environment and attitude, no accountability for certain actions, and adults' lack of respect for others. Interventions included increased school activities involving parents, cooperative  learning projects that reinforced appropriate behavior, and a heightened adult awareness of the importance of appropriate modeling and positive discipline. Post-intervention surveys, checklists, interviews, and observations indicated a decrease in disruptive behaviors in the classroom; more time was needed to determine if the decline in disruptive behaviors was a direct result of the intervention strategies.

        "author":["Colbert, Judith A."],
        "description":"This study examined the role of contextual factors in providing quality early care and education services, focusing on program models from Aboriginal/First Nation settings in four countries. Methods included a search of published literature from mainstream and Aboriginal sources, an electronic search of unique Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples sources, intervenor briefs, public testimony, and personal interviews. The findings indicated that mainstream literature, dominated by U.S. work, focuses on the effects of child care, quality, and context. Aboriginal literature, international in scope, focuses on cultural and linguistic issues, community development, Aboriginal child care needs, and strategies. Systems and models for delivering early childhood services for Aboriginal  children in four countries are described. Kenya's system prompts communities to define their needs and create programs to meet those needs, and serves an indigenous and varied population. New Zealand's system has been successful in providing quality services for Maori children but has not been able to provide a context for effective transitions. In the United States, the Child Care Bureau provides support for tribal child day care, and the American Indian Programs Branch of the Head Start Bureau supports comprehensive child development programs for Alaska Natives and American Indians. Federal government initiatives in Canada have resulted in an increase in early childhood programs for Aboriginal children. Based on the study, it was concluded that examples from Kenya and New Zealand  highlight the importance of focusing discussion on planning and policies before programs are launched to ensure that contextual factors, including a supportive infrastructure and community and family supports, are in place.

The report is organized around two goals for health plans. The first goal, facilitate adolescents' access to health care, focuses on policies and systems that can enhance health plans' responsiveness to adolescent members. The second goal, engage teens, parents, and community resources to improve adolescent health, demonstrates the benefits of partnerships to maximize the internal efforts of health plans. The report contains 11 strategies that can help health plans reach these goals. Strategies for Goal 1  include promoting regular preventive health visits; seizing health promotion opportunities; ensuring access to primary caregivers with skills, experiences, and interest in adolescent issues; encouraging the use of multidisciplinary clinical teams; offering comprehensive screening and response for high-risk behaviors; protecting teens' confidentiality; and providing services through specialized adolescent health care centers. Strategies for Goal 2 are to: include adolescents in quality improvement initiatives, help parents and others learn how to support adolescents' health and well-being, participate in community-based health initiatives, and support and disseminate research about adolescent preventive care. Each strategy section also spotlights one or more existing programs and presents  outcome data when available. Five appendices include the Managed Care Self-Assessment Tool, clinical preventive service guidelines for adolescents, the Group Health Cooperative parent/teen letter, acknowledgements, and program contacts and other resources.

Participating were eligible pregnant women in 6 Florida counties; 359 were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 169 to the control group. In addition to prenatal care, treatment group women received weekly home visits by nurses or paraprofessional home visitors who promoted healthy lifestyles, coordinated services, and provided education/support through a community network. Control-group women received services available in the community. Results  indicated no statistically significant differences in low birth weight, preterm birth, or poor birth outcome between the treatment and control groups. Women with poor previous birth outcomes were 2.9 times more likely to have a poor birth outcome than women without such experience. Women who received services (independent of group status) had lower rates of low birth weight, preterm birth, and poor birth outcomes. Samples were identified as at much greater risk of poor pregnancy outcome than a comparison group of the general pregnant population in Florida during the same time period, contributing to the inability to demonstrate a significant treatment effect on birth outcomes.

        "title":"Struggle for Self-Sufficiency: Impact of Welfare Reform on Families with Children in Kansas.",
        "description":"Since Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996, Kansas has dramatically reduced its welfare roles. Noting that achieving self-sufficiency is the real measure of success in combating poverty, this study examines welfare reform efforts in Kansas. To gather information, United Way member agencies and community emergency assistance agencies administered a survey during 1998 and 1999 to 2,005 households seeking assistance, 1,244 of whom were families with children. Findings reveal that while Kansas has made progress in fighting poverty, that progress is far more modest than the dramatic decrease in welfare roles suggests. Kansas ranks 14th in the percentage reduction in welfare recipients between 1993 and 1999. Many welfare recipients  and former recipients continue to struggle to meet their needs. The level of income required to become self-sufficient often far exceeds the wages that a welfare recipient can expect to receive. Kansas diverts almost half the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant into foster care, thereby reducing its ability to effectively improve families' self-sufficiency. Kansas places little emphasis on providing recipients with skill-specific training needed to secure a living wage, with current state spending too low to take full advantage of federal matching grants. An alarming number of poor families are not receiving food stamps, Medicaid, child care subsidies, and other benefits for which they are eligible. Based on findings, the following recommendations were made to help Kansas  achieve the true goals of welfare reform: (1) caseworkers should make sure that families are aware of benefits for which they are eligible; and (2) job readiness and training programs should be emphasized.

The statistical portrait is based on a variety of indicators in the areas of: (1) physical and mental health; (2) social and economic opportunity; (3) education and learning; and (4) child health care access. The report contains a special section on Maine children in need, discussing: gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth; the Maine Youth Initiative; and the Mental and Behavioral Health Initiative. Following the data for these areas, the report presents state level trend data, a Maine state profile, county-by-county profiles, 1990 census data, and definitions and sources of data. Findings indicate that the status of children's physical and mental health is improving in several key areas, including  infant mortality rate, low birth weight infants, 2-year-old immunizations, teen smoking, teen violent death rate, and juvenile arrest rate. There are mixed indications of children's social and economic security, with progress in child support enforcement, teen birth rates, median household income, and unemployment rate. Education indicators revealing room for improvement include high school completions, graduates with plans to attend post-secondary education, and dropout rates. (EV)",

This report responds to requests by members of Congress to: (1) identify laws, regulations, and policies that regulate commercial activities in schools; and (2) describe the nature and extent of these activities. The research involved a review of state laws and regulations, site visits to 19 elementary and secondary schools in 7 school districts in 3 states, a review of reports about commercial  activities, and interviews with representatives of national education and business organizations. Findings indicate that the visibility, profitability, and type of commercial activities varied widely and that high schools had more commercial activities than middle or elementary schools. (EV)",

The guidelines are intended to assist educators in making decisions about curriculum content and in defining and implementing a comprehensive curriculum that will provide opportunities for young children to achieve knowledge and skills. Specific goals are delineated for prekindergarten children in the following content areas: (1) language and early literacy (including listening comprehension, speech production and speech discrimination, vocabulary, verbal expression,  phonological awareness, print and book awareness, and motivation to read); (2) mathematics (including number and operations, patterns, geometry and spatial sense, measurement, and classification and data collection); (3) science (science processes and concepts); (4) social studies (including history, culture, community, geography, and economics); (5) fine arts (art, music, and dramatic play); (6) health and safety; (7) personal and social development; (8) physical development (including physical movement, gross motor development, and fine motor development); and (9) technology applications.

The report first examines the extent of child poverty in Connecticut, as well as its causes and effects, and suggests some possible courses of action. Following demographic information, the bulk of the report provides a statistical portrait of Connecticut's children based on 14 indicators of well-being: (1) children living in poverty; (2) family setting; (3) children in families receiving welfare benefits; (4) children receiving free or reduced-price meals; (5) low birthweight; (6) infant mortality; (7) prenatal care; (8) births to teen mothers; (9) performance on Connecticut Mastery Test; (10) performance on Connecticut Academic Performance Test; (11) high school dropout rate; (12)  juvenile violent crime arrests; (13) child abuse; and (14) teen deaths. Among the findings, the report indicates that increasing numbers of children are living in poverty; the number of children in families receiving welfare benefits has declined; the low birthweight rate has increased; and test performance has improved, as has the dropout rate. Percent of births to teen mothers has remained static. The final portion of the report presents the child well-being information organized by region rather than indicator.

        "description":"This Kids Count data book examines statewide trends in the well-being of Connecticut's children. The report first examines how well children have faired during the past 100 years in terms of economics, education, health and safety, and race relations, and how they are doing at the start of the 21st century. This section also outlines the state's objectives or vision for children and the underlying principles of this vision. Following demographic information, the bulk of the report provides a statistical portrait of Connecticut's children based on 17 indicators of well-being: (1) family setting; (2) children in families receiving welfare benefits; (3) children receiving free or reduced-price school meals; (4) high school employment; (5) births to teen mothers; (6) low birthweight;  (7) infant mortality; (8) late or no prenatal care; (9) physical fitness tests; (10) preschool experience; (11) performance on Connecticut Mastery Test; (12) performance on Connecticut Academic Performance Test; (13) high school dropout rates; (14) child abuse/neglect; (15) child deaths; (16) preventable teen deaths; and (17) juvenile violent crime arrests. Among the findings, the report indicates that the number of families receiving welfare benefits has decreased; the number of high school students working in excess of 16 hours per week has increased; births to teen mothers have decreased but the number still remains large; infant mortality has decreased as has the problem of late or no prenatal care; and the rate of high school dropouts has improved, as have child abuse/neglect rates.  The number of juvenile violent crime arrests has increased. The remaining section of the report provides the child well-being information organized by region rather than indicator. Data sources and notes and a description of the methodology conclude the report. (HTH)",

        "description":"Although research on the effects of K-12 single-sex education is inconclusive in general, some common themes emerge in the research literature. This Digest reviews that research with particular attention to effects on girls' attitudes and achievement. The Digest first discusses attitudinal variables (i.e., self-esteem and attitudes toward academic subjects) and then explores research on achievement variables. The Digest concludes with a summary of research findings, including the following: (1) studies of attitudinal variables yielded some consistent findings, including differences in specific domains of self-concept between girls in single- and mixed-sex schools, and findings that support the view that single-sex contexts foster less stereotypical views of subjects; (2) studies  finding positive achievement effects attributable to school type tend to view their findings as specific to certain contexts and group characteristics (including socioeconomic status); (3) some studies recognize that some single-sex schools are &quot;doing something different&quot; that may be reproducible in the coeducational context--these studies view policy and training interventions as particularly valuable; and (4) other studies have not claimed positive achievement effects for single-sex programs. The research, while inconsistent in its assessments of whether single-sex education is &quot;better&quot; than coeducation for girls, does reveal areas of consensus on specific indicators, which may serve as starting points for further research into how single-sex schools affect educational outcomes.

        "description":"Noting that parents' use of corporal punishment to discipline their children remains a strongly debated issue, this paper examines the impact of corporal punishment on children's development, focusing primarily on its long-term effectiveness. The paper presents the history of spanking in the United States, including public opinion on corporal punishment, the declining practice of spanking in schools, and parents' reasons for spanking. Arguments presented against corporal punishment include sending children mixed messages about social behavior, increasing children's deviant or antisocial behavior, increasing violence and aggression, increasing cruelty to animals, increasing the probability of spousal abuse, and contributing to psychological problems such as depression, drug  addiction, and anxiety. Arguments in favor of the use of corporal punishment focus on differentiating its effective use from harmful use, presenting research findings that a fair amount of corporal punishment (a light spanking less than once a week) did not affect children's adjustment negatively; findings regarding the contribution of parents' beliefs about spanking and their emotions to the practice; and methodological concerns about anti-corporal punishment studies. Guidelines for administering corporal punishment are presented. The paper asserts that there may be a middle ground where reasonable conclusions can be made about the use of corporal punishment. The paper further notes that there is too much conflicting evidence to outlaw corporal punishment completely but there is evidence  that some forms of corporal punishment are inappropriate and should not be used to discipline children. Therefore, it is important for professionals to educate parents on when and how corporal punishment can be used most effectively. (Contains 37 references.) (KB)",

Among the many challenges faced by the growing number of out-of-school time initiatives are developing financing plans and finding funding that will support long- and short-term goals. This report describes the variety of afterschool programs, analyzes information on the range of total costs and cost elements that such programs experience as well as revenues they receive, presents a comprehensive framework for thinking about necessary cost elements involved in developing and operating afterschool programs and systems, and provides a guide to existing and potential revenue sources for meeting  direct service and infrastructure costs. Following an introduction describing the trends underlying the growing interest in and demand for afterschool programs, the report describes the heterogeneity of afterschools programs. The report provides a framework of cost elements and examines what is known about the total costs of these programs, including start-up costs, operating costs, capital costs, and infrastructure costs. Funding sources and revenues are examined, including parent fees; public funds from federal, state, and local government; private funding; and in-kind contributions. Also discussed are ways to fund the afterschool infrastructure, including facilities improvement, professional development of providers, and technical assistance to programs. The report concludes by noting  that community leaders are finding creative ways to finance afterschool initiatives, and are drawing a widening circle of partners into action. A list of cost elements for afterschool programs and systems is appended. (KB)",

        "description":"Although a national consensus has emerged regarding the importance of extending publicly-funded health insurance coverage to low-income children under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid, substantial numbers of eligible children remain uninsured. This study examined whether extending insurance coverage to low-income parents influenced the enrollment among children. Data were obtained from the Current Population Survey. The change in child and parent Medicaid participation rates between 1990 and 1998 was measured for each of three groups of states, comparing the net differences in changes in states with early expansions (Hawaii, Oregon, and Tennessee) to the changes in states with late or non-Medicaid expansions (Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota,  New York, Vermont, and Washington) and to states with no expansions by 1998 (all other states). The key findings indicated that most children in families with incomes below 200 percent of poverty are already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, but 25 percent of eligible children remained uninsured in 1998. Family-based Medicaid expansions that include parents can increase Medicaid enrollment among children who already are eligible for Medicaid but are unenrolled. States can reduce the proportion of persons who are uninsured through broad Medicaid expansions that include parents. Broad Medicaid expansions that include parents can substantially improve health care access and utilization for both adults and children. (A description of the study's methodology and a technical discussion of the  effects of broad expansions on young children's Medicaid enrollment are appended.) (KB)",

Projects are intended to strengthen children's dispositions to be interested, absorbed, and involved in in-depth observation, investigation, and representation of worthwhile phenomena in their own environments. This Catalog on the Project Approach, the third of its kind, describes and illustrates projects done by children in early childhood and elementary classrooms on topics such as dogs, musical instruments, hens, bicycles, birds, grocery stores, restaurants, and books. Section 1 of the Catalog provides a brief overview of what a project is and offers some suggestions about how to get started. This section also discusses how young children's emerging mapping skills can be  strengthened through project work. Section 2 describes some of the strategies used to help teachers and student teachers learn to use the Project Approach. A variety of course structures and support group arrangements are described, and the important role of administrators in supporting teachers' efforts is discussed. The findings of a survey of teachers using the Project Approach are also summarized. Section 3 offers examples of Project Approach efforts that can be accessed on the World Wide Web. Section 4 consists of the summaries of 17 projects, and the Catalog's final section, &quot;Resources for Implementing the Project Approach,&quot; includes ERIC Digests, a glossary, recommended book titles, an ERIC bibliography on the Project Approach, information on a Project Approach summer institute and  the Projects-L electronic discussion list, and a list of contributors to the Catalog.

        "author":["Schwinden, Ted"],
        "description":"In response to a Montana School Boards Association (MSBA) resolution, this report develops alternatives and recommendations on school district reorganization for submission to the Montana state legislature. The first section examines the history of school district establishment and consolidation in Montana, and points out public opposition to reorganization and the legislature's failure to act on dozens of reorganization proposals over the years. In the early 1990s, a state budget crisis focused taxpayer attention on the cost of education in Montana, and school consolidation quickly became a hot political issue. Next, sections of the report: discuss who's in charge of Montana's public schools, particularly with regard to the consolidation issue; recognize that the goal is to  improve a good system, not replace a failed one; describe the current structure of Montana's 503 school districts; examine seven reorganization options that range from doing nothing to creating a single statewide district; discuss the generally higher costs but potential educational benefits of small schools; and portray the fiscal impact of selected reorganizations of the past 20 years. Recommendations to the legislature include measures that encourage elementary and coterminous high school districts to form K-12 districts, that establish a minimum acceptable size for nonisolated high schools, and that encourage the use of distance learning technology and cooperative agreements. Contains 36 references and school district information in tabular form. A supplementary page, titled &quot;School  District Reorganization: A Retrospective&quot; and dated September 1993, describes dissemination of the draft report to MSBA members and their responses and provides corrections to the report.

        "description":"Over half of Finnish elementary schools are small schools employing 1-3 teachers. This paper examines the implementation of new national curriculum policies in two small elementary schools. The new policies, adopted in 1994, stress autonomous control of learning and encourage each individual school, in collaboration with the community, to draw up its own curriculum on the basis of general national guidelines. Teachers are encouraged to help students become familiar with the local environment and the needs of their own community. One of the schools studied, Suvila School, emphasized the interaction between the school and community. Changes proceeded in phases as teachers gained experience. Cooperative work in small multi-aged groups was introduced. Activity-oriented learning was  accomplished by extending topic-unit duration, allowing time for student project work. Teachers functioned as instructors and work supervisors. In contrast, teachers at Ranta-Sointula School were openly critical about implementation of the new school-based curriculum. The head teacher was not interested in in-service training and cited a lack of teacher cooperation. Parents wanted traditional teaching of basic skills. The curriculum preserved traditional school practices of textbook-centered curriculum and teacher control. In general, curricula are based on certain philosophies and beliefs about education that shape teachers' actions. Therefore, curricular changes involve changes in teacher beliefs and depend upon teachers' readiness for cooperation and experimentation. (Contains 58  references.) (TD)",

        "description":"An ethnographic study explored the university experiences of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) graduate and professional students at a West Coast research university. The study consisted of interviews with each participant, observations of students participating with other AI/AN students in 15 public events, and a meeting with the entire group. The eight participants were a diverse group, coming from different socioeconomic levels and different tribes, yet all had experienced academic isolation resulting from the influences of cultural incongruity, history, ethnicity, and community. One influence that did not emerge as important was racism. The alienation they experienced resulted not from the color of their skins but from their world views. AI/AN graduate and professional  students responded to experiences of isolation and cultural incongruity by constructing a surrogate community on campus, which helped them define their ethnicity. The study unexpectedly highlighted a professional program, the school of medicine, that has made strides in understanding AI/AN perspectives. The school has course offerings tailored to the needs of students planning to serve the AI/AN population, a staff member whose purpose is to serve AI/AN needs, a student organization, and some faculty and administrators who are sensitive to differences in cultural perspectives and understand the strengths that AI/AN cultures can bring to the practice of medicine.

        "description":"Rural communities with populations of under 15,000 are the least resilient to negative economic shocks, but local initiatives can reduce the negative impact of rapid economic change. Data from a study of three rural Australian communities and one &quot;community-of-common-purpose&quot; were used to develop a model of how the informal learning process inherent in community action builds resilient communities. Learning, social capital, and change are interlinked. The model identifies the resources used in the learning process, which are the resources that form the social capital of the community. These social capital resources are: (1) a knowledge of who can provide advice, support, information, and resources; and (2) identity resources, that is, a sense of belonging or willingness to act  for the benefit of the community. The model illustrates that social capital is built as it is used. Informal learning interactions help people get to know each other and develop networks. They also build a commitment to the community and people's confidence to act for community benefit. Both quantity and quality of interactions have a role in the development of social capital. Qualitative elements such as shared language, shared experiences, trust, personal development, and identification with the community help build knowledge and identity resources and thus improve the quality of learning interactions. An understanding of the ways in which communities develop and use social capital as they learn will help build resilient rural and regional communities. (Contains 41 references.)  (TD)",

        "description":"Rural areas around the world face problems stemming from the globalization of agricultural and other markets, the resulting competitiveness for existing and shifting markets, loss of population, and consequent decline of economic and social infrastructure. Rural communities need to develop the ability to manage change, and this requires engaging in learning processes of both a formal and informal nature. There is a growing recognition that social capital is as important as economic capital in community development. A new model of leadership is needed that fosters social capital by drawing on knowledge and identity resources. Enhanced social relations produce social well-being and cohesion, as shown in a case study of a rural Australian town that revitalized itself through the  whole-community activity of producing a huge silk tapestry. Based on 10 lessons gleaned from community development efforts in various U.S. cities, a model of &quot;situated leadership&quot; is postulated. Situated leadership does not flow from a predetermined &quot;right&quot; way to do things, but is determined by the nature of the changing situation at a particular location. The situated leader builds relationships across community sectors to establish common interests; develops relationships from qualities of historicity, externality, reciprocity, trust, and shared values; identifies relevant knowledge and identity resources; connects people with resources to plan futures; ensures the facilitation of networking across groups; and celebrates and documents successes.

Social capital is provisionally defined as the networks, norms, and trust that constitute the capacity of individuals, workplaces, groups, organizations, and communities to strive for sustainable futures in a changing socioeconomic environment. Participants in the study were chosen based on recommendations of community members on who provides them with help, advice, or information. Analysis of interviews, tape-recorded community meetings and interactions, and personal diaries identified three categories of resources that people draw on as they interact with each other: 1) knowledge resources, or the shared knowledge of community, personal, individual, and  collective information; 2) identity resources, or the shared understandings of personal, individual, and collective identities; and 3) consolidated resources, the common understanding and familiarity with community assets used reciprocally for mutual benefit. A set of indicators of these resources used in &quot;community interactive productivity&quot; was then developed. Interactive productivity is viewed as the community learning processes by which social capital is created. The terms &quot;community learning&quot; and &quot;capacity building,&quot; and the possible causal link between social capital and economic well-being are discussed. (Contains 56 references.) (TD)",

The intention is that the indicators will be applicable to geographic communities, professional or common interest communities, such as professional associations, and groups of businesses such as Executive Link[TM], the subject of this paper. Executive Link consists of farm businesses that meet for nonformal training in several chapters in eastern Australia. Each chapter consists of about six  farm businesses and their owner/managers who share their business management expertise. Executive Link appears to have features of a learning community, including a shared purpose and learning interactions across the boundaries of individual member businesses and chapters. This paper identifies networks, commitments, and shared values as the elements of social capital that contribute to the quality of learning interactions. Suggested indicators of social capital building include development of a shared language, shared experiences, trust, self-development, and an identification with the community.

Participants were chosen based on recommendations of community members concerning to whom they turn for help, advice, or information. Community interactivity was recorded using interviews, tape-recorded community meetings and interactions, and personal diaries. Findings indicate that informal learning is an important factor in the formation of social capital and that there are two categories of resources upon which people draw as they interact with each other. The first is knowledge resources, which comprise the common knowledge base of community, personal, individual, and collective information. These include knowledge of the  skills, knowledge, and affective attributes of other community members, and knowledge of the common physical resources of the community. The second is identity resources, which are the common understandings of personal, individual, and collective identities, categorized as social and civic identities. Formation of social capital depends on sufficient numbers of interactions in which members foster each others' learning by sharing knowledge resources, build each others' self-confidence or encourage positive identity shifts in each other, and exhibit trust. It was also found that microinteractive processes have the capacity to link with meso and macro social, civic, and economic outcomes. (Contains 64 references.) (TD)",

        "description":"This report describes principles of community organization that can contribute to sustainable community renewal. Community is composed of social networks which form the community infrastructure. Relationships among people with the same roles are passive; relationships that cross role boundaries are active. Communities that exhibit active relationships have the greatest potential for sustainable community action and renewal. Active relationships develop when an atmosphere conducive to democratic participation is available to all interested community members. Social capital is a measurement of the levels of social trust and active relationships present in the community. Social infrastructure can be likened to social capital, and components of social infrastructure that apply to the  rural context are outlined that revolve around trust and acceptance of diversity. Two tools that contribute to the creation and application of social capital, particularly in the rural context, are dialogue and school-community interaction. The process of bringing people together builds social capital, but to succeed, the process must be collaborative, not hierarchical. Dialogue is the first step toward collaboration. Three centers that promote dialogue are discussed, and case studies of dialogue in practice are given. School-community interactions are important because schools, especially in rural areas, are often the strongest community institution and youth are a vital resource that must be engaged into the community. Finally, five dimensions of successful collaborative development are  discussed. Appendices present dialogue centers, theoretical models of community development, and collaborative community development models. (Contains 22 references.) (TD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the role that culture and language can play in American Indian education, as well as some challenges of incorporating culture in education. The movement toward incorporation of language and culture in school curricula emerges out of a tattered educational history. This history shows how the use of Native languages and cultures in school has fallen on a continuum from English-only instruction to language and culture used only to achieve an ultimate goal of assimilation. Since the federal government funds most reform efforts in Indian education, it also determines the purpose and judges the success of such efforts. In contrast to assimilationist models of education, a bicultural education model expects that both the community and school will decide the purpose  of education. In moving toward authentic incorporation of Native languages and cultures through a bicultural model, Indian educators must address challenges involving the diversity of understandings of language and culture, the diversity of understandings of culturally appropriate education, and the diversity of experience and tribal affiliation. The first step in overcoming unequal positioning of Native languages and cultures is to identify the power structures determining the purpose of education. Native efforts to reform education require guidance from educational research that seeks to preserve Native languages and cultures and to create opportunities where Native people can succeed in education. A research agenda should consider theoretical models, historical research on Indian  education, practical studies on classroom teaching and learning, and related research on other minority groups.

The study looks at the effects that sharing of local expertise, the restructuring of the traditional professional development funding model, and a concentrated effort on curriculum implementation have had on teacher effectiveness and satisfaction, and classroom instruction. Data were gathered from two surveys given to 66 teachers and 10 administrators. Findings indicate that teacher networking was taking place on a large scale in the division and was meeting the needs of teachers; teachers reported a high degree of satisfaction; teacher networking was helping with  curriculum implementation, introducing teachers to new classroom teaching strategies and meeting their personal professional development goals; and teachers felt that funds were being used more efficiently and effectively. Administrators felt that the amount of money given to schools for professional development was inadequate and that although professional development funds had a positive impact on teacher performance, the impact on support staff was questionable. The model was more beneficial to early and middle-years teachers than to senior-years teachers and teachers without a regular classroom.

This paper is a summary of the first year results of a study that came from this initiative. In it are profiled four rural schools and the exemplary educational initiatives they have successfully installed and carried out. Federal Hocking High School (Ohio) adopted the &quot;Coalition of Essential Schools&quot; (CES) and &quot;Expeditionary Learning-Outward Bound&quot; programs and implemented block scheduling, multifunctional lunch periods, daily advisory meetings, team teaching, graduation  portfolios, senior projects, and community internships. Dawson-Bryant Elementary school, a K-5 school in southeastern Ohio, adopted the &quot;Success for All&quot; model, which focuses on reading instruction, and invested in information technology equipment, wiring, training, and software. Northport K-12 school in Michigan also adopted the CES model, but its signature initiative was the senior projects program. West Liberty Elementary school (Iowa), a PreK-2 school, installed the first two-way Spanish/English immersion program in the state. Elements of success common to all these efforts were a school culture that was amenable to change and experimentation and that emphasized continuous improvement, reflection, and self-analysis; attention to principles of change; solid research, in some cases up  to a year of research; local adaptation; and additional resources.

        "description":"A 3-year intervention project focused on preventing substance abuse, violence, gang violence, and truancy among K-12 students at the Chief Leschi School in Tacoma, Washington, a tribally controlled, urban school for high risk and adjudicated Native youth. This paper reports the elementary school results. The Positive Reinforcement in Drug Education (PRIDE) curriculum, a comprehensive plan that integrates school and tribal community efforts to address substance abuse, was enhanced by revising it for grades K-6 and integrating it with newly adopted essential learning standards. A series of teacher trainings was conducted to increase teacher effectiveness in dealing with violence and substance abuse by implementing social learning strategies with students across grade levels. Pre-  and post-assessment included interviews with key staff and three sets of quantitative data: school attendance, behavior records, and six student questionnaires about tobacco and drug use and future intentions. Data for grades 4-6 showed a significant decrease in emergence of drug-using behavior and the existence of risk factors over the 3-year project. Reported rates of alcohol and drug use decreased significantly since the fall 1996 surveys, although they generally increased during each academic year in each grade level due to socialization effects. Data are presented on use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and drugs and intentions of future drug use by grade, December 1996 through June 1999. (TD)",

        "description":"Some researchers have asserted that the poor outcomes from American Indian schools result from the lack of cultural fit between teachers and students. Data gathered from 258 American Indian faculty at U.S. colleges and tribal departments of education indicate that 65 institutions of higher education produced 1,347 new American Indian teachers during 1995-97, for an average of 449 per year, or about 2.3 percent of the demand. Seventy-five percent of these institutions were public colleges, one-sixth were private, five were tribal colleges, one was Bureau of Indian Affairs, and one was a tribe. In the 1,512 American Indian school districts, there were only 42 American Indian superintendents. To meet the unique cultural needs of American Indian students, it has been suggested that  both American Indian control over school boards and Indian control of school administration are necessary. Recommendations to achieve this goal include increasing the number of American Indians earning teaching credentials to 2,000 or more per year for 15 years; developing a corps of American Indian superintendents; developing a superintendent's institute; developing a school board institute; and developing exemplary programs in American Indian schools. Two tables present production of Native American teachers by institution and total American Indian superintendents by state. (Contains 16 references.) (TD)",

The research consisted of a retrospective study in which surveys were completed by 429 participants in outdoor programs sponsored by the Student Conservation Association, the National Outdoor Leadership School, and Outward Bound; and a longitudinal study in which surveys were completed before, after, and 6 months following participation in an outdoor program. Most respondents reported major impacts on their personal and intellectual development as well as outdoor recreational and environmental interests. A smaller but substantial minority viewed the experience as significantly affecting their career interest and inclination to contribute community service. This highly positive  outlook did not diminish over time. Most respondents reported far greater respect, appreciation, and spiritual connection with nature, and professed a stronger commitment to conservation and stewardship of the environment. Still, the actual degree of change in conservation behavior was limited and diminished over time. Substantial improvements in outdoor skills and interest in biology and natural history were noted. Increases in self-confidence, self-esteem, independence, autonomy, and initiative were reported. Substantial, although less striking, changes were observed in many elements of interpersonal relationship. The benefits reported stem from experiential, outdoor, and integrated components of the wilderness learning experience, which should be incorporated into conventional  educational curricula.

This definition tends to understate the problem. In 1997, 15.8 million employed parents had incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) can raise a full-time, minimum-wage earner's income above the poverty level, but one fifth of eligible families do not participate in EITC. Medicaid and many health insurance programs are available for the working poor and their families. Some families may even qualify for food stamps, housing assistance, child-care subsidies, and other programs. The working poor need information, assistance, skills to manage existing  resources effectively, and training for a better job. Providing working poor individuals with information about available resources is an important first step. Educational efforts should focus on life skills to better balance the demands of work and family and technical or vocational training leading to a better job. Programs need to provide accurate information to employers about assistance and support available in their community for the working poor. Employers should be encouraged to provide health insurance, retirement plans, and education to help employees maximize the benefits to which they are entitled. Working poor issues are community issues. Communities must have an infrastructure in place that supports working parents and provides opportunities for advancement. (TD)",

        "description":"A case study of an economically distressed rural Kentucky school district examined the theory that educational policy can enable community participation and that participation can enable policy implementation by affecting school governance and expanding the services provided. Primary data were gathered via interviews with four parent participants, one longtime community member activist, six educators, and one regional-level administrator who was also a longtime active community member. Secondary data came from newspapers, state government documents, policy papers, and critiques and updates of the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA). Findings indicate that during the decade prior to the passage of KERA, educational reform policies were few and did little to enable community  involvement in the district. Participation that did exist was loosely organized, project-oriented, and individualized, due to the absence of institutionalized structures for input. Passage of KERA led to changes in the level and type of local participation by enhancing the capacity of community members to get involved, creating incentives or decreasing disincentives to participate, providing new platforms (school councils) on which to provide input, and mobilizing local actors to get involved. One constant barrier to participation was a lack of personal resources due to low socioeconomic status. Recommendations for policymakers include maintaining localized structures; helping people develop skills for civic engagement early on, such as in school; and addressing the social and economic  development of low-income communities. The appendix includes the interview protocols. (Contains 32 references.) (TD)",

        "description":"Many Native Americans do not plan on attending college. In fact, many of them drop out of school to find work. Culturally sensitive, comprehensive school-to-work transition programs could greatly benefit the Native American population. Counselors need education in areas of Native American culture and customs. Counselors can build rapport with students by asking them about their heritage and allowing them to express their ideas and beliefs. Counselors should be aware that the strong bond to family that is characteristic of Native Americans often results in individuals taking a lesser job closer to home. For many Native Americans, decisions concerning one family member must go through proper channels in the family and tribe. School counselors should keep this in mind when  determining who should be involved in the child's vocational preparation. Although it is important to understand the problems of Native Americans, counselors should emphasize the positive values of Native American culture. Increased cooperation between tribes, employers, educators, and the community will facilitate the feeling of connectedness that is important to Native Americans. Industry tours, career days, open forums at schools, apprenticeships, mentor programs, and field trips increase student exposure to the workforce, which is often limited because of the rural nature of reservations. A classroom environment that encourages discussion about vocations would also be helpful. Two appendices present graduation and college application rates and serious problems in schools by type of  Indian school. (Contains 15 references.) (TD)",

Multi-age groups of eight children in grades 1-6 work with college student mentors for 3 1/2 hours each day, eating breakfast and lunch served family-style and creating print-rich environments that support their emerging literacy. The program emphasizes building partnerships between local and state agencies and communities. To sponsor an Energy Express site, a community collaborative of parents, groups, and organizations develops a proposal; generates a required local funding match; and assists in local planning, implementation, and evaluation. While West Virginia University Extension provides leadership, a number of state agencies and organizations and AmeriCorps work  together to fund and operate the program. Energy Express emphasizes the value of place, acknowledging research findings that curriculum based on place can be a vehicle to connect children's learning to their emerging identities as members of a community. Weekly themes progress from myself, family, friends, homeplace, and community, to the ideal world. During the final week, children complete a community service project. The literature used in the program and the program structures (small learning groups, print-rich philosophy, family-style meals, volunteerism, and community service) all tap into the children's sense of place. The program has been operating for 5 years, and nearly three-quarters of participating children have made substantial gains in reading. (Contains 27 references.)  (TD)",

This collection of five essays presents a number of themes that are central to the Rural Challenge's philosophy. &quot;Bringing It All Back Home: Reclaiming the Rural Story&quot; (Mary Casey) talks about the stories that give definition to the diversity of rural American communities. This perspective provides a richer way to think about &quot;rural&quot; as a concept, not just a demographic category. &quot;Democracy, Schools and Communities&quot; (Carla Fontaine) explores democracy as a critical legacy of rural education. Reviving the idea that school and community are intertwined can be an inspiration for reconstructing a  more local base for schools and rebuilding communities. &quot;On Living Well in Our Place: Earlier Rural Reform Movements&quot; (Julie G. Canniff) reviews efforts to revitalize rural schools and communities in the early 20th century, noting parallels with the Rural Challenge's efforts toward social, economic, and cultural revitalization of local communities and their reintegration with their schools. &quot;The Genius of Place&quot; (Ben Williams) provides a philosophical base to the concepts of place and community. Turning away from what is local and seeking progress in the far away can result in profound moral, spiritual, aesthetic and educational losses. &quot;Reflections on Leonard Covello: Teacher with a Heart&quot; (Vito Perrone) describes a teacher who brought a village conception to his urban school  environment. The essays aim to suggest additional possibilities for the school-community exchange interests of the Rural Challenge. (Contains 163 references.) (TD)",

        "description":"Over the last 50 years, American attitudes toward rural areas have shifted from pride and concern to indifference and ultimately neglect. This shift in attitudes has accompanied the decline in rural population. The media tend to portray rural areas in extremes, depicting either poverty, neglect, and despair, or breath-taking scenery and an idyllic lifestyle. Such conflicting representations feed misconceptions about rural areas. A good example of our neglect is found in rural education. Rural schools are underfunded, and rural students have been neglected in educational studies and viewed from a deficit perspective. The urban model imposed on rural areas has resulted in consolidation, not just of schools, but of governments and farms. Consolidation, whose primary aim has been to  save costs while improving rural education, has been described as the single most damaging policy for the quality of schooling and sustainability of rural communities in this century. Consolidation overlooks the wealth of knowledge, sensibility, and history embodied in the relationship between a community and its children, resulting in loss of valuable cultural capital. Successful rural school reform depends on rural community revitalization. Although the great diversity in rural areas complicates defining &quot;rural,&quot; the rural life fosters democracy, egalitarianism, and independence, which are foundational ideological elements not only of rural life, but of the United States as a whole. Thus, to preserve rurality is to preserve the foundation of our society. (TD)",

        "description":"Historically, participation in school affairs gave rural people a working knowledge of how democracy functioned. In the late 19th century, power shifted from the voice of the many to the voice of a few, as &quot;expert&quot; opinion increasingly influenced state legislators, governors, and national political leaders. The push to consolidate schools resulted from that thinking. Legislation has undermined the ability of citizens to make decisions at the local level, effectively disenfranchising a populace that had once so spiritedly engaged in local government, education, and community. As rural communities lost their core with the consolidation of their schools, their economic viability also dwindled, resulting in a loss of employment-seeking youth and community identity. Today, citizens  are making efforts to exert more local control, as evidenced by the charter school movement and efforts to resist further consolidation of consolidated schools. In a recent Gallup Poll, most respondents wanted public schools to prepare students to be responsible citizens; favored community service as a requirement for graduation from high school; and saw local teachers, not nonlocal leaders such as state legislators, as most committed to local public school improvement. It is possible that local schools and rural communities will thrive once again as concerned citizens exert more influence in the democratic process. (TD)",

        "description":"The Country Life Movement in the United States (1900-1920) emerged in response to the migration of rural people to the cities and the rising obsession with scientific knowledge. Modernizing rural areas and their institutions was seen as necessary to sustain rural communities at the economic and social levels of urban centers. Liberty Hyde Bailey, Horace Plunkett, and Theodore Roosevelt contributed ideas to the Country Life Movement. Three main themes of the movement were community sustainability, redirected community institutions, and participatory democracy. To this end, farmers were organized into cooperatives. Reforming rural education was central to the movement. The Cooperative Extension Service was born, and consolidated schools that served rural needs were advocated to  connect farm families to their local villages. The Antigonish Movement in Canada (1920-1950) sought to build up the spiritual and material wealth of society by meeting the needs and concerns of local communities. The tool for this was extension education; experts were removed from universities and placed side by side with leaders in small, poor communities. The Annenberg Rural Challenge intends to become a millennial educational reform movement by recommitting to these earlier movements' principles of economic sustainability; pedagogy that uses the community as laboratory and text; involvement of parents, congregations, community leaders, and local businesses in the day-to-day activities of the school; and development of leadership through direct action on behalf of the community.

        "description":"Public education was introduced in the United States at the beginning of the 19th century to replace the informal community-based education system that had broken down as a result of immigration and war. At the beginning of the 20th century, as America changed from a largely rural agricultural society to the modern industrial economy, education was criticized as not being synchronized with urban life, and rural areas and their schools were viewed as backward. John Dewey and other progressive educators linked education and community in a dynamic whole that would both temper and adapt to change. But the meaning of community was gradually separating from geographic location and becoming more abstract. Today, education is increasingly disengaged from the life of the local place it  serves. Qualities such as grounding and depth in education cannot be measured, yet research seems to indicate that when community involvement and support for education are high, students do better academically. The Annenberg Rural Challenge believes that education and community can share common benefits by implementing a pedagogy of place. Pedagogy of place uses what is local as a source of curriculum that deepens knowledge through the understanding of the familiar and accessible. Practical, aesthetic, and symbolic aspects of education can all be incorporated into a pedagogy of place. Politicians and educators have focused much attention on global issues such as global markets and hemispheric pacts, but they have paid little attention to the village. Acting responsibly on a local level  through place-based education will do much to alleviate global concerns. (TD)",

        "description":"Leonard Covello was an Italian immigrant who taught in East Harlem (New York City) from 1911 to 1956. This article, composed of excerpts from other works about or by him, illustrates his dedication to reciprocal relationships between school and community that are relevant today for both urban and rural communities. When Covello left school in his junior year to work, he learned that work was an important means of crossing physical and cultural boundaries and that work should be more connected to schools as a vehicle for enabling discussion about racial discrimination. Covello lived in East Harlem because it enabled him to see his students and their families in the streets and in their homes. He recognized that issues such as housing and medical care were important to the  community because he lived there, and it was natural for him to involve the school in such issues. The departments in the school developed their curricula around relevant community issues so that local matters formed a base for much of the learning. Covello involved his students in service learning such as citizenship education for immigrants. Covello felt that schools were ideally situated to be centers for democratic education; they are the only social agency that has direct contact with practically every family in the community and this contact is mandatory by law. Schools should therefore cultivate a spirit of friendliness and intelligent cooperation in the building of wholesome social and civic relationships. (TD)",

A 2-year study sponsored by the Royal Society of the Arts predicts that in the next 20 years, conventional full-time, permanent jobs will almost disappear; flexible working, in every sense, will be the norm; and the great revolution of flexibility will blur the boundaries between work and the rest of life. Globalization and technology are changing the way that businesses and work are organized and managed. As work and life are redefining themselves, learning must be redefined also. The aims and organization of schools are still educating people for the Victorian economy and society. A curriculum that focuses on drilling large quantities  of information into students' heads is useless when information is expanding exponentially. A curriculum for 2020 must focus not on acquisition of knowledge, but on development of competencies, defined as abilities to understand and to do. Next, the education system must take seriously the fact that people are different and learn in different ways. At present, there is little understanding or respect for different ways of learning; work-based learning is considered a second-class option, while experiential activities are often viewed as a treat or an add-on. In addition, the education system must recognize that learning occurs in places other than schools, that fully integrating information technologies into the delivery of education would turn the community into a learning resource.

        "description":"The Brahma Kumaris (BK) Spiritual University, headquartered in London, works toward helping others understand the role of spirituality in daily life and in creating a better world. In the early 1990s, a BK research project in 128 countries found that people's ideal vision of the future emphasized a return of the importance of values. In response, BK published a guide book that offered a universal approach to 12 spiritual values. BK was given general consultative status with the Economic Social Council of the United Nations and has been working with a UN agency to develop activities that promote incorporation of values in school curricula and to establish a program encouraging the spiritual development of young women. Another dimension of BK's work involves the practice of  reflection and self-evaluation. Very much a part of experiential learning, the reflection process promotes a form of active learning that transforms and opens the door for spiritual awakening and consciousness. Outdoor experiences, in particular, awaken feelings of the sacred and allow young people to become aware of spirituality in their own lives. Spirituality begins with an enquiry into the unique workings of one's own self. Life skills related to communication and interaction with others are developed through knowing the self and learning to move thoughts and feelings in a positive direction. With positive spiritual development comes emotional stability and enhancement of mental abilities. Education must return to the position of enabling each individual's spiritual potential to be  released. (SV)",

        "description":"Experiential learning as a field of practice is vast. This paper uses the metaphor of a tree to categorize experiential learning's variety, the roots being the underpinning theoretical traditions and the branches the various forms of practice. The place of experience is highly valued in three traditions of adult education: the progressive, humanist, and radical traditions. The goals, assumptions, and values of these traditions with respect to experiential learning are outlined. All three traditions view the development of the learner's ability to reflect upon experience as the key to learning potential. However, they differ in the nature and purpose of reflection. The progressive tradition taps experience as an additional source of knowledge, the humanist tradition pursues  personal wholeness, while the radical tradition sees reflection on experience as a means to empowerment and social transformation. Experiential learning practices may be grouped according to their end use or product: (1) documentation and assessment of learning from prior experience, perhaps to gain entry to higher education or to advanced standing; (2) use of experience in self-directed learning and learner-centered instruction as forms of educational innovation; (3) consciousness raising to effect social change; and (4) individual growth and development through personal reflection. The roots and branches of various organizations that use experiential learning are discussed, and emerging practices are examined. (Contains 10 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"This first article in a series on telecommunications in rural America provides an overview of several key telecommunication issues facing rural regions. High speed data services known as broadband have the potential to make rural areas less isolated and improve the rural quality of life, but physical barriers, sparse population density, and few markets present significant obstacles to their deployment in rural areas. Three types of broadband delivery--digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modems, and wireless--are discussed, along with their advantages and limitations for rural implementation. E-commerce, the use of the Internet for commerce, is expanding rapidly. Whether e-commerce will help rural enterprises thrive or hurt rural areas by increased by-passing of the middle man is  yet to be seen. The telecommunications industry was deregulated to offer customers the benefits of competition, but the need for a physical connection between the phone company and the customer makes true competition impractical, especially in sparsely populated rural areas. Rural and urban residents are unlikely to have the same competitive choices. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provided for subsidies to rural schools, libraries, and health care providers for various telecommunications services. Schools in rural high-cost areas were specifically targeted to receive the highest &quot;e-rate&quot; discounts. Recent regulatory developments have allowed wireless technologies to receive ETC (eligible telecommunications carrier) status. Whether regulators will require wireless services to replace  wireline service will have a profound effect on the availability of advanced services in rural areas. (TD)",

Broadband applications such as e-commerce, distance education, and telemedicine require a communications infrastructure that can move large amounts of data quickly. Currently, many rural regions lack such an infrastructure because broadband is limited by technological constraints prevalent in rural regions. Since providers are not required to offer broadband services to all regions, smaller communities are not top priorities. Satellite technology is the best hope for rural areas but will probably not be available  until 2002-03. In addition, an exemption in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for small rural telephone providers serves as an obstruction to those who would offer broadband in rural areas. Legislative and regulatory developments may help. The FCC is considering applying the definition of universal service to broadband services. If that happens, public funds would be available to offset the costs of bringing broadband to rural America. Bills addressing high-speed data and rural regions have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. (TD)",

Fundamental restructuring is necessary to accommodate this change, and the new California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) may provide a model. CSUMB has a commitment to serving underrepresented populations and establishing a multilingual, multicultural, intellectual community through the use of high-quality distance learning programs utilizing innovative pedagogies. Although CSUMB has entered into partnerships with private businesses that enable it to have the latest in educational technology, it is not the quantity of computers, but rather, new behavioral approaches to technological use that are absolutely necessary. CSUMB's approach to education  emphasizes outcomes and competencies and replaces a credit-based system with the assessment of demonstrated learning. CSUMB findings concerning the high tech environment include: (1) advanced technology greatly augments regular classroom instruction and is a viable delivery system for multilingual teaching and learning and for distance education, especially in underrepresented communities; (2) computer messaging systems facilitate writing across the curriculum and greatly improve student writing and logical skills in multiple languages; (3) computer technologies support active, rather than passive, learning; (4) coupled with visual materials, thinking textually is sufficient to improve literacy even when a liberal attitude is taken towards grammar, syntax, and spelling; and (5) computer  technologies promote participation and learning in traditionally communicative-apprehensive learners such as shy students, limited English proficient students, and women who avoid verbally confronting men.

This 1997-98 report begins with a mission statement, state goals, and identification and recruitment efforts. A section on home/school coordination discusses how parents help prepare Individual Services Plans for their children; participate in the planning of their local Migrant Program; and receive training in areas such as reading strategies, nutrition awareness, and teen issues. The Maine Migrant Parent Advisory Council  informs parents of the programs offered and any changes or legislation impacting the program. Student services include academic services, academic support services, English-as-a-second-language programs, Portable Assisted Studies Sequence, summer school programs, harvest schools, and the Maine Conservation Camp. Supportive services include the Migrant Health Voucher Program available to migrant families not eligible for Medicaid. Services offered and participating health centers are listed. The program evaluation section describes the Snapshot Assessment and the Migrant Performance Evaluation System, still under development, and presents charts showing migrant performance on the Maine Educational Assessment in reading, writing, and mathematics for grades 4, 8, and 11.

Attracted by the rural South's healthy economy, the Hispanic population in the South is projected to double by 2025. Most in-migrants are seeking permanent rather than seasonal employment. With an increased Hispanic population comes increased purchasing power. On the downside, higher concentrations of Latinos also impose immediate needs for education to meet additional or special needs of the new population; for bilingual media and religious services; and for bilingual service providers in health care, social services, and law enforcement. Many factors in successful development are related to social capital. Latinos must acquire additional social and human capital to fully contribute to the  economic prosperity of the rural South. This will require that meaningful interaction takes place between Latino and non-Latino residents in host communities. How the South decides to funnel its resources to enhance the skills and knowledge necessary for full participation of Latinos will determine how successful it will be at remaining in the economic forefront.

Schools gain resources and community support for educational initiatives, have the opportunity to develop an academic program rooted in experience, and can help students connect to the roles and responsibilities of adult society. Integrated school-community projects are best pursued through a formally organized collaborative group. Collaborative arrangements give structure to the process of developing an initiative, can help to bridge the factionalism that often arises within a community, provide a forum for airing concerns in a productive  way, maintain support and stability during changes in personnel or politics, increase the available pool of resources, and build local capacity for other community development efforts. Eight basic steps in the collaborative process are briefly described: convening a group, assessing strengths and needs, establishing purposes and priorities, learning to work well together, planning projects, implementing the plans, assessing the results, and sustaining achievements.

        "description":"The Monongalia County (West Virginia) Even Start Program is a comprehensive, rural, home-based family literacy program that provides families with adult literacy education, parenting education, and early childhood education. Although all Even Start programs conduct some home visits, the Monongalia County program is unique in that home visits are the primary service delivery mechanism. Following an overview of the national Even Start program and the Monongalia County program, this report describes an evaluation of program impact on the vocabulary development of child participants. The sample consisted of 32 children with an average age of 4 years, 4 months, and included 5 children for whom English was a second language (ESL) and 10 children with an active individualized education  plan (IEP). Even Start staff administered the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III) to the children on a pretest-posttest basis during the 1998-99 program year. Most children had 7-8 months of program participation. From pretest to posttest, PPVT-III scores increased significantly for the full group and the subgroups. The effect size of the point gain was &quot;moderate&quot; for the full group, &quot;large&quot; for the ESL group, and &quot;very large&quot; for the IEP group. The PPVT-III average age-equivalent score increased 13 months during an average treatment period of 7 months. Therefore, the children in the sample nearly doubled the vocabulary growth expected of them. (Contains 20 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"Researchers and other persons interested in promoting research about rural school busing met in Columbus, Ohio, in December 1998. Drawing on that meeting and the rural school literature, this report describes why school transportation is an important issue nationwide, explains the lack of research on rural school busing, proposes a research agenda, and recommends ways to use the agenda to foster research on the topic. School busing is relevant to nearly all school districts because of its theoretical relationship to the generic culture of U.S. schooling and its practical (but unknown) impacts on family life and school participation and on student achievement. A discussion of 20th-century school consolidation and professionalization trends and of the dominant, functionalist  framework for educational research suggests that the functionalist tradition privileges some topics of research over others. In particular, the concerns of rural families and communities about busing, often raised in protest to long bus rides and rural school closures, were in opposition to prevailing views of professionals and functionalist researchers and, therefore, unlikely to provoke much research interest. A research agenda is outlined in detail. Its categories (all in relation to rural school busing) are history, politics, spatial distribution of schools, consolidation, social and cultural circumstances, outcomes or correlates of schooling, children's health and safety, finance, and alternatives to current circumstances. Appendices include &quot;Long Rides, Tough Hides: Enduring Long  School Bus Rides&quot; (Belle Zars) and background on the collaboration between AEL and the Rural School and Community Trust Policy Program.

A study of schools with continuously improving or continuously declining writing portfolio scores led to identification of 36 indicators of successful writing programs. These indicators were used to develop a comprehensive needs assessment instrument, to be used in a school self-evaluation involving all stakeholders. This paper describes the pilot test and field test of the instrument, the School Study of Writing Instruction. The pilot test was carried out in a small K-6 school in western Kentucky and was deemed successful due to faculty participation and sense of ownership and the steering committee's customizing of the instrument. The results generated 18  recommendations and 22 proposed revisions. The field test was conducted in 11 primarily rural and small-town schools. The revised instrument involved a process in four steps: interviewing administrators, students, and teachers using questions related to the 36 quality indicators; writing a report profiling the school; rating the school on the indicators; and setting priorities for improvement. Five schools were assigned an external facilitator. Overall, conclusions about the self-study process were positive. Most schools completed the study to a satisfactory point and believed the effort to be worthwhile. The time required was a concern, but facilitator assistance was highly beneficial. The instrument was generally valid and reliable, but may be improved with various adjustments.  Appendices contain statistical data tables and a time and task summary. (Contains 30 references.)

The reliability of the Turkish translation of STAS-II was found to be 0.80 with the test-retest method. There is a significant mean difference between class levels (p=0.027). Teachers colleges and student gender do not show significantly mean differences based on STAS-II scores. However, the uniqueness of the nationwide science curriculum and the  unification of the education system may have importance in developing similar attitudes among Turkish students. (Author/YDS)",

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a 2-year study investigating the types of experiences and support necessary for in-service teachers to effectively integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in their teaching/learning environments. The complex nature of GIS software prompted the authors to ask whether GIS can be a useful tool in the classroom. In an effort to answer this question, workshops were conducted, assessed, and revised in an iterative process. Assessment measures included classroom observations, interviews, participation in Web-based discussions, and lesson plan analyses. Results include documentation and rationale for the evolution from an intensive multi-day workshop with follow-up classroom support to a three-part series of workshops distributed over a 6-month  period with classroom support available. Qualitative analyses include excerpts from classroom observations, interviews, and lesson plans which contrast the level and type of use by teachers who participated in the in-services. Many of the 15 participants in the first workshop did not successfully integrate GIS into their classrooms settings. The large majority of participants in the last workshop were able to plan and implement lessons incorporating GIS in meaningful contexts. GIS is a tool that is being used extensively by researchers, scientists, and planners. Until recently it was not feasible for educators to use this spatial data resource because the cost of the software was prohibitive and the size of the data files was too large to load on the personal computers used in most school  settings. Demand from public and private sectors, coupled with spiraling innovations in technology, have resulted in the recent introduction of software which can be used to manipulate spatial data on personal computers. Software companies such as Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) have produced software bundles for school systems at affordable educational prices. Educators who have had the opportunity to explore these resources are excited about the potential of these spatial data resources to enhance the achievement and conceptual understanding of students in content areas including geography, science, mathematics, art, and technology. Students can investigate real-world problems to understand concepts and patterns about such topics as climate, human usage patterns,  and the earth as a system. These same patterns can serve as inspiration for art projects, and the software tools can allow multiple perspectives. Students can also take on the role of planners by querying the spatial data to help manage crop production, range management, county, and city planning. The purpose of this study is to develop effective professional development workshops in the use of GIS. This includes the support and information necessary for interested Wyoming teachers to use these resources in their classrooms to increase and enhance student achievement in areas of art, science, mathematics, geography, and technology.

The Collier Chautauqua Program (CCP) implemented the Iowa Chautauqua model at the district level in Collier County, Florida. A formative evaluation of the implementation of CCP focused on teacher enhancement resulting from participation in the program, teacher concerns regarding classroom implementation of instructional innovations, and issues related to district-wide implementation of the program. Results were communicated regularly to the district administrators responsible for program implementation throughout the two year period of evaluation. A reflective analysis of the process of formative  evaluation reveals challenges involved in conducting evaluation activities, limitations of the use of a survey instrument with Likert-type response scale, and limitations of qualitative approaches to data collection. Identification and discussion of these challenges are useful for improving formative evaluations, which in turn should improve the professional development program informed by such an evaluation.

The study focused on PCK with respect to a central issue in science teaching; i.e., relating macroscopic phenomena to microscopic particles. The collection of data involved two written questionnaires, interviews with every individual preservice teacher and their respective mentors, and an audio recording of a specific workshop session in the teacher education program. Results indicated a growing awareness among the preservice teachers concerning the need, in teaching situations, to explicitly relate the macro level and the micro level to each other. Moreover,  the importance of the careful and consistent use of language was noticed by many preservice teachers. The growth of PCK appeared to be influenced mostly by the preservice teachers' teaching experiences. Also, the workshop appeared to contribute substantially. Finally, for some preservice teachers, their mentors appeared to have influenced the growth of PCK. Implications for science teacher education are discussed. (Contains 25 references.) (Author/YDS)",

Only the stems of the items were selected from the VOSTS; the multiple-choice responses were developed according to the original procedure outlined by the original authors (Aikenhead and Ryan, 1992). Results indicated that Emirates high school science students held mixed understandings about the epistemology of science. About 21-68  percent of students' responses were classified as religious understanding about the nature of science; 9-70 percent of students' responses were classified as traditional understanding of science; and 3-59 percent of students' responses were classified as constructivist understanding of science. The results suggested that students' cultural background influence their views about the epistemology of science. People involved in science teaching in the United Arab Emirates should consider students' cultural background when developing and presenting science curriculum materials. (Contains 60 references.)

One hundred and thirteen junior or senior level elementary education majors enrolled in science methods courses at a large Midwestern university participated in this study. A 29-question survey was created by one of the authors. The question focused on the causes, effects, and interactions of three environmental issues, greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, and acid rain. Students answered the questions on a Likert Scale. Students were invited to explain their answers in the space provided below each question. In addition, five students agreed to an in-depth follow up interview to  further explore their knowledge level and preconceptions. An analysis of the survey data indicates that the majority of preservice elementary teachers possess an array of incorrect ideas about the causes and effects of the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, and acid rain. Recommendations are made for changes in the preparation of preservice elementary teachers to address the deficiencies identified in this study. (Contains 24 references.) (Author/YDS)",

        "description":"Teachers play a major role in the creation of student learning experiences. Conventional wisdom suggests that teachers' knowledge, beliefs and values influence their instructional choices. However, attempts to describe the decision-making process have yielded inconclusive results. Analysis of the beliefs, intentions, and actions of two exemplary science teachers using a project approach to teaching revealed consistent themes that suggest instructional practices are guided by teachers' implicit conceptions. The research project used a naturalistic design to examine teachers' beliefs, and actions in context. Data were gathered about teachers' beliefs using an adaptation of the Conceptions of Teaching Science Protocol (Hewson, Kerby, and Cook, 1995). An interview about instances  served as a probe of teachers' beliefs about the ideal goals of project-based science. Teachers' oral and written instructions to students provided information about their intentions to promote a particular science program, and classroom observations and assessment instruments became the source of data about teachers' actions. Statements from each of these sources was classified and grouped, then examined for the presence of common themes. The themes were summarized as a description of the teachers' conceptions and examined by the participants to affirm its authenticity. As a result of this analysis, two teachers with different explicit beliefs about science teaching produced remarkably similar learning experiences for their students. Despite important differences in school culture,  demographics and philosophy of teaching, these veteran science teachers created variations on the project-based approach to science that offer students rich experiences consistent with the recommendations of major reform documents. The value of the study comes from its illumination of a process that can elicit meaningful insight into the influences underlying the origin of classroom events. The potential for effective modification of instructional practices is enhanced by a clearer understanding of teachers' role in the creation of curriculum. (Contains 25 references.) (Author/YDS)",

Over the last decade, students have used technology such as graphics calculators, statistical software, spreadsheets, and computer algebra systems (CAS) extensively in tackling extended investigative, problem solving, and modeling tasks as part of their school based assessment. The use of graphics calculators has been permitted in calculator neutral mathematics examinations since 1997, while from 2000, these examinations will be set with assumed student access to an approved graphics calculator and will also include some calculator active questions. This development has been supported by the  implementation in 2000 of a revised senior mathematics study that includes a technology active learning outcome for all mathematics courses. The University of Melbourne, in partnership with Board of Studies, Victoria, and three calculator companies, has received a major Commonwealth government 3-year research grant 2000 - 2 to undertake a pilot study (http://www.edfac.unimelb.edu.au/DSME/CAS-CAT) for a CAS active mathematics course and corresponding CAS active examinations, and to plan for its possible accreditation within a revised mathematics study.

Is the use of data and its collection desirable to the mathematical learning process? The answer is a resounding yes! Not only can significant mathematical ideas be taught in the process; colleagues are also helped in the sciences. When done correctly, students actively involved in the data collection process take ownership of the data and of the mathematical learning that follow. Ownership, in turn, leads to understanding a key component that may be missing in traditional instruction. Students and teachers must know how to use the software and follow proper data collection techniques. Both of these can be learned with practice in doing data collection.  There are marvelous opportunities to collaborate with a science teacher. Data collection is a learned skill, and many times mathematics teachers don't have the \"lab\" skills that science teachers have because traditionally mathematics has not been thought of as an experimental science. Teachers must also be able to ask good questions to help guide and direct students as they start an activity. If used as a demonstration in class, the teacher must be able to lead students to the desired mathematical outcome--understanding a mathematical concept. (ASK)",

        "description":"Considering that, of the 250 million new cases of water-associated diseases reported every year, 75% occur in tropical, poor, rural areas and slum-outskirts of big cities, it becomes clear that water education is a priority. This booklet illustrates that early water education can benefit the entire community. Since habits related to water use are learned very early in life, children's water education is vital. Chapter 1 considers a guide to the planning of training programs attuned to local cultures. Chapter 2 reviews children's specific needs and activities. These constitute the entry points through which water education can be developed with the most rapid and positive effects both on children's health and on the health of their entire community. Chapter 3 highlights the  specific needs of the most vulnerable segment of the community--infants and mothers. Chapter 4 focuses on some appropriate techniques for children to use in their homes that may draw their parents in and improve the family's well-being. Chapter 5 introduces ways of helping children improve their community's comprehensive protection. Chapter 6 suggests ways of educating children to take responsibility and actively participate in the collective changes that can promote health and environmental security. (Contains 16 references.)

These predictors included gender, race, socioeconomic status, and previously earned grades in mathematics. Data came from the base year of the National Educational Longitudinal Study of Eight Graders (NELS 88). A random sample of 180 students consisting of 30 Black males, 30 Black females, 30 White males, 30 White females, 30 Hispanic males, and 30 Hispanic females were selected from the data set. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Females were no less likely to score well on mathematics standardized tests than were their male counterparts. However, there were differences between racial groups.  The effects of socioeconomic status varied among groups but were found to be consistently significant across racial lines.

Four high schools were selected in which Learning Logic was used for some Algebra I sections and in which other sections of Algebra I were taught without the use of Learning Logic. All such students who enrolled in Algebra II were included in the sample. Results of the analysis of Algebra II grades of these students revealed no significant differences between students who used Learning Logic in Algebra I and students who did not use Learning Logic in Algebra I. Teachers who used Learning Logic noted some  benefits in terms of attitudes of students. (Author)",

Today most leadership scholars see leadership as a process of a functional role in a group, which may be taken up later by another individual depending on the needs and tasks of the group. This curriculum guide is the result of a model partnership between a university and a high school in developing the beginnings of a school for citizenship and leadership. The guide begins with a foreword by James MacGregor Burns, a preface by the editor, and an introduction, &quot;Why Teach Leadership?&quot; by Gill Robinson Hickman. It is then divided into three sections: (1) &quot;Getting Started--John F. Kennedy High School: A Case Study&quot; (Juana Bordas with Lisa Levin  Itte); (2) &quot;Foundations of Leadership--A Model High School Leadership Course&quot; (Jeff Schultz); and (3) &quot;Leadership Learning across the Grades and Disciplines--Sample Lessons and Activities for Grades K-12&quot; (Carol Starr). An afterword by Donald N. Bigelow and a list of suggested readings and resources conclude the guide. Attached are four appendixes: &quot;Predicting High School Student Leadership&quot; (Benjamin Schneider; Michelle C. Paul; Susan Schoenberger); a list of 1995 CivicQuest Teachers' Institute participants; contributors; and acknowledgments. (Contains 14 references.) (BT)",

        "description":"The more than 20 countries that participated in Phase 1 of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) Civic Education Study were asked to respond to 18 sets of framing questions formulated by an international planning committee. A National Expert Panel met to generate responses to the 18 sets of framing questions. Panelists volunteered to draft written responses to approximately two questions each, commenting on six points raised by the international committee: importance, policies, terminology, public discourse/controversy, organizations, and sources. Drafts were then evaluated by the whole panel. The National Expert Panel identified the questions they thought would be of highest priority, and these priorities were considered along with  those of the other participating countries when the international committee selected the four core international questions addressed in the third document in this series. An annotated list of organizations involved in civic education in the United States is part of this document; these nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, and varied groups provide materials, educate teachers, sponsor contests, influence policy, and draw attention to particular facets of civic education. Information was obtained from the &quot;Encyclopedia of Associations 95,&quot; as well as from organizational Web sites, responses from a survey sent to organizations, telephone interviews with organizational staff, and brochures obtained from exhibits.

The more than 20 countries that participated were asked to gather data to answer four Core International Framing Questions (CIFQs). Volume 2 explains the process from which the CIFQs emerge. All participating countries were asked to gather data on what students ages 14-15 are expected and/or likely to learn about: (1) democracy, political institutions, and rights and responsibilities of citizens; (2) national identity; and (3) social cohesion and diversity. For the fourth question, countries were to select either media, local participation, or the connection between the political and economic system. A National Expert  Panel decided that for the fourth question data would be collected on what students are expected or likely to learn about the connection between the economic and political systems. The panel identified textbooks, state social studies coordinators, teachers, students, or organizations as the most appropriate data sources for obtaining information on each of the 11 points (textbooks, courses, instructional activities, assessment, extracurricular activities, activities outside the class, teacher training, media, influence of political parties, obstacles, and changes over the last 10 years) raised by the international planning committee. Further, panelists drafted initial interview protocols for student and teacher focus groups, questionnaires for organizational and state surveys, and a  rubric for a content analysis of textbooks. (Contains 12 tables, 10 references, and appendixes with survey instruments and interview protocols, summary of state survey, and a list of textbooks evaluated.) (BT)",

On the tour, students discover firsthand the unique resources of Lowell, Massachusetts, and the Park, while the workshop brings these historic resources to life as students build their own water power systems. During the tour, students travel aboard a turn-of-the-century trolley to the Suffolk Mill where they trace the transfer of water power from canal to turbine, and along the lineshafts, belts, and pulleys to a power loom producing cotton cloth; students also conduct experiments regarding power transmission using an exhibit featuring the same simple machines that are used to transmit power in  the mill. The workshop divides the students into two groups: one works in the &quot;wheel pit&quot; area where they build and test water wheels in a schematic water power site; the other works on the &quot;mill race&quot; activity in which problems arising from the design and construction of pre-canal power systems are solved.

After an introduction to the two primary workforces in Lowell, students learn about the mill environment and gain insight into the changing nature of work and workers' lives. In the workshop, each student is given a role card based on the life of an actual immigrant to Lowell. Once all the students have been processed through  immigration, members of the six ethnic groups find some background information on their group, their homeland, and their reasons for immigrating to Lowell.

        "description":"Some educators contend that students who engage in activities related to school subjects learn more efficiently and more effectively, and remember what they have learned much longer than students who do not. Service-Learning (S-L) can provide a central focus around which educational change can occur. Moreover, S-L enhances the ideas promoted by various circles of school reform. Theodore Sizer's nine principles and David Berliner's management of teaching are a few of the philosophies that provide the sound theoretic foundation for instituting S-L programs. Kate McPherson (1989) suggests S-L facilitates school reform while providing an expanded pedagogy to meet the learning styles and needs of all students, making learning relevant and exciting and necessitating critical thinking  about what has been learned. Several examples of &quot;serving with meaning&quot; demonstrate the power of S-L as a classroom strategy. S-L becomes part of the educational process in elementary school programs when it is integrated into curriculum areas. This integration comes readily since S-L is often a natural extension of the content and skills already being developed in the classroom and does not distract but rather enhances existing curriculum.

        "description":"This booklet discusses a program to strengthen the civic qualities of Mexican citizens in order to respond to Mexico's present and future challenges. The booklet enumerates the current situation, pinpointing indicators that show the Mexican government's need for attention: the nature of the Mexican political system does not support active participation by citizens in monitoring and influencing public policy; the proportion of women who have participated effectively in some kind of political protest is only half that of men; the hegemony of a unique party, murders with political tinges, and scandals surrounding political figures have generated a rejection of politics by certain sectors of the population; Mexican citizens are less well informed than citizens of other countries  about public issues; and activities which benefit the community are not generally included in civic education in Mexico. In response to the present situation, the program's primary objective is to endow the new institutional frameworks and governmental programs with the support required for viability and effectiveness in strengthening Mexicans' civic qualities. The defining characteristics of the new citizen profile must be inspired in values and principles translated in inclinations and attitudes; but in order to have a real impact over reality, future citizens must develop certain skills (especially the various communication skills) to be able to act as participatory and active citizens within the community. The booklet states that the Ministry of the Interior (SEGOB) will contribute to  spread values, principles, attitudes, and skills that must be inculcated in the 21st century citizen. It concludes by asking and answering &quot;Who Is a True Citizen?&quot; and &quot;Why Must We Love Mexico?&quot; (BT)",

        "description":"The Indian people are living longer, more women are working, and the country's one billion inhabitants are becoming more industrial and urban. This research paper analyzes the impact of social changes in India upon its elderly population. The paper's specific objectives are to identify some major social changes in India as described by various sociological studies; examine the impact of these social changes upon the elderly population; identify the specific social problems of the elderly in India; document the programs that governmental and non-governmental agencies in India are implementing to serve older adults' needs; assess the effectiveness of these programs based on evaluative studies by Indian researchers; and suggest major public policy changes needed to ensure quality of  life for the Indian elderly. The paper discusses the Indian elderly in historical perspective (based upon library research) and develops a needs assessment of the contemporary Indian elderly population. The following conclusions may be derived: (1) there is a large body of research about the Indian elderly, mostly conducted and published in India; (2) social changes in India have adversely impacted the status of the Indian elderly; (3) announcement of a public policy for the Indian elderly in 1999 is a good beginning; (4) more multi-disciplinary research is needed about the Indian elderly; and (5) some international non-governmental organizations operating in India that derive their financial resources from foreign donors are becoming involved in delivering services to the Indian elderly.  In addition, public education about the needs of the elderly population is necessary. Contains 3 tables of data and an 81-item bibliography. (BT)",

        "author":["Mohapatra, Urmila"],
        "description":"A study analyzed the service needs of the South Asian elderly population of Leicester, England, and also dealt with the role of South Asian ethnic organizations in delivery of services to these elderly. The South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis) constitute about 23% of the population of the city and number around 65000 persons. It is estimated that the city of Leicester has about 50000 elderly people (60+) of these elderly, South Asians number slightly over 11000. The service needs of these South Asian elderly are comparable to that of the general elderly population of Leicester. Studies have also identified some special needs of the South Asian elderly. The services of the public and nonprofit organizations of Leicester are available to all elderly, and a number of  South Asian organizations are responding to the special needs of the South Asian elderly. Public funds and some voluntary contributions fund these organizations. South Asian elderly in Leicester also need access to caregivers with South Asian language skills since some South Asian elderly do not speak English. The South Asian ethnic organizations appear to be responsive to the special needs of the South Asian elderly population of England. Needs assessment for the elderly should be ongoing, as should be assessment of the effectiveness of the various programs designed for the South Asian elderly population of Leicester. This study is an example of a cross-cultural study in social gerontology. Contains 5 tables of data and 37 references. Appended are illustrations, maps, and data relating  to the South Asian elderly population of Leicester. (BT)",

Lee and George Peabody, whose rare encounter marked a symbolic turn from Civil War bitterness toward reconciliation and the lifting power of education. The paper presents an overview of Lee's life and professional and military career followed by an overview of Peabody's life and career as a banker, an educational philanthropist, and one who endowed seven Peabody Institute libraries. Both men were in ill health when they visited the Greenbrier Hotel in the summer of 1869, but Peabody had not long to live and spent his time confined to a cottage where he received many visitors. Peabody received a resolution of praise from southern dignitaries which read, in  part: &quot;On behalf of the southern people we tender thanks to Mr. Peabody for his aid to the cause of education...and hail him benefactor.&quot; A photograph survives that shows Lee, Peabody, and William Wilson Corcoran sitting together at the Greenbrier. Reporting that Lee's own illness kept him from attending Peabody's funeral, the paper describes the impressive and prolonged international services in 1870. It also discusses historic events around the time of Peabody's death, especially the &quot;Trent Affair,&quot; and Prime Minister Gladstone and Queen Victoria's gratefulness to Peabody for his housing gift in relieving the conditions of the poor of London. Author research information and a list of publications on Peabody are included. (BT)",

The personnel responsible for curriculum development and competency-based education who use the model must be able to view the entire program holistically, yet work to facilitate implementation of the component parts. The model's introductory sections, while useful for social studies teachers, are designed to provide direction for those responsible for developing the social studies program. The model includes the following for grades prekindergarten through 12:  (1) suggested instructional objectives; (2) suggested performance objectives; (3) recommended strategies for assessments; and (4) a recommended program of intervention services. The primary purpose of the pre-K through high school social studies program is to help young people understand through the study of the past and present what it means to be a human being in society and to develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world of finite resources. This integrated study is articulated across grade levels to achieve the purpose of the program--the promotion of civic competence. Contains a glossary, a 21-item bibliography, and two appendices.

This compilation is designed to show the service-learning process in action. The collection presents outstanding examples of successful service-learning projects as described by Wisconsin teachers representing every grade level, numerous disciplines, and a variety of student interests. The volume notes that current research indicates that students who participate in service-learning projects connect learning to their world and achieve better grades. Following an introduction that explains the service-learning process, the collection outlines 14 high school projects, 3 cross-grade-level projects, 4 middle  school projects, and 5 elementary school projects. An Appendix lists Wisconsin's model academic standards (relating to the projects) for agricultural education, business, English language arts, environmental education, family and consumer education, health education, information and technology literacy, marketing education, mathematics, music, physical education, science, social studies, technology education, and visual arts.

        "author":["Benton, Mary"],
        "description":"A program for improving student attitudes and achievement in art was developed and implemented. Targeted population consisted of eighth-grade students (n=28) in a junior high school in a suburban community near a large Midwestern city. The problem of poor attitudes and disinterest in art was documented with student surveys and self assessments, a behavior checklist, and teacher anecdotal records. Analysis of probable cause indicated that students considered art a low priority in their education, leading to poor quality, missing, or late assignments. Review of the research indicated that art is not regarded as a major content area and is overlooked or displaced in the curriculum, and often considered only necessary for the artistically talented. A review of suggested solution  strategies, combined with analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the establishment of a professional art gallery to display student work, the matting and framing of student projects, and the creation of student portfolios. The program also included new lessons geared to be meaningful and relevant for students. Activities and discussion topics were developed to communicate to students that art is not only for the artistically talented. A description of the art program and its importance in their children's well rounded education was presented to parents at an open house. Post-intervention data indicated that more students exhibited an interest in art and gave the subject a higher priority in their education. Research is necessary to determine whether improved attitudes and  achievement are a result of the intervention. (Contains 17 tables of data and 29 references. Eleven appendixes contain forms, surveys, letters, and assignments.) (BT)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the rationale for a new course in the history of American protest music which was offered during 1999 at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Ohio. Noting that the course was team taught by a U.S. history professor and a librarian with expertise in the area, the paper states that the course aimed to survey U.S. history through songs of protest and complaint, thereby telling the history of the United States from the bottom up. The paper lists learning outcomes and states that the course met twice a week for 75 minutes with an enrollment of 21 students. The class examined the following topics: What Is Protest Music?; Spirituals and Work Songs; Songs about Racism; Songs of the Wobblies; Songs of the Depression; Songs of Aunt Molly Jackson; Songs of Sarah Ogan  Gunning; Songs of Woody Guthrie; People's Songs and the American Left; Songs of Pete Seeger; Songs of Bob Dylan; Anti-War Songs; Vietnam's Aftermath; The Talking Blues; Songs of the Civil Rights Movement; Songs about the Environment; Songs of Feminism; and Contemporary Protest Music.

Major goals of the teacher resource materials are to provide students with: information about Father Damien (1840-1889) and his work with the Hansen's disease patients at Kalawao, Moloka'i; primary and secondary data to help them process and construct conceptual understandings about (1) culture and disease, (2) arts and humanities surrounding representation of Father Damien, (3) the memoralization of Father Damien, and (4) the perspectives surrounding the historical and political era of Father Damien's  service; and the opportunity to apply the knowledge to understand current issues and become active participants in authentic social-action solutions. The guide's learning modules are guided by the Hawaii Content and Performance Standards. These content standards identify the broad concepts, skills, and dispositions that clarify and define what students should know and be able to do as a result of the particular learning module selected. Using the standards, participating educators can focus on specific grade-level benchmarks. (BT)",

The targeted population consisted of students in fourth grade, sixth grade, and special education classrooms (n=46) in three different school districts. Income levels varied among school districts. Targeted behaviors included fighting, defiance, being off-task, and other disruptions. An examination of probable causes for this lack of social skills revealed that societal influences did not encourage positive character development. Poor peer relationships kept students from making intelligent choices. There was also a lack of consistency and expectations to develop these skills in the different environmental settings in which the students lived. After observing classroom behaviors and  reviewing professional literature, a decision was made to select three interventions. The researchers developed and implemented a series of lessons focusing on different character traits. Outside speakers visited and encouraged the students to recognize the importance of these character traits. Results of post-intervention data indicated that direct instruction and reinforcement of positive character traits lowered incidences of fighting, defiance, off-task behaviors, and other distractions to their learning. Peer relationships also improved, but students still lacked in respecting others, and more work is needed in this area. (Contains a table, 3 figures, and 22 references. Seven appendixes include a character education survey, behavior checklist, and student activities.)  (Author/BT)",

Adding to this idea the realization that all stories evolve from out of our cultures, the article suggests societies are shaped by the circularity and interaction of this combination. It focuses on the relation between story and tolerance. The article uses A. A. Milne's &quot;Winnie the Pooh,&quot; as a metaphor to (1) explain the internal structure of a 'multi-differentiated' family and community and (2) illustrate the idea that through the familial and cultural use of stories, we set up boundaries, expectations, belief systems, behaviors, rules and norms and establish levels of tolerance that explain and humanize the effect of differences  that are found within our social groupings. The research methodology combines literary exploration and individual interviews (a family social worker specializing in U.S. subcultures; a married mother of four; one male and one female child of 'story book ages').

        "description":"This paper presents an argument for self-study of teacher education practices as a means-and-ends tool for promoting reflective teaching. The assertion is that self-study serves a dual purpose: as a means to promote reflective teaching and as a substantive end of teacher education. The argument consists of a five-part theoretical rationale for the use of self-study in reflection-oriented teacher education programs. Taken together, the various components of this rationale suggest that the promotion of reflective teaching will require something other than an additive approach to teacher education reform. Rather, self-study calls for a reconceptualization of the very process of teacher education itself. When teacher educators adopt self-study as an integral part of their own  professional practice, the terrain of teacher preparation shifts. Self-study becomes more than just a means to the aim of reflective teaching--self-study becomes an end of teacher education in its own right. (Contains 36 references.) (Author/SM)",

The units had either a science theme or science integrated with themes from other disciplines. The multicultural component was analyzed using Banks' Dimensions of Multicultural Education and Approaches to Multicultural Education (which include five dimensions of multicultural education and four levels of multicultural curriculum reform). Gender and ethnicity were also examined. Of the 45 predominantly female students who completed units, 14 were African American, 5 were Hispanic American, 3 were Asian American, and 23 were  Anglo-American. Results indicated that students attempted to integrate multicultural approaches in their lessons to various degrees. Of the 38 students who addressed multiculturalism or diversity, 6 demonstrated equity pedagogy and 32 demonstrated content integration; 3 demonstrated both content integration and equity pedagogy; and 1 demonstrated content integration with knowledge construction. Students did not apply any levels above level 2 on Banks' typology of multicultural approaches. Most students used level 1, the contributions approach. Students preferred the curriculum approach of content integration more than any other approach. (SM)",

It highlights obstacles and supports she encountered while working at two early education schools during the project's first 2 years and examines her need for the same kind of deep-seated, reflective, and transformative professional development required of teachers with whom she worked. Ethnographic methods were used to describe her experiences, including field notes of activities and feelings about both sites, monthly invoices, periodic progress reports, minutes from project meetings, documents and artifacts about reform, and notes from a support  group meeting for professional developers. The paper concludes with lessons learned that were different from those already reported in other projects. For example, her role as middleman (linking the reformers sponsoring the change to the school teachers and principals) was difficult and complicated her role as coach. Implications for reform include: change is complex, and attention to its process is important; sensitivity to change processes means interrogating one's own and others' assumptions about how learning happens; and professional developers need professional development.

Data in the form of extended written responses were obtained from student teachers in a rural, southern teacher education program at the end of their student teaching experience in the spring semester. Participants were asked to generate classroom management strategies in response to hypothetical problems that occurred in the classroom, discussing strategies they would use in handling two hypothetical vignettes of defiant behavior and specific strategies that might not work. Data analysis indicated that student teachers' reported strategies for both vignettes were more similar than different. They most frequently reported that they would send  the student to the office, give verbal directives to stop the behavior, lecture or reprimand, talk to both students separately, and involve the principal or parents. Strategies they typically considered ineffective included yelling or screaming at the students or threatening punishment. What was absent from the student teachers' responses were proactive measures to prevent such behavior or attempts to socialize the students to cooperate with learning goals. (SM)",

The study also examined whether lack of readiness for SDL was an implementation obstacle. Finally, it noted other barriers and obstacles to full implementation of a teacher performance appraisal policy in one Newfoundland school district. The researcher analyzed current literature dealing with teacher professional growth, teacher performance appraisal, TE, and SDL in an attempt to isolate barriers to full implementation of a teacher performance appraisal process that encourages SDL. The study analyzed the Newfoundland school district's implementation of a teacher  performance appraisal policy using teacher and administrator surveys and interviews. Results highlighted several themes related to this process within the school district: rationale, implementation, barriers, responsibility, uniqueness, and growth realization. Teachers' levels of TE influenced their attitudes toward, and success in, this new process which encourages SDL. This influence, in turn, affected teachers' professional growth experiences in the process itself. Teachers believed that the most effective and meaningful teacher evaluations were self-directed. Barriers to implementation included time and teacher-administrator relationships. (Contains 54 references.) (SM)",

The paper highlights experiences that have promoted the development of three middle school mathematics teacher leaders. First, it describes the professional journey of an exceptional teacher leader with 40 years of experience in diverse school environments. Next, it examines the training of two others who are still emerging as teacher leaders. The stories underscore the reality that efforts to promote improvements in mathematics education programs will not succeed unless they are coupled with opportunities that target teachers'  need to grow as professionals. All three teachers share a strong commitment to raising the level of student mathematics achievement, making personal changes and improvements to positively affect their teaching quality. All three work to evaluate their teaching and strengthen their weaknesses. Two of the teacher leaders realized that they did not know enough math to truly engage their students in meaningful mathematics discourse. The results emphasize the need for support from district leadership and continuous professional development. (Contains 11 references.) (SM)",

Both bring substantial expertise to science education, though neither has experienced optimal conditions for flourishing as teacher leaders. One teacher has strong content knowledge and a deep understanding of standards. The other, who feels that there was never a student she could not reach, received early mentoring and professional development toward a leadership role. The first teacher's greater content knowledge facilitated the implementation of a coherent curriculum. The other teacher's skill in scaffolding instruction produced significant student learning of complex scientific concepts. Neither teacher has yet achieved high levels of expertise in both  realms. Their combined experiences highlight the many issues that contribute to the confused state of urban middle school science reform. Inadequate preservice preparation in content, scientific inquiry, and appropriate pedagogical skills leaves new teachers poorly prepared to engage in the complex process required in inquiry-based instruction. There is limited leadership at the district level for providing quality ongoing professional development that integrates content, inquiry strategies, and assessment practices.

It also investigated the additional skills and orientations teachers needed to take on leadership roles and how teacher leaders acquired their ability to lead their colleagues. Data came from a 2-year study of 10 exemplary teacher leaders who had played significant roles in their districts' and states' standards reform initiatives. Results indicated that ongoing, high quality professional development experiences played an important role in their careers. Their ability to collaborate with peers and to become more reflective practitioners was enhanced by powerful professional development. These experiences also expanded their professional networks. At the end of the  2-year data collection, the 10 teachers met to discuss the findings. During the discussion, they examined what differentiated excellent teachers from teacher leaders. Besides high levels of expertise, collaboration, reflection, empowerment, and flexibility, teachers needed to develop sophisticated expertise in pedagogical content knowledge and a professional network to support ongoing learning in order to be effective leaders. The encouragement of respected mentors and colleagues, coupled with continuous nourishment of their intellectual interests through rigorous learning opportunities, were the keys to their success.

Interviews, observations, and shadowing were conducted during the first year to examine the teachers' scope of work. Observations focused on teachers working with a range of students and with colleagues in formal and informal situations. Participants constructed portfolios with reflections on their own practice.

A similar approach was used during the second year, with greater attention to teachers' leadership roles. Each year included a 3-day working conference in which the teachers completed action  research. Presented in four papers, the results: evaluate the usefulness of a reflective tool for identifying essential qualities comprising teacher leadership; examine math and science reform issues that might explain the relative lack of middle school teacher leaders in these two disciplines; analyze the situation in middle school science; and discuss efforts to identity teachers' leadership qualities and how they were developed. The results note the importance of high quality professional development in understanding the career development of teacher leaders. (Contains 12 references.) (SM)",

Course instructors collected data from student journals, papers, written  assignments, and class discussions regarding students' attitudes and ideas about culture and race in schooling. Instructors presented their findings at two different intervals. A team analyzed trends and tendencies in development of student thinking across the program. Instructors' predictions of students who would be the most and least changed were confirmed by analyzing responses. Very few students demonstrated much change.

The researchers examined whether: (1) the group assessment process predicted future  student teaching performance; (2) the group assessment scores were reliable across raters; and (3) the group assessment interview was a better predictor of student teaching performance than academic criteria. Data analysis indicated that the group assessment overall rating predicted student teaching performance, and it did so better than academic criteria.

        "description":"Action research affords preservice teachers both opportunity and perspective to investigate practical needs and critical issues in classroom practice. A one-semester Educational Inquiry course enabled students to pose important questions as part of a required 2-hour experimental research course in a field-based teacher education program. This paper describes a course of study for undergraduate students to gain introductory knowledge of action research skills through understanding research terminology, qualitative and quantitative methodology, data collection techniques, and research resources to more closely link research and practice as they examined the nature of teaching. As part of the Educational Inquiry course, preservice students framed a research question, conducted a  literature search, and organized and implemented a field-based action research study in order to synthesize coursework, field experiences, and related research. Perspectives in this paper reflect the voice of the university instructor and members of the class of 22 participating elementary and secondary education students enrolled in the course.

        "description":"This paper describes a preservice elementary education program that incorporated more time spent at school sites. The program consisted of three consecutive semesters of courses combined with fieldwork. The first semester included a methods course, a reading class, and a children's literature class. Additional time was spent in the field observing and teaching elementary students. The next semester, students took five methods courses (mathematics, science, social studies, language arts, and reading). They spent every day in their field sites and an intensive week at their assigned schools, where they were expected to teach longer projects and units. Student teaching encompassed the third and final semester of the program. Special education and early childhood education students  often felt overwhelmed by the requirements of their majors as well as those of the program, so a better curriculum was designed for them. When they realized that the program's courses could help them better prepare for their roles as future teachers, the courses became more relevant to them. The program addressed specific strategies that all students could use to individualize teaching (e.g., cooperative learning and thematic projects). Today, a cohesive atmosphere exists between students in special education, early childhood education, and elementary education. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes a framework which captures the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of teacher leaders who demonstrate the ability to work effectively with students and peers in their own classrooms and beyond. Data come from 10 in-depth studies of recognized, urban, middle-school teachers. During the study, participants came together twice for 3-day conferences to facilitate reflection on their leadership qualities and how they acquired them. The process revealed some early themes about teacher leadership: the importance of subject matter knowledge, the commitment of teachers to working collaboratively, and the unique challenges of teaching other teachers versus students. Through interviews and portfolio reviews, other themes emerged: the role of reflection in teacher  growth, the sense of empowerment they shared, and their enthusiasm for continually innovating in the classroom. Using teachers' feedback, a framework was developed that captured leadership qualities in four dimensions: expertise, collaboration, reflection, and empowerment. By following the teachers' career paths, the study found that as the teachers developed high levels of skill in each of the four domains, they emerged as leaders. The importance of professional development experiences in cultivating participants' expertise, collaborative and reflective skills, and sense of empowerment is noted. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes an effective mentoring approach involving an undergraduate preservice teacher and a college instructor designed to increase the instructor's computer literacy. The mentoring effort placed the teacher as learner and the undergraduate student as technology mentor. The pair established weekly meeting times and shared goals and objectives for their collaborative sessions. The mentoring relationship provided a risk-free atmosphere within which the teacher could ask basic questions. Initially, the student provided assistance in response to the teacher's very basic computing questions, but eventually, the student introduced more complex productivity tools. The collaboration resulted in the teacher's increased technological competencies which could be applied in an  undergraduate teacher preparation course. The teacher went from using technology in very basic ways to infusing technology to enhance academic content and skill areas involving thinking, decision making, and problem solving. The student felt that the mentorship included three important elements of effective technology use: using positive reinforcement appropriately, supporting faculty as they set personal and professional technology goals, and applying a lesson from higher education (individualize technology supervision).

Section 1 examines teacher licensure and certification, looking at such action taken by states as requiring teachers to know how to use technology in order to get or renew licenses and addressing the issue of teachers' content knowledge in the subjects they teach. This section also discusses national certification. Section 2 looks at teacher recruitment, focusing on alternative certification programs, critical teacher shortage areas, and low-performing schools. Section 3 discusses teacher performance and pay, explaining that SREB states are focusing on creative, fair, effective evaluations of teachers and on providing assistance to teachers with unsatisfactory  performance. States are also working to increase salaries for new and veteran teachers and to reward teachers who accept additional responsibilities. Section 4 examines support for teachers, noting that states are making considerable efforts to support new teachers through mentor programs and to provide all teachers with professional development opportunities. Section 5 looks at other actions taken by local school boards. Section 6 describes upcoming studies on the issue. (SM)",

        "description":"This study examined the perceptions of preservice teachers tutoring non-native English speakers in a local public school. A group of 14 predominantly female preservice teachers participated, nine white and five Hispanic. Participants completed interviews asking about their tutoring experiences. Results found two common themes: most participants were led to the profession through strong, passionate desires to help others, and most shared the belief that their tutees were remarkably bright. Hispanic and white participants had clearly different perspectives on how they related to their tutees, their expectations for them, and their suggestions for intervening on their behalf. They sought to connect with their tutees through different channels. Hispanic participants were able to  relate their own struggles in school with those facing their tutees. White participants were impotent when it came to assessing their tutees' needs and defining a plan to help them. They also had trouble separating language skill and cultural knowledge from ability to succeed in school. Hispanic participants held higher expectations for their Hispanic students than did their white counterparts and a more sophisticated understanding of their tutees' academic, social, and language situations. Every white participant expected their Hispanic tutee to drop out of school. (Contains 40 references.) (SM)",

An introductory section introduces the issue of purposeful intrusion of politics into education theories, standards, and curricula. It focuses on the point of entry of politics into science education; the technology of truth; whether or not there is a problem with student performance in science; and national and international science testing. The next section offers a series of case studies of threats to scientific accuracy and integrity in science education, threats that come from both the Left and the Right, focusing on such issues as environmental science and evolution. It explains how these sometimes-obscure developments in curriculum or teacher preparation are  likely to influence the quality of science teaching and learning in U.S. schools. The report concludes with a discussion of certain constructivist features shared by people arguing on both sides of these issues, noting the effects on education of making compromises in the curriculum.

Georgia Southern University's College of Education developed and funded three roles for P-12 participants: site-based student teaching supervisors, clinical associates, and demonstration teachers. The site-based model has proven to be an efficient, cost-effective supervision approach. Feedback clearly suggests that university and P-12 participants have benefited. The clinical associate serves as a link between the university and the school. This role has become a significant bridge for communication and has positively contributed to the program and faculty  development for the P-16 community. Demonstration teachers have many roles, including student teacher supervisor, mentor, curriculum developer, and collaborator with university faculty. Evaluation suggests that teachers find the program worthwhile and enjoyable and appreciate the opportunity to collaborate, work with student teachers, and stay abreast of new ideas. Some teachers noted areas for improvement, such as more contact with university faculty and more joint staff development. The three program components have set the stage for the development of a new cooperative program, Partner Schools. (SM)",

The paper goes on to consider what constructivism means for learning, offering a summary of characteristics of constructivist learning and teaching and using the summary to compile a constructivist checklist. This checklist can be applied by educators to educational projects and environments in order to observe the way in which constructivist epistemology and theories of learning can be accommodated in educational practice.
