        "description":"School climates at 12 day care centers in Sweden were compared to investigate effects of center climates on children's social and emotional behavior. Observations and interviews conducted at the day care centers revealed differences in center climates related to child-rearing patterns, patterns of interaction, the distribution of power, and in children's social behavior. At centers in which caregivers exhibited &quot;present-focused&quot; working methods, children were frequently involved in free play, planned activities did not always take place as planned, adults were rather passive in their relationship to children, and children were seen often wandering around aimlessly. Children attending such centers also played less with each other and teased and rejected each other more than at&quot;future-focused&quot; centers. At centers in which caregivers used &quot;future-focused&quot; working methods, a clear daily plan and many planned activities were exhibited. Adults activated children who had nothing to do and required children to take responsibility for many situations. Consequently, children felt they were needed. Children played together more at these centers than they did at &quot;present-focused&quot; centers. (Examples of free play and planned activities at &quot;present-focused&quot; and &quot;future-focused&quot; centers are included.) (RH)",

Discussion focuses on how attitudes of the adult learner can impede learning, how the trainer can encourage teachers and other school personnel to learn about computers, and the trainers'&quot;invisible agenda&quot; of educational goals that supplements the program of formal instruction. Trainers are advised to vary the pace and rhythm of instruction; avoid jargon while introducing basic concepts; encourage the development of useful computer habits by learners; recognize that, for adults beginning to learn about computers, memorization of routines is not as effective a strategy as understanding the program; provide explicit models for understanding concepts; and suggest strategies  for continued learning.

Factors contributing to children's peer relationship problems include unacceptable social behavior, &quot;differentness&quot; from other children, family problems, and a reputation as a social outcast. Children with relationship problems can be helped through social skills training, interventions focused on related problems, provision of nonthreatening social experiences, and cooperative classroom projects. Adults are urged to give children evident opportunities to share peer-related concerns,  show respect for children's unique social needs, and create social options for children without creating pressures.

        "author":["Klein, Amelia J."],
        "description":"Highlighting pertinent research in the area of young children's development of humor, this paper reviews four areas from a cognitive-developmental perspective: (1) humor as a cognitive process, (2) humor and the developmental process, (3) research on young children's humor, and (4) humor and early childhood education. First, the structural properties of incongruity and resolution are discussed in terms of the forms that humor can take as a cognitive process. The stages involved in humor processing are examined in relation to the structure of humor and the cognitive status of the recipient. Secondly, humor is viewed as a developmental process which reflects underlying cognitive changes. General cognitive prerequisites for incongruity humor are defined and the stage at which young  children first are capable of understanding comic incongruity is identified. Thirdly, research is reviewed and findings summarized in the areas of laughter-provoking situations, cognitive mastery, moderately novel humor stimuli, and structural aspects of humor. Lastly, the role of humor in four areas of early childhood education are explained: humor as a motivating factor; the value of humor in spontaneous play activities; the role of humor in the learning process; and the types of humor most appropriate for young children. Examples of children's jokes, riddles, etc. are used to illustrate important concepts throughout the paper. An 11-page reference list is appended. (DST)",

        "description":"Addressing the question, \"What can be done to promote school achievement?\", this paper summarizes the literature on motivation relating to classroom achievement and school effectiveness. Particular attention is given to how values, ideology, and various cultural patterns impinge on classroom performance and serve to enhance motivation to achieve. In defining motivation and achievement, five identifiable behavior patterns are outlined along with an explanation of personal investment as a unifying concept for those patterns. Also, a description of the motivational cycle is provided and the rewards for personal investment in the educational process are briefly discussed. Next, the determinants of motivation and personal investment are examined in terms of the following factors:  motivation as a personal trait; motivation and thoughts about the self; motivation and achievement goals; value attached to the task; and situational influences on motivation. Finally, a theory of personal investment stressing the role of cognitive mediators in determining motivation is developed. References and figures are appended. (DST)",

Focal concerns are (1) the dynamics of abuse in general and in foster families particularly; (2) the need for prevention related activities on a systems level, for adequate training and supports for foster families, and for consistency and clarity of expectations; (3) worker's tasks such as identifying high risk children, assessment and matching for placement, use of individualized contracting, and picking up on danger signals; and (4) worker's role in helping foster parents with behavior management, including alternatives to physical discipline and ways of clarifying expectations for discipline. The manual discusses the  licensing worker or foster home developer's role of supporting the foster home, developing resources for foster parents, and monitoring quality of care. Appendices provide information about liability for inadequate foster care services, foster parents' rights to share in decision making for the foster child, diagrammatic assessment of family relationships, development of support systems for foster families, guidelines for foster parents, what the Bible says about punishment, discipline and behavior management, the abused and neglected adolescent, mismatching of foster parents and the sexually abused preschool child, and talking with foster parents about sexual abuse.

Teachers are encouraged to use transition time to provide an opportunity for imaginative and creative thinking and to avoid tedious waiting and chaos. Transition activities can be used as a teaching technique to prepare children to listen, to relax, to move from place to place and from activity to activity, and to allow opportunity to apply and reinforce learning while others in the group complete a task. Topics covered include the following: criteria for selection of transition activities; suggested transition activities; activities for grouping and moving children; activities for changing learning centers, cleaning up, or completing tasks; relaxation  activities; preparation activities for the next activity and listening; and waiting activities. Specific learning activities to be used by preschool teachers are described under each topic. (DST)",

        "description":"Parent involvement has been documented as the most effective method of improving student performance in school. This book explores ideas, strategies, and resources that parents and teachers can use in teaming together to facilitate productive student behavior and to deal positively with discipline issues. Parental role in discipline is discussed in terms of three forms of parental influence: (1) on the child's behavior; (2) on the first learning environment; and (3) on the child's attitudes. The discussion of parents and teachers as copartners in discipline focuses on the need, basis, and process for a team approach. Educating parents about discipline is explored by discussing parent education with a discipline focus and orienting parents to the classroom discipline approach.  Additionally discussed are strategies for involving parents in discipline and for dealing with special discipline situations. It is concluded that teachers who use parent education and involvement strategies that focus on discipline have found them to be an important ingredient in successful classroom discipline programs. Parent-teacher teaming is indeed a key step toward achieving more productive student behavior. (RH)",

        "description":"Based on the current drive toward professionalism in early childhood education and the low status and prestige afforded teachers in this field, this paper applies some of the main concepts of professionalism to the current state of the art of early childhood education. Two uses of the term &quot;professional&quot; are delineated: the &quot;folk&quot; concept and the scientific concept. The first use is explained in terms of an honorific designation, and early childhood practitioners are not seen in the public mind to have achieved the goals implicit in this concept. In the scientific conceptions of the term &quot;profession,&quot; eight criteria must be met: social necessity, altruism, autonomy, code of ethics, distance from client, standards of practice, prolonged training, and specialized knowledge. The  current status of different aspects of early childhood education is then assessed in relation to meeting these individual criteria. In a closing section, the work of several contemporary developmental researchers is cited as rich in implications for principles of education in the early years. Finally, the difficulty that the field of early childhood education experiences in producing reliable and persuasive empirical evidence for the activities of its practitioners is discussed. (DST)",

Provided are eight units which should be taught in sequence because each builds on the concepts taught in previous units. Unit 1 focuses on children's need to try new foods and to eat a variety of foods. Unit 2 concerns acceptable mealtime behaviors and manners. Units 3 through 8, respectively, focus on hygiene at mealtime, variety in foods, sensory enjoyment of foods, origins of foods, healthy foods, and desirable eating habits. Introductory pages of each unit describe the focus of the unit, explain the child-oriented goals, provide a brief rationale, give a summary of background  information for the teacher, and describe the skills and knowledge the children should be able to demonstrate after participating in the unit lessons. The first lesson in each unit introduces the unit concepts and provides a framework for all other lessons in the unit. All of the lessons that follow the first lesson are designed to reinforce or expand upon the ideas and concepts presented in the first lesson. Included are references to books for preschoolers, audiovisuals for preschoolers, teachers, and parents, teacher/parent materials, and a list of sources of inexpensive nutrition education teaching aids.

If research on reading is to make a difference, it will have to start with an understanding of how contemporary social-historical contexts shape the nature of instruction and the production of school failure. Current data show how, without special cultural support systems, the individual teacher is at an enormous disadvantage in trying to get a student over the major misunderstanding that reading is reading individual words so that they sound right. Reading is a process of interpreting the world. Current research using an interpretive model has produced  remarkable changes in the reading ability of seventh grade students. But the system of remediation most commonly used is one that goes back to the system of the basic unit again. Instead of basic skills, a socio-cultural approach to reading talks about basic activities and instantiates those needed to carry out the whole process of reading in the general conditions for learning. When such lesson contexts are created, children can learn to read who otherwise couldn't be taught. (RH)",

Beliefs about children's performance were examined in mothers and their sixth grade children in the People's Republic of China and in Chinese-American and Caucasian-American groups in the San Francisco Bay area. Interviews covered attributions for children's relatively high and relatively low performance in mathematics, using five options: ability, effort, training at home, training at school, and luck. Mothers were asked how they would respond to specific instances of unusually high or low performance in math. ANOVAS were run on cultural/national status, generation (i.e., mothers and children),  and gender of child. Results indicated that mothers in the People's Republic of China attributed relative success to the school and low performance to lack of effort, in contrast to Caucasian mothers who blamed lack of ability and the school for low achievement. Responses of Chinese-American mothers were usually closer to those of mothers from the People's Republic of China than to Caucasian parents. (Author/DST)",

The first of four volumes, this report presents the preliminary findings of the Phase II Comparative Study of Case Review Systems which focused on the dispositional hearing requirement. The study consisted of a national overview of the hearings in fifty states and Washington, D.C. and an in-depth study of the hearings in eight selected sites. The primary sources of information for the national study were  telephone interviews with the state foster care administrator and one judge from each state. The data collection instruments for both parts of the study were designed to elicit information about the type of judicial review operating within the state and to specifically explore the state's status with regard to the P. L. 96-272 dispositional hearing components. Chapter topics include current status of the states; state status, change, and support for individual components of P. L. 96-272; periodic reviews and other procedures; due process and decision-making authority of dispositional hearings; impact and problems in implementing and recommendations of agency and court respondents; and preliminary conclusions and issues to be addressed.

In particular, they demonstrate the interaction between hearing implementation and the review system operating within a state prior to P. L. 96-272. The sites visited were all in the process of making significant changes in their review systems and were initially selected to illustrate  the differing types of case review systems. However, as the descriptions indicate, each state had different problems to address and thus developed unique approaches to implementing case reviews and dispositional hearings. The eight states specifically covered were Virginia, California (San Francisco County), Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C. Finally, a series of vignettes drawn from actual cases serves to illustrate and define specific problems and issues arising from conclusions to be derived from each case and/or questions remaining to be resolved are summarized at the end of each vignette.

        "description":"This report is the third of four volumes presenting results of the Comparative Study of Case Review Systems Phase II--Dispositional Hearings, focusing on implementation of the dispositional hearing requirement of P. L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. This volume of the study presents the results of a state statutory survey of the laws in all fifty states and the District of Columbia which most closely resemble the P. L. 96-272 dispositional hearing requirement. In addition, it analyses a number of legal issues that have arisen during the implementation of this provision. The aim of the study was to provide information useful to state agencies and courts on how the hearings are functioning. On a limited basis, primarily through analysis of hearing  decisions, the issue of case outcomes also is addressed. Following an introduction which describes the study background and methodology, chapters cover (1) legal issues related to dispositional hearings and (2) state statutory survey results. An extensive appendix summarizes each of the fifty states' and the District of Columbia's state statutory provisions closest to P. L. 96-272 dispositional requirements. Each summary includes the following topical areas: procedure, coverage, procedural safeguards, scheduling, authority of court, and decision required. (DST)",

        "description":"Sex segregation is a powerful phenomenon in childhood. It occurs universally whenever children have a choice of playmates and is found in sub-human primates too. Adults are not directly responsible for sex segregation. Data do not support the hypothesis that the most ladylike girls and the most rough and active boys first form the segregated play groups that emerge in nursery school. Modest evidence indicates that participation in all-girl play groups serves a positive socializing function for girls. For boys, no such evidence was found. Recent findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that the cultures developed by boys and girls in their segregated groups are distinctive and serve different functions. Altogether, these findings and results of primate studies suggest  that females are first to initiate segregation to avoid being dominated by males. These conjectures, however, do not explain why boys avoid playing with girls. It is concluded that gender segregation appears to be relatively intractable; it may be unwise for adults to try to prevent boys and girls from choosing same-sex playmates in unstructured play situations. Adults can play a very large role, though, in setting up structured situations in which cross-sex interactions can occur without placing on children the burden of letting their peers see that they have chosen a cross-sex partner.

        "description":"Questions of how and why early childhood education has come to rely on a psychological perspective are examined and problematic aspects of the discourse of early childhood education are explored. An overview of the history of early education discusses the replacement of idealistic by pragmatic perspectives, the influence of Darwin's use of the scientific method on educators' thought, the emergence of the field of child development, the role of normative studies of children, and the current reliance of early childhood educators on psychological rationales for program design. Subsequent discussion of educational interests and psychological theory initially differentiates the two domains and explores the limitations of the psychological perspective for the educator through a brief  analysis of Piaget's work that focuses on decontextualized knowledge, reason and value in psychology, and the metaphoric view of stage theories of development. Concluding discussion deals with perennial problems, such as the nature of appropriate knowledge for the young and the basis for the early childhood educator's professional expertise; future directions are advocated for early educators that would involve a qualitative shift in how and where knowledge is sought and in how they think about themselves, their work, and the children they teach.

The impact of these synopses on the comprehension of commercials also was investigated. A total of 30 second graders and 30 fifth graders participated. Synopses were presented to experimental subjects either before or after commercial breaks; no synopses were presented to control subjects. Immediately after viewing the program, all subjects were given a 44-item multiple-choice test assessing comprehension of the program and commercials. The second-grade boys in the post-commercial condition showed significantly greater comprehension of essential content than did second-grade boys or girls in the pre-commercial or  control conditions. The comprehension level of the post-commercial second-grade boys was comparable to that of the fifth graders. There was no corresponding effect for second-grade girls in the post-commercial condition. Further, the synopses did not interfere with the comprehension of commercials for any group. Similarities and differences with past research are discussed. (Author/RH)",

Business incubators promote community development by diversifying the economic base, enhancing the community's image as a center for innovation and entrepreneurship, and creating jobs. Most business incubators are located in urban areas, but in the past two years several rural incubators have been initiated including projects in aging industrial areas and rurally isolated non-industrial areas of Western Illinois, Northwest Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Missouri. In planning and operating these rural incubators, development officials have had to consider the number  of potential clients in the area, marketing strategies for the incubator, and the level of economic and community support available for incubator development. These considerations varied in relative importance depending on the type of rural area the incubator was located in, its degree of affiliation with a university, and the type of incubator facility, e.g., manufacturing, retail, or high technology. Strategies to overcome the problems associated with rural business incubators included aggressive marketing plans, commercialization of university research, and diversification of funding sources.

Currently 26.9% of America's school systems enroll over 500,000 students in more than 26,000 small schools staffed by 50,000 teachers. Small schools have pioneered many educational &quot;innovations&quot;: non-graded classrooms, individualized instruction, cross-age groupings, peer tutoring, and emphasis on the basics. Current efforts to reduce student/teacher ratios, use the community as a resource, and &quot;mainstream&quot; mildly handicapped pupils also have their roots in the small schools of the past. Small schools offer benefits in areas of personal relationships, student morale, teacher-student interaction, administration, and curriculum and instruction. Although research on optimum school  size is mixed, research suggests that class size is related to pupil achievement, smaller classes are more conducive to improved pupil performance, smaller classes provide more opportunities to meet individual needs, pupils in small classes have more interest in learning, and teacher morale is higher in smaller classes. Strengths inherent in small schools that support characteristics/practices associated with findings from &quot;effective schools' research&quot; include orderly, serious, safe, attractive school climate, clear school mission; strong administrative leaders who emphasize instruction; high expectations for student achievement; presence of student, staff, and school evaluation systems; supportive home/school relations.

        "description":"Education students planning to teach in rural areas need, but do not receive, specialized training. Among differences encountered by rural teachers are professional isolation and limited inservice training; assignment to more subjects, more grade levels, and more extracurricular activities; lower budgets and salaries; inadequate materials; less pressured environment; greater cooperation; more student involvement; and more interaction among students, parents, and staff. A literature review suggests that teacher training programs are unresponsive to needs of prospective rural teachers and that research interest in rural education is limited. Suggestions for preparation of rural teachers include cultivating awareness of cultural, social, and economic conditions of rural areas  through student teaching/practicums in nonmetropolitan areas; preparing future teachers to work with broader age ranges in multigrade classrooms and to teach several subjects; and encouraging faculty to conduct research in rural education. A comparative list of rural-urban differences in the work environment and a chart showing emphasis given by public institutions to topics applicable to rural teaching are included. (LFL)",

        "description":"Although roots of adult education can be traced back more than a century, rural adult education is an emerging discipline in American education which has yet to develop an established research base. Recent research has established that rural adult learners look like, act like, and learn like urban adult learners, but their opportunities for participation in adult education programs are limited because of access, distance and travel, self-confidence, and affordability. Identified as providers of rural adult education are four-year colleges/universities, federal and state government agencies, private organizations, research institutes, regional libraries, state departments of education, two-year community colleges, and vocational-technical colleges. Research shows programming  offers undergraduate degrees, job training and professional development, noncredit conferences and workshops, Adult Basic Education courses, rural focused curricula, and community development activities. Efforts to improve research on rural adult education focus on creating a complete picture of rural adult learners and educational providers, developing policy options more responsive to increased costs associated with delivering services to rural areas, examining collaborative models and methods of coordination that best serve rural communities, and studying successful rural adult programs. Research is also needed on the role of adult education as a mechanism to promote rural development. (NEC)",

This paper presents some reflections on these elements and on their interrelationship. Some contextual cosiderations are made and concepts are developed about the common areas that can exist among participatory research and management of  educational systems. In order to substantiate the potential of this interaction, some experiences in the Latin American countries of Colombia, Chile, and Central America are discussed and perspectives are stated about the harmonization of participatory research and educational management.

        "description":"University autonomy is a concept widely discussed and often misunderstood. In the Latin American context, university autonomy has been regarded as something inherent to the nature of the universities. As long as universities exist, the phenomenon of university autonomy will be present . University autonomy should be examined in the light of such fundamental concepts as academic freedom, self-government, university-government relationships, and the university's concern for social issues. In studying its nature, several factors should be considered, i.e., juridical, historical, sociological, cultural, political, and philosophical matters. This paper makes some propositions about the concept of university autonomy, in light of important issues that have appeared in the academic  realms. The propositions are made around the national planning movement in Latin American countries, the interinstitutional coordination among public sector organizations, the privatization of Latin American higher education, the accreditation of universities, the international cooperation, and the growing unionism among university sectors.

Problems which undermine self-perception in migrant students are detailed, including teachers'&quot;Missionary Mentality,&quot; fallacies of offering equal educational opportunity to all, the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; theory, and language differences. Guidelines for educators of migrant students include remembering the social and cultural genesis of student problems and not blaming the  victim, helping migrant families agitate for social reform and compensatory help, studying ways to transform schools to adapt to the students' needs as well as helping students adapt to school. Suggestions are offered for curricula which provide information about the migrant way of life, civil rights, and publications/organizations for migrants, and which teach ways for migrants to solve social and economic problems through their own efforts. Examples of student decision-making models and integration of families into school activities are offered.

The definition of academic tasks focuses attention on each of the following: the products students are required to produce; the resources, including content instruction, that are available to them; accountability or the reward structure in the class; and the cognitive demands of the tasks. Analysis of tasks in the classroom requires attention to interrelationships among tasks as well as to the actions and perceptions of students and  teachers.

        "description":"With an estimated 17-22 million animals used in laboratories annually in the United States, public interest in animal welfare has sparked an often emotional debate over such uses of animals. Concerns focus on balancing societal needs for continued progress in biomedical and behavioral research, for toxicity testing to safeguard the public, and for education in the life sciences with desires to replace, reduce, and refine the use of laboratory animals. In 1985, the United States Congress enacted three laws that dealt with laboratory animals, including amendments to the Animal Welfare Act. This assessment analyzes the scientific, regulatory, economic, legal, and ethical considerations involved in alternative technologies in biomedical and behavioral research, toxicity testing, and  education. Included is a detailed examination of federal, state, and institutional regulation of animal use, and a review of recent developments in 10 other countries. The report illustrates a range of options for congressional action in seven areas of public policy regarding animals: using existing alternatives; developing new alternatives; disseminating research and testing information; restricting animal use; counting the numbers and kinds of animals used; establishing a uniform policy for animal use within federal agencies; and amending the Animal Welfare Act.

Other objectives were to determine: any correlations between number and types of science courses completed and (a) students' attitudes toward teaching science and (b) their confidence in their ability to teach science; any sex differences in understanding, attitude, and confidence; and any correlation between attainment test scores and  attitudes and confidences. Results obtained appear to substantiate the following interpretations. University of Wyoming elementary education students are being inadequately prepared to teach science in terms of attainment of a reasonable level of understanding of scientific concept currently included in elementary school science curricula. It appears that simply having these students take greater doses of traditional college science courses does not favorably impact understanding of science concepts, attitudes toward science, or confidence in personal ability to teach science. Freshmen appear to have a significantly serious negative attitudinal complex regarding science and science teaching. Though there is a discernible trend in the direction of positive attitudes toward science by  students as they mature from freshmen to senior level, this trend is completely unrelated to the number of standard general education science courses completed.

Its goals were: (1) to revitalize the college-preparatory mathematics program of two California high schools, and (2) to increase the number of minority students completing that program. Establishing collegial relationships between the faculties of the schools and the University of California at Berkeley, mathematics honors programs, active involvement by parents, and close working relationships with a Hispanic community were the four tasks involved. Only one school was evaluated, since the other was closed. The emotional climate at the school prior to the program's beginning is sketched, and the mathematics department and its course offerings are described. Then how each task was implemented is  described and evaluated. Finally, the academic records of black students are examined, with analysis of the program's effect on their performance in mathematics classes and their persistence in taking mathematics. The evaluation is based on individual and group interviews and classroom observations. Problems with the honors programs and the parent component are noted, and the university-community relationships are briefly reported. The record of black students is discussed, and it is concluded that although the program was not successful in helping students who began in the slow track to move to the college-preparatory track, it did encourage schools to pay attention to the academic success rate of their minority students, encouraged students to contrive taking math, and created better  communication between minority parents and school personnel.

Assessment procedures consisted of 14 individual interviews and 8 paper-and-pencil tests based on children's responses to mathematical cognition tasks in one-one interviews. The same criteria embedded in student response assessments were applied to demands made by mathematics curriculum objectives, textbooks materials, classroom activities, and Alberta Education Assessment Test items. The project sampled curricular cognitive demands and student cognitive response levels from the six elementary school grades and across five mathematics topic strands  (numeration, operations and properties, measurement, geometry, and graphing). Answers to various research questions varied by topic stand, grade level, and demand component. However, several general findings are noted. About three-quarters of all student responses were at the concrete operational level, with remaining answers at the preoperational level. About three-quarters of all demands were at the concrete operational level, with most of the remaining quarter at the early formal level. In general, cognitive demands made by the curriculum were found to correspond well to distributions of student cognitive responses in most topics and at most grade levels. (Author/JN)",

The need for decreasing recidivism and prison populations through educational programs is presented, with data on the costs of not doing so. The use of television as a teaching resource is proposed as a possible solution. A field test was conducted to determine the effects of a series of instructional television programs (&quot;Adult Math&quot;), designed to present mathematics concepts measured by the General Educational Development test on learners in a state correctional institution. Data were obtained for 22 persons in the experimental group and 18 persons in the control group. Two forms of the General Educational Performance Index were used as pre-and post-tests, and data were compared using analysis of covariance.  The use of television curriculum did not significantly increase the mathematics achievement of the incarcerated learners. Those scoring at the 6.0 and above grade levels on reading and arithmetic skills attained the best results. (MNS)",

        "description":"Focusing on competency in art education, the seven essays in this critique deal essentially with two aspects of this topic: as it appears to manifest itself in competency-based teacher education (CBTE), and how competency might be interpreted to serve in the name of art education. In the introductory section, \"Art Educators focus on Controversy,\" Nancy MacGregor compares and contrasts the remaining six articles. In the first article, \"Competence and the Hidden Curriculum,\" Arthur D. Efland holds that while competency-based measures may objectify certain aspects of the teaching function, they will in all probability elude others. In \"Different Art Teaching Styles and Some Elemental Competencies,\" Charles G. Wieder refers to two aspects of competency as he presents his concern for  relationships between the learner and the teacher. The notion of two levels for competence is again apparent in the third essay, \"Competency and the Craft Studio-Classroom: A Case for Literacy\" (Donald Duncan). Duncan states that the term competence is synonomous with ability and skill, implying a quality of performance rather than a quantity of knowledge. Next, in \"Some Thoughts on Competency, Art and Art Education,\" Robert Arnold writes about little and big competencies, with little ones being observable and testable and big ones being untestable because of differences in values. Similarly, Kenneth Marantz in \"Toward the Liberation of a Conservative Concept,\" holds that competence has a built-in virtue or goodness and cannot be relegated to achievable bits and pieces. In the final  essay, \"The Logic of 'Competence' as it Bears on the Teaching of Art,\" Ross A. Norris views competency as defined by the CTBE movement and identifies five criteria to which teachers must conform to be competent.

In the current preoccupation with preparing graduates of 2001 to get jobs using the technology of 1985, seldom is a distinction made between what makes life possible and what makes life worth living. Mistaken assumptions that seem to be commonly accepted include: the purpose of education for society is to contribute to the nation's economy and to the gross national product; the most urgent need in the curriculum is more science, math, and computing; and the arts are essentially frills to be offered as time allows. The failure of the National Commission on Excellence in Education to include the arts among its \"Five New  Basics\" reflects the commission's obsession with the computer and its view of children in terms of their future roles in the marketplace and their potential contributions to international competition. Three goals developed by Music Educators National Conference for serving the needs of the class of 2001 include: (1) By 1990, every student, K-12, shall have access to music instruction in the schools, with the curriculum of every elementary and secondary school, public and private, including a balanced, comprehensive, and sequential program of music instruction taught by a qualified teacher; (2) By 1990, every high school shall require at least one unit of credit in the arts for graduation (the arts being defined as music, visual arts, theater, and dance); (3) By 1990, every college  university shall require at least one unit of credit in the arts for admission.

        "author":["Biraimah, Karen"],
        "description":"A case study of a Togolese secondary school provides the focus for an examination of the impact of Western notions of gender-based role expectations in Third World education. Work on the reproduction of inequality in education suggests that in-school processes direct different knowledge to different groups. However, in the case of Third World schools, this process may not involve the reproduction of societal inequalities, but rather the legitimation of Western notions of sex-role divisions of labor which are not necessarily practiced in the Third World. The present study suggests that when the reproduction argument is extended to the Third World, the schools, as former colonial institutions, may not simply reproduce inequalities within that particular society but may also  transmit a new set of sex-role divisions of labor. Togolese schools transmit images of women as unproductive housewives and mothers. These roles are incongruent with Togolese society and labor force participation patterns. This study further reinforces existing arguments that Third World schools may intervene to reverse the effects of modernization on women's declining status. The study suggests that even Third World schools with gender-biased informal curricula can be used by girls to obtain upward social mobility. The study concludes that, in the case of Lome Secondary School, the informal curriculum reproduced a significant pattern of sex-role differentiation even though the school outwardly reflected uniformity and equality. A uniform curriculum and open access policy do not  necessarily eliminate discrimination. (LP)",

        "description":"The five papers presented in this monograph deal with the implications of the criticisms of education and the calls for excellence now evident in a number of industrialized nations. While the issues discussed vary, there is a common concern to understand how current changes in educational policy may affect educational practice. \"Women, Educational Reform, and the Process of Change\" (Rosemary Deem) considers some of the attempts that have been made in Britain to reduce the amount of sexism in education, to offer better and fairer educational routes and experiences for girls, and to decrease gender inequalities within schools. \"In/Forming Schooling: Space/Time/Textuality in Cumpulsory State Provided 'Mass' Schooling Systems\" (Phillip Corrigan) raises questions against certain  dominant forms of theorizing, investigating, and explaining schooling. \"The Political Economy of Text Publishing\" (Michael Apple) analyzes the production of curricular materials from the perspective of cultural commodities production and consumption. \"Parents, Children, and the State\" (Miriam E. David) argues that the New Right government in Britain, much like that of the United States, is subtly constructing public economic, social, and educational policies that will radically alter the place of family in the socio-economic system. \"Public Education and the Discourse of Crisis, Power, and Vision\" (Henry Giroux) argues that public education in the United States faces a dual crisis: a neo-conservative threat to all public spheres and a failure of radical educational discourse to either  illuminate the nature of the existing failures of American education or to provide a theoretical discourse for educational reform.

A discussion of the place of structural developmental curricula in the reform dynamics of educational progressivism precede the specifics of the Icelandic reform context. The description of the special features of the project includes its role in the production of concepts, instructional materials, and teacher materials representing the integration of knowledge about man, society, and the ecological conditions of man's life on earth--a representation systematically built from a wide variety of social science disciplines using the inductive processes and discovery approaches as  specified by developmental didactics. Next is a discussion of factors contributing to the defeat of the project; a defeat triggered by an onslaught of neo-fundamental ideologies in which perspectivism and socio-moral understanding were defamed as indoctrination and the goal of developmental education was replaced by the &quot;Back to Basics&quot; movement. Experiences gained and motives operating during two decades of Icelandic educational reform are then discussed and reasons for the vulnerability of rational and rationalist reforms are examined. Tables and appendices include (1) an overview of the project's K-9 social studies course; (2) a structural matrix of key concepts; (3) examples of the linkage of key concepts and content in a widening spiral framework; (4) a presentation of a unit; and  (5) examples of second and third grade task structures, organization of tasks, and objectives.

The survey contained the following sections: (1) Demographic Information; (2) What Makes a Good Classroom Teacher? (3) Who Has Influenced You the Most? (4) What Aspects of Teaching Are Appealing to Young People? and (5) How I Feel about Teaching as a Career. From an analysis of the 2123 responses the following set of student beliefs about teachers and teaching was developed: (1) the  salary for a beginning teacher is too low; (2) teacher work schedules would not encourage students to choose teaching as a career; (3) characteristics selected by students to describe a \"good classroom teacher\" were similar to behaviors identified by current research associated with improved student achievement; (4) teacher behaviors manifesting affective aspects of the teaching-learning process were among the most important characteristics of a good teacher; (5) more and newer equipment in schools is needed; (6) apparent lack of interest in learning by students was seen as a deterrent to a teaching career; (7) students do not show sufficient respect for teachers; and (8) ineffective teachers should leave teaching. Survey results and a detailed analysis of thinking pertinent to students'  responses are presented. The major conclusions are accompanied by specific recommendations for state action that could lead to more students choosing teaching as a profession. The survey questionnaire is appended. (JD)",

The focus was on perceived sources of influence on classroom practices. The findings suggest that a wide array of features compete for the attention of the first year teachers as they make instructional decisions. Over the course of the year, beginning teachers sort out these forces and attend to some more than others. The perceived sources of influence are similar at the end of the first year of teaching to those reported by experienced teachers who are operating in a similar context. Induction programs appear to contribute positively to the socialization process with respect to classroom practices through the mechanism of the peer or supporting teacher. The  induction programs exert little in the way of positive influence on classroom practices through the evaluation procedures used. (CB)",

Although K-6 grade teachers showed higher levels of distress on all of the stress related items, the magnitude of their differences from 7-12 grade teachers was usually small and nonsignificant. Job satisfaction appeared to increase with teaching higher grade levels. More reports of routine problems and life change adjustments correlated with lower grade  levels.

While members of the AFT have a few differences with some of the current reform proposals, the AFT in general supports the overwhelming majority of specific proposals called for in the various reports on the state of education. Current examining procedures are inadequate. Problems exist in the nature and level of the testing, and also with conflicts regarding the quality and quantity of teachers needed. The AFT supports the notion of a national teacher examination developed along the same lines as examinations for doctors, actuaries, or lawyers. Such an instrument and testing  program could be developed by a group of leaders of educational organizations, college presidents and other professionals in the field who could constitute themselves as a non-governmental American board of education. Such an instrument and testing program could be developed within three to five years. The test should cover three general areas: subject matter knowledge, ability to make judgments to justify instructional decisions, and an internship program. Teacher organizations can have a very important role in the development as well as the acceptance of such a test in that the AFT and the National Education Association could make passage of such an examination a requirement for membership.

It is called the ALACT model after the first letters of the phases. These reflective teaching procedures are taught to prospective teachers before they undergo field experiences.

Studies of teacher planning, decision making, knowledge, and theorizing can be used to provide prospective teachers with a realistically complex picture of the cognitive aspects of teaching. This research also supports the development of a conception of teaching as a reflectively professional enterprise. For both novices and experienced teachers the proposed goals of applying this research are to promote understanding of teaching as a design profession and to empower teachers in self-directed professional development efforts. Knowledge about how teachers get their work done is of worth to teachers not because it will  provide them with new tools to use, but rather because it changes the way researchers view what teachers need to know; researchers can then be of more help to teachers. Descriptions of teaching that have been produced by studies of teacher thinking can help to provide a framework for researchers to decide what sorts of information, advice, and support will be useable in the classroom.

        "author":["Shulman, Judith"],
        "description":"A case study is presented of a secondary student teacher, focusing on her adaptation to the role of a teacher, and factors that influenced the adaptation process. The student teacher described is one of a growing number of women who are making the decision to become professionals later in life, after having experienced roles such as marriage, parenting, and other jobs. The study was conducted over a 10-week period of student teaching. This student teacher's development as a teacher is traced through changes in her teaching and related changes in the language with which she described her experiences as a student teacher. For example, as the period progressed, she devoted increasing amounts of time to instruction, and talked less about classroom management per se and more about the  impact of instruction on order in the class. Her adaptation to the role of a teacher was influenced significantly by the personal resources she had due to her age and life experience. They provided her with the strength to operate according to her own values, even when they differed dramatically from those of her cooperating teacher. This process of development is discussed by drawing on the role theory as well as existing literature on the socialization of teachers. (Author/JD)",

The structure and operation of policies in effect in four states--California, Colorado, Georgia, and Oklahoma--are described, and the factors that influence the design of these state policies are analyzed. While all four states each use some type of individual assessment as well as an approved program approach to screen teachers, the state policies showed a wide range of diversity. Various movements, such as the competency education movement, influenced the design of teacher assessment policies, with the major impetus differing for each state. Contextual factors also had a role in policy design, as did availability of  funds to develop assessment instruments. One aspect similar to all of the states was that the policies were here to stay, regardless of the potential for low passage rates by minorities or graduates of certain schools of education. The paper concludes with implications of the teacher assessment policies and recommendations for the development of other such policies. (CB)",

The project is based on the assumption that the study of philosophy, history, literature, and other basic disciplines of the humanities will help prospective teachers to develop interpretive, normative, and critical perspectives on education. Assuming that the route to professional competence does not lie in converting members of the human species into unreflective, dependent beings, but in engendering critical reason, this project focuses on the teacher preparation component that bridges the gap between the educated person and the professional teacher. The intent is to improve professional competence for preservice teacher educators by providing new and  prospective teachers the opportunity to heighten moral consciousness and create conditions for professional independence.

A one-year study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of three instructional methods to learn collaboration skills: (1) lecture-discussion; (2) instruction using videotape; and (3) systematic, guided experience in an interdisciplinary practicum. A three-part written test and an experiential assessment were used to measure the effects  of the three instructional methods. There were significant statistical differences on two parts of the written test and qualitative differences in the experiential assessment among the three instructional groups. Overall, systematic experience in an inter-disciplinary practicum was most effective on all measures in students' acquisition of collaboration skills. (Author/JD)",

It was also noted that a growing number of states are requiring prospective teachers to pass a test of basic skills, and at least two states are requiring a similar test for inservice teachers. In response to concerns over eroding standards, representatives of state credentialing agencies have recommended that colleges and universities impose stricter entrance and exit  requirements, remedial coursework for students deficient in basic skills, and revocation of program certification of certain teacher training institutions that continue to graduate high numbers of students who fail to meet basic skill criteria.

        "description":"This study determined the prevalence and patterns of smokeless tobacco use in a sample of preservice educators at a southern university, and identified factors associated with initiation and reinforcement of the activity. A 26-item survey was completed by 174 persons enrolled in a course required for completion of the teacher education program. Results indicated that 23.3 percent of the male respondents, but none of the female respondents reported current use of smokeless tobacco. Among users, 55.0 percent used it nearly every day. Most users (60.0 percent) &quot;dipped&quot; or &quot;chewed&quot; 4-7 times per day. The factor most often cited for initiation of use was the influence of a friend. Both users and nonusers were unable to identify the health effects associated with smokeless tobacco. It  is concluded that a significant number of male preservice teachers in this geographic area use smokeless tobacco. Ignorance in this group about the health effects of smokeless tobacco is notable. These data suggest that some persons in the field of education have succumbed to the wave of popularity that smokeless tobacco enjoys in parts of the United States. The influence that these future educators could have on acceptance of smokeless tobacco use by younger audiences as a viable recreational activity may have practical significance for the college health educator.

This paper examines methods of evaluating pupil achievement, including: work samples, checklists, rating scales, sociometric devices, teacher-pupil conferences, parent-teacher conferences, diary entries, anecdotal records, teacher-made tests (essay items, true-false items, multiple-choice items, matching items, completion items), and standardized tests. Other techniques related to pupil evaluation are self-evaluation by teachers, and formative and summative evaluation. Feedback from evaluation results need to be utilized to improve the curriculum. Improved  specific objectives, learning activities, and appraised procedures selected by teachers might be a relevant end result. (LMO)",

        "description":"This study investigated the feasibility of using the three-parameter model in Florida's minimum competency testing program. LOGIST 4 was used to analyze 1984 Statewide Student Assessment Tests (SSAT)-II data, exploring possibilities that easiness of the test would cause problems in the estimation of the a and c parameters. These problems and results of the trial analysis are discussed in chapter 2 of this 7-chapter report. An elaborate investigation of the assumption of unidimensionality of SSAT scores is reported on in chapter 3. In the next two chapters, goodness to fit of the one-, two-, and three-parameter models to the SSAT-II data is discussed, and the results of a parameter estimation investigation are described, along with a consideration of the appropriateness of  different models. Chapter 6 reports on studies of the optimum number of examinees to be used in analyzing the data available from Florida's tests, including an attempt to improve parameter estimates by oversampling the lower end of the achievement distribution. A brief chapter of conclusions completes the report. (LMO)",

The study was conducted in a three-year secondary school of approximately 2,000 students, just outside of the greater Los Angeles area. A selected group of five to ten teachers, two administrators, and a counselor helped to develop the means whereby the district's extant information system could be modified or augmented to better meet the  needs of staff at the building level. Three reporting mechanisms were designed for organizing student information: Student-At-A-Glance, Class-At-A-Glance, and School-At-A-Glance. The last phase of the study revolved around the actual use of reports by school staff. The ongoing assumption derived from the study is that multilevel analysis and interpretation of school-based information has an immense potential for facilitating individual-diagnostic, class-instructional, and school-organizational planning decisions and evaluations.

        "description":"The desire for a national picture of educational quality remains a continuing but unresolved goal. A question has been raised among high level policymakers regarding the feasibility of using existing data collected by the states to construct education indicators for state-by-state comparisons of student performance at the national level. A feasibility study was contracted to the UCLA Center for the Study of Evaluation (CSE) to explore the methodological and implementation issues of this approach. The results of the feasibility study are described and discussed in this report. Included in the study are analyses of: (1) the general characteristics of current state testing programs and of the content of currently used state tests; (2) alternative approaches to linking test results  across states to create a common scale for purposes of comparison; and (3) the availability of auxiliary information about students and schools and its potential use in creating more valid indicators of achievement. These analyses culminated in a number of recommendations about ways to facilitate the use of state data for national comparisons. These recommendations focus on basic preconditions, proposed approaches, pilot study needs, auxiliary information collection and documentation, and strategies for optimizing political, institutional, and economic support.

        "description":"The use of computers to build diagnostic inferences is presented in two contexts: (1) closed world, exemplified by the space shuttle launch monitoring system; and (2) open world, represented by computerized diagnostic testing of reading comprehension. The analysis shows that the closed world provides a substantially cleaner environment within which to perform diagnostic inference. In the case of educational diagnosis, most domains tend to be relatively open-ended, and thus no comparable clarity can be found. If the test materials for computerized administration can be designed within tightly controlled parameters, and if the diagnostic strategy can be strongly tied to theory about performance errors within the topic domain, then many of the ambiguities of diagnostic inference  will be closer to resolution. The computer has proved itself valuable in managing more traditional varieties of educational test administration and scoring. Properly programmed, the computer can become an unparalleled asset in the context of diagnostic testing. (LMO)",

The application of research-based analytic methods  to the description of important skills is treated as the core of the description section. Once the conceptual base for the diagnostic test is documented in the skill map and the test description, the steps for writing, reviewing, and trying out diagnostic items remain much the same as those used in survey testing programs.

        "description":"Since the 1983 publication of \"A Nation at Risk,\" most states have responded to public demand for educational improvement by enacting legislation increasing the number of units in academic subjects required for high school graduation. Required courses now consume three-quarters of the high school years, countering the former trend to large offerings of various elective courses. This task force report to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development examines the observed and anticipated consequences of these requirements for the curriculum, for students, and for teachers. Major findings include: (1) students are required to make greater effort, and those going on to college will be better prepared to succeed; (2) negative consequences are more likely for those  students not going to college as evidenced by the accelerating dropout rate; (3) inadequate attention has been paid to requiring carefully balanced programs; (4) time for elective courses has decreased, and increased requirements reinforce past artificial divisions of knowledge; and (5) teachers' professional latitude is being sharply curtailed. It is recommended that educators closely monitor, document, and evaluate actual consequences of increased graduation requirements on students and teachers, and that these findings be relayed to parents and legislators to ensure that future policy changes are enacted with wisdom.

        "description":"This report and compilation of papers summarizes information collected by an Assessment Development and Use Project, initiated by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (NWREL) to assist test development efforts by state and local agencies. Specific item banking applications are reported in two case studies, selected because they represent item bank efforts in which agencies other than the ones that developed the item bank have been able to develop tests from these item banks. The first item bank described is the Wisconsin Item Bank, developed by the Wisconsin State Department of Public Instruction to be used by school districts participating in Wisconsin's voluntary competency-based testing program. The design, history, problems, and operational details of the item bank  are discussed in detail. The second report describes an item bank developed by the Portland Public Schools. This item bank has supported Portland's local testing needs and has been shared with several other districts. Discussed are the history and purposes for development, current uses, problems and issues in development, management, and use, and ways the technology may be shared. The final section of the paper considers issues related to how well item banks work and how well they fulfill their potential. (LMO)",

The work was conducted as part of the Assessment Development and Use component of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory's (NWREL) Assessment and Development project. Two school districts were recruited to participate in this effort--McMinnville, Oregon, and Kyrene, Arizona. The draft case studies covered the demographics of each site, the testing system in place, the overall history of the activities, and the current status of each effort. Comparisons were made on the following subjects: (1) costs; (2) change agents; (3) role of technology; (4) curriculum alignment; (5) major issues and concerns; and (6) process of change. Extensive appendices attached to each case study provide background  materials, such as five year curriculum plans, testing schedules, class profiles, philosophy of education, courses of study, program evaluation plans, and cost options.

The dual focus approach has two advantages: (1) it provides a common information base for decisions at both ends of the continuum; and (2) it helps ensure that these decisions are in harmony with each other. In addition, this approach conserves time and effort of staff and students alike by making one data collection effort serve two purposes. This user oriented model reflects many years of evaluation experience by the Center for the Study of Evaluation (CSE). The model evaluation plan consists of eight steps: (1) identify evaluation  users and their needs; (2) form a task force; (3) reach consensus on information needs; (4) specify information base and develop measures; (5) develop procedures for data collection and report of results; (6) pilot and refine measures and procedures; (7) collect information; and (8) prepare reports.

Several types of testing and assessment options are considered against a background of validity. Criterion-referenced measurement is discussed extensively in terms of history, field study, identity problems, intellectual conflict, social conflict, and test design. The conflict between criterion-referenced tests and norm-referenced tests, development of norm-referenced tests, domain-referenced testing, problems with domain referenced tests, new approaches to content specification, quality control, integration of testing and instruction, and the narrow definition of testing are discussed as subjects for concern. Following this, a special model of  evaluation adapted to the problem of new technologies is detailed. In order for the model to assess new technologies as desired, the information must: (1) provide an enhanced documentary base for the processes of new technology development; (2) use state-of-the-art evaluation methodology, including both quantitative and qualitative approaches to measurement; and (3) provide policy feedback to the supporting agencies. Criterion referenced measurement is advocated for the assessment of instructional technology outcomes, with the caveat that such measurement is difficult. An 18 page bibliography is appended. (LMO)",

        "description":"The use of metaphor offers considerable promise within scientific disciplines for encouraging creative thinking, drawing attention to important concepts or principles in a discipline, and developing new methodologies. Ferguson's description of architectural practice as a metaphor for the development of social programs is used to demonstrate these uses of metaphor through a comparison of architecture to the development of culturally adapted minority education programs. Architecture's design process, which seeks to understand context through analysis and to create a form appropriate to that context through synthesis, parallels educational program development. Judging the success of the design process through the analysis of fit between the form and its context, extends the metaphor  to program evaluation. Like architecture, educational programs have functional-practical, milieu-creating and symbolic purpose. As in architectural building tasks, minority educational program development must analyze the cultural contexts, seek solutions to a series of functional or psychological needs, view the resulting form as one solution among many, and evaluate the fit.

        "author":["Jones, Douglas H."],
        "description":"The progress of modern mental test theory depends very much on the techniques of maximum likelihood estimation, and many popular applications make use of likelihoods induced by logistic item response models. While, in reality, item responses are nonreplicate within a single examinee and the logistic models are only ideal, practitioners make inferences using the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator derived as if item responses were replicated and satisfied their ideal model. This article proposes a sample space acknowledging these two realities and derives the asymptotic distribution of the induced maximum likelihood estimator. It is assumed that items, while sampled from an infinite set of items, have but a finite domain of alternate response functions.  Using the proposed sample space, the statistical functional approach of von Mises is applied to derive the influence curve of the maximum likelihood estimator; to discuss related robustness properties; and to derive new classes of resistent estimators. This article's general purpose is revealing the value of these methods for uncovering the relative merits of different item response functions. Proofs and mathematical derivations are minimized to increase the accessibility of this complex subject. (Author/LMO)",

NEOMYCIN's knowledge base and reasoning procedure constitute a model of how human knowledge is organized and how it is used in diagnosis. The hypothesis is tested that such a procedure can be used to simulate both expert problem-solving behavior and a good teacher's explanations of reasoning. The paper is divided into four major sections: (1) acquiring the model by protocol analysis, using a framework that separates an expert's causal explanations of evidence from his descriptions of knowledge relations and strategies; (2) overview of the diagnostic model; (3) representing the model, including strategy and domain knowledge; and (4) evaluating the  model for sufficiency and plausibility by testing it in different settings requiring expertise. NEOMYCIN's diagnostic procedure is discussed in detail, as a memory aid, as a set of operators, as proceduralized constraints, and as a grammar. (Author/LMO)",

Six experiments support the assumptions of the proposed framework. The experiments are designed to address the following categories of inquiry: (1) Can we adjust our strategy preference to mirror the ratio of presented to non-presented statements in a story? (2) What strategy is preferred when both strategies always work? (3) Can people switch strategies from question to question based on advice preceding each one? (4) Can people estimate answerability faster than they can answer? (5) Binary responding for estimate versus answer; and (6) Can our estimation process be subverted by spurious familiarity? The first three experiments  show that strategy-selection is under the strategic control of subject and that contextual variables affect this selection. Experiments 4 and 5 suggest that strategy selection also involves evaluating the question itself; Experiment 6 suggests variables that influence the evaluation of the question. This model is shown to be consistent with processing strategies in domains other than question-answering. (Author/LMO)",

Two studies involving CPSI are presented. The first study concerns a common parental cognitive task: causal analysis of an undesired behavior. The task was to diagnose the cause of non-contingent crying in an infant. The subjects were required to rule out causes of crying by acquiring the fewest and most important stored information units possible. The second type of problem, focused on decision making in a potentially difficult setting. The computer simulated the experience of shopping in the supermarket with a young child. As the computer reported that the child began to misbehave, the subject could select one of four or five  pre-programmed responses. Subjects in both experiments were 120 middle-class, college educated women from two locations. In the first problem, mothers and pediatric nurses were more efficient and accurate at reaching a solution than women without children. In the second study, nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous women showed differences in management techniques, but similarities in responses to child misbehavior. Further applications for the CPSI techniques are suggested. (LMO)",

Also investigated were within-school activities and systems to disseminate the information, and reactions of principals to various types of document content. The research plan incorporated preliminary studies, discussions with a number of educators, and questionnaires mailed to all members of an advisory committee for SET. Results showed that academics fall into  categories of those who accept the research model and those who question its validity. Teachers and school personnel had limited experience with SET because the materials seldom reached them. Publishing and distribution problems could be corrected through a considerable effort to recruit the cooperation of principals of schools, and through the development and use of a network. Current subscription statistics for SET and an analysis of item sources are included in the report. Appendices include a school visit checklist, a school librarian interview schedule, and other materials used in school and institutional visits. (LMO)",

        "description":"New legislation in 1972 shifted the emphasis of the California Assessment Program (CAP) from traditional every pupil achievement testing to a more efficient multiple-matrix testing design, under which a broad spectrum of skills could be surveyed without undue expenditure of educational resources. Scale score reporting was introduced to the grade 6 assessment in 1981-82. The purpose of the present report is to document activities undertaken in this endeavor. After a brief review of the fundamentals of CAP measurement models, the following topics are considered: (1) structure of the assessment instrument and the delineation of skill areas; (2) item calibration procedures and results; (3) scoring procedures for a single school in a single skill element, then for aggregations of  schools and/or skill elements; (4) method of approximating results for demographic subgroups within schools; and (5) equating of results from the prior grade 6 surveys to the new score scale. Appendices include (1) Calibration of Skill Element &quot;Classification of Numbers&quot;: One- and Two-Parameter Logistic Models; and (2) 1981-82 Grade 6 Item Parameter Estimates. (LMO)",

A 49-item attitude form was developed with six subscales representing distinct aspects of attitudes toward economics: (1) satisfaction with current grasp of economics; (2) capability for understanding economics; (3) attraction to economics; (4) economics as a field; (5) general need for economics; and (6) economics courses. The questionnaire was administered to three groups of adult students pursuing continuing education programs in financial services and to two groups of undergraduate students. Item scores, subscale scores, full form scores, inter-scale correlations and item scale correlations were calculated. Results indicated good reliability for  both the questionnaire and the subscales, but did not reveal strong differences between the subscales. In general, students' attitudes toward economics were quite positive. Differences and similarities between the different student groups followed traditional expectation. The data support further scale development and draw attention to the various facets of student attitudes toward economics. The questionnaire and item results and characteristics are appended. (BS)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the processes by which visual mental images--the precept-like short-term memory representations--are created from information stored in long-term memory. It also presents a new method for studying image generation. Three experiments were conducted using college students as subjects. In the first experiment, a Podgorny and Shephard paradigm was adapted to study image generation. In the second experiment, regression analyses were performed on response times in a scanning instruction and no-scanning instruction condition. Experiment three was designed to investigate whether scanning plays a functional role in image generation. Results indicated that images of upper case letters are formed segment by segment, in roughly the order in which most people draw the  letters. Results were shown not to be an artifact of how people scan images once they are formed, and could not have been due to experimenter-expectancy effects. Results also indicated that subjective estimates of mental image generation time are quite close to those obtained using objective measures. (Author/LMO)",

        "description":"Visual recognition, navigation, tracking, and imagery are posited to involve some of the same types of representations and processes. The first part of this paper develops a theory of some of the shared types of representations and processing modules. The theory is developed in light of neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data from non-human primates, computational constraints, and behavioral data from human subjects. In developing theories of some of the high-level computations that are performed by the visual system, three problems which must be solved by any visual system are considered: (1) position variability; (2) figure/ground segregation; and (3) non-rigid transformations. The second part of the paper develops a mechanism for the development of lateralization of visual  function in the brain. The theory rests on a set of relatively simple, uncontroversial properties of the brain, including: (1) processing components; (2) exercise; (3) selectivity; (4) &quot;central&quot; bilateral control; and (5) reciprocal innervation. This theory leads to predictions about the lateralization of the putative processing modules. The third part of the paper examines critical tests of these predictions, and reviews relevant empirical findings in the literature. Eight pages of references and several figures are included.

        "description":"Pennsylvania's &quot;Testing for Essential Learning and Literacy Skills&quot; (TELLS) program was instituted during the 1984-85 school year, to identify reading and mathematics problems early in a student's school career. This document describes the intent and legislation behind TELLS, the implementation of the test, population tested, properties of the test, results of the test for noncategorical students and total groups, and analyses of results for each objective. Committees of Pennsylvania reading and mathematics professionals selected objectives to serve as the basis for the tests and chose Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company to provide test items meeting those objectives. The tests were administered in October 1984 to grades 3, 5, and 8. Students falling at or below cut scores  became eligible for state-funded remedial instruction. About 35 percent of public school students and 24 percent of nonpublic students became eligible for at least one program. For certain objectives, the performance of above-cut students differed greatly from that of below-cut student. For grade 3 the Multiple Meaning Words objective marked the greatest difference on the reading test; for grades 5 and 8, the Inferential and Critical Comprehension was most indicative. Appendices include: (1) selected sections from the State Board regulations; (2) applicable sections of Act 93; (3) TELLS objectives; and (4) samples of reports. (LMO)",

The analysis is in three parts. The first part describes CAP's founding in the 1930s and analyzes the process through which it was established and the operation of its prevention programs. The second part examines the operation of the CAP program in South Chicago in 1980, in light of assumptions derived from the historical analysis of the salient features of CAP philosophy and practice. Both parts focus on the ways CAP was implemented and the implications these ways may have had for its success, or lack of success, in preventing delinquency. The third part of the analysis combines census data with data on delinquency  rates and data on program participation and operations to develop a rudimentary quantitative method to enlarge upon and with which to make a preliminary validation of earlier analyses.

Bilingual instruction is also provided in social studies, mathematics, and science. The program was designed to develop career awareness and to encourage students to develop their bilingual skills as a potential asset in the business world. Program objectives were assessed in mathematics, science, social studies, and Spanish (teacher-made tests), and in English language development via the Criterion Referenced English Syntax Test (CREST). Quantitative analysis of achievement data indicates that: (1) Overall, students met the program criterion of mastery of one CREST  objective per month of instruction both semesters; (2) Those enrolled in Spanish language courses achieved the 65% passing objective; (3) In content-area subjects, only 11th grade students in science (fall) and 12th grade students in math (fall), social studies (fall), and science (fall and spring) were able to meet program objectives. The report recommends that students who are somewhat proficient in English be mainstreamed and assisted with tutoring. Further, it recommends that separate testing of the survival skills emphasized in the program be initiated, that greater efforts be made to involve parents, more materials be developed in mathematics and social studies; and that exploration be made of the failure of students to meet program objectives in content areas.

Total spending is examined by purpose and source in Chapter 1, followed by a description of recipients of public expenditures and some of the rationales for these expenditures in Chapters 2 and 3. Next, the extent of community-based rather than institution-based programs is examined for such areas as mental retardation, delinquency, and substance abuse. Chapter 5 examines the extent of preventive as opposed to treatment programs. The final two  chapters analyze the importance of nonservice spending such as administrative expenses, and describe spending in Texas in relation to the State's administrative structure for children's programs.

The activities in the guide can be implemented throughout the school year to help students become aware of the social, economic, and political climate during the civil rights movement and to appreciate Dr. King's role as a proponent of civil rights for all people. Following a brief overview, a list of teacher and student objectives, and a chronology table, the guide is divided into two major sections: (1) Lesson Plans and Activities for Grades K-6, and (2) Lesson Plans and Activities for Secondary Grades 7-12. Both sections present five different lesson plans (together with  the required readings, plays, charts, illustrations, and timelines) and conclude with a list of additional instructional activities. The activities in Section 1 focus on : (1) King's childhood; (2) his message of mutual understanding and respect (considered in relation to students' own behavior); (3) the facts and accomplishments of King's life; (4) the reasons for celebrating King's birthday; and (5) the chronology of King's life. Section 2 focuses on: (1) the struggle for voting rights; (2) the philosophies and activities of persons who influenced King's press for civil rights; (3) the relationship of King's goals to the goals upon which America was built; (4) the role of groups and organizations in the civil rights movement; and (5) the evolution of nonviolence from the 1940s through  the 1960s. The guide concludes with an annotated bibliography of books, teaching aids, and information resources. An appendix includes additional materials and resources. (KH)",

Chapter 1 discusses how poverty is measured, recent trends and current patterns of childhood poverty as officially measured, and the effects of using alternative definitions of poverty. Chapter 2 describes issues that arise in determining the scope of direct government efforts to aid low-income families and in designing specific policies. It then examines the current Federal role, and concludes with an overview of options for altering current policies. The options themselves are discussed in chapters 3 through 6. Chapter 3, on options for cash transfer programs, focuses on aid to  families with dependent children, the earned income tax credit, and other alternatives. Chapter 4 analyzes options for in-kind transfer programs, including food stamps, school nutrition programs, health care, and housing assistance. Chapter 5 considers options to deal with the effects of poverty, including nutrition and health services, child welfare services, targeted education programs, and services related to adolescent pregnancy and parenthood. Chapter 6 discusses options to improve employability, such as employment and training, and child care services. An appendix assesses current and alternative measures of poverty. The report includes 23 statistical tables and figures. (KH)",

The data were obtained from the March 1985 Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The report covers data on: The Food Stamp Program; the National School Lunch Program; public and other subsidized rental housing; Medicare health insurance; Medicaid health insurance; CHAMPUS, VA, or military health insurance; and employer or union provided pension plans and group health insurance plans. There are two types of recipients for these noncash benefits: means-tested (those whose household income falls below a specified level) and non means-tested. In 1984, 88% of the households in the United States received at least one  noncash benefit, an increase from 1983 of approximately 972,000 households. Households receiving at least one means-tested benefit did not change significantly from 1983 to 1984, but those households receiving nonmeans-tested benefits increased from 69.8 million to 70.7 million from 1983 to 1984. The body of this report consists of tables showing the collected data.

Table 1 gives racial/ethnic student distribution in the State's five major school districts (Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers), for the rest of the State, and for the State as a whole. Table 2 presents the distribution of Black and Hispanic students by location in the State. It shows that 70.6% of all Black students and 86.5% of Hispanic students attend school in New York City. Table 3 shows a percent distribution of students by racial/ethnic origin for the years 1980-81 through 1984-85. In the large cities, the  minority group population rose from 66.5% to 69.1%, with an even larger increase in Yonkers.

The data were collected by the Census Bureau in a supplement to the March 1985 Current Population Survey (CPS), which used independent postcensal estimates on Hispanics. The Hispanic population has grown by 16% since 1980 as a result of high fertility and increased immigration. This is a proportionately larger increase than that for the total population. The Hispanic population has a higher median age in 1985 than it did in 1980 (up from 23.2 to 25) but still lower than the non-Hispanic population. Hispanics had a lower educational attainment level than non-Hispanics, with 14% having completed less than five years of school  compared with only 2% of non-Hispanics of comparable age. In 1985, 72% of Hispanic families were married-couple families and 23% were families with single women heading the household. Family composition varied markedly among different Hispanic groups. There was no statistically significant difference between labor force participation of Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations, but the unemployment rate was substantially higher for Hispanics (11.3% versus 7.4%). The median income for Hispanic families in 1984 was $18,800 and for non-Hispanics $27,000. In 1984, the proportion of Hispanic families below the poverty level was more than double that of non-Hispanic families. (CG)",

(2) How should resources be  targeted to people with diverse needs? What approaches work best for which groups? (3) What is the Federal role in assuring that adequate child care and medical care are available to mothers making the transition from welfare to work? (4) How should government make the initial investment needed to reach severely disadvantaged participants? (5) How should Federal programs be designed to effectively serve large numbers of people? (6) How does Federal policy affect the availability of better-paying employment options for women?

Bennett, for Federal legislation to convert the Existing Chapter 1 program of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, which provides remedial educational services to disadvantaged students, into a tuition voucher program. The report, which is organized in outline form, makes 8 major points: (1) The voucher bill is objectionable on philosophical grounds. (2) Poor parents would not really have the choice of schools the voucher advocates claim. (3) The voucher bill would negatively affect Chapter 1, a program that is currently working well. (4) The bill would irresponsibly offer public funds without demanding public accountability; (5) The voucher program will be an administrative  nightmare. (6) The bill could have a negative effect on civil rights and desegregation. (7) The bill raises serious constitutional problems, such as the separation of church and state and the tuition tax credit issue. (8) The voucher would be a $3.2 billion experiment based on inadequate and inconclusive evidence. (KH)",

        "description":"This report uses motivation theory, social and cognitive development theory, and a construct, Definition of Reality (DOR), to explain why the black students of the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) do less well on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills as they progress from elementary school into high school. The report is divided into 8 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the study's purpose, background, and hypotheses, and Chapter 2 discusses its theoretical basis. Chapters 3 through 7 discuss social and cognitive development and the resulting DOR at progressive stages in school. Chapter 8 presents general conclusions. Major findings, it is said, are: (1) As black children mature, they begin to experience and discern the many culturally imposed hostilities of American  society. This process engenders a DOR that encourages them to believe they will continue to be powerless, low caste, and discriminated against by white society. (2) By early adolescence, many blacks have learned to adapt to their DOR by giving less time and energy to schoolwork. They believe that academic achievement will neither change their economically subjugated position nor provide them with the benefits that come to high-achieving white children. (3) The declining test scores in the DCPS present a clear profile of lessening motivation as students adapt to the imposed DOR. Improving black academic achievement motivation, it is argued, will depend heavily on initiatives which take place outside of schools: integration and compensatory programs, in themselves, cannot significantly  alter the black child's perception of the racial biases of the outside community.

In a paper entitled &quot;Program Evaluation in a Multicampus Community College District,&quot; Ted Martinez, Jr., reports on the evaluation system that was designed to deal with a multicollege entity (Dallas County  Community College District) in Texas designed to serve 25,000 occupational students in 123 different occupational programs. Maurice Lemoine discusses the problem of developing and implementing a three-tiered evaluation approach at a large, single-campus college serving 25,000 students in a major metropolitan area suburb in his paper entitled &quot;Triton College Program Evaluation Model.&quot; Appendixes to this forum report include guidelines and data collection instruments used in the evaluation processes at each of the three 2-year colleges discussed and a list of member institutions of the NPA in 1985-86.

        "description":"A research project examined the effectiveness of using personal tutors/counselors in distance education programs as a means of reducing student attrition. In the experiment, one person integrated the roles of different tutors in different subjects as well as the role of the student advisor in the ordinary distance education system. The main difference between the treatment of the experimental and control groups was that the experimental students communicated with one personal tutor who integrated administrative, teaching, and counseling functions, which are normally carried out by three separate individuals in Norway's distance education system. Students in the experimental group participated in 3 to 11 courses each. Eight months after enrollment, the experimental group had a  higher completion rate than the control group. However, although the completion rate was higher in the experimental group, the proportion of active students was still comparable with that of the control group. The control group contained a larger percentage of inactive students. (Appendixes to this report include the study questionnaire and study-related correspondence in Norwegian.

The purposes of the study were to produce an equity handbook on education and employment and to develop a gathered through interviews with 60 women enrolled in traditional and nontraditional vocational training programs at Pueblo and Pikes Peak Community Colleges. The traditional group was most often influenced by friends or self in declaring a major. Nearly half of the nontraditional group viewed theirs as a self-decision, although many more reported using information from advisors, counselors, and male family members. The most often reported difficulties were financial problems, family problems, coursework, and scheduling. The biggest  needs were child care facilities, more counseling, training in job acquisition skills, and career and placement information. Both groups recommended more career counseling and information to aid in recruitment of women into nontraditional programs. The traditional group was concerned with changing traditional attitudes; the nontraditional group advocated advertising, recruitment programs, and role models. The report concludes by recommending support systems for females in nontraditional programs, dissemination of career information, job placement, recruitment of women, and equity inservice for educators.

        "author":["Fahy, Patrick J."],
        "description":"Because of the increasingly diversified population and needs of adult students at the Alberta Vocational Centre, a more flexible and responsible learning environment was needed. A brief effort using PLATO hardware and Basic Skills courseware for grades 3-8, and then for high school equivalency programs, was successful. However, it would have been too cumbersome and expensive for long-term, widespread use, because of the large amount of hardware that would have been required, and the necessity for teachers to make radical changes in their teaching styles. In 1983, efforts began to develop computer-managed learning (CML) by converting an existing basic mathematics course to computer management using PLATO Learning Management (PLM). PLM is an author system that permits development  of tests and drills by non-programmers. Once developed, PLM-based materials incorporate PLATO's extensive recordkeeping capabilities with high reliability, graphics, and telecommunications. Results of this project indicated that students whose achievement had been minimal under conventional teacher-directed learning conditions could improve their learning, and could cope successfully--even happily--with computer management. Becasue of the success of the CML venture, a project to use it in the nursing assistant program at Alberta Vocational Centre will be implemented in September of 1986. CML is an application of technology with powerful potential to reorganize the learning environment and the learning experience for both students and teachers; it reorganizes the learning experience  without completely changing the teaching experience. With CML, both teachers and students can be shown and can experience the liberating power of this technology. (KC)",

        "description":"A mail survey of Nebraska fire departments/districts was conducted during summer 1983 to assess the human and physical resources available to them with special emphasis on equipment and protective clothing needed in pesticide-related emergencies. It also assessed general preparedness for responding to agrichemical emergencies, particularly those involving pesticides, and determined the scope of experience in responding to pesticide-related emergencies. Oxygen supplies for medical emergencies were carried by 27 percent of the firefighting vehicles; 70 percent had a medical emergency kit available. In approximately 6 of every 10 departments, less than half of the personnel had completed an Emergency Medical Technician, Firefighter First Aid, or equivalent course. More than half of  the departments had special equipment (self-contained breathing apparatus, chemical suits) available for use in contaminated environments. Most departments assigned personnel without training on how to deal with special situations (e.g., chemical fires) and reported spending four hours or less in-service training time on that same topic within the past three years. Few departments reported that significant percentages of their personnel had certificates, diplomas, or degrees in firefighting or related areas. Most responses to calls during 1982 involving pesticides were located in rural areas. (YLB)",

Data were from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Labor Market Behavior, a longitudinal study with annual interviews from 1979 through 1983 of youth between the ages of 14 and 21 in the first year. Two central hypotheses were that a woman who expects to allocate more time to the home is more likely to expect intermittent labor force participation and therefore selects a typically female occupation and that marital and child-bearing expectations will affect gender typicality of a woman's, but not of a man's, occupational choice. These hypotheses were confirmed. Higher ability women were more likely to plan labor force  participation. Coming from a female-headed household increased daughters' labor force commitment and the chances they would choose traditionally male occupations. Little support was found for the hypotheses that being in a job traditional for one's sex affects turnover. Results showed general support for the hypotheses that the greater the mismatch between job characteristics and the individual's characteristics, the higher the probability of turnover and that the less attractive the job, the higher the probability of turnover.

        "description":"A task force was created to establish a collaborative relationship among government, education, private agencies, and employers for transition services for special education students. Findings were that unemployment and underemployment were extremely high for special education graduates who lacked adequate basic, job-seeking, and work skills. Few options were available for pursuing education beyond high school. Many graduates did not know how to make effective use of available adult services, nor how to find special services for disabled adults. Parents were uninformed about work or education options, service providers were not well informed about school services and potential client needs, and employers did not know where to find disabled job applicants or obtain services to  help them adapt jobs. Legislation lacked a unified approach to transition services. Action recommendations were made to the school system and county government to create a transition service delivery system. Four components of the school transition service were planning, instruction, linking, and staff development. Four components of the county government system were planning and coordination, program expansion and improvement, business linkages, and legislative advocacy.

Usable surveys were returned by 342 teachers in 236 schools. The predominant brand of computer at the secondary level was the Apple II; most postsecondary schools used both Apple II and IBM personal computers. High schools had an average of 19 computers for instructional use in the business department; postsecondary schools had an average of 35. The business microcomputer applications currently taught most frequently were word processing, accounting, BASIC programming, spreadsheet use, and database applications. Computers were infrequently used to teach content. The content areas  most frequently taught using computers were accounting and keyboarding. Teachers infrequently used computers as a teaching management tool (word processing and spreadsheets). Less than half of responding teachers marked any area of instructional computing as one about which they needed more information; they were often those already using computers most. Teachers teaching with computers liked the experience. Areas of greater indecision were equity in access to computers by teachers and students, copying software for classroom use, and preparation of business teachers for using computers in instruction.

The competencies upon which these modules are based were identified and verified through research as being important to successful occupational teaching at all levels of instruction. The modules are suitable for the preparation of instructors in all occupational areas. This module is designed to give prospective teachers skill in organizing their classes and laboratories to install competency based education (CBE). It deals with the decision making, planning, and preparation that must be done before students actually arrive to participate in the CBE program. The information and practice activities  in this module will assist student teachers in providing two key pieces to the CBE puzzle: a learning environment designed to help individual students achieve competencies, and a realistic system for managing records, assigning grades, and taking in new students. The module consists of a terminal objective, enabling objectives, prerequisites, resources, and four learning experiences. The learning experiences, each based on an enabling objective, contain activities, information, case studies, examples, and feedback. The final learning experience is an actual teaching situation in which the prospective teacher is to organize his/her class and laboratory to install CBE and be assessed by a resource person. (KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the pedagogical inservice needs of postsecondary agriculture instructors in the United States by type of institution, and to determine the types of inservice activities available to postsecondary agriculture instructors by type of institution. A survey questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of 430 instructors. The 306 instructors who replied rated 118 pedagogical competencies and 19 inservice activities. The results of the survey showed that full-time instructors expressed greater need for inservice education regarding pedagogical competencies than part-time instructors. Part-time instructors rated availability of inservice activities at their institutions higher than full-time instructors did. However, more than  one-third of the part-time instructors did not know what inservice activities were available at their institutions. Instructors at institutions offering bachelor's degrees and above in agriculture had less inservice need for pedagogical competencies than instructors in institutions offering two-year degrees or less. Instructors in the bachelor's degree-granting institutions see their greatest pedagogical inservice need to be \"teaching with the aid of a microcomputer,\" while instructors at institutions granting lower degrees perceived their highest inservice need to be \"recruiting students\" for their programs. The results of the study can be used to help educators and supervisors of postsecondary agriculture instructors to meet the divergent needs of instructors at different types of  institutions. Appendices contain letters of correspondence, the final questionnaire, and tables of statistical data. (KC)",

        "description":"A project was begun in 1978 to test the feasibility of a high-skill training program that would prepare welfare recipients for well-paying jobs in the private sector. The training for this specially selected Work Incentive Program (WIN) was to be provided by two Bell and Howell schools, one in Columbus, Ohio, and the other in Chicago. Training consisted of a two-year program for electronics technicians. The WIN women who entered the program were older, usually black, heads of households, and academically weaker than the school's usual young, white, male students. Special counselors, tutoring, child care, and allowances were provided for the students selected. The program was evaluated after five years, comparing the specially selected WIN group with a regular short-term WIN  training group. It was found that 53 of the women in the special group (29 percent) graduated--not much lower than the schools' graduation rate for regular students. However, the academic difficulties and personal problems that were largely responsible for the high dropout rate also affected the progress of those who managed to graduate; most graduated in more than two years. Employment information was obtained from graduates, dropouts, and comparison group members at two points in their careers. Following graduation, 34 (71 percent) of the WIN clients were successful in obtaining employment. Those who did find jobs were well paid; salaries averaged $12,883, considerably higher than the national average of $7,634 for women placed under the regular WIN program. However, cost-benefit  analysis of the program showed that program costs were higher than either client wages or taxes paid by former clients could match, so the program received mixed ratings.

Elderly Americans spend less than younger people on food away from home and on alcoholic beverages. Households in the Northeast and West spend more on food than those in the South and North central regions, and nonblacks spend more on food than do blacks. Per person spending on food varies little across seasons. This study uses tobit analysis of the 1980-81 Continuing Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure effects of income and other demographic factors on per person spending for 28 food groups and alcoholic beverages. The results are combined with projections of income,  age distribution, regional population shifts, racial mix, and population growth to project food spending to the year 2020. Food groups projected to increase most are food away from home, fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and alcoholic beverages. (Author/KC)",

Following an introduction, a complete description of the farm is provided. The next section presents the LP model, which is structured to help analyze after-tax income and erosion effects of soil conservation and commodity program options on cash-grain farms having various land, labor, and financial resources. The model can be used directly or easily modified for farms in other critically eroding Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs). (The model maximizes after-tax farm income subject to a simultaneous system of linear resource constraints.) The mathematical expression of the model is presented; a  sample tableau of the LP matrix follows as well as a full documentation of the purpose and coefficient derivation procedure for each row and column. Symbols used in the equations appear immediately after the equations. Other contents include a description of the data sets used for this study and the output report of a sample optimization run on a microcomputer. (YLB)",

It presents by occupational area basic information on more than 150 validated measures and lists more than 1,200 additional entries in the Vocational Education Curriculum Materials (VECM) database that include evaluation materials. The compendium was drafted following computer searches of three databases: Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), VECM, and Educational Testing Service (ETS), in addition to letter requests to curriculum coordination centers, instructional materials laboratories, and commercial publishers. Most of the measures verified as field-tested are from three sources: the National Occupational  Competency Testing Institute, the Instructional Materials Laboratory at Ohio State University, and the American Institutes for Research. Entries in this guide are organized by the four-digit &quot;Classification of Instructional Programs&quot; system. Listings include descriptions of the tests, addresses of originators, title, developer, educational level, target population, availability, and curriculum center. The compendium is designed for use at all levels of vocational education by those who need to select instruments for use in assessing the outcomes of instructional programs. It should be of most use to those who cannot easily conduct computer searches of the databases that contain the instruments listed in this compendium. Appendices contain an index, examples of VECM documents, and a sample  ERIC search strategy. (KC)",

It also ascertained how well secondary vocational education is serving women, minority groups, handicapped individuals, economically disadvantaged persons, and persons with limited English proficiency. Data were from the High School and Beyond National Longitudinal Survey. Among vocational majors, men were relatively more numerous in vocational high schools and area vocational centers. Vocational high schools enrolled relatively more blacks and low-ability and low socioeconomic status (SES) students than did the other two types of schools. The trade and industry specialty was the  most popular in vocational high schools and area vocational centers, the business specialty in comprehensive high schools. Although women were predominantly enrolled in business, the majority of women attending vocational high schools specialized in trade and industry. The effect of delivery systems on earnings was negligible when compared with the effects of students' characteristics and environmental factors. The only significant findings of a delivery system effect on earnings was a negative one for area vocational centers compared to comprehensive high schools. Findings provided a basis for questioning the popular notion that area vocational centers produce a better payoff. (YLB)",

Data on four school programs--vocational noncooperative, vocational cooperative, general education, and college preparatory--were collected in a repeated measure design via observations, testing, and interviews. A total of 360 observations of each of the four programs at six different schools were conducted. The data collected indicated that all four educational programs examined have something to learn from the others. It was recommended that vocational programs increase (1) both the exposure to and the level of reading skills required for vocational students; (2) the demand for the level of mathematics skills that students use in completing  tasks; (3) students' involvement and intensity with activities requiring the use of data; and (4) students' opportunities for autonomy, self-direction, and feedback. Vocational educators were also urged to create a more caring and supportive learning environment to help students perceive vocational education classes more positively.

        "description":"The aging of the population is one of the major influences on the environment in which vocational education operates. The number of people 65 and older will increase more slowly in next 25 years than in the past. Improvements in working conditions, health care, and pension plans since World War II have made those who will be 65 by the end of the century healthier and more financially secure than previous generations of the elderly. Medical advances that should lead to sizeable increases (5 years or more) in the life expectency of the elderly in this century are not likely. A significant proportion of those approaching age 65 express interest in working, usually on a part-time basis; however, labor force participation by males 55 and over has been declining steadily. These  findings suggest that those elderly persons who are most likely to want and need vocational education are the poor and near-poor. The role that appears most appropriate for vocational education is to serve those who wish to work but lack skills.

Through extensive document review, supplemented by telephone and on-site discussions with educators and employers, the benefits that accrue to both groups have been documented. The following patterns of collaboration are identified, along with examples from on-going programs: employer representatives as school advisors, job training programs for employers, employer representatives as trainers, loans or gifts of equipment to schools, brokering of educational services, small business linkages, and training material repositories. The report outlines preliminary  standards of program success, proposes factors contributing to successful linkages, and presents possible barriers to cooperation. Among the factors that appear to be instrumental in the success of vocational education-defense establishment collaborative efforts are the following: (1) recognition that providing training services to employers is serving students; (2) recognition on the part of state government that vocational education has a role to play in economic development, which can contribute to defense preparedness; (3) emphasis on determining the common needs of business and vocational education; (4) openness of communication; (5) realistic commitments by vocational education to employers; (6) a current marketing plan; (7) staff members actually engaged in promotion and sales; and  (8) recognition of the differences between the business environment and education.

These guidelines are concerned not only with collaborative efforts between vocational education and defense industries, but also with linkages between vocational education and the armed forces. The guide contains 11 sections. The first section is an overview of the vocational education-defense sector relationship. It is followed in the next two sections by a discussion of the benefits of  vocational education-defense collaboration and examples of collaborative efforts. The fourth section contains information on determining standards of program effectiveness, while the fifth and sixth sections discuss factors contributing to successful linkages and barriers to such linkages. In the seventh section, a systems approach to cooperative planning is presented; this is followed by a section on implementation processes and techniques and a section on a comprehensive evaluation system.

Chapter 1 provides a general overview of vocational education today--what is offered, who is served, what is accomplished, and what it costs. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of Federal vocational education policy from its beginnings in 1917 to the most recent reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act in 1984. Chapter 3 develops the argument for adopting a new approach to Federal vocational education policy and describes the elements of \"permissive planning.\" Chapter 4 outlines a  performance-based approach to evaluating vocational education programs and discusses how the desired outcomes of vocational education should be defined and measured. Chapter 5 addresses the problem of improving the accuracy and consistency of vocational education data. Chapter 6 presents findings from site visits to local secondary and postsecondary institutions offering vocational education programs to elicit local perspectives on performance-based evaluation. Chapter 7 adds a concluding note on possible future directions for Federal policy in vocational education. (YLB)",

An overview provides background information: a definition, content, scope and sequence for IA, and the integration of the essential learning skills. The next three sections contain IA goals and examples of teacher and student activities that help children acquire knowledge and skill in the three major areas of IA: graphic and electronic communication, energy-power-transportation, and materials--processes. The next section contains activity sheets that expand 17 of the 96 activities suggested in the three preceding sections. They are  presented as examples to be used for planning and conducting elementary school IA activities. The final section lists resources available to develop and present IA experiences to elementary school students, including software, kits, books, human resources, and resource organizations. (YLB)",

        "description":"This Congressional report contains a state-by-state look at what is being done about teen pregnancy. Data are presented from a survey of state governors which examined the impact of current teen pregnancy policies and programs. Information regarding needs, services, special projects, and initiatives is included. Barriers to successful programs, as well as recommendations for improving current efforts are presented. The data are organized into four chapters: (1) National Perspectives on Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting; (2) Barriers and Serving At-Risk, Pregnant, and Parenting Teens; (3) Federal Policies and Programs, and State Efforts; and (4) State Efforts to Serve At-Risk, Pregnant, and Parenting Teens. Findings are presented which illustrate the high costs of pregnancy to  teens, their children, and the government, especially in terms of health care costs and support programs. States are unable to document extent of teen pregnancy, what benefits teens are receiving, who finishes school, effects of pregnancy; moreover fewer than one-half of the states can provide information on federal efforts. Significant barriers to improved services include overlooking prevention efforts, not taking a comprehensive approach to the issue, providing insufficient education for teens and communities, poor coordination, inadequate funding and insufficient data, and rarely making an effort to involve teen fathers. Two promising trends are reported: more states are focusing attention on teen pregnancy, and parental involvement is increasing. Appendices include the questionnaire  submitted to the governors, references (including all documents submitted by states), federal program descriptions, and the 1985 Adolescent Family Life Grantees listed by state.

The federal response of mandating a 21-year-old drinking age for states with the threat of loss of some highway funds for non-compliance is reviewed. Among the facts supporting a 21-year-old drinking age are: (1) when the drinking age was lowered to 18, accidents and deaths involving young drivers climbed immediately; (2) alcohol-related automobile accidents are the leading cause of death for 16- to 24-year-olds; (3) states which raised the drinking age to 21 significantly reduced nighttime fatal crashes of the young; and (4) the  fatal alcohol-related crash rate for 18- to 20-year-old drivers is three times the rate for older drivers.

A study was conducted which asked older adults to remember an experienced event, retention of experiences being considered a better indicator of functioning ability than retention of word lists. In an initial study, older adults' recall was found to be better in a meaningful context but was still not as good as the younger adults' recall. To test if better instructions would yield improved results, a follow-up study was conducted. Participants included 10 older adults aged 60-79 years from a college alumni association and 10 younger adults aged 18-20 from a college psychology class. Participants were told to make clay and then form shapes from it. Participants were informed  that they would be asked to report everything they could remember about the procedure. A videotape was shown to illustrate the type of details to be remembered. Memory for four types of information was examined: superordinate and subordinate actions of clay-making and shape-making. The results indicated that only subordinate shape-making recall was lower for older adults than for younger adults. The organization of a meaningful context and additional instructions may have helped older adults' recall improvement in the second study. Further research should examine context-relevant memory although context support does not completely compensate for memory decline. (ABL)",

The unique contributions of play therapy are evaluated including the therapy's accessibility to young children, its richness and flexibility, its exposure of covert patterns, its wealth of therapeutic means, and its therapeutic economy. The systematization of the therapy attempts to show what the formal and functional properties of make-believe play are, how they can be used in the family play-therapeutic process, and how they can be mobilized to bring about desired change. Properties of make-believe play are: (1) emotionally regulated choice of themes; (2) associative fields and symbolization; (3) differentiation of thematic content from communicative functions; and (4) realification, identification, and  playfulness. Principles of realification, identification, and playfulness can have manifold uses in family play therapy in the areas of materialization, owning and alienation, separation of levels, and arbitrariness of signifier. The paper also raises the question of how a therapist can influence the participants in family play therapy to act in ways that let the above-mentioned properties be activated without making participants feel constrained, unnatural or ridiculous.

        "description":"Recent research suggests that alcoholic inpatients' performance on neuropsychological tests is predictive of their drinking status following discharge from alcohol rehabilitation programs, although no single test itself has been predictive of relapse. This study seeks to develop a ecologically relevant memory test that would predict relapse and could be easily administered to alcoholic inpatients. Participants were 56 male veterans ranging in age from 21 to 66 who were inpatients in an alcohol treatment program which advocated abstinence. Participants completed the Product Recall Test (PRT), an ecologically relevant test consisting of cut-out magazine advertisements placed on cards to test memory recall. The Memory-for-Designs Test (MFD) was administered as an ecologically  irrelevant test for comparison. The results indicated that significantly more subjects who recalled less than or equal to one-half of the PRT test items relapsed. The MFD test showed no relationship to relapse. Poor performance on the ecologically relevant test may be related to relapse rates because those individuals with poor recall of real world items may be less socially effective and therefore more subject to relapse.

Findings were recorded for ideology, affiliation with organized religion, dimensions of religiosity, and clinical practice and training. Several conclusions can be drawn from the survey. The results revealed that psychologists were distributed equally within three ideological frameworks. They appeared to address religious, spiritual, and  ontological issues in their personal lives and to respect the function that religion serves in peoples' lives. In general, they did not affiliate with organized religion, although the majority reported having been raised in a religion and in general did not report this as being a negative experience. Professionally, psychologists dealt with religious and spiritual issues in psychotherapy and the majority felt personally competent to counsel clients regarding spirituality.

        "description":"Information integration theory (IIT) seeks to develop a unified theory of judgment and behavior. This theory provides a conceptual framework that has been applied to a variety of research areas including personality impression formation and decision making. In these applications information integration theory has helped to resolve methodological and theoretical problems. The core of the IIT approach lies in the inductive analysis of multiple causation. IIT is applied in an inductive mode; generalizations emerge from experimental analysis. In nearly every area in which integration theory has been applied, this focus has led to significant restructuring of basic issues. This shift in thinking affects every aspect of research, from mundane details of methodology to the  epistemological nature of theory. Moreover, the inductive perspective sees behavioral science not as a formalized knowledge structure, but as an ongoing inquiry system. For IIT, the ultimate unit of analysis is the individual. The IIT approach has implications for various types of generality and for nomothetic versus ideographic research strategies. (Author/ABL)",

This report focuses on three issues: (1) an assessment of the consistency of responses between 1982 and 1983; (2) a description of the demographics of drinking patterns using indices developed from the 1983 data; and (3) a description of the occupational patterns of drinking among young people. It is noted that questions about the age respondents began drinking and drinking patterns in the last week and month were  asked in the survey. Since the survey was self-reporting, test validating measures are described and the issues of response accuracy and response bias are addressed. The report describes measurements and definitions of categories of drinkers. Descriptions of drinking patterns are given with variations in drinking patterns by demographic characteristics including age, sex, and race. Socioeconomic factors relating to alcohol consumption including poverty status, educational attainment, family background, religious background, and parental background are discussed. The effects of occupation and industry on drinking are given. Thirty-three tables of survey results are included. Broad conclusions are discussed. The alcohol use section of the survey is appended.

Those results are then extended with multivariate analyses of alcohol use patterns as they are related to indicators of socioeconomic status. Age and trends in alcohol consumption are discussed with tables illustrating the number of days on which the respondents drank in the previous week, the total number of drinks consumed, and the average number of drinks per drinking day compared for the three survey years (1982-84).  Drinking and social status and problem drinking are discussed and supporting data tables are included. A major portion of the report details the patterns of reported problems within the young adult population. Several issues are raised in the conclusion of this document. It is noted that: (1) quantity and frequency should be distinguished in the interpretation of results; (2) blacks have a higher prevalence of cirrhosis than do whites, although blacks reported less alcohol consumption; and (3) alcohol related problems are not merely a function of alcohol consumption. An appendix contains the alcohol use section of the survey instrument. (ABL)",

Literature is reviewed which defines self-concept and concludes that measurement of different definitions are difficult to perform. Self-concept is then defined as the individual's repertoire of self-descriptive behavior including self-knowledge, self-esteem, and self-ideal which can be measured by physical maturity, peer relations, academic success, and school adaptiveness.

        "description":"Distributive justice deals with the fairness of outcomes or rewards while procedural justice deals with the fairness of the rules and processes involved in the distribution of rewards. Two studies were conducted to examine the influence of different social contexts on the effects of procedural (PF) and distributive (DF) fairness. College students (N=584) in the first study read a story describing a college situation in which a professor allocated a course grade to a student. In the second study, college students (N=192) read a story describing a supervisor allocating a pay increase to a worker. The school study used three PF levels; the work study used two PF levels, and both studies used three DF levels. After reading the stories, subjects completed questionnaires which included  measures of nine dependent variables. The results indicated that: (1) both PF and DF had strong effects on the affective and social responses studied; (2) PF had much greater influence than DF in the work context, but not in the school context; and (3) the relative impact of PF vesus DF varied for different social and affective responses. These findings suggest that PF is quite important and that justice research and theory dealing only with DF is seriously incomplete. The findings also suggest that social and allocation context may influence the roles of PF and DF in their relative impact on social and affective responses. (NRB)",

        "description":"While the prediction of college grade point average (GPA) has been extensively investigated, research results seem inconclusive. Recent developments in the realm of intelligence have emphasized word knowledge and world knowledge. These two components were investigated relative to college GPA in a group of elementary and secondary student teachers (N=137) and in a group of college freshmen (N=36). Subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test to measure reading rate and reading comprehension, the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) to measure general world knowledge, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Revised (PPVT-R) to measure word knowledge. Further information was gathered to provide values for the subjects' high school and college GPA's. Data analysis  from both groups provided similar findings: high school GPA and the score from the PPVT-R were the best predictors of college GPA with high school GPA being the best single predictor. These findings suggest that past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior. Since the addition of scores from the PPVT-R provided an even better prediction model, word knowledge may be a significant factor in predicting college GPA. The fact that both the PPVT-R and the PIAT, tests designed for high school students, proved difficult for some subjects may raise other issues of concern to educators and researchers alike. (NRB)",

One-half of the women attended an educational intervention program including films, lectures, and discussions on alcoholism. The other half, the control group, did not. Arrival interviews as well as 6- and 12-month follow-ups will be conducted to assess the frequency of verbal aggression, physical violence, social support, and alcohol  dependence. In the second study, participants (N=6) included a battered coalcoholic woman, her battering husband, and four members of the couple's support group. Four therapy sessions prepared the woman to confront her alcoholic husband in the fifth session.

A sample of adults from three different geographical areas of Kentucky was assembled and 71.5 percent of the adults months for a total of five interviews. A life event scale testing 54 life events common in older adults was administered. Researchers determined if subjects had attachment bereavement (loss by death of spouse, parent, or child), nonattachment bereavement (loss by death of sibling, grandchild, or friend), and other losses (loss of a house or job). Depression and pre-event variables were measured. The results  suggested that bereavement and other losses do independently affect depression when measured within 6 months of the loss. Pre-event differences need to be considered if an accurate estimate of effects of events on depression is to be made. Physical health was the strongest predictor of depression. This approach to the study of bereavement makes it possible to measure the effects of or number of variables prior to the bereavement event. (ABL)",

        "description":"This document examines three important national surveys that provide periodic longitudinal data on the transition to adulthood during the late 1960s and 1970s: (1) the Parnes Young Men and Women Panels, initiated in 1966 and 1968; (2) the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, initiated in 1968; and (3) the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. Section I of this paper provides an introduction to the three datasets and describes two projects in the Rand Corporation Labor and Population Program which build on the complementarities of these datasets. Section II outlines the special characteristics of each survey that affect the construction of appropriate cohorts for comparison and compares them on such background characteristics as age at survey, race and parental  education. Section III presents the constructions of the four measures of life-cycle progress: first marriage, leaving the parental home, school enrollment, and military service. Section IV shows how the four measures compare across surveys. Section V discusses the results and their implications for the complementary use of these datasets and for the prospective collection of information on life-cycle transitions. Background tables are appended and references are given. (NRB)",

Results of data analysis are presented which indicate that: (1) no evidence of consistent leniency towards young adult offenders was found; (2) both juveniles and young adults with extensive records were sentenced more severely than those with lighter records; (3) the availability of prior records  did not guarantee such records would have an effect; (4) consideration of juvenile records only at sentencing may provide adequate discrimination between chronic and occasional offenders; and (5) juvenile arrest charges not resulting in a finding of delinquency are often used to represent the defendant's criminality.

In opening remarks, Congressmen Roybal and Pepper question this ruling, citing productivity of older workers and the lack of data to support any specific age for mandatory retirement. Congressman Rinaldo's remarks support the rule on the grounds that aircraft accidents are often associated with diseases common with aging. Testimonies are included from: (1) General Chuck Yeager who speaks against the age 60 rule, arguing that medical examinations and flight simulators will reveal any deficiencies disqualifying a pilot from flying; (2) T. Franklin Williams, of the National Institute of Aging who discusses recent  research showing that functioning may be maintained until age 80 or later; (3) Jefferson Koonce, a professor of human factors engineering who opposes the age 60 rule, instead recommending assessment of pilot proficiency using available methods; (4) Samuel Fox, III, a cardiologist, who explains that a person's risk of heart disease can be quantified and could be used in pilot assessment; (5) Leroy Shaver, a former pilot who describes his forced retirement and disagreement with the age 60 rule; and (8) Anthony Broderick, a Federal Aviation Administrator who outlines the age 60 rule and its rationale.

        "description":"Although many students and teachers may believe otherwise, answer changing can be helpful in test taking. This study examined the effects of having a teacher lecture on answer changing as a beneficial test strategy. Participants (N=470) were college students randomly assigned to intervention or nonintervention treatments. In the intervention treatment, students heard a lecture on effective study techniques which included a discussion on the answer changing myth and detailed strategies under which answer changing was advisable. The non-intervention control group received no discussion of the answer changing myth. Two tests were reviewed for answer changes by observing erasures and crossouts. No significant differences were found between the two groups. A reason for this could be  that although students believe it is not a good idea to change answers, they do so anyway. It is also possible that only an individualized intervention might have an effect. Since answer changing had less than a one percent net gain for students in this study, performance enhancing resources might be better spent in other ways. (ABL)",

        "description":"This document argues that packaged guidance curriculum activities are intended for general populations and often fail to address the needs of certain communities or to be responsive to specific events. A process is then presented which enables counselors to design their own activities. The process described is based on an experiential learning model with five steps: (1) experiencing; (2) publishing; (3) processing;(4) generalizing; and (5) application, to which the step of development of objectives is added. It is recommended that objectives be specific and appropriate, with no more than two objectives for each 20 to 40 minute activity. An effective experience phase is suggested to generate information relevant to the exercise by incorporating role-playing, reflection,  problem-solving, games, artwork, or films. The publishing phase is presented as an attempt to surface reactions to the experience phase, usually by asking questions related to the objectives. In the processing phase the counselor is instructed to summarize responses, make note of them, and encourage students to draw their own conclusions. A discussion of the generalizing phase focuses on the need to present concepts that will help students to organize and understand their experiences. The final phase, the application phase, involves student practice of the skills and knowledge they have learned from the guidance activity. The paper concludes that guidance activities developed to meet specific needs are more likely to meet those needs than are generalized packaged activities.  (ABL)",

Hypotheses attempting to explain this age-related difference in a perceptual-cognitive task have included orthogenic principle, response-competition, and cautiousness. This study examines whether there are any significant performance differences on the Stroop test by cautious or &quot;risky&quot; older adults. Participants (N=41) were older adults ranging in age from 55 to 81. All participants were administered the Stroop Test and the Hand Test. In the Stroop Test subjects responded to stimuli by naming a color or color word as fast as possible. Participants were categorized as cautious or risky on the basis of the Hand Test. Analysis did not show slower response time  for cautious adults. Data suggested that cautiousness increased with age and was manifested more in terms of fewer errors of commission per unit of time than in speed of response. These findings suggest that risky adults may encode stimulus information repeatedly before retrieving a response and that cautious adults might be slower in encoding information but have a higher probability of retrieving a correct response.

        "description":"The relationship between opinions toward arms control and certain related beliefs was examined in two studies involving interventions designed to change those beliefs. In study 1, 131 college students who attended a \"Psychology of the Nuclear Arms Race\" lecture and 98 students who did not attend the lecture completed a 20-item questionnaire assessing arms control opinions and related beliefs. Study 2 used pre- and post-testing with the questionnaire to compare attitudes of 42 students who attended the lecture, 74 students who did not attend, and 18 students who took a \"Psychology of the Nuclear Arms Race\" 25-hour course. The results of the two studies revealed that students' opinions about arms control were related to their beliefs about: (1) the importance of nuclear weapon  superiority; (2) Soviet arms control intentions; (3) the probability of nuclear war; and (4) the consequences of nuclear war. The students exposed to the interventions reported being more favorable toward arms control than did the control students. The findings suggest that students' opinions about arms control are affected by the number of beliefs held by them that are consistent with arms control, and that lectures and courses which address these beliefs from a psychological perspective have the potential to change students' opinions about arms control. Whether these conclusions can be generalized to other teachers, forums, and audiences deserves further study. (NRB)",

The relationship of social network variables to child adjustment in one-parent families was examined in 119 6- to 10-year-old eldest children who were living with their separated or divorced custodial mothers. Mothers rated their children on the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist, and provided information about the child's quality and frequency of contact with various members of his or her social network. Children (N=94) rated themselves on the Child Depression Inventory. Multiple regression analyses  were conducted using one criterion variable (a measure of psychopathology of the child) and ten predictor variables (time since parents' separation; child's age; and both the quality and quantity of the child's contact with peers, other adults, the custodial mother, and the non-custodial father) for each analysis. The results revealed that only the network quality measures were significant predictors of child adjustment. Sex differences were also found, with boys' interactions with peers and the custodial mother more salient, while interactions with the non-custodial father and other adults were more salient for girls.

        "description":"Reading research can answer the question of how to teach vocabulary to increase reading comprehension. Literature reviews show that almost any type of vocabulary instruction can produce significant gains in word knowledge, but that since more than this superficial knowledge is necessary to make a difference in reading comprehension, much vocabulary instruction fails. The definitional approach teaches labels rather than concepts, while the context approach is ineffective when taught as a discrete skill. Although combining these two teaching methods is effective, several new instructional techniques are still more \"powerful.\" The characteristics of powerful techniques are integration, or establishment of connections or relationships between instructed words and other words and  concepts; repetition, or repeated encounters with new words; and using word meanings to make inferences. Producing the largest vocabulary gains with limited instruction time also requires efficient as well as powerful instruction. Research suggests that most people learn vocabulary incidentally, from context, hence the following paradox: the most powerful method of vocabulary instruction is quite inefficient and the least powerful method is quite efficient. This leads to five recommendations for vocabulary instruction: (1) intensive instruction should be used for a relatively small number of carefully selected words, (2) powerful vocabulary instruction can be applied with intermediate levels of intensity to a large number of words, (3) the classroom atmosphere should be saturated with new  and interesting words, (4) students should increase the time actually spent reading, and (5) students should be given instruction that will help them become more effective independent word learners.

        "description":"Because of the difference between narrative and expository material, students in grades 4-12 require different reading skills, as well as different levels of skills to comprehend subject matter reading. This means the content area teacher has two roles: subject matter specialist and instructional leader. The following model suggests a process by which instructional strategies for teaching content area material are determined by the content itself. First, the teacher lists instructional objectives in sequence according to their importance. Factors by which objectives are determined include the material to be read, the background of the students, and the resources available. Next, the teacher determines the levels of intellectual involvement dictated by the objectives, that is, the  reading/thinking skills required to comprehend the material. Last, the teacher considers the methodology appropriate to teach the content at the requisite thinking levels. Choosing instructional strategies independently of determining objectives often leads to instruction only at the literal level. Use of the model in which the content determines the instructional process provides for more efficient and effective planning and implementing of instruction. (LLZ)",

The first two sections of the paper provide a rationale for the use of collaborative team instruction based on Feuerstein's model of cognitive modifiability through systematic and consistent mediation and a summary of the program development. The third section discusses the course, including the goals, objectives (increase students' awareness of their own learning strategies), ideas to be stressed (use of precise terminology), and examples of suggested activities. The fourth section analyzes the dynamic assessment techniques (pre and post) upon which the mediated  instruction is based and by which students' growth is measured. Rationales are presented for the uses of various instruments and techniques to measure progress at the stages of data gathering, data elaboration (classification, comparison, summarization), and data communication. The other sections discuss the checklist of student behavioral changes, the interrelationship of ICCR with General Education Courses, and the reflective observations of the course's beneficial effects on both teachers and students. Concluding remarks articulate the reasons for a commitment to mediated cognitive instruction. Appendixes include sample syllabi and further information regarding Feuerstein's model. (LLZ)",

The subjects, 40 fourth and fifth grade students with low reading skills, participated in a training program that included instruction and practice in identifying the important ideas in a reading passage. One group received ability feedback (positive comments on student performance), a second group received effort feedback  (positive comments on student efforts), a third group was given ability feedback during the first half of the program and effort feedback during the second half, and this sequence was reversed for a fourth group. Results showed that children who received ability feedback during the second half of the program developed higher ability attributions and self-efficacy than did children in the other conditions. The sequence of extended attributional feedback did not differentially affect skill development. (FL)",

        "description":"The focus of this paper is on some of the difficulties students experience in learning from texts and in solving other types of academic problems, because of their failure to distinguish between skills needed for everyday thinking and those needed for academic thinking. The paper discusses the types of processing problems children experience when asked to read, suggests that some students have pervasive problems with academic learning because their thinking has all the strengths and biases of everyday thinking, and argues that certain characteristics of everyday thinking are particularly ill-matched with the demands of formal science education. It also discusses interventions for introducing more effective learning and teaching strategies in the general realm of reading  comprehension, such as using reciprocal teaching. Finally, the paper speculates on possible extensions of these intervention procedures in fostering problem solving in science and math. (EL)",

        "description":"An examination of how new knowledge is acquired reveals that knowledge is organized in global conceptual constructs called schemata, and that the process of knowledge acquisition can be conceptualized as the articulation and restructuring of these schemata. Assuming that a schema is a generative structure with implications beyond what is immediately known, the working out of these implications is schema articulation. Schema restructuring is the kind of learning that involves fundamental changes in the nature of the schema itself. The domain of observational astronomy (i.e., the knowledge about the sun, moon, and stars in relation to the earth) would be an appropriate domain to test these ideas. When the purpose of instruction is to promote schema articulation, it is important to  build instruction around the child's already existing schema. When the purpose of instruction is to promote knowledge restructuring, it is important to foster recognition of the anamolies in the existing schema and to use explanatory analogies and/or physical models to bring relevant knowledge from a different domain to help schema restructuring.

Chapter two presents the service quality model, with its five features, used to focus the research, while chapter three describes the two school districts and their major classification systems, including assignments to mainstream reading programs and special programs. The next three chapters define the three interlinked activities that shape reading-related student  classification: (1) establishing the structure for providing services, (2) assessing and placing children, and (3) coordinating and providing instruction. Chapter seven discusses the critical preferred practices that facilitate appropriate classification, including establishing budget priorities, and chapter eight summarizes some key implications to be drawn from this study (such as the need to define standards), comments on selected public policy issues (such as the systemic roots of service quality problems), and proposes a strategy for reform focused on reading.

Following that, the paper discusses the transformations that revisions can have on the text world, and concludes by emphasizing the interactive relationship among three components of revision (meanings are evaluated, appropriate responses are examined and selected, and the text is transformed), pointing  out that throughout the entire process of generating meaning, the reader or writer must consider the potential for revision from these various perspectives.

Subjects--students from either the high SAT (approximate average of 1200 points) population (HS), or the low SAT (approximate average of 800 points) population (LS)--were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups that studied (1) cartoons with humorous captions, (2) cartoons with nonhumorous captions, (3) the humorous captions alone, or (4) the nonhumorous captions alone. Results indicated that humor has little or no noticeable effect, or a negative effect, on free recall for both the HS and the LS college populations. The LS participants rated the  material as more humorous than did the HS population, but recalled less. Recall was lowest for the HS group that read humorous captions without pictures. For the LS group, recall was best when the nonhumorous captions were presented with pictures. Pictures relevant to the accompanying text, containing highly coherent messages, encourage superior recall for both groups. However, implications are that humor and pictures are additional stimuli competing for attention from the LS population. (Tables of findings are included.) (EL)",

Half of the questions were textually explicit and half textually implicit.

Results showed no difference between groups on total recall, but the prequestion groups did better on the cued information than did the control group. The control group did better on the non-cued information, however.

        "description":"The acquisition of visual information, which occurs during eye fixations, involves two processes: registration (visual information becoming available to the brain) and utilization (visual information being used to further text comprehension). Registration occurs at the beginning of a fixation, while at least four possible patterns describe the points at which utilization occurs. It may occur: (1) immediately following registration; (2) from different regions at different times; (3) frequently throughout the fixation--continuous utilization; and (4) at a delimited point in time. In order to test these hypotheses, a series of experiments, all using a variation of the same methodology, was conducted. The results indicate that the fourth pattern--utilization occurring at a delimited  point in time--best describes what occurs most typically during reading. Furthermore, the results present two possible versions of this hypothesis: that utilization takes place at the end of a fixation or after a fixation is terminated, and that the time of utilization varies--early or late in the fixation--influenced possibly by the needs of other on-going language processes. Further research is needed to examine these possibilities. (LLZ)",

The paper then applies the theory to specific materials about the nature of lenses, showing through a detailed presentation of inquiry dialogue how a teacher can pose  problems (or cases) to students in a systematic manner to force them to construct and test a theory of domain.

Subjects, 31 eighth grade remedial reading students from a suburban junior high school, were divided into two groups: a treatment group that received semantic impressions as a prereading activity, and a control group. The semantic impressions--words extracted directly from a story--provided clues to the setting, characters, and major elements of the plot. A maximum of three words was used for each impression. The 19 clues were arranged vertically and marked with arrows to indicate clue order. After fifteen minutes of demonstration and instruction, students were given the impression and asked to link the clues  together in the same manner and to generate a hypothesis story of their own. The next day, the students read their stories before being given a copy of the short story to read. After reading it, students from both groups were tested on it. Results indicated that students receiving the semantic impressions as a prereading treatment correctly answered a higher percentage (72%) of the comprehension questions than students who simply read the story (60%).

        "description":"Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 68 first graders to identify what ideas young readers hold about the reading process. Specifically, the study questioned whether good and poor readers held the same views about how they learned to read, what they and others did as they read, their reading ability, and why people read. The responses of the highest and lowest readers to the interview questions were compared and reported in tabular form. Results showed that, in general, there was more similarity among the high achieving readers' responses than among the responses of the low achievers, and there was some overlapping between the responses of the two groups. Both high and low achievers viewed the reading process as the saying of words. The children differed somewhat,  however, in the strategies they would use to say the word. More than one-half of each group said they would sound out the word, and almost a third of the high achievers said that was the only strategy they would use. Nearly one-half of the low achievers credited their mother as the one who taught them to read, while nearly 62% of the high achievers credited their teacher. Finally, almost as many low achieving as high achieving readers said they were good readers. The appendix contains responses to the interview's 13 questions, which were adapted from the Burke Reading Inventory. (HOD)",

Prior to the videotaping, teachers were told to ask the students to engage in a discussion of the reading materials that were assigned the day before. Results showed a relationship between the type of interaction pattern observed (discussion versus recitation) and the particular content area in which the observations were made. By comparison, the teachers of social studies and literature encouraged more recitation-like interactions than  did their colleagues who taught science and health/human development. The science and health/human development teachers--more than the social studies and literature teachers--expected students to participate in whole class discussion as a follow-up to the reading assignments. Data suggested that the teachers communicated certain procedural display models from which students were able to pick up cues as to their expected participation in a whole class discussion. Further studies should deal with students' perceptions of such practices. (HOD)",

The model proposed in this chapter synthesizes recent research around three interactive elements, which make up the second through fourth chapters: (1) content thinking, which includes declarative, procedural, and contextual knowledge, and the integration of these elements; (2) reasoning, which consists of transferring content (that is, storage and retrieval of declarative, procedural, and contextural knowledge), matching these elements with what is already known, and restructuring or  producing new knowledge; and (3) learning to learn, which describes attending (paying attention), setting goals, monitoring attitudes, and self-evaluating the thinking processes. The document concludes with a discussion of a few restructuring issues considered necessary for the systematic teaching of thinking skills; specifically, how each of the three thinking skill areas necessitates fundamental changes in schools, testing, evaluation, and the integration of instruction.

The paper notes that the biggest impact of computers may be in terms of the ways they contribute to the social organization of the classroom. The second paper, &quot;Whose Computer Is Is Anyway?&quot; by Sarah Michaels and Courtney Cazden, questions whether the use of computers in education will mitigate, maintain, or even increase existing inequalities, and points out that boys and students in wealthier school districts, for example, have more opportunities to work with computers and that there may also be socioeconomic status (SES)  related differences in the kinds of instruction that students receive through computers.

Word properties investigated included length, morphological complexity, part of speech, conceptual difficulty, and the strength of contextual support for each word. Text properties included readability as measured by standard formulas, and several measures of density of difficult words. Results showed that, among the word properties, only conceptual difficulty was significantly related to learning from context.

The paper defines the process of discovery and describes Kimberling's four stylistic devices to create a form reproducing this activity of discovery: (1) first-person references to the teacher/writer's experience in the classroom and second-person references to the audience (other teachers); (2) language and syntax depicting the excitement of learning; (3) idealized dialogue (\"language somewhere between the way students usually talk and the actual  language of mathematics,\") and (4) insertion of bits of mathematics history into the discussion to establish continuity between present and past discoveries. The paper then discusses the use of the articles to stimulate students' writing about the process of one of their own discoveries and mentions some of the varied topics on which students have written.

After four years, a team of seven faculty members from rhetoric and composition, literature, psychology, and linguistics--with the help of faculty from several other fields--designed a research and evaluation program to determine the success of the writing across the curriculum project. The evaluation proved that many students and instructors came to view writing as a complex and central activity, integral to learning and understanding in all disciplines. A total of 20 individual studies was conducted for the evaluation, including the  following: (1) two studies of student laboratory reports, in biology and engineering, which showed the success of the faculty workshops; (2) a writing assessment of engineering students, which showed that the evaluation design had not been integrated to program goals as well as it might have been, and that the program itself was not quite as effective with engineering students as the faculty had hoped; and (3) two studies of student journals in mathematics and civil engineering, which showed that speculative writing plays an important role in student learning in content area courses. Among other things learned by this evaluation was the value of the multiple measures approach. (HTH)",

The functions of graduate study in English are to prepare (1) teachers of English, (2) scholars who can advance critical theory and the understanding of language and the writing process, and (3) the next generation of literary critics. In recent years, however, the supply of advanced degree graduates has exceeded demand, leading to the question of whether the number of institutions allowed to offer graduate study in English should be limited. Obviously, it is time to rethink what graduate education in English can and should be. For example, graduate programs could be designed to prepare students for careers such as  creative writers, to give students general pleasure in gaining the knowledge, or to provide students who spent their undergraduate years in accounting, engineering, or other overspecialized fields with a less specialized graduate program. Graduate study in English must escape elitism and turn back toward the real world if it is to be of any value. (HOD)",

First used in 1710, the concept of authorship is a relatively recent invention. To understand how constructed the concept is--not commonsensical or inevitable but a complex reflection of contemporary culture--requires a look at the Middle Ages, its reverance for authority, reliance on scriptoria for copies of manuscripts, and the development of such rhetorical arts as manuals for letter writing. There is, however, no full history in English that focuses explicitly on the development of the concept of authorship. The concept emerged as the result of a number of related influences--technical, philosophical, political, sociocultural, legal,  economic, and literary. Most important to understanding the concept is recognition that authorship, especially humanistic or literary, has been almost exclusively limited to individuals writing alone. Also, the concept does not apply equally to different kinds of discourse. Tacit acceptance of this concept is reflected not only in the assignments given by composition teachers--with emphasis on individual rather than group invention and concern with plagiarism--but also in methods used for testing and in research. Composition teachers and researchers need to be more aware of the complexity and power of the concept of authorship. (HTH)",

Literature to which students could relate more easily, such as &quot;Farewell to Manzanar&quot; and &quot;No No Boy,&quot; was selected for the class, and students kept a reader's and writer's journal in which they responded to questions about the literature. Alan Purves's four stages of response to literature--engagement, perception, interpretation, and evaluation--were used as a framework for the progression of journal and discussion questions and for assigned unedited journal pieces later expanded into essays. In spite of the  interactional reading and writing and the attempt to enlarge perspectives, many of the students continue to respond to only a portion of the text. Nevertheless, basic writing students in particular need to assimilate their own experiences and values so that they feel that their opinions have worth, and the academic community has a responsibility to assist those students in achieving that goal.

        "description":"Practicum courses in theatre arts, which function as laboratories where students can practice theatre and receive academic credit for their efforts, greatly benefit students. Because the main goal of such practicums is cooperative achievement of the best production possible and since every step of a production involves a new problem or decision, the practicum course appears to provide an ideal model for life training as well as for artistic training. An experiential model created by Kolb, Chickering, and others tries to capture both the cognitive and the socioemotional factors that go into knowledge acquisition and application. The practicum theatre activities support this model by focusing on having experiences or taking actions, observing and reflecting on these experiences in  order to generalize from them, and re-using the generalizations to solve new or similar problems. The direct experience that theatre practicums provide, therefore, assures strong student motivation because it teaches socialization skills and creative problem solving by offering students the experience of producing art and of plying their craft before an audience.

Further analysis indicates that the culture of black Americans has fostered the development of a number of characteristics that would help them to function in corporate cultures that are populated primarily by white Americans. Distinct cultural differences appear in the areas of values, language behaviors, nonverbal behaviors, and assumptions about relationships to the world. In examining each of those four categories, it becomes apparent that although ethnic differences provide group members with different ways of coping with the world, the general goals of survival and advancement are found in each cultural group. Further research is needed in order to explore  the adaptability of black cultural skills to corporate settings. (DF)",

The paper discusses the comprehensive examination of the specific objectives and methods, relevant background information on the University of Wisconsin (Parkside), and the conditions that helped to stimulate the program development. It then describes the philosophy of the new program and points out its uniqueness in focusing on the development of literacy. Tables of both the old and the new courses and their requirements provide for a comparison of the two programs. The  paper also discusses the two central concerns guiding the program evaluation and redesign, and contains a list of objectives, followed by a description of the requirements for the program with an emphasis on the courses that are most unique, including innovative core courses, a course designed to expose students to communication professionals and their work, and a unique \"preprofessional\" student-run organization.

Part 2 explores whether the model is compatible to acting theory by matching it to three established theorists (Grotowski, Stanislavski, and Brecht), and suggests that because it is compatible with their theories and useful in understanding their differences, it gains credibility. Part 3 assesses the model's usefulness in  dealing with actors, particularly in teaching, by looking at the very different approaches of two important teachers of acting (Viola Spolin and Kristen Linklater), and illustrates how the model is useful for understanding both teachers and illuminating their differences. Part 4, the summary, suggests directions to take and questions to explore. Notes and a bibliography are appended. (EL)",

This limitation has applied to measures of communication-bound anxiety that have generally been developed as unidimensional instruments. A study explored whether a measurement approach based on individual and situational differences would yield significantly better cross-situational predictions of communication apprehension than would current measurement approaches. In the first phase of the study, an individual difference measure and a situational difference measure were developed and tested with 71 college students. In the second phase, the two instruments were compared with current instruments to determine how well each could predict the same  cross-situational behaviors. All instruments were administered to the same group of students. Results showed that the new instruments predited as well as or better than any of the current instruments across a number of situations, with cross-situational predictions of behavior improving from an average of 5.9% for the current measures to 50.4% of the new ones.

Two hundred volunteers enrolled in a required public-speaking course (1) responded to several demographic questions, (2) described the persuasive choices they would make in the scenario provided, and (3) completed a self-monitoring measure of selection of argument strategies. In investigating the subjects' reasons for refusing to use a number of previously identified compliance gaining strategies, the study concluded that about 25% of the refusals were justified because the strategy simply would not work. Fifteen percent of refusals were made because respondents felt the strategies were negative or objectionable. Twenty-five  percent of the rejections were due to person-centered concerns such as self-image or another's welfare. Finally, over one third of the strategies were rejected on the basis of being false or irrelevant. The results suggest that strategies should provide options to function in a given situation.

Community members are more supportive of schools that they feel they understand, and the significant role parents play in their children's education can only be affected by the schools if effective communication exists. Four methods of communication are especially useful with groups of parents: newsletters, open houses, handbooks, and parent organizations. Communicating with parents individually may involve parent-teacher conferences, home visits, interviews, and phone calls or letters. Efforts to inform parents should be continued through their children's secondary school years because parental interest remains high even though their active participation is often  reduced. Effective use of the kinds of communication covered here can serve as a starting point for broader school-community relations efforts. These efforts include soliciting citizen involvement as volunteers in the schools and developing partnerships with community businesses. Resource materials providing useful information on various aspects of school-community relations are cited throughout this publication. (PGD)",

The study found several significant achievements and changes, but also found that inadequate funding and prejudicial attitudes are combining to prevent efforts to provide equal opportunity from being as effective as possible. A supplement to the National Board of Inquiry's report on this study, this publication discusses the problems facing reformers in Illinois as revealed in the Illinois hearings conducted as part of the larger study. The problems fall into four categories: discrimination and differential treatment, threats to an effective mainstream  learning program, inadequate responses to special needs, and barriers to public involvement. The material presented consists primarily of key information provided by hearing witnesses. The hearings revealed that the problems are spread throughout the state. Considering the present interest in major educational reform, it seems critical to address these issues along with the more popular issues of educational quality. Seven hard questions, dealing with issues like discrimination, mainstreaming, dropouts, and involvement of parents, that should be asked when assessing recommendations for reform conclude the document.

        "description":"Joint action among teachers appears to depend on the teachers' perceptions of their interdependence and the presence of opportunities for joint action. An urban middle school had been organized into teams on several levels with strong support from the principal. Three situations that altered these operating procedures provided evidence that teachers are more likely to cooperate to solve their problems when they feel their problems are shared and when barriers to common action are reduced. The three situations involved an influx of student teachers, turnover among members of established teams, and the appointment of a new school principal less committed to the team approach. The study suggested that three kinds of joint action can be identified: coordinated activity, conducted  individually but similarly; accommodating activity, involving individual adjustments in response to others' needs; and cooperative activity, the mutual, face-to-face interaction of teachers to achieve a joint goal. This report concludes by suggesting that a larger study focusing on the conditions and factors affecting joint action rather than on visible evidence of teaming seems called for. (PGD)",

Information was gathered from each school through observations, interviews, documentary material, and discussions with district personnel. On the basis of these data, a description of each school's resource allocation process was developed, and the feasible alternative approaches that administrators took in each component of the resource allocation process were identified and compiled into a three-part overall description of the process, covering  acquisition, distribution, and management of resources, respectively. Quantitative analyses were also conducted to examine and compare the choices and results for each school. Numerous figures and data tables are contained in the text, and four appendixes provide comparisons of data from each individual school with the four-school average. (TE)",

The data source was grade and absence reports collected over a period of nearly two years. Approximately 50 administrators, over 500 teachers, and 10,000 students contributed data to the project. The analysis goal was to examine differences in the teachers' overall class absence rates as they related to differences in the classes taught, the teaching practices used, and the teachers' personal characteristics. Other variables that might have contributed to the absence rating were also considered. Among these were student ability level, class size, total number of students taught, grades received by students, and time of day. Also the differences  between the responses from the low-absence and high-absence groups were measured for the various items on a student attendance questionaire administered to all teachers in the study. Evidence derived from the data demonstrates that teachers are distinguishable with respect to their students' absences and that the subject and students taught are two factors that help determine the student absence rate. More study of classroom factors is needed to provide information for use in reducing absenteeism. (GJ)",

Percent increase in value during the 2 years was calculated for each house and an average increase in assessed value was derived for each block. Although differences were found between assessed value increase for group home blocks, none of the differences was statistically significant. Overall findings confirmed earlier studies showing that changes in property values are not related to the presence of a group home in the block.

Following a brief review of HCEEP'S mission and history, the State Grants Program and its three types of grants are described: planning, development, and implementation grants. Distinctions between the State Grant Program and an earlier program, the State Implementation Grant, are offered. Noted is the emphasis on collaboration between outreach activities and state-level agencies and programs, and collaboration is seen to take three forms: activities that support outreach goals, activities that support state goals, and activities to support early intervention. Suggestions are made for planning future  collaboration. (CL)",

The first volume introduces the naturalistic model of inquiry, noting its philosophical underpinnings and basic characteristics. Operational Procedures in carrying out the field study research are addressed, including design update, site selection, data analysis, draft reviews, and steps to assume trustworthiness of the data (including its credibility, transferability, and dependability). Results of the field study are examined in terms of organizational/governance issues, service and delivery mechanism issues, effectiveness and impact issues. Among  conclusions and policy recommendations offered is the need to clarify and simplify P.L. 94-142; provide more resources, proportionately, to rural areas; fully fund mandated programs; and stimulate formulas. A series of trade-offs in the policy decision process are also considered. Volumes II and III of the report present the detailed case studies of five rural districts and their responses to implementing P.L. 94-142. Volume IV contains four commissioned papers with the following titles and authors: &quot;Special Education in Rural America&quot; (P. Worth); &quot;Dean's Grants Projects and Rural Education&quot; (M.

A review of research covers the use of the battery in the LD population and offers conclusions, including that LD children can be identified, but that the visual scale may be a weak one in terms of making discriminations. The paper describes a case study in which the LNNB-CR was helpful in determining whether an 11-year-old was primarily a learning disabled or a psychiatrically disordered patient. Test analysis indicated that the boy did appear to have LD, with deficits in the left parietal  area, and that his rehabilitation potential was quite good given his adequacy in understanding situations and solving tasks of abstract reasoning.

Additional variables investigated were size of school system/community (small, medium, and large) and grade level (first, third, and fifth). Following random assignments to experimental or control status, all experimental Ss were provided two 1-hour intervention sessions designed to increase student acceptance and awareness of mentally handicapped individuals. Intervention materials were selected from the Better Understanding of Disabled Youth program. Five weeks after the pretest, all Ss were again measured with the same  instrument. Initial differences were discovered for each variable under consideration. Change scores between pretest and posttest measure indicated significant differences among comparisons of all experimental variables. Control groups remained stable on all variables from pretest to posttest. Multimedia presentations in the areas of handicap awareness and group interaction were effective ways of increasing students' acceptance of mentally handicapped children in a systematic manner.

General characteristics of the referral process in one district (background, language usage, grades, current placements, IEP team participation, and group differences) are reported. A path model was developed using causal modeling techniques to examine possible factors leading to diagnoses of either learning disabilities or language impairment. Five variables in the model were found to  have a direct effect on placement category after the effect of all the other variables had been controlled: sex, language scale, psychometric team, IQ test administered, and age. Findings revealed a surprising frequency of the language impaired designation. In general, findings were replicated in a second district. (CL)",

Chapter one examines the dilemma of adequately educating students who lack an understanding of religion's influence in history. Chapter two analyzes how classroom practices are based on a series of defacto policies that encourage educators to avoid explicit reference to religion. Chapter three is an examination of the religious, historical, sociological, educational, legal, and political assumptions that undergrid present curricular policies. Chapter four explores the legal basis for teaching  about religion. Chapter five describes how public protest has hindered thoughtful treatment of religion in textbooks. Chapter six emphasizes that the proper role of religion in the school is the study of religion for its educational value and presents suggestions for proper inclusion of religion in schools. Chapter seven points out that commonly stated educational goals cannot be achieved without proper integration of religion into the curriculum. The concluding chapter contains a list of recommendations for ending public education's silence on religion. (SM)",

Maintaining social order, perceiving contemporary events accurately, and advancing science and technology require secondary school students to understand the nature, concepts, and processes of these disciplines in a social context. While educators have stressed a need to implement STS-based core curriculums, their recommendations have not become trends in curriculum development or reform, and curriculum reformers estimate that more  than 90 percent of high school graduates have reached only the lowest levels of scientific and technological literacy. Chapter one describes a curriculum framework organized into the categories of acquisition of knowledge, utilization of cognitive skills, and the development of attitudes. Chapters two to four discuss topics, concepts, issues, attitudes, and cognitive processes that can be used as integrative threads. Chapter five examines curriculum options and alternatives, such as developing interdisciplinary courses. Chapters six and seven focus on the infusion of STS content into social studies and science courses. The concluding chapters, eight and nine, describe underlying teaching concepts, cognitive process skills, and guidelines for curriculum reform. (JHP)",

        "description":"There is little agreement about how the ability to read route maps initially emerges and about how it should be stimulated by early childhood educators. This study assessed the route map reading behavior of young children and the basic skills that might contribute to that behavior. In individual videotaped sessions, 120 four, five, and six year olds, assigned to either a mimetic or itinerary map condition, used a series of four route maps (three pretraining; one experimental) to locate animals in a small-scale zoo. Each child's knowledge of basic spatial ability, symbol recognition, and metacognitive skills (thought to underlie map reading performance) was assessed during pretraining. During the experimental task, where and how often children referred back to the map for guidance  and contingent route traversal success, was measured. Three questions were asked: (1) What was the initial level of mastery of each skill? (2) What was the level of mastery after explicit instruction? and (3) What was the relationship of possession of these skills to successful map reading performance? Instruction improved the performance of all three age groups on all three map understanding measures. Results indicated that fragile map understanding and usage skills are emerging during the years from 4 to 6 and that the key to this emergence is an increasing capacity to successfully intercoordinate spatial ability, symbolization, and metacognitive skills.

The goals of the program are to: (1) encourage higher levels of thinking; (2) increase knowledge of arts terminology, style, and concepts; and (3) develop the characteristics of creative thinking, in students from kindergarten through high school. The teaching focus requires the infusion of arts-making and arts-responding activities into the humanities, science, and mathematics curricula. It also requires regular, sequential instruction in art, music, dance, and theater in a manner that supports general education goals. It emphasizes students' use of higher levels of thinking (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation) as they observe artistic events or create art objects. In addition, it stresses the acquisition of those  characteristics associated with creative thinking. Fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration are variously stressed depending upon the nature of the assignment. Central to the program is a commitment to at least one period per week of formal instruction in art and vocal music to students in elementary schools by state-certified specialists. For older students the opportunity to study with arts specialists is complemented through involvement in additional arts activities such as rehearsals for performances. Intensive staff development needs to accompany this program. (SM)",

Modern information technology disputes the idea that citizens can be properly educated to assume the burdens necessary to reap the blessing of freedom. Information technologies challenge the ability of citizens to fulfill the fundamental requirement of democracy: informed participation. In considering how to meet the challenges of information technology, the issues of information processing, contextual knowledge, and selectivity must be addressed. Each is reflected in a number of proposed remedies. Intelligent information system interfaces will serve to reduce the \"cost\" of citizen information processing by structuring the citizen's investigative work. Students must receive explicit  training in information-processing skills. For effective and efficient information retrieval and processing, citizens must possess fundamental contextual knowledge of history and government.

A long tradition of civic talk exists in western democratic civilization. The Greek teacher, Protagoras, the Father of Debate, required his students to speak first on one side of an issue or principle and then on the other. Greek youth investigated the controversies and the values of the day and learned that reason exists on both sides of an argument. For a society born in public debate and brought up on freedom of expression, educators have all but forgotten to teach communication. While most students receive 12 years of language training, little of it focuses on oral communication. Today's educators need to teach students  to speak about the issues confronting society and community values. Students should learn how to enter into a reasoned discourse knowing that their reasoning could be altered or that they may persuade someone to adopt their point of view. Educators should teach the system of inquiry and advocacy upon which the United States was built. Every citizen should have access to information and know how to acquire it. Discussing and arguing relevant issues should be part of every subject in the curriculum. Numerous resources available for teachers who wish to include speaking assignments in their classes are discussed. (SM)",

Each approach is reviewed according to: (1) the rationale of the approach; (2) the process of valuing; (3) the teaching methods used to achieve the specific purpose to the approach; (4) an instructional mode or system of procedures used by teachers to actualize the approach; (5) the roles of the student and the teacher in each approach; and (6) characteristics of the teaching and learning materials. The rationale of the values inculcation approach is to instill certain desirable and prechosen values in students. The moral development approach is used primarily to stimulate students to advance their powers of moral reasoning through a series of increasingly advanced and complex stages. The  analysis approach to values education rests on helping students develop logical thinking and using scientific inquiry procedures in solving value issues. The clarification approach is to help students clarify and actualize personal values. The action learning approach is to develop students' abilities to act directly in personal and social situations so that they might try out their personal values. The emotional-rational approach to values education attempts to help students understand and adopt a lifestyle based on care and consideration for others as well as self. (SM)",

        "description":"The term gender bias was coined by the National Judicial Education Program to Promote Equality for Women and Men in the Courts and is defined as the predisposition or tendency to think about and behave toward people primarily on the basis of their sex rather than their status, professional accomplishments, or aspirations. An effective method for documenting the extent and nature of gender bias is the task force approach. Data collection methods used in task force studies included: (1) interviews with judges; (2) analysis of statistical materials from the administrative office of the courts and other state and federal agencies; (3) review of cases on substantive law in the areas of damages, domestic violence, juvenile justice, matrimonial law, and sentencing; (4) surveys on gender  bias at state bar association regional meetings; and (5) surveys distributed to attorneys throughout the United States. Several states that carried out task force studies of gender bias have reported similar findings. Women receive unequal treatment in the areas of divorce, domestic violence, personal injury litigation, rape, and juvenile justice. Women attorneys, judges, and employees of the courts receive demeaning and unequal treatment from other attorneys and judges. All the task force studies made recommendations to sensitize court officers about the problem of gender bias and to ameliorate the effects of such bias. (SM)",

Attention is also now being directed to improvement of teacher education programs, and many of the southern states are taking measures to ensure more stringent review and approval standards for teacher education programs. Recent changes in program approval now include the use of outcome measures such as passing rates on teacher certification tests. Other changes being instituted in various states include academic teacher education program reviews by higher education agencies; the mandating of national accreditation; increased emphasis on arts and science  courses in the undergraduate program; a trend toward increasing school experiences as part of teacher education; and creation of special centers and teacher education projects at universities with teacher education programs.

Such self-observation can be an empowering experience for the teacher when the self-viewing is effectively facilitated within the perspective of the observation and feedback process. There are at least three dimensions to this process: (1) general ground rules which establish the context in which the videotape feedback process will occur; (2) identification of specific and general teaching skills which serve as a basis for observation and feedback (a content framework); and (3) a feedback structure which can serve as a guide for the facilitator (a process framework).

The development of two categories, Educology and Pedagogy, is based on four assumptions involving: (1) knowledge not being pursued in teacher education programs; (2) differences between the discipline of education and other disciplines; (3) the need to revise the programmatic scheme of teacher education; and (4)  the role of teacher educators and policymakers in pursuing knowledge to be incorporated into teacher education programs.

The plan focuses on improving teaching skills through a participatory structure involving peer coaching and trainer team building. Details of the project design are described. Discussion of the plan focuses on research findings on teaching skills and teaching models to which components of effective teaching are applied. Ways of providing training on these models are discussed with emphasis on the effectiveness of peer coaching and trainer teams. Each of these techniques is considered in the light of its impact on teachers, students  and school districts. Supplementary materials on building support teams for school improvement include a model and outline of steps in a basic practice model as well as a coaching guide and lesson design for effective teaching and a checklist for implementing an innovation.

While cooperative learning techniques vary, they all share an interest in finding an alternative to &quot;frontal teaching&quot;--the teacher instructing the whole class or individual seatwork by students. Cooperative methods allow students to work in small groups under the assumption that cooperative tasks are more likely to motivate students to learn and provide more individual help for students. Cooperative learning is also advocated for improving social relations between races, ethnic groups, high and low achievers, or for increasing productivity in problem solving. A summary is presented on studies of five major techniques for implementing cooperative learning in grades  7-12. Twenty-seven reports of high quality studies were reviewed, involving 37 comparisons of cooperative versus control methods. The effectiveness of cooperative learning is discussed along with implications for practice. Data collected in the studies are presented on 10 pages of tables and a list of 56 references is included.

It is concluded that while the overall research picture offers ample evidence of achievement gains associated with smaller class size, this relationship is complicated by mediating process variables. It is suggested that class size is but one of several factors that, in combination, affect student achievement. Efforts to reduce class size should begin with analyses of how, within a given school or subject area, the manipulation of class size might improve student-teacher interaction.

Survey studies consistently report that academic-track students are more likely to attend college and attain more schooling overall. However, no consensus exists about the effects of tracking on achievement or on student attitudes. The ethnographic literature reveals consistent track differences in students' academic experiences. High-track classes cover more complex material more quickly, exposing students to more high-status knowledge. Existing evidence does not show whether tracking  actually causes polarization of students into pro- and anti-school factions, or whether this polarization results from pre-existing differences among students. Combining the survey and ethnography findings, the balance of the evidence suggests that grouping and tracking do affect achievement, despite the inconsistencies in survey analyses.

Understanding the factors which have an impact on physical fitness could help people improve their fitness levels. This study examined 1,357 Navy men to determine the impact of a variety of behavioral, psychological, and background factors on four components of physical fitness: (1) cardiorespiratory endurance (1.5-mile run); (2) muscular endurance (sit-ups); (3) flexibility (sit-and-reach test); and (4) body composition (estimated percent body fat). Controlling for exercise  activities, physical fitness was positively associated with &quot;wellness&quot; behaviors (e.g., &quot;watch my weight,&quot;&quot;take vitamins&quot;), believing that it is important to score high on physical fitness tests or that exercise will produce valued outcomes, and being athletic as a youth. Fitness was negatively associated with age, ever being overweight, smoking, and &quot;preventive/avoidance&quot; behaviors (e.g., &quot;avoid getting chilled,&quot;&quot;have first aid kit at home&quot;). Identifying such factors may help to structure better fitness programs tailored to the individual. (Author)",

The training included specific learning keys, progressive relaxation, mental rehearsal, and goal setting. A multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of this training technique. The autoregressive integrated moving averages modeling technique (Box & Jenkins, 1976) indicated that the error terms for the data from both years of the program were not serially correlated, thus suggesting the appropriateness of a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of the ANOVA indicated that the  training program was effective in improving free throw shooting. The data also suggest that goal setting is an effective technique for maintaining performance improvement over an extended period of time. (Author)",

The major features of this design are described in &quot;A New Design for a New Era&quot; (Messick, Beaton, and Lord, 1983). The purpose of this document is to describe the actual implementation of the design in the 1983-84 National Assessment of Reading and Writing (NAEP's fifteenth year); it is intended as a supplement to the reports of that assessment (see ED 264 550, ED 273 680, ED 273 994) and supports these reports by providing detailed technical information so that the accuracy of the substantive results can be judged. Some major features of the new design were: to sample grades 4, 8, and 11 as well as students' ages 9, 13, and 17 (in  school); to introduce Balanced Incomplete Block (BIB) spiralling as a method of estimating inter-relationships among variables; to collect extensive information about teachers, principals, and schools; and to scale the reading data, if possible. These innovations were added to the previously used procedures, which were kept to ensure maintenance of NAEP trends. This report describes: (1) the data collection processes, including the assessment instruments for reading and writing; (2) the data analysis process for both reading and writing, including &quot;plausible values&quot; of reading proficiency and the NAEP reading and writing; and (3) some estimates of the reading and writing proficiencies of selected subpopulations of the sampled students. Two supplementary studies on the validity of NAEP's  reading and writing assessment instruments and the design effects in the 1983-84 sample are also presented.

        "description":"A survey addressing the fairness of the Cincinnati (Ohio) Design for School Excellence (DSE) Merit Schools program was administered to school principals in March, 1986. The questionnaire was developed by a representative committee of elementary and secondary principals and central office personnel not directly involved in the original development of the DSE. The survey was reviewed, modified, and approved by the Cincinnati Association of Administrators and Supervisors (CAAS) Executive Committee. Forty-eight principals or 60% responded. Principals were asked to rank on a four point scale their perception of fairness of the 11 DSE indicators. Results showed a need for steps to be taken to adjust and clarify the program to increase its acceptance. Particular problems and concerns  about the DSE were expressed in four major areas: (1) some schools have more advantages; (2) merit variables based on attitude surveys have limited validity; (3) attendance problems do not affect schools equally; and (4) student mobility and entry level aptitude affect schools unevenly. Since the DSE was strongly supported by the Board of Education and top central administrators, CAAS made 10 recommendations for improvement; their status is summarized.

        "description":"While neuropsychology relates the neural structures damaged in traumatic brain injury with their cognitive functions in daily life, this report reviews evidence that elementary operations of cognition as defined by cognitive studies are the level at which the brain localizes its computations. Orienting of visual attention is used as a model task. The component facilitations and inhibitions in visual orienting are related to neural systems through the study of focal neurological lesions. Visual orienting is a part of a more general selective attention system that also involves orienting to language. Ability to be aware of and to act upon target events depends upon the connections of posterior orienting systems to anterior systems involved in target detection. These pathways have  been examined in studies of focal changes in cerebral blood flow during performance of language tasks. Although there is not available a general analysis of the mental operations performed by these anterior systems, there is some evidence relating the dorsolateral prefrontal and areas of the medial surface to aspects of focal selection. To study the generality of the attentional system developed in this report, the putative deficits of attention in disorders such as schizophrenia are examined. (Author/MDE)",

        "description":"The number of students retained in grade in the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) has increased dramatically since new promotion policies were instituted in 1981 and Texas House Bill (HB) 72 was passed. Elementary school promotion is now tied to mastery of essential skills; secondary students must meet attendance requirements, as well as maintain an average of 70 in all courses and a minimum of 70 in certain required courses. In AISD in 1986-87, 4,118 students are repeating part or all of a grade, especially in grades one, seven, and nine. AISD spends approximately $3,500 per student to provide an extra full year of instruction. Research shows that retention has not helped most elementary students overcome their deficit in learning in the long run. It appears best  to provide alternative instruction without retaining most low achievers. Special programs such as summer school, transitional classes, Transitional Academic Program, and Academic Incentive Program could help to reduce the number of retainees. If retained, students also need special instruction. At the secondary level, minimizing the number of credit units repeated, providing intense remediation in basic skills, and promoting students as soon as possible may decrease the dropout rate.

Second, seventh grade TBE participants made strong gains in the reading, language, and mathematics subscales of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS). Eighth grade (TBE) students made greater than expected gains in reading and mathematics ITBS subscales. Third, all SCE-eligible, Hispanic Limited English Proficient students had access to bilingually certified classroom teachers.

The paper focuses on the feasibility of modeling performance on a three-dimensional rotation task within the context of Item Response Theory (IRT). To test the feasibility of psychometrically modeling performance on this item type, an 80-item, three-dimensional rotation test was constructed using eight basic Shepard-Metzler figures. An inexpensive computer system was also developed to administer the test and record performance, including response-time data. Data were collected on high school juniors and seniors. As expected, angular disparity was a potent determinant of item difficulty. The  applicability of IRT to these data was investigated by dichotomizing response time at several points and applying standard item parameter estimation procedures. It was concluded that an approach to psychometric modeling that explicitly incorporates information on the mental models that examiners use in solving an item is not only workable, but also essential for future developments in psychometrics.

        "description":"Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE) is a project using computer software to promote the constructive processes involved in intentional learning. CSILE enables groups of students to build a collective database (knowledge base) of their thoughts, in the form of pictures (created by students using a color graphics editor) and written notes. CSILE was initially developed for university and graduate-level students; current research focuses on 64 students in two sixth-grade classes. The report offers 11 principles applicable to a variety of educational software and then discusses the application of that principle to the project: (1) make knowledge-construction activities overt; (2) maintain attention to cognitive goals; (3) treat knowledge lacks in a positive  way; (4) provide process-relevant feedback; (5) encourage learning strategies other than rehearsal; (6) encourage multiple passes through information; (7) support varied ways for students to organize their knowledge; (8) encourage maximum use and examination of existing knowledge; (9) provide opportunities for reflectivity and individual learning styles; (10) facilitate transfer of knowledge across contexts; and (11) give students more responsibility for contributing to each other's learning. CSILE examples cover both how principles were being realized, and how novices can at times circumvent the goal of eliciting extra constructive effort. (LPG)",

        "description":"Standard procedures for estimating item parameters in Item Response Theory models make no use of auxiliary information about test items, such as their format or content, or the skills they require for solution. This paper describes a framework for exploiting this information, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of item parameter estimates and providing diagnostic information about items' operating characteristics. In the proposed model, final item parameter estimates represent a compromise between Linear Logistic Test Model estimates, where items with identical features would have identical estimates, and unrestricted maximum likelihood estimates. The principles were illustrated in a context for which a relatively simple approximation is available: empirical Bayes (EB)  estimation of Rasch item difficulty parameters. Computation proceeded in three steps: (1) unrestricted maximum likelihood estimates of item parameters; (2) point estimates of the regression parameters; and (3) final estimates of item parameters. A numerical example applied EB estimation procedures to the responses from 150 sixth graders on the Fractions subtest of the California Achievement Test. Three models, varying in their assumptions of item exchangeability, were fitted to the data. Analysis showed that auxiliary information about item features contributed as much information about item parameters as the likelihood function did. (Author/LPG)",

The emphasis is on programs that can be readily replicated by schools other than those that developed them. The focus is on programs provided to students who have been identified as in need of remedial services which are implemented outside of the regular classroom. The study found that effective pull-out programs for students fall into three broad categories: (1) diagnostic-prescriptive programs; (2) tutoring programs; and (3) computer-assisted instruction. Successful examples of each of these types are described and discussed. The most successful models completely adapt instruction to students' unique needs and provide plentiful direct instruction appropriate  to their levels of readiness. Results of the study suggest that the achievement of at-risk students can be significantly increased, either by making relatively inexpensive but extensive modifications in the regular instructional program or by implementing relatively expensive but intensive interventions as pull-out programs. It is possible that a combination of these strategies would be more effective than either one by itself. An extensive list of references is included, along with descriptions of successful programs among each of the three types. (PS)",

The full range of alternative classroom organization models designed to meet the needs of low-achieving or heterogeneous classes is explored in an attempt to discover which type of program is most effective and why. The goal of this study is to determine how the education needs of all students can be met by fundamentally restructuring the regular classroom, as opposed to adding on services outside of the regular classroom. Therefore this review focuses on the specific, comprehensive programs beneficial to the achievement of students who are at risk and that are replicable at other schools. Research demonstrates that effective classroom programs accommodate  instruction to individual needs while maximizing direct instruction, and assess student progress frequently through a structured hierarchy of skills. Two categories of programs emerged as particularly effective: continuous progress and cooperative learning. An extensive list of references is included.

The findings confirmed the negative relationship between intense work and grade point average. The results suggest that students who work do not perceive any effects of the job on their school work. Neither do they perceive any less approval from their parents, teachers and other school officials.

A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted by groups with broad school and community interests. The need to improve student achievement in basic skills was identified as the priority. The Monitoring Achievement in Pittsburgh (MAP) program was developed to address the need for a common instructional program in mathematics; and the School Improvement Program was created to provide focused educational reforms to schools with the most severe achievement problems. Achievement scores have increased since 1980. Now new initiatives are necessary to target high risk students. The new programs are the following: (1) Kids Incorporated--a rewards  program which maintains the students' enthusiasm for learning; (2) in-school tutoring which develops the students' self-concept as well as their academic skills; (3) Superstars--a rewards program which also develops self-esteem; (4) an attendance monitoring system which notifies parents of student absences; (5) individualized inservice and action plans which deal with cultural and value differences; and (6) a computer-assisted program which monitors student achievement.

        "description":"This document responds to the need for integration of basic skills into vocational education by providing a summary of research findings, implications, and practical suggestions for teachers. The six sections and four complementary posters are intended as tools for staff development of teachers engaged in teaching basic skills. Sections can also be used separately as informational handouts for individual or group instruction at a workshop and mailouts to motivate participation in professional growth activities. Each section is organized by the kinds of questions that teachers have about students' difficulties with basic skills and teachers' difficulty in addressing these problems. Sections 1-3 discuss dropouts--an assessment of the problem as it relates to basic skill  deficiencies; the impact of personal, family, and school factors on dropout-prone youth; and what happens to dropouts. Section 4 clarifies the business and industry perspective on the importance of a work force competent in basic skills. Section 5 summarizes basic skill problems prevalent among special populations. Section 6 summarizes the implications of both learning and teaching styles for basic skills acquisition. Appendixes provide information on guides and modules that provide assistance to administrators, counselors, and teachers as they promote a joint effort to strengthen basic skills. (YLB)",

Materials are provided for conducting three different campaigns. The first two sets of materials offer two approaches to promoting and publicizing a literacy program. The first approach is geared toward enhancing community awareness of the program's role in tackling the literacy problem, whereas the second is geared toward informing local employers of the illiteracy problem, how it affects them, and how  the literacy program can help. Two publicity campaigns for promoting an entrepreneurship education program are provided. The first centers around the concept \"mind your own business by owning your own business,\" and the second is based on the concept \"own your own business, own your own future.\" The third group of materials offers to approaches to enhancing institutional awareness of a program. One promotes program services to employers, and the other recruits clients. Copy for a public service announcement and black-line masters for a poster, fliers, stationary, a large ad, descending sizes of slogans for various promotional materials and items, bumper stickers, bus and taxi cards, ads, and pads and tear-off cards are provided for each of the six approaches.

This volume and two other monographs are intended to enable counselors and instructors to establish and conduct special services to meet the learning and career needs of adult populations. The publication prepares counselors to provide intake, assessment, employability skill development, and career guidance to multicultural, handicapped, and older adults, as well as dislocated workers and women reentering the work force. The eight chapters present a succinct, practical, action-oriented synthesis of research and development material that addresses the issue of  providing special services to various populations of adult learners. Topics are implementing adult intake and assessment, providing employability skills for adults, providing career guidance for multicultural adults, providing career guidance for older adults, providing support services for handicapped adult learners, planning dislocated worker programs, providing vocational counseling for the dislocated farmer, and providing vocational counseling for the displaced homemaker and reentry woman. Each chapter shows how the basic theories and strategies may be adapted to respond to the particular needs of the adult population. (YLB)",

This volume and two other monographs are intended to enable counselors and instructors to establish and conduct special services to meet the learning and career needs of adult populations. This publication provides the literacy enhancement program planner with the demographic information, program development considerations, and remediation strategies needed to implement a successful program. Part I discusses the characteristics of illiterate speakers of English. An examination of employers' literacy competency needs results in a checklist of literacy  competencies required for entry-level employment and for career advancement. Guidelines for assessing the basic skills of literacy program clients are presented along with criteria for selecting instructional materials most appropriate to the needs of the program's clients. Two models for the development of a literacy enhancement program are outlined. Part II considers planning and implementing programs of literacy instruction for nonnative speakers of English in a vocational context. Brief descriptions of various types of English-as-a-second-language (ESL) programs and a model for vocational ESL delivery are given. Part II then presents an overview of the latest and most successful strategies being used in vocational education. (YLB)",

A Self-Change, Adaption, and Modification (SCAM) Model is developed. The literature support for the model is written in similar fashion to Todd-Mancillas and Kibler's (1975) change model from which the SCAM Model is derived. Instead of presenting the literature review in standard essay format, it is presented in logical, sequential segments, each supporting one of the SCAM training steps. The literature support for SCAM training steps follows this format: name of element, purpose of the element, and a list of literature support citations for that step. The steps are  problem identification, behavioral assessment, analysis of behavioral discrepancy, steps to ideal status (action planning), measurement of results, recommendations for change, and post assessment. The final section recommends improvement of the trainee-oriented training program literature by upgrading the quality of research undertaken and published and providing more detailed explanations of how to implement SCAM programs.

Specifically addressed to those who work with adults on the margins of society--the poor, the incarcerated, the illiterate, the mentally handicapped and others--the guide is organized in a two-part format. The first part examines the theoretical foundations of participatory education, and the second part discusses the Abbotsfield Women's Project, which was a pilot project in participatory education that was conducted in Edmonton, Canada, between October 1985 and June 1986. The following aspects of participatory education  programs are covered in part 1: the basic concept and framework of participatory education; guiding principles for participatory education (participation, commitment, community, accountability and responsibility, praxis, hope, vision, acknowledgment); curriculum and the notion of curriculum as plan (intents, sources and resources, activities, and evaluation); and administrative concerns (facility, child care, confidentiality, questions of time, staff roles, the question of power, the validity of the &quot;numbers game,&quot; and ways of locating interested participants). Part 2 describes the history and design of the Abbotsfield Women's Project, the processes used in developing and implementing the project (creating an environment, connecting and focusing, working toward an experience of community,  responding to the moment, caring for others, reaching into and beyond oneself, celebrating community, and reflecting), reactions of project participants to the project, and project outcomes. A 12-page annotated bibliogrpahy is included. (MN)",

The utility and use of the AIF capabilities of Air Force ATDs were explored by means of a survey of 534 simulator instructors from Air Training Command, Military Airlift Command, Strategic Air Command, and Tactical Air Command training sites. The primary purpose of the survey was to provide a database that could be used in defining the requirements for ATD procurement and in developing future ATD training programs. The results indicated that,  in general, the features that were rated highest were those used for training management, variation of task difficulty/fidelity, and monitoring student performance. The level of AIF use was affected somewhat by hardware and/or software unreliability, implementation time, functional limitations, and design deficiencies. However, the presumed training value of an AIF was the most important determinant of its use. Recommendations were made concerning the AIF capabilities of future ATDs and research aimed at determining the principles of effective AIF use. The survey instruments are appended. (Author/KC)",

The linkage model depicts a process that is divided into three phases. Three chapters discuss in detail these phases. Chapter 1 on the decision phase concerns these functions: establish communications, develop agency interest, obtain agency decision, and identify needs. Chapter 2 on implementation addresses agreement development, curriculum development and identification of method of instruction, teacher recruitment and orientation, and program implementation. Chapter 3 on the evaluation phase discusses evaluation of student performance and program  administration and provision of feedback to agency administration, ABE coordinator, and teacher. An appendix provides a guide to linkage agencies. (YLB)",

It investigated how Section 306 agency personnel interpreted the CBAE manadate and effects of the mandate on agency management, classroom functioning, and student outcomes. Quantitative and qualitative strategies were used to collect data from adult basic education/English-as-a-second-language students from Section 306 adult education agencies. Findings indicated approximately one-half of the agencies had identified competencies, an increased number of agencies had developed student profiles, use of the California Adult Student Assessment System Survey Achievement Test had increased, documentation of student competency attainment  remains low, most agencies have structured student placement systems in place, instructors perceived themselves as using a variety of instructional strategies whereas the students did not, and staff development opportunities have increased. Recommendations were made in these areas: state-level and local agency-level supports for change; CBAE curriculum; assessment, recordkeeping, and guidance; instructional strategies and materials; and staff development.

Bachelor degree programs within the BDFS system are designed to relate directly to the military occupational specialty of soldiers. In operation since October 1986, the program grew out of the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges, which offer associate degree programs. The BDFS system includes the following features: colleges limit required academic residency to 25 percent or less of the total degree program; educational plans are drawn up for each student; BDFS institutions award credit for nontraditional learning; BDFS institutions agree to guaranteed transferability of credit among colleges and universities in the network; the  student-soldier can complete degree requirements after completion of military service; courses are scheduled to facilitate the soldier's completion of a sequence; and the colleges in the network publicize their programs to military personnel and their families. Currently, there are eight BDFS networks with more than 840 network units (one college offering one curriculum at one approved installation) operating around the world. Educational institutions are nominated for BDFS institutional membership by local U.S. Army Education Services officers. The BDFS system is expected to be expanded and refined in the future.

Chapter 2 provides three program examples of popular education: a workshop for teachers about popular education in Central America, a workshop on working people in Canada and Central America, and a workshop on popular education for community groups. Techniques for building a popular education program are shared in Chapter 3. They include sculpturing, sociodrama, role play, drawing, and songwriting. Chapter 4 contains  exercises to help the group process, such as ice breakers, group building, and relaxation. Finally, Chapter 5 explains how to develop resources--in this case, a slide show--and describes four slide-tape shows produced by Rick Arnold and Bev Burke about Central America.

The survey instrument used in the study was developed at a 3-day Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) workshop that was attended by 11 expert secondary and postsecondary administrators from 6 states. The DACUM committee identified 210 tasks that were eventually clustered into 12 duty areas. The questionnaire was then sent to 188 administrators, 128 of whom returned usable questionnaires. Of the 210 task statements included on the questionnaire, 201 were verified as being important.

Second, the Center concentrates on two of the most powerful human capital pressures on the economy--the need for worker adaptability or flexibility and the quality of the labor supply. Third, its primary objective is to spearhead a major restructuring of K-12 education. Fourth, in rethinking K-12 education, the Center challenges distinctions between work-related and general learning. Fifth, the Center  questions distinctions made between at-risk and not-at-risk learners. Finally, the Center challenges the assumption that the nation's educational and training delivery systems--for example, schools, the military, the corporate training system, and public training programs--differ substantially in their pedagogic strategies.

        "description":"In September 1984, a questionnaire on safety belt use laws was sent to approximately 25 nations, more than 20 of which responded. Various members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Road Research Program used data from the completed questionnaires in conjunction with existing literature to write a series of working papers analyzing various aspects of the effectiveness of seat belt laws in different countries. In November 1985, more than 80 experts from 14 nations attended an OECD-sponsored workshop on the effectiveness of safety belt use laws, which was structured around the papers prepared by the members of the OECD working group. This report includes a summary of the workshop and the final versions of the following workshop presentations:\"Safety Belt Usage Laws in Various Countries\" (Tore Vaaje); \"Safety Belt Usage Rates\" (E. A. Marburger); \"Safety Belt Use Rates and User Characteristics\" (John Lawson); \"Casualty Reductions: Results from Safety Belt Use Laws\" (James Hedlund); \"Rear Seat Belt Use and Effectiveness for Adult Rear Seat Occupants in Cars\" (Maryvonne Dejeammes, Ake Nygren, Claes Tingvall); and \"Effectiveness of Child Restraint Laws\" (Maryvonne Dejeammes, Ake Nygren, Claes Tingvall).

        "description":"This book describes various aspects of the historical development of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The first chapter, entitled &quot;Origins,&quot; sketches the factors leading up to authorization of the BLS in June 1884. A chapter entitled &quot;Carroll Wright: Setting the Course&quot; discusses the views and contributions of the BLS's first commissioner. The next chapter covers the studies for economic and social reform that were undertaken during the administration of the bureau's second commissioner, Charles Neill. The BLS's history during the pre-World War I recession and war years, when Royal Meeker headed the bureau, are examined next. The fifth chapter is devoted to Ethelbert Stewart's term as commissioner of the BLS, which lasted from 1920 to 1932. The BLS's efforts to meet the  emergency demands imposed on it first by the Great Depression and then by the New Deal agencies that were created to deal with the Depression are discussed against the framework of Isador Lubin's term as BLS commissioner. Ewan Clague's term as BLS commissioner (from 1946 to 1965) is discussed in terms of the expanding role that economic indicators began to play in the BLS. The eighth chapter summarizes the limited terms of the next three BLS commissioners, Arthur M. Ross, Geoffrey H. Moore, and Julian Shiskin, as well as the term of Janet L. Norwood, who was well into her second term as commissioner when the book was published. A brief discussion of the BLS's continuing mission, an appendix describing BLS publications, source notes for each chapter, and an index conclude the book.  (MN)",

        "description":"Action learning is a potentially empowering management development strategy--empowering to managers and through them to employees. The core of the action learning process is similar to the empowerment process identified by Freire (1973), although the context of these approaches is very different: praxis. Praxis involves critical reflection on experience that leads one to see a problem in an entirely new way, to reformulate the problem, and to try out new strategies to solve the problem, many of which involve collaborative action with peers. In both approaches, participants become aware of the way in which taken-for-granted sociocultural norms have often been internalized and acted out without questioning. Although action learning is in some ways a very practical learning  strategy, it departs from many of the purely behaviorist orientations to learning because its emphasis is not on shaping the individual to a predefined standard. Instead, it works from within to assist the individual in seeing his or her individual and social reality from different perspectives. The focus is not first and foremost on solving a problem more effectively, but on properly naming the problem before one even begins to think of strategies for its solution. In this way, it is suited to the challenge of today's managers who must take a proactive role in creating and managing change before they are overwhelmed by its effects. (KC)",

This cooperative extension service program provided special training in horticulture to members of the local community who would then work as volunteers through their local cooperative extension office to provide horticulture-related information to their community. Telecasts consisted of pretaped segments that alternated with phone-in question-and-answer sessions. A questionnaire collected data from 174 participants regarding the perceived effectiveness of this teaching method. The delivery method was economically feasible. The majority of the respondents were satisfied with the satellite portions of the program and were favorably  disposed toward use of satellite telecommunications for other extension uses and for education in general. Nearly 98 percent indicated that the telecasts were either well done or very well done. Almost 90 percent said they would be willing to attend future extension programs using satellite delivery. Complaints were in two areas: technical problems and the speed at which the broadcasts presented the material. (The instrument is appended.) (YLB)",

The first chapter discusses the consequences for business of an ill-prepared work force and examines the issues of the quantity and quality of workers, with special attention to the problems posed by the dwindling entry-level work force and the increasing mismatch between workplace needs and worker skills. The return on business investment in education (including development of a literate and better-trained work force, a better business climate in the community, and a better national competitive edge in the global marketplace) are examined next. The third chapter, which is a case study in  the development of a business-education partnership, outlines the history, outcomes, and lessons learned from the Boston Compact (a school-business partnership that was formed to improve attendance, reduce the dropout rate, improve performance levels, and increase college and job placement rates among students enrolled in Boston's public schools). Multilevel partnerships as well as partnerships in policy, systemic educational improvement, management, teacher training and development, the classroom, and special services are explained. Assessing community needs and building a school-business partnership are the focus of the final chapter.

        "description":"The Soviet government has consistently relied upon the country's educational system, including adult education, to advance its ideological, social, and economic goals. In the Soviet Union, education has been used to promote Soviet identity, minimize the impact of religion, advance the status of women, and help increase worker productivity. Adult education programs have many different purposes, including eliminating illiteracy, raising occupational skill levels, attaining a 100-percent secondary school completion rate, raising ideological and political levels, and encouraging cultural enrichment and constructive use of leisure time. All of the country's adult education programs are regulated by the government. They are completely government financed and are free to adult learners.  Virtually all adult education takes place on the students' own time. Both formal and nonformal programs make up the country's adult education system. The formal school programs for adults integrate adult education courses into the existing framework of secondary, vocational, or higher education. The curricula of evening, correspondence, and day classes are largely the same. Approximately 13 million Soviet citizens are enrolled in over 47,000 people's universities. These universities combine features of formal and nonformal education. Although they have definite curricula and academic programs, they do not purport to provide a standardized body of knowledge. Many students attend them to prepare for exams given at work or through other schools; in and of themselves, certificates of  completion from people's universities do not give individuals any additional rights or status. Museums, libraries, clubs, theaters, and cultural centers are other providers of nonformal, nonschool programs for adults. Trade unions play a large role in workplace educational programs, which are primarily intended to improve worker productivity. (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined the characteristics of effective secondary vocational education programs for a variety of special needs populations (disabled, disadvantaged, and limited English proficient individuals; single parents; and persons enrolled in programs to eliminate sex bias and sex stereotyping). The following eight states were studied: California, Colorado, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Data were collected from a review of the literature, site visits to local schools, and a mail questionnaire to state coordinators of secondary vocational education programs for special populations. Encouragement of parental and community involvement, class sizes ranging from 11-15 students, and positive social interactions between special population and  nonspecial population students were all associated with program success. Successful programs appeared to have staff members who were willing to experiment, were nonbiased toward special populations, served as positive role models, and had experience in both their subject area and methods of teaching special populations. Most successful programs coordinated sources from multiple funds to maximize their effective use. Preassessment of learning styles and special problems, individual education plans, readiness to modify curricula to meet individual needs, and supportive services all appeared linked to program success. It was concluded that program evaluations should focus on a variety of input, process, and outcome variables and that student evaluation should include assessment of students'  skill development and personal growth related to attitudes and behaviors.

Increased service to employers and student retention were moderately successful outcomes. The study also identified factors contributing to institutions being able to achieve their outcomes: articulation as a high priority of state education officials; effective interpersonal relations; strong commitment by local administrators; open communication channels;  well-written, carefully planned articulation agreement; modest goals; initial and continuing commitment and leadership by key institutional personnel; effective local leadership; well-developed curricula; remediation services; transportation services; program promotion; and impartial program coordination.

A series of three regional meetings were held for prospective BVT programs. These meetings articulated the basic concepts of BVT models, presented resources, and led participants in preliminary planning for program implementation. Eight agencies were selected as aspirants that received customized on-site technical assistance to help develop and implement BVT programs. As a result, one project put in place a BVT program, and three other projects developed BVT programs to a point where they were awaiting  clearance of external factors to implement them fully. Two of those three were expected to be operating shortly. Recommendations were made for the continued support of the type of technical assistance that was provided. (Sample materials are appended.)

        "description":"The Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council tested four systems that could be used to provide supportive services to a minimum of 100 volunteer literacy tutors. The following four support systems were developed: a program providing for telephone consultation by a reading specialist, informal meetings of volunteer tutors, workshop class reunions, and a tutor mentoring program. The informal local gatherings of tutors proved to be the best method of providing tutors with an opportunity for continued contact and support. The method was found to allow a great deal of flexibility in that the tutors were able to choose the times, locations, and frequency of their meetings. Because the tutors could share the responsibilities in making arrangements for the meetings, the staff coordinator did  not need to attend each meeting. The workshop reunions were the second most effective of the support systems tested. They were advantageous because they offered an opportunity to bring together volunteers who first met at their preservice training and thus helped the tutors develop a special sense of community. The telephone consultations with volunteer reading specialists did not work out as well as had been hoped and thus were rated third among the four methods tested. It was concluded, however, that, given certain guidelines, the method can be an effective way of providing supportive services to volunteer tutors. The mentoring strategy was poorly received by those participating in the test, perhaps because the tutors in the program preferred more solitary activities. (MN)",

The Educational Handicaps and Problem Questionnaire (EHPQ) developed from the study of Brunner and Nicholls (1960) was administered to adult educators in public higher institutions and voluntary agencies. Both groups of adult educators identified research, methodology, retention of competent professional staff, and definition of adult education as the major handicaps and problems in their field. The study concluded that both education policymakers and adult education agencies should work together in finding solutions to the problems of adult  educators.

The book contains an introduction and nine chapters. The introduction defines program evaluation, provides a rationale and uses for program evaluation, and suggests ways to develop a program evaluation policy. The nine succeeding chapters cover these topics: types of program evaluation, designing a program evaluation, measures for goals and objectives, data collection, systems analysis, evaluation research, data analysis techniques, report writing, and developing a plan to implement program evaluation. Following the narrative of each chapter are exercises and  self-tests with answer keys. An appendix provides definitions, lists of references and resources, program evaluation forms, and statistical formulas. (KC)",

The results revealed that children's attitudes were influenced by variables such as level of cognitive development, experience with death, socialization, and instruction. Young children reported an imaginative range of views about forms of possible afterlife. Adolescents included recognition of environmental, ecological, and psychological causes of death and were concerned about the effects of personal death on family members and friends. Adolescent views of an afterlife reflected traditional  socialization. Attitudes of adults were influenced by variables such as gender differences, environmental factors, generational differences, experience with death, aging, and interaction effects. Widows and widowers who had developed individual survival skills, psychological coping strategies, and extended social support networks reported less distress than did unprepared subjects following the death of a spouse. While aging or maturation alone appeared to be systematically unrelated to overt death anxiety, adults did seem to maintain an ambiguous attitude regarding death throughout the lifespan. (Author)",

        "description":"While research has shown that people are adversely psychologically affected by knowledge that their communities have been toxically contaminated, it has been suggested that those who see a disaster as naturally occurring tend to be less adversely affected than those who see a disaster as caused by human acts. To examine this issue, questionnaires were collected from 73 residents of Warwick, New York. Warwick residents potentially faced toxic contamination from both a natural occurrence (radon released by underground deposits of uranium) and a man-made problem (a plan to dump radioactively contaminated soil in the bordering town). The results revealed that respondents viewed the dumped toxic as more dangerous than the naturally-occurring toxic and were both more aware and more  concerned about the dump situation. They also rated government handling of the dump as poorer than government handling of the radon problem. Subjects also differed in their emotional reactions to the two dangers, checking more total emotions in relation to the dump than to the natural radon and feeling more anger about the dump than about the natural radon. These findings support the hypothesis that perception of human causation leads to greater distress and anger than does perception of natural causation of toxic contamination. (NB)",

Sixty male and 34 female college students who had a same-sex best friend and who were involved in an exclusive dating relationship completed Rubin's Love and Liking Scale for dating partner and the liking items for best friend, a measure of social support, and a short measure of jealousy in both friendships and romantic relationships. The findings support the idea that women are more intensely involved in their friendships and also  in their romantic relationships. Women liked both their best friends and their romantic partners more than men did. Women also reported being more jealous of their best friends than were men and they tended to feel that friends supported them more than did men. Women reported feeling significantly more supported by their romantic partner than did men. Further research into the relationship of friendships and romance is warranted. (NB)",

This study was conducted to examine the effects of lawyer's hostile versus non-hostile behavior and lawyer's leading versus non-leading questions on simulated jury impressions. The script of a negligence case was drafted and videotapes were made for each of four conditions which varied by lawyer hostility and use of leading questions. College students (N=89) viewed one of the tapes and acted as jurors in the trial. Subjects rated impressions of the defendant's lawyer and of the expert witness, indicated a verdict, and gave a decision about the size of the award, if applicable. The  combination of both hostile style and leading question tactics produced a more negative effectiveness rating than did either tactic alone. The results support the view that a powerful style produces a more favorable impression of a defense attorney than does a less powerful style. The approach involving both hostile affect and leading questions, however, was responded to negatively and seen as reducing the lawyer's perceived effectiveness, as was a non-hostile non-leading question style.

        "description":"Although partially caused by sex differences in aspirations and qualifications, the underrepresentation of women in professional and managerial positions also reflects the persistence of sex discrimination at the entry level. Discrimination against women applying for traditionally male jobs seems to increase with ambiguity about the fit between the applicant qualifications and job requirements. To examine this issue, 60 male and 60 female college students evaluated a male or female applicant for the position of Residence Life Director, which was described as a masculine, feminine, or neutral sex-typed job. Ambiguity of the evaluation task was varied by amount of job-relevant information in the applicant's resume. The results revealed that applicants received better evaluations  when ambiguity was low; ambiguity did not interact with other factors. Male applicants were evaluated more favorably for the masculine job than for the neutral job, but female applicants were evaluated more favorably for the neutral than for the feminine job. Same-sex favoritism was shown in salary recommendations, especially for male subjects. These findings suggest that job applicants should present as much job-relevant information as possible.

        "description":"Research has demonstrated that discrimination against women does not occur for all high status traditionally male job positions; bias seems most likely when ambiguity in the evaluation process requires evaluators to resort to their stereotypes in order to predict performance. The same line of reasoning may apply to blacks or other minority candidates for high status traditionally white male positions. This study investigated the effect of job status on racial discrimination as well as on sex discrimination in the same hiring situation. It also examined whether own-sex favoritism in evaluations would extend to black candidates. White male and female college students (N=64) evaluated job candidates. Candidates and job descriptions varied on whether they were appropriate for high  status or low status positions. Candidates also differed in race and gender. This 2x2x2x2 design yielded several three-way interactions. Information about the candidate affected perceptions of the job status and clarity of candidate description, as well as the candidates' qualifications for the job. Subjects tended to prefer their own gender for the high status job but to prefer the same-sexed black person when both jobs were considered. Regardless of job status, subjects were willing to hire the candidates, with the striking exception that male subjects rejected most of the the black female candidates. (Author/NB)",

A study was conducted to survey the amount of contact counselors had with exceptional students, the relationship between self-perceived counselor effectiveness and special education background, and the willingness of counselors to seek additional training in special education in order to feel more effective. Questionnaires addressing these issues were completed by 91 high school counselors. The results revealed that the majority of respondents were not working with  significant numbers of special education students. Counselors who reported feeling adequately prepared to work with these students were as likely to have taken one or more special education courses as were those who did not feel adequately prepared. Almost one-half of the respondents indicated they would not be interested in taking special education coursework to increase their effectiveness in working with exceptional students. (NB)",

        "description":"In response to a request from the chairman of the Congressional Select Committee on Aging, the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigated the potential effects of legislative proposals to provide catastrophic coverage to Medicare beneficiaries on beneficiaries' out-of-pocket health care expenses. The GAO reviewed GAO and other reports to identify types and amounts of out-of-pocket expenses, Medicare law and regulations to determine beneficiaries' out-of-pocket liability for covered services, and minimum coverage requirements for Medigap policies to determine how they affect costs. Fourteen catastrophic coverage bills were analyzed to determine how they would address the major types of catastrophic health care costs, and the financing mechanisms of the bills were compared. The  GAO concluded that 9 of the 14 proposals reviewed would establish a catastrophic limit above which the beneficiary would no longer be liable for Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. It was concluded that, if enacted, these bills would represent an important step in increasing the health insurance coverage available to the elderly, but that significant gaps would remain. This report presents the GAO comparison of catastrophic health insurance proposals and looks at inpatient hospital care, nursing home care, home health care, Medicare Part B services, other medical services not covered by Medicare, catastrophic protection, and financing and costs.

        "description":"This document presents the texts of four Congressional hearings held in September of 1985 and February and March of 1986 to investigate the effects and the causes of the critical shortage of liability insurance in the United States. The first hearing examines the dimensions of the problem and offers insights into why objectives of having an insurable society are not currently being met for many people. The second hearing calls on representatives of businesses and of cities, towns, and school boards nationwide, many of whom have been affected by the crisis of insurance cancellations and rate increases. Also testifying are representatives of insurance agent organizations who discuss the insurance industry and difficulties faced by clients. The third hearing concentrates mainly on  the perspectives of the states in their current responsibilities for regulating insurance. Witnesses at the state level provide information about the current regulatory system. The final hearing calls on witnesses who discuss areas in which the need for improved risk abatement is particularly acute, including the trucking industry. A total of 35 witnesses provide testimony at the four hearings. Materials submitted for the record are included. (NB)",

This research examined the differential effects of joint versus maternal custody, structural complexity (presence or absence of stepfather's children from a prior marriage), and sex and age of adolescent on adolescent outcomes in stepfamilies. The volunteer sample consisted of wives, husbands, and oldest or only adolescents in 84 white, middle-class stepfather families. Each family member independently completed a questionnaire in the family's home. Findings revealed that adolescents in joint custody and simple stepfamilies reported more happiness and more inclusion than did those in joint custody and complex stepfamilies. Joint custody families  with older adolescents and with boys reported the most role ambiguity (disagreement about the stepfather's role in the family). Structural complexity affected loyalty conflicts only for younger adolescents, who reported less loyalty conflicts in complex stepfamilies. Boys were reported to have greater well-being than girls regardless of custody arrangement. (Implications for theory and policy are discussed.) (Author)",

The usefulness of self-efficacy as a predictor of career choice and the relationships between careers considered, efficacy beliefs about career, self-esteem, and academic ability were also examined. Male and female undergraduates (N=115) enrolled in career exploration classes completed two self-efficacy questionnaires, the careers considered questionnaire, the Perceived Traditionality Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory. American College Testing scores were used to measure academic ability. Traditionality of a career  was found to be a moderator variable in career choice for women but not for men. Efficacy beliefs were found to be significant predictors of career considered. Mathematical ability was positively correlated with efficacy beliefs for traditionally male careers and inversely correlated with efficacy beliefs for traditionally female careers. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Most theory and research on power and social influence in counseling and psychotherapy has focused on the power base and power outcome domains of Olson's (1972) framework which viewed power as a generic concept consisting of the three domains of power base, power process, and power outcome. Statistical approaches to the study of power, influence, and dominance have been developed which fall under the heading of sequential analysis. These approaches see counselor and client responses as being both causes of later events and results of earlier ones. Analyzing power and influence in counseling in terms of the relative degrees of contingency among counselor and client responses seems to be a natural approach. An alternative view to that operationalized by usual approaches to  sequential analysis proposes that, rather than earlier events pushing later events into existence, later events may draw earlier events into existence. By taking this approach and computing conditional probabilities in the backward direction, the question becomes one of understanding the possible behavioral sequences that all end up at the same place. Power should not be defined in such a way as to include all causal or contingent relations between interactants, regardless of intentions, because if that were the case, then all human interaction would be a matter of power. In examining human interactions, it is important to accept the fact that human relationships, including counseling relationships, are possible apart from power struggles. (NB)",

Proponents of prescriptive/normative decision-making models attempt to develop procedures for making optimal decisions while proponents of the descriptive/behavioral models look for a choice that meets a minimal set of requirements rather than an optimal set. This study compared an Expected Utility model (prescriptive/normative) and an Elimination by Aspects (descriptive/behavioral) model of career decision making. Both models were also compared with a \"model-free\" choice situation in which the decision-making strategy was not explicitly dictated by experimental procedure. The three decision-making strategies were compared in terms of quality of  choices, types of careers chosen, and post-decision satisfaction. College students (N=101) completed the Work Values Inventory and participated in activities which involved operationalization of the three decision-making models. The results suggest that use of the Expected Utility model produced the \"best quality\" decisions for subjects. (Author/NB)",

The GAO investigation focused on the extent to which OHDS selected and rejected full grant applications and preapplications out of ranking order without written justification and the extent to which it selected grant applications for administrative rather than competitive review without written justification during fiscal years 1984 and 1985. The results revealed that in selecting child abuse and neglect projects to fund in 1984 and 1985, 15% of OHDS's decisions on competitively reviewed full applications and preapplications were made out of ranking  order. Written justification was not prepared for 83% of these cases, nor was it prepared for any applications rejected within ranking order or for 93% of decisions to select grant applicants for administrative rather than competitive review. Other required documentation on resolution of recommendations and suggestions of expert reviewers, review comments by OHDS officials, and files of rejected applications were also not kept. Although OHDS took steps to remedy these problems in fiscal year 1986, the steps did not resolve all of the problems.

Using published and unpublished information, the GAO identified trends and wide variations among states in Medicaid spending and compared eligibility criteria used, the scope of services offered, and reimbursement to providers. Medicaid spending in New York was compared to national averages and studies analyzing the underlying causes of variations were reviewed. The results of the GAO investigation revealed that growth in spending for Medicaid during fiscal years 1965-1980 was primarily caused by increasing use and an expanding Medicaid population. Growth in spending in fiscal years 1981-1983  was attributable primarily to inflation. The distribution of payments within the Medicaid program has shifted from acute care for the disabled and Aid to Families With Dependent Children to long-term care for the elderly and chronically ill. The Medicaid literature suggests that similar people in similar circumstances but in different states are treated unequally in terms of both Medicaid eligibility and generosity of benefits. Interstate variations appear to be caused by variations in the availability of financial resources across states and by the social and political variables which influence the ways states choose to structure their Medicaid programs.

Two studies were conducted using a paradigm which permitted a direct comparison of Learned Helplessness Theory and Egotism Theory as explanations for the motivational deficit associated with the performance of depressed subjects in an achievement situation. The purported difficulty of a task was manipulated to examine whether relatively depressed persons persisted less as the task grew more difficult, as Learned Helplessness Theory must argue, or whether they persisted more, as Egotism Theory predicts. The results showed that relatively depressed college  students persisted longer in their attempts to solve a puzzle when it was described beforehand as extremely difficult compared to when it was purported to be moderately difficult. Subjects also were more likely to blame their lack of success, especially in the moderate difficulty condition, on too little and too much effort, as well as on their being anxious and worried, relative to their less depressed counterparts. These findings provide evidence that depressed persons engage in egotistic behavior when their self-esteem is threatened by potential failure. (Author/NB)",

A review of 279 Medicare and Medicaid cases from the Office of Inspector General revealed that 89% of the cases involved submission of false claims; 3% involved kickbacks; and 2% involved perjury, theft, or misuse of government property. About 85% of cases involved health care providers, of which approximately 50% were medical doctors. About 50% of cases involved allegations of fraud committed against the Medicare  program, 30% involved Medicaid, and 9% involved more than one health care program. Three types of action which can be taken against health care providers who commit Medicare or Medicaid fraud were identified: (1) subjection to criminal or civil action by the Department of Justice; (2) assessment with a civil monetary penalty; and (3) suspension from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A review of 351 cases revealed that, in 275 cases, subjects were either prosecuted, fined, or suspended from participation in the program. New procedures are being initiated by the Office of Inspector General to ensure that vulnerabilities in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are communicated to health care program managers so that underlying causes of fraud can be corrected.

Figures and tables are used to illustrate changing family circumstances which require structural adaptation and new transactional patterns, dysfunctional family patterns, and an example of clinical depression precipitated by failure of a family system to adapt to life cycle stressors associated with retirement. Intervention from a family systems perspective is conceptualized in terms of three aspects of intervention: (1) structural formulations of cross-generational triadic patterns of  enmeshment-disengagement; (2) failures to adapt to life-cycle transitions; and (3) the dysfunctional systemic structure.

        "description":"A dual-career family is a family in which both spouses are committed to occupational work and to a family life together and support each other's desires to combine roles that traditionally were viewed as incompatible. Male socialization in the areas of entitlement, dependency, and nurturance can cause problems for men in dual-career marriages. In addition to sharing power and status with women, men in dual-career families need to revise their sense of self. Benefits for men in dual-career marriages include freedom from the burden of total economic responsibility for the family and a chance to be more involved with their children. Stressors common in dual-career marriages include deciding whether, when, and how to parent; combining work and family; and job placement and  occupational mobility. A successful dual-career marriage depends on many factors, most notably the spouses' willingness to integrate career and family despite societal pressures to conform to sex-typed roles. Personal, family, and societal resources are needed to achieve this integration. Spouses in dual-career families need to talk about their conflicts, seek out community resources, and recognize that change is rarely easy. To make a dual-career family work, spouses must understand the issues involved and work through their problems with flexibility, compassion, and patience. (NB)",

        "description":"Social support in the workplace may take many forms, and the form it takes may be related to the extent to which it buffers the relationship between occupational stressors and individual strains. A study was conducted to examine social support given to subordinates from their supervisors. Nurses (N=225) from seven hospitals completed measures of role stressors, job satisfaction and other outcomes, social supports, and contents of communications with supervisors. The results revealed that positive and negative work-related communications occurred between supervisors and subordinates, that supervisors and subordinates also talked about non-job related events, and that these three types of communications were often combined. Subordinates' perceptions of available support from their  supervisors were primarily related to positive job-related or non-job-related communications and only slightly related to negative job-related communications. Traditional measures of perceived social support had main effects on employee strain; contents of communications with supervisors also had these effects. The findings suggest that the buffering effects of social support may depend in part on the content of communications among potentially supportive people. Future research might examine different stressors, strains, and sources of support. (NB)",

The second study conducted with regular education teachers (N=72) included the acting out behavior problem and the acceptability of the three interventions. The ratings of the interventions indicated that both student teachers and regular education teachers viewed the humanistic and behavioral approaches as being the most acceptable and the pragmatic approach as being the least acceptable. In terms  of classroom use, there were significant positive correlations among acceptability ratings of the three intervention types and student teacher self-reported use of these three types of intervention. With regular education teachers, there was a significant positive correlation between the ratings of the behavioral intervention and self-reported use of behavioral interventions within the classroom. Neither the pragmatic nor the humanistic ratings correlated with self-reported classoom use for the regular education teachers. (Author/NB)",

Medical professionals need comprehensive AIDS training and educational programs which cover medical, epidemiologic, psychosocial, and neuropsychiatric aspects of AIDS. Counseling psychologists can provide a unique perspective and service in training health care professionals in the prevention and intervention of AIDS by helping them acquire or alter personal-social skills, improve adaptability to changing life demands, enhance environmental coping skills, and develop a variety of problem-solving and decision-making capabilities. Counseling psychologists can help medical personnel develop the counseling skills they need to support the patient  and family and to help them make appropriate decisions, adjustments, and changes in behavior necessary to cope with the impact of AIDS. Not only can counseling psychologists train medical personnel to positively impact AIDS patients, they can also impact hospital policies which adversely affect AIDS patients. By training medical personnel to enhance healthful behavior patterns through the development of interpersonal and counseling skills, attitude change, and a reduction in discomfort and conflict which may interfere with quality patient care, counseling psychologists can greatly impact the AIDS crisis.

An instrument measuring applicants' match to a large number of professional and technical jobs within a state civil service office was developed from data collected through a comprehensive job analysis. A study was conducted which investigated the selection decisions of civil service applicants (N=103) following completion of this instrument measuring their job-person match with each of 70 jobs. Applicants either completed the instrument, completed the instrument and received additional feedback concerning their match to jobs, or served as a control. The  results revealed that applicants' selection decisions were modified by feedback on their matches to the different jobs. Applicants completing the instrument but receiving no feedback were not significantly different from controls. Applicants' match to jobs was significantly, but differentially related to civil service test performance across groups. Results indicated that applicants were willing to alter their initial selection decisions and even eliminate jobs based on feedback from an instrument measuring job-person match under certain conditions.

Therapists must be comfortable talking explicitly with these clients about sex, and must be able to help clients talk explicitly about their behavior. Clients often feel ambivalent about being tested for the AIDS antibody. Therapists can help these clients explore for themselves the ramifications of finding out their antibody status and can help clients make their own choice about testing. Counseling psychologists can also provide crisis intervention to persons who have received a positive antibody result. Physicians may refer to a therapist patients who may be either antibody positive or negative, but who are convinced  they are going to die of AIDS. Counseling psychologists can also work as consultants to local AIDS task forces, providing education and training through psychoeducational workshops and other programs, and giving direct services to clients. There are numerous opportunities for counseling psychologists in private practice to become involved in AIDS work. Counseling psychologists have a responsibility to become informed and to provide sensitive therapeutic services to the community. (NB)",

This study examined the effects of joint versus maternal legal custody, whether or not the stepfather had biological children from a prior marriage, and the sex and age of an adolescent on the custodial mother's remarriage. Middle class remarried mothers (N=84) and their husbands each completed a questionnaire measuring marital satisfaction; competition between the father and stepfather; role ambiguity for the stepfather role; and the mother's relationship with her ex-spouse. The findings revealed that marital satisfaction was highest for couples with girls in joint custody. Mothers of early adolescent daughters reported  better relations with ex-spouses than did mothers of later adolescent daughters; no difference was reported for sons. Stepfathers with no prior children reported more competition with the biological father than did stepfathers with biological children. Couples in joint custody arrangements with stepfathers who had no prior children reported the most role ambiguity. The results suggest that custody decisions made at the time of divorce can have an impact on subsequent remarriage, and that stepfamilies need help in creating roles for stepparents that complement biological parents' roles.

Chapter 1 defines reading as the process of constructing meaning from written texts, a complex skill requiring the coordination of a number of interrelated sources of information. Chapter 2, on the preschool  years, focuses on talking to the young child, reading aloud to the preschooler, and teaching children about written language. The third chapter, on beginning reading, counsels parents on what to look for in good beginning reading programs in schools, and how to help the child with reading at home. The fourth chapter, on developing readers and making reading an integral part of learning, offers suggestions for helping the child succeed in school and for encouraging reading for fun. The afterword calls on teachers, publishers, and school personnel, as well as parents, to participate actively in creating a literate society. The booklet concludes with a list of organizations that provide practical help or publications for parents. (NKA)",

A. K. Halliday's systemic functional grammar. The first paper is concerned with representation as it is defined by linguistics--how to represent language metalinguistically, or how to talk about talk. Topics covered in the paper include: (1) the lag between theory and representation; (2) dimensions of structure (including a sample grammar and discussion of the structuring, insert, expand, conflate, and preselect operators); (3) modes of meaning and modes  of structure, a characterization of representational problems of constituency, prosody, pulse, and interdependency; (4) modes of meaning and modes of choice; and (5) possible solutions. The paper also contains an appendix on representational conventions and a bibliography. The second paper looks closely into how systemic functional grammar can be represented using the framework of functional unification grammar (FUG). Included are descriptions of: the ingredients of FUG (unification, paths, patterns, disjunctions, and their representations); technical details of the representation of systemic grammar in FUG; differences between FUG and systemic grammer; extensions to FUG motivated by systemic functional grammar; solutions to problems in systemic notation (such as discontinuous  constituents and feature propagation); and features of a grammatical analysis computer program.

        "description":"Containing the results of Oregon's second statewide analytical writing assessment, this document summarizes the procedures used to evaluate the writing skills of 4,567 eighth graders from 55 schools and analyzes the results. Following an introduction that includes comments from the scoring team, chapter 1 presents a brief history of writing assessment in Oregon, including the rationale behind scoring methods, writing models, and paper selection. Chapter 2 gives a trait by trait analysis of content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence structure, and conventions of the sample papers. Chapter 3 compares the 1985 and 1987 assessments, concluding that the differences in performance cannot be attributed to scoring team variance, but that some differences may be attributable to  variance in the writing prompts. Chapter 4 reviews potential influences affecting student performance, including the prompt, teacher attitude, understanding of the exercise, curriculum, and instruction. Chapter 5 provides a detailed summary of the findings and recommendations of the interpretive panel. The report's conclusions include the following: (1) students' writing seems balanced between strengths and weaknesses, with a preponderance of scores of 3 on a 5 point scale; (2) the average score for all traits is slightly higher than in 1985, and signs of strength across several traits indicate successful strategies on the part of teachers; and (3) the value of a writing assessment lies in its ability to build understanding between teachers and students about the nature of good writing. A  note on the follow-up to the 1987 assessment is included, and appendixes contain the writing prompt and student instructions, the letter to students accompanying the test results, and a list of interpretive panel members for 1987.

        "description":"To evaluate the effectiveness of a new writing curriculum in the Oak Ridge Schools (Tennessee), modeled after the process-oriented National Writing Project, a three-year study of student writing was conducted. The study consisted of evaluating writing samples collected from 90 students in grades 3 through 12 over 3 consecutive years, and surveying by means of annual questionnaires the writing attitudes of students, parents, and teachers. Results from the student attitude surveys show an increase over the second and third year in students' interest in learning about writing, in their level of confidence, and in their association of self-esteem with good writing. A decrease was observed in students' feelings of discomfort about completing writing assignments and in their feelings  that they do not write well and that writing is difficult. At the end of the study, students at each grade level were better writers than were previous students in that grade level. Students in classrooms with teachers trained according to the National Writing Project approach performed better on the writing sample than did students in the classrooms of untrained teachers. The teacher survey showed few differences between trained and untrained teachers in attitudes about writing, ranking of writing problems, and assessment of language arts priorities. Some significant differences were found between parent and teacher attitudes. (Recommendations of the writing committee are included, and writing assignments and assessment rubrics are appended.)

        "description":"Gifted students' writing may exhibit stylistic dissonance--a mixture of basic writing features may coexist with features indicative of much higher levels of rhetorical control. A case study of an 11-year-old sixth grade student who attended a freshman composition course at an Arkansas university illustrates this dissonance. The poems and short stories he wrote in sixth grade and during a summer course exhibited many mature features, such as metacognition and revision skills. He was also an excellent peer tutor. His abilities allowed him to take the freshman composition course in which academic writing would be required, even though his elementary school teachers and principal thought he would not succeed because he spoke with a rural accent and came from a low-income family. He  was classified as a basic writer in the college setting, because he was unprepared for the types of writing tasks he would encounter. An essay that he wrote revealed many surface errors such as spelling errors, dialect interference, and punctuation problems. Other basic writer's problems he exhibited included egocentrism (or writer based prose) and problems with focus. Yet, his abilities to revise, organize, and add detail to the text attested to his skills as well. It is important for teachers to learn to recognize the gifted child writer, even when surface problems mask their abilities.

        "description":"Designed for secondary school English teachers who want to help their students develop enthusiasm for words, their histories, and the way language structures words to produce meaning, this paper offers suggestions for a program of study employing dictionary projects and personal experience. The paper describes making a class dictionary of teen language, involving such activities as the following: (1) posting words on a class bulletin board; (2) interviewing students and parents to gather words; (3) examining dictionaries to see what words they contain; (4) examining textbooks for ways to present new terms; (5) examining dictionary histories; (6) deciding how to select words; (7) writing definitions; (8) determining spellings and variant spellings as well as pronunciation and  usage; (9) debating decisions of correctness versus majority rule; and (10) accounting for changes in meanings of various words. The paper argues that this broader, deeper type of language study remedies past problems of paying exclusive attention to memorization and mechanical skill, because students begin to understand the nature of the language system they have mastered. The paper suggests additional language lesson plans based on different areas of linguistic studies, including units on generating spelling rules from observations of spelling patterns, proposing a reform of English spelling, illustrating a definition, compiling lists of morphemes, and compiling sequences of words with relative shades meaning.

        "description":"Noting that teacher education students are unfamiliar with the censorship issue, this paper discusses three kinds of censorship the pre-service English teacher can be expected to face, and suggests ways to prepare them to recognize and remedy anticipated problems. The essay identifies the first kind of censorship as that imposed by English teachers, librarians, and parents who reject adolescent fiction and popular teen magazines as less worthy reading material than the traditional canon. The essay advocates using individualized reading programs to counter such canonical censorship, and recommends seeking assistance from the school librarian for information about good new books and writers. Second, the essay identifies teachers' self-censorship resulting from more experienced  colleagues' advice to avoid certain lesson plans judged too \"difficult\" or too controversial with parents. The essay again recommends seeking the advice of school librarians, who will have the best sense of what students like to read, and what their parents will object to. Finally, the essay identifies the censorship efforts of groups from outside the school, and notes that most students training to be teachers are unaware of the motives and scope of book censorship groups. The essay recommends initiating in-class debates on the subject, and inviting a school librarian to share experiences in negotiating such objections to book selection. (JG)",

The paper first discusses choosing a computer for the laboratory, recommending unconnected microcomputers over mainframes or networks. Next considered is choice of word processing software; full-featured programs are recommended but simpler programs for beginners are also suggested. Other software, such as spelling checkers, outliners, and style checkers are also discussed. Next the document  focuses on political issues, such as the relationship of writing laboratories to administration, laboratory scheduling, and money matters. The document then examines the details of working word processing instruction into the freshman composition curriculum, stressing the importance of handouts. Advantages and disadvantages of using computers in composition courses are then enumerated, and the lack of research studies on the topic is noted. An annotated, selected bibliography is appended.

The first part of the paper introduces the idea of symbolic thinking by comparing students encountering new ideas with convention-goers making their way around a new city. The section suggests that the convention-goers can do this because they relate unfamiliar experiences to things that are already held in the mind symbolically and adjust old ideas on the basis of new information. The next part of the paper discusses language use in school, and contrasts Transmission teachers, those who see themselves as experts imparting a fixed body of knowledge, with Interpretation teachers, those who acknowledge and work with the ideas with  which students come to school. The third part of the paper offers a communication model of language for learning, which encompasses individual capacities for language, language functions, communication modes, and audiences, while the fourth section suggests ways in which the model may be used to facilitate students' self-expressive uses of language.

        "description":"Research has suggested that students have difficulty completing content area writing assignments if the teacher's written instructions are not clear. Students' written work is more likely to be of higher quality if teachers specify the assignment's audience and purpose and offer prewriting instruction. Controversy exists over how explicit the instructions should be--whether they should contain an outline of the writing process, or whether this should be implicit in the assignment--but there is some consensus that instructors should balance open-endedness with strategic directions or cues in the instructions. A study of instructors' writing assignments at the University of Texas at Austin revealed that instructors did offer the most crucial rhetorical cues, as well as other  related ones, in their writing assignments. A content analysis of the writing assignments of 35 faculty members showed that two rhetorical dimensions, topic and specific task, appeared most frequently. Almost all of the 130 assignments contained topics, and those that did not were elaborated upon in class. Less popular were references to style, organization, purpose, and audience. Two thirds, however, contained imprecise language and mixed messages. Teachers must remember that student experiences grow out of instructions, and evaluation of the final written product is a response to the connection between an assignment and the product.

        "description":"Facing the problem of a wide discrepancy in grading standards for student essays, the English department at a Texas community college developed a standardized method of grading students' expository and persuasive essays. The department established a committee of 10 full-time instructors whose objective was to standardize grading for all required essays. The committee developed five categories of criteria: (1) content, purpose, thesis, and support for thesis; (2) organization, development, and paragraphs; (3) sentences; (4) word use and tone; and (5) punctuation and mechanics. The categories were refined after a semester to include a &quot;D&quot; grade as well as &quot;A,&quot;&quot;B,&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; Additionally, a sliding scale and a &quot;no grade&quot; option were incorporated. &quot;B&quot; papers were then differentiated  from &quot;A&quot; papers as being accurate rather than superior, as worthwhile rather than valuable, and as lacking &quot;rich&quot; content. &quot;C&quot; papers were then defined as sketchy and routine, and &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; papers showed poor theses and little or irrelevant support. A review of the revised criteria indicates that they need some refinement, as &quot;A's&quot; and &quot;F's&quot; are difficult to assign, but that on the whole they have provided more specific direction for students looking to revise their work, and they have reduced grading time.

Based on the premise that illustrations in Victorian books can be &quot;decoded&quot; much like a written text, students were introduced to illustrations from Charles Dickens'&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and Lewis Carroll's &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and spent time examining the illustrations to determine their faithfulness to the text and how they elaborated upon the narrative. Students also read research that familiarized them with Victorian artistic concerns, such as the language of symbols in artwork, and the Victorian preoccupation with the pastoral, death, and the family. An assignment called for  students to examine Dante Gabriel Rosetti's painting &quot;Found&quot; and decode its symbols. More successful students learned not only to decode individual symbols but make ideational connections by seeing the symbols as a whole, as a &quot;text&quot; to be read. During the second month of the course, students were able to see how an illustration highlights a text or provides essential information. As the course neared its end, students had progressed to a point where most easily made ideational connections between the arts, and occasionally made insightful connections between Victorian and modern concerns. The nature of this course seems to encourage students to make a full range of connections. (JC)",

Topics covered in the paper include the following: (1) the two competing perspectives on the brain--the simple left-brain right-brain view and MacLean's triune brain (reptilian, paleomammalian, and neomammalian); (2) assessment of the intrapersonal communication system by beginning at the preverbal stage; (3)  the role of the brain in understanding intrapersonal communication processing; (4) modularity of brain function and intrapersonal communication; (5) interhemispheric cooperation; and (6) interhemispheric dissonance. The paper concludes that intrapersonal communication should not be regarded as either oxymoronic or all-inclusive, because the communication among brain modules--where modules may or may not interact, exert control over one another, compete, or cooperate--is indeed a form of intrapersonal communication. Seven pages of references, a table of brain functions and structures, and a diagram of the triune brain conclude the paper. (SKC)",

Results of the LEAD test indicated that these leaders were likely to adopt a&quot;selling&quot; approach, considered only marginally effective by the test's authors.

Research was carried out in Belize, a small multi-lingual Central American country with no domestic television stations but with exposure to transborder television services from Mexico and the United States. Subjects, 245 high school juniors and seniors from three schools responded to a questionnaire about media exposure to Mexican and U.S. television, as well as print and radio. The Belizean youth represented a different population from elites who had been  the focus of previous research. Results indicated that the proposed model provided an excellent fit with the data in the tests reported, and the amount of variance explained in appraisal and exposure was generally superior to that reported in other tests. Measurement errors were also acceptable. All of these factors taken together supported the general theoretical framework advanced in previous studies, and the overall pattern of results suggests that the model can be generalized for a variety of media, with important implications for intercultural relations.

        "description":"Noting that when a deaf child is born to hearing parents, problems arise due to the language barrier, this paper discusses the kinds of disruptions hearing parents experience with the birth of a deaf child, the implications such an impairment has on development and language acquisition, and the adjustments made for such a child. Following an introduction which suggests that a child may have many meanings for parents, the first section of the paper presents the stages of development from birth to one year for normal and deaf children. The second section examines the discovery and diagnosis of deafness in a child, and the stages of mourning--impact, denial, grief, focusing outward, and closure--that parents of deaf children experience. Subsections also examine the impact a deaf  child may have on the parents and their ability to communicate with one another, upon grandparents, who often continue to deny the problem, and upon siblings, whose time with and closeness to the parents may be impaired because of increased attention to the deaf child. The final section looks at finding a communicative mode with the deaf child, and suggests that a combination of manual and oral approaches is best in establishing a language system. A conclusion suggests that communication between deaf children and those close to them will dictate how they see themselves individually and as members of society.

        "description":"The media have often been related to nation-state building and the generation of national sentiment, but because few ethnic minorities can afford to maintain their own media systems, they generally remain relatively powerless. Indigenous land claims, legal settlements that guarantee territorial sovereignty to an ethnic group, are one way of consolidating self-rule and accumulating capital to create a media system. The Inupiat, an indigenous population of the North American Arctic, have successfully settled land claims suits, allowing them a great deal of political and economic independence. They have also developed their own television and print media, encouraging the maintenance of their culture and addressing their concerns in their own language. In contrast, the Samis, an  indigenous population of Sweden, have not had the same success in land claims settlements, and have not been free to develop a high level of economic and political autonomy. Hence, the Samis do not run their own media; a brief weekly television show broadcasts news of interest to Samis but few are employed by the station, and a state-run magazine for them prints articles in Swedish, rather than their own language. It is clear that Inupiat devolution--the process of acquiring self government--is at a more advanced stage than Sami devolution because of the land claims variable.

        "description":"The telecommunication revolution in the USSR is creating structural change in the culture, encompassing media, societal, and ideological systems. In the process, it is replacing traditional Soviet collectivist values with individualist, western values. Increasingly easy access to western ideas through VCRs, direct broadcast satellites (DBS), and home computers has led the Communist Party to restrict access to all but Soviet ideas through these media, although not entirely successfully. On the black market, Japanese VCRs and western films outsell the poorly made Soviet VCRs and limited selection of tapes. Estonians are also able to receive Finnish broadcasts of American television programs, which the Soviets have attempted to control with &quot;prior consent&quot; agreements with the West  concerning satellite broadcasts. The most pressing problem, however, lies with the Soviets' need for computer literate citizens who will not undermine propaganda and information control by connecting with non-Soviets through telephone-linked computer systems. Kenneth Burke's &quot;pentad&quot; model illustrates how the communication technologies can act as a change agent upon the Soviet media system and larger society, with the &quot;agent&quot; being the Soviet government, Soviet society the &quot;scene,&quot; and the desire to compete with western technology the &quot;purpose.&quot; Whether the new technology can be kept under control is a pressing question for Soviet leaders, a problem which could, conceivably, cause another October revolution.

        "description":"Efforts to contain the spread of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) have been slowed by numerous arguing factions, political, religious, and medical, all of which perceive the AIDS epidemic through a different set of symbols. The images can be more easily understood using Kenneth Boulding's Threat, Integry, and Exchange (or TIE) model. The triangular model suggests that interactions based on threat images are destructive, founded on one group subjugating another. Groups who base their actions on threat images include Christian fundamentalists, who conclude that the disease is an act of divine retribution; the medical community, which sees AIDS as a threat to its authority and ability to cure disease, and some gay groups, who see AIDS as a threat to their political  autonomy and sexual freedom. Action based on exchange images are more productive, including spending tax dollars on AIDS research, while action based on integrative images is the most productive, encompassing the acknowledgement of identity in relation to others. Churches that have welcomed gays into their membership and groups that have been formed to deal specifically with the AIDS issue fall into this category. It is held that Boulding's concept of integry provides the best model for a pragmatic and thoughtful response to the \"situational exigence\" of AIDS, and the public should attend to those in the AIDS debate who articulate this unifying image.

        "description":"Seeking to understand American and Nicaraguan perspectives of the Nicaraguan revolution, a study examined the rhetorical strategies used by Presidents Reagan and Ortega in their speeches. Ten public addresses made by each president in 1985-1986, pertaining to funding for Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary forces, were charted and examined for prevalent themes. The themes were then grouped together by the ideas represented, and the groups were clustered to represent a broader topic of consideration. A discourse analysis based on Kenneth Burke's ideas on myth criticism investigated the mythic structure of each leader's rhetoric. In addition, an agon analysis of the rhetorical texts examined the philosophical perspectives of the two presidents. Analyses indicated that President  Ortega's discourse featured the pentadic element &quot;purpose,&quot; which corresponds to the philosophical term of mysticism, while President Reagan's discourse featured the pentadic element &quot;agency&quot; which corresponds to pragmatism. These philosophical perspectives are components of each other and as such serve to define each other. Just as a means is implicit in an end for Daniel Ortega's mysticism, purpose is implicit in agency for Ronald Reagan's pragmatism. Findings suggest that the political drama of international policy rhetoric is a viable and necessary area for future study. (Forty notes are attached.) (NKA)",

Directors of various state and regional humanities councils furnished information for analysis by means of direct inquiry or published essays. Results indicated that the similarities of state programs  were greater than the differences. Results also indicated that a limited number of communication scholars are involved in programs sponsored by humanities councils. Specific projects funded in the communication field were difficult to identify, but projects that used activities and concepts taught in communication departments were mentioned. Some issues of interest to all communication scholars were those related to the formulation of ideas and the writing of successful proposals for the humanities, including careful examination of proposed budgets, presentation of specific detailed descriptions, and emphasis of humanities content.

While writer-performers regard a script as more important than the performance, a solo performance is, however, a showcase of the artist's talent, and creating one's own text offers the performer artistic control. Some performers, such as Hal Holbrook and Emlyn Williams, adapt and reconstruct works by other writers into a new text. Lily Tomlin's collaboration with Jane Wagner recently produced the highly successful &quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.&quot; Monologist Ruth Draper performed purely oral performance texts for years (condensing, extending, or altering them according to the needs of a particular audience) before she finally  wrote them down late in her lifetime. In such places as Colonial Williamsburg or Disneyland, the employees assume the role of fictional or historical characters, which is another way of combining writing with performing. Although considerable research is conducted for each character, the performers create their own dialogue through improvised interaction with each other and visiting tourists. The dual role of the performer-writer, which sometimes can result in internal conflict, is nonetheless challenging and rewarding. (Notes are attached.) (NKA)",

        "description":"Since the passage of House Bills 246 and 72, Texas teachers have expressed frustration with the sudden and dramatic increases in the amount of paperwork required of them, complaining that the extra time required for noninstructional duties cuts into both instructional and personal time, and that the paper work created by this legislation is largely irrelevant to instruction. This study examines the extent to which teachers' frustration with paperwork is creating a burnout problem among Texas teachers. A series of questionnaires were sent to 3,000 randomly selected teachers from the Texas Education Agency's 1985 list of educators. A total of 700 usable questionnaires were returned. These questionnaires provided data about: (1) paperwork, divided into three subscales--frustration,  independence, and coping; (2) burnout, divided into two subscales--emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment; (3) locus of control; (4) pupil control ideology; and (5) demographic data. The attitudes toward paperwork accounted for the largest amount of emotional exhaustion, followed by locus of control. These questionnaire data were supplemented by qualitative data from a telephone survey of 40 randomly selected teachers along with written comments mailed in by hundreds of respondents. All the findings pointed to the same conclusion: teachers are experiencing considerable burnout due primarily to the burden of paperwork, which contributes in turn to their sense of helplessness--the other major source of burnout. The report concludes with a set of recommendations by which the Texas  Education Agency can reduce paperwork in schools. The latter two sections of the document comprise an extensive review of literature related to paperwork and burnout and a detailed account of the methods and procedure used in collecting and analyzing the data. A bibliography is appended, along with statistical data. (TE)",

To evaluate the program, at the end of a 3-year exploratory period, data were obtained from onsite observations, meetings with three sets of graduates, selected school staffs and colleagues, and with participant and interested observers. Additionally, questionnaires sent to 273 graduates were responded to by 195 (74 percent); and questionnaires sent to 92 superintendents were responded to by 83 (90 percent). A summary of a review and synthesis of the current literature on leadership and leadership development is presented. More than 75 percent of the responding participants indicate they have considered returning to the Academy  for another program, and 95 percent would recommend the experience to a colleague. An 80 percent positive rating in terms of the applicability of knowledge acquired was given, and on a five-point scale rating, the culture of the Academy as an environment for professional growth, the mean rating was 4.7. The superintendents' views of the Academy are generally positive. Alternative futures for the Academy were explored at a meeting with the six stakeholder groups by giving them a summary of the appraisal data with an overview of seven alternative scenarios.

A total of 160 families currently living on the island were mailed a survey, but only 65 surveys were returned. A much higher rate of return had been expected because of apparent dissatisfaction with the school, because of the controversy this seemed to have fomented and because of the compactness of the community. The respondents revealed that they see a need to involve more adults in the school and to hire and retain top quality staff. The respondents are aware of the limitations placed on the curriculum by the small size of the school; however, they believe that the system could be better managed. Interviews with 15 members of the school  staff resulted in numerous positive comments regarding ideal class size, good relations among staff members, regular reporting to parents, availability of educational materials and equipment, ability to give individual attention to students, and the use of computers in the classroom. Some concerns were voiced in regard to cocurricular activities, need for a parenting program, assistance in developing a drug-alcohol program, planning time, and the need for the planned new gymnasium. Researchers also looked at a sampling of school records and surveyed the school facilities. The report concludes with a set of recommendations.

        "author":["Donaldson, Gordon A., Jr.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"In response to national calls for educational reform, Maine's legislature established a career ladder certification system with three steps: provisional, professional, and master teacher. The goal was to tie teacher advancement to evidence of improved teaching and classroom management. The 1984 plan required that teacher committees develop certification criteria at the local school system level and that the new certification strategy be pilot tested in selected districts for a three-year period. Maine's law gave local administrators responsibility for setting standards and for measuring their colleagues' performance. This paper analyzes the master teacher criteria created by local committees in 16 pilot districts. The length of typical Maine criteria lists and the variety of  topics covered made it difficult to summarize their content. However, the items were grouped into the following categories or domains. The teacher: (1) prepares for instruction effectively; (2) uses teaching strategies and procedures appropriate to the content, objectives, and learners; (3) uses evaluation to improve instruction; (4) manages classroom activities effectively; (5) establishes and maintains a professional leadership role; (6) communicates effectively; and (7) manages routine business and recordkeeping efficiently. Each item on a local district list was assigned to one of these categories. Results showed that pilot sites did not create criteria stressing improved teaching and classroom management. One-third of all criteria were professional leadership items, while  instuctional and classroom management items comprised only 17 percent and 16 percent of the total, respectively. Committees relied on nonpedagogical aspects of teacher performance and produced remarkably similar lists. Also, the 16 pilot site lists contained many hard-to-measure process-type criteria and used high-influence language creating interpretation problems. Maine's effort to engage teachers in certification calls into question several propositions concerning the benefits of professional self-regulation. Still, teachers' trust in the criteria and process may compensate for these difficulties. Included are seven references and five tables. (MLH)",

        "author":["Willie, Charles V."],
        "description":"Backed by the federal government, the excellence movement in education has advocated higher college admissions requirements and reliance on nationally administered standardized tests. Although intended to benefit the public welfare, these recommendations actually discourage learners considered less worthy. When discussing the movement's mental health implications, one must consider community psychology concepts (equality, supremacy, preeminence, authority, responsibility, rejection, and others) related to individuals' interactions. Essentially, excellence is a function of individual aspiration and accomplishment. When excellence is viewed as a collective property, an inappropriate transformation has occurred that is open to abuse. Institutions, groups, and other collectivities  are obligated to serve others adequately, not excellently. Drawing on the work of Polybius, an ancient Greek historian, this paper argues that the excellence movement's attempts to transfer an individual, personal privilege into a social obligation is inapppropriate, misguided, and ultimately pathological. Polybius feared that subsequent generations of authority holders reared in a privileged atmosphere would abandon their high responsibility in favor of avarice and other excesses. Today's educators should not be so quick to condemn the U.S. system of universal education as mediocre, nor to adopt exclusionist higher education policies. Our educational system will be strengthened by maintaining its twofold goal of community advancement and individual progress. Included are four references.  (MLH)",

        "author":["Sacken, Donal M."],
        "description":"This paper offers some reflections on reconstructing the role of school law instruction in colleges of education, and specifically in administrator preparation programs. Three aspects of a school law course are discussed as they relate to the typical path of educational administrators' academic preparation. The \"translational dimension\" of school law refers to the original function of school law courses, which is simply to instruct educators in the legal concepts necessary to discharge their duties, so that they will not violate the law from ignorance. Typical school law courses involve an exposition of important case law to show the variability of legal outcomes, on the assumption that educators will better serve professionally if they comprehend the basic nature and application  of legal principles and the adjudicative process. This approach, however, is seen as insufficient because it looks at law in isolation from other types of knowledge about educational organizations. An integrative approach which views legal decisions prismatically from the perspective of scholarship in several different disciplines is, therefore, recommended. For example, insights from sociological analysis and management theory could be brought to bear on legal issues such as school desegregation, teacher dismissal, collective bargaining, and teacher student relations. The third aspect of school law courses is the foundational aspect, which addresses the historical precedence and development of legal decisions in education. Another foundational perspective that can be highlighted in  school law is the ethical foundation--the relationship between school law and justice or morality, and the moral ramifications of schooling and school management. The ultimate measure of a school law course, however, is its contribution to the overall intellectual training of school administrators. (TE)",

        "description":"Accurately estimating the number of female high school administrators is difficult because (1) comprehensive studies by individual position are nonexistent; (2) most state departments of education do not collect or report such data; (3) limited samples are used in studies; and (4) researchers and reporters tend to aggregate positions. Researchers are divided as to female administrators' progress during the past decade. This situation led to companion studies aiming (1) to determine whether the status of female high school administrators has changed since 1972; and (2) to develop baseline data for monitoring female status in line administrative positions. This paper summarizes study data that addresses the question of women high school principals and assistant principals. The  first study examined 44 of the largest U.S. school districts. In the second study, various district types (urban, suburban, medium city, and rural) in Tennessee were examined to see if findings in the largest districts were mirrored in all types of districts in one state. Data were secured for 1972, 1982, and 1986. (The studies will be replicated in 1986.) Results clearly showed gains in status and representation of women high school administrators since 1972, particularly in large city districts. In 1986, women held 23 percent of high school principalships (up from 6 percent in 1972) and 32 percent of assistant principalships (up from 19 percent in 1972). Women are making steady, less spectacular progress in suburban, medium-sized, and rural districts. Included are nine references.  (MLH)",

        "description":"This document has been designed to assist members of a program review team through the process of reviewing a program. The program review process has been designed for judging the effects of the curriculum, instructional methods, and improvement strategies on the students; guiding the development of planned assistance; and providing a model for the school's own self-study process. Chapter 1 describes the methods and procedures of program review, the application of appropriate criteria for judging the schools' instructional program, and the development of proposals for improving the instructional program. Chapter 2 describes a set of criteria for curricular quality and lists precautions for reviewers about applying these criteria to the school program. Chapter 3 describes how the  interaction between the review team and the school results in an assistance plan for improving the instructional program. Two appendices comprise nearly two-thirds of the document. Appendix A, &quot;The Quality Criteria for Judging the Effect of the Program on the Elementary School Student,&quot; contains criteria for excellence in 12 areas: language arts, mathematics, science, history-social science, visual and performing arts, physical education, schoolwide effectiveness, special needs, learning environment, staff development, leadership, and program planning. Appendix B is the guide to be used by schools in conducting a self-study. (TE)",

        "description":"Beginning in November 1986 and continuing through the end of March 1987, the Capital Area School Development Association (CASDA), consisting of 36 teachers and administrators from 23 school districts in the Capital Area (Albany, New York) met in a series of six full-day sessions to deliberate on issues being raised in the current national policy debate on educational reform. This report summarizes these discussions in four essays. The keynote essay, &quot;A School for Learning,&quot; suggests that in order for schools to rededicate themselves to learning, schools must use what is known about learning; student evaluation practices should be designed to assist learning rather than simply to screen students; scheduling should be guided by learning requirements, and not vice versa; learning  should be aimed toward creating contributing members of a humane and caring society; and a shared vision in school and community is needed to transform schools into centers of learning. The second essay, &quot;A New Model for School Leadership,&quot; calls for redefining the roles of teacher and administrator to promote greater teamwork and collegiality. A model is provided for a concentric team approach to school organization and leadership, focusing on the student. The third essay, &quot;The Professionalizing of Teaching&quot;, calls for changes in the way contracts are negotiated and what is included in them and changes in the roles of teachers and administrators. It also calls for greater teacher participation in curricular decisions, and for norms of continuous self-improvement among teachers. The final  essay, &quot;Preparing for the Future in the Teaching Profession,&quot; sets forth specific recommendations for improving teacher education programs. (TE)",

        "description":"This book provides a series of conceptual guidelines and models, predicated on Catholic tradition and law, for all those responsible for educational governance in Catholic elementary and secondary schools and in the various forms of parish religious education programs. Chapter 1, &quot;Education and Governance,&quot; discusses Catholic educational governance in the larger context of Christian values and the mission of the Church. Chapter 2, &quot;Governance and Law&quot;, discusses the respective roles of canon and civil law in the organization and operation of Catholic education. Topics discussed include the distinction, in the Code of Canon Law, between catechetics and Catholic schooling; the legislative, judicial, and executive power of the diocesan bishop; parish governance; schools and  ecclesiastical structure; civil law and church property; contracts and employee relations; and Catholic school boards. Chapter 3 sets forth the following basic principles for church governance: (1) shared mission, (2) participation, (3) discernment of shared vision, (4) collaboration, (5) pastoral planning, (6) justice, (7) formal and informal relationships, (8) subsidiarity, and (9) accountability. Chapter 4 provides models by which groups within the church can structure educational governance. These include three models for single parish educational programs (a consultative board, a consultative committee formally related to the Parish Pastoral Council, and a board with limited jurisdiction); two models for inter-parish educational programs (a consultative board or a board with limited  jurisdiction); and three models for private schools (a consultative board, a board with limited jurisdication, or an independent corporate board). Chapter 5, the conclusion, discusses the distinctions between power and authority in church governance. Appended are sample board constitutions and a glossary of terms. (TE)",

Following an introduction, section 1, &quot;Re-thinking the Organizational Structure of Schools,&quot; presents current thinking on the organizational structure in which school administrators function. Alternative models are offered so that schools can redesign their environment to develop greater excellence. &quot;Research on the Competencies of Effective Administrators,&quot; section 2, discusses the skills and competencies of effective administrators identified in some of the major research studies. Section 3, &quot;Competencies of Effective Administrators,&quot; groups the competencies discussed in section 2, plus others found in the literature, under the eight  categories defined in the U.S. Department of Education's Leadership in Educational Administration Program (LEAD). A ninth area, involving parents and the community in school improvement, is added to the discussion. &quot;Providing Leadership for Change,&quot; section 4, recommends ways that individuals can incorporate the leadership functions into administering their school or school district to facilitate improvement. The final section of conclusions emphasizes that the bureaucratic structure of most schools is not conducive to educational excellence. Policymakers should include &quot;leadership for change&quot; as a competency needed to redesign school organizational structure. The report provides 11 pages of references and 4 appendices of identified administrative skills and competencies. (CJH)",

Total counts for the nation as a whole are presented, except for the following categories, where states are missing data: Prekindergarten and \"ungraded\" students; and prekindergarten teachers, kindergarten teachers, teachers of ungraded students, and instructional aides. Student enrollment is broken down from prekindergarten through grade 12 and for ungraded students. Numbers and percentages are tabulated for instructional staff (teachers  and instructional aides) and for support staff (guidance counselors/directors and \"other\"). The report derives the following statistical observations: (1) The student/teacher ratio ranges from a low of 13.7 for Connecticut to a high of 23.4 for Utah; (2) total public school enrollment is approximately 39.8 million students; and (3) nationally, teachers account for a little over half, 53.4 percent, of the total staff of public schools.

Almost one-third (29 percent) indicated that they had seriously considered leaving teaching because of student misbehavior; and on the average, teachers estimated that about 7 percent of the students they taught had habitual behavior problems. These are some of the findings of a recent survey designed to obtain the views of a nationally representative sample of public elementary and secondary school teachers on discipline problems in schools and to replicate certain questions asked on previous surveys of teachers and administrators. Data reported in this survey were collected by means of a mail survey with telephone followup  from a stratified national sample of 1,547 teachers. An overall response rate of 94 percent was attained. This bulletin presents a summary of major survey results.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between leadership style and the personality (patterns of core strengths) of school administrators as perceived by themselves and by their subordinates and colleagues. Sixty-seven principals and central office staff and 285 of their teachers and peers from 2 school systems participated in the study. Bipolar theory (J. W. Thomas 1978) posits that, given three pairs of core strengths, individuals express preference for one pole of each pair. The Leadership Effectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD) instruments (P. Hersey and K. Blanchard 1977) assessed the leadership styles of the principals and central office administrators. The principals recorded their self-perceptions by using the Bipolar Inventory and the LEAD-Self questionnaire.  To obtain teachers' perceptions, principals randomly chose five teachers to complete the LEAD-Other questionnaire and the Bipolar Inventory B. Central office administrators followed a similar procedure. No significant relationships were found when data were statistically analyzed using the chi-square technique. A strong preference (82 percent) for the high task/high relationship leadership style was demonstrated. Leaders were ascribed the socially valued traits of risking, practical thinking, and independent risking more than such less socially valued traits as theoretical thinking--unsurprising preferences among occupants of leadership positions. The findings suggest a lack of evidence that leadership is related to personality. Recommendations include a replication of this study with a  larger sample and the use of other leadership assessments and personality inventories. Two reference pages are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"An evaluation of the Honolulu (Hawaii) District Instructional Assistance and Assessment Component involved the assignment of part-time teachers to six specific learning disabilities classrooms in elementary schools to work with the special education teacher in instructional and mainstreaming activities. Five other classrooms were used as comparisons. Classroom observations found that one-to-one instruction occurred more frequently in project schools. Parents saw one-to-one instruction as desirable and credited such close attention as the reason their child enjoyed and/or preferred the special class. Mainstreaming could prove difficult if children expect individual attention in regular classrooms. Some parents were concerned about the movement of their child between classes and  missing work in the regular classroom. Group interaction between teacher and students or among students themselves was infrequently observed, limiting the richness of shared experiences. Seatwork was a common activity, perhaps a consequence of the individualized education program. Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) were administered to both project and comparison school students. Students in comparison schools scored higher on both the pretest and posttest in all batteries (Reading, Mathematics, Language, and Basic Total) than students in project schools, but project school students showed greater gains between tests. Recommendations are given for implementation during the expanded second year of the project. (Author/VW)",

The study attempted to (1) estimate the approximate number of Indian children in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho who are seriously emotionally handicapped, developmentally disabled, or both; (2) identify current services to these children; (3) identify service delivery barriers to this population; and (4) identify exemplary programs and innovations for successfully addressing these problems. Existing relevant literature was reviewed and key informants were identified and contacted by telephone. The study found that some 11-to-20% of all Indian children appear to have some degree of emotional impairment but that  only those whose conditions absolutely demand intervention receive treatment, largely because no single system has assumed primary responsibility for this population. Barriers related to the system (diffuse responsibility, lack of funding, isolation), to the community (needs for increased awareness, improved attitudes, and training), and to practice (need for culturally based diagnosis, lack of knowledge of etiology) were identified. Exemplary programs using a variety of approaches are cited, including group homes, prevention programs, and alcoholic treatment programs. The report concludes with recommendations and a selected bibliography. (VW)",

The study was made to understand better how children who presented with uneven or unusual behavioral development are identified as developmentally multihandicapped. Areas examined included when parents became concerned about developmental delay, what concerns they expressed, to whom they expressed them, when evaluations were made, what kinds of evaluations were carried out, and which diagnostic models were most effective. The results showed that parents most often first expressed concern to pediatricians, noting both language and social delays. On average, parents first reported concerns around 1-1/2 years of  age, began diagnostic evaluations around 2-1/2 years of age, and received diagnoses of autism around 4-1/2 years of age.

Nine adults (6 male, 3 female) with hearing impairments participated in a 4-day wilderness experience that included cross-country skiing, snow shelter construction, winter camping, a high ropes course, group initiative tasks, environmental awareness instruction, and a period of individual isolation. Pre- and post-test scores of the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory for Adults were analyzed. Post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. Conclusions about the impact of the experience are guarded due to  the small number of subjects and the lack of a control group, but the benefits of an outdoor adventure program as an ancillary component to existing rehabilitation programs are noted.

Coding was accomplished via the Mother-Child Language Usage system. Results confirmed earlier studies suggesting the child's linguistic ability is the primary determinant of maternal speech. Mothers' speech directed to DS children was not significantly different in nature than mothers' speech directed to NH children, when the children were matched  according to their linguistic ability.

Videotapes were made of the infants during 3 minutes of face-to-face play with their mothers. Tapes were coded in terms of sequence of vocalizations, pauses, switching pauses, and turns. Time-series regression analyses indicated that a great deal of accommodation occurred, especially for the vocalization and pause parameters. The accommodation was primarily compensatory in nature and was exhibited equally by mothers and infants in all three diagnostic groups. There were also substantial individual differences in vocal behavior across dyads within  each group.

The project was intended to assess both the strengths and weaknesses of community residential programs, to provide statewide feedback on service delivery, to develop a method by which citizens and service providers can work together to improve services, and to ensure individuals with retardation the opportunity to live in community settings which accommodate their individual needs with a minimum of restriction. The second article reviews one parent's experiences with her retarded daughter's struggles for independence. (CL)",

Fabrics of the same or different texture were presented to the same hand (uncrossed condition) or alternating hands (crossed condition). A repeated measures design was used to investigate performance on the tactile task using a verbal response mode and a nonverbal response mode. Analyses indicated the number of uncrossed errors and crossed errors were significantly greater for the verbal response mode as compared to the nonverbal response mode. The youngest children made significantly more crossed errors in the verbal  response mode compared to the nonverbal response mode. Results suggested that younger learning disabled children may experience greater difficulty using a verbal response mode on a task which is inferred to require interhemispheric transfer of information.

A generic school-based model was developed in which costs could more accurately be described for local district planning, budgeting and allocating of resources to instructional program and service areas. The cost analysis framework was used to collect cost data from a large suburban school district to show the feasibility of the model in special education. A follow-up study on school records and outcome information revealed that there were clear differences at the conclusion of school among those students identified as  special education, vocational education and college bound. A concept paper was developed to present the analytical process of a benefit-cost study for special education. Finally, a benefit-cost analysis conducted to assess a specific public school special education program serving mentally retarded students indicated that projected lifetime earnings of mildly retarded adults clearly exceeded the costs of providing special education for this population.

Teach and Reach focuses on compensatory education in reading and mathematics for low achieving black students in grades K-3. The program uses small group and individual instruction and a variety of teaching techniques. The program evaluation found that the majority of administrators and teachers felt that it promoted increased student learning, but the program was expensive. The Gifted and Talented Program operates at both the elementary and secondary levels in language arts, mathematics, and bilingual gifted. Program goals included providing teacher training,  updating curricula, piloting the mathematics program, and implementing the gifted bilingual program in at least three schools. The evaluation found that the program's 5-year reorganization plan was on schedule. Project BEST is a 3-year staff development program, with the goals of improving administrative leadership skills and introducing the elements of lesson design, motivation factors, practice theory, and retention theory. The evaluation found that Project BEST facilitated principals' instructional leadership, that the majority of teachers were implementing the project, and that administrators evinced a highly positive attitude toward the project.

        "description":"Many low-cost and no-cost modifications to computers would greatly increase the number of disabled individuals who could use standard computers without requiring custom modifications, and would increase the ability to attach special input and output systems. The purpose of the Guidelines is to provide an awareness of these access problems and a focal point for listing possible solutions. Section I provides an overview of disability types and the major impacts that each disability has on computer use. Section II contains a listing of problem areas and possible solutions, arranged by the part of the computer involved, including operating systems, keyboards, display screens, other output devices, mechanical design, and documentation. The Executive Summary contains a chart  summarizing the problems, the populations affected, a relative priority, possible solution strategies, and the impact/benefit of such adaptations or modifications on/to the mass market for the computer. A summary listing of design ideas is presented in three categories: design features to increase the number of people who can use an unmodified computer; design features to facilitate the connection of special accessories or programs needed by more severely involved persons; and to design features to facilitate the use of computers as special devices, such as portable communication aids.

The patients were distinguished from controls by a slower response to a target in the right visual field than to a target in the left visual field when attention was not first directed to the target location. The second experiment, involving a spatial orienting task along with &quot;shadowing&quot; a story aloud, indicated that patients were distinguished from controls by a stronger bias in favor of symbolic information over language information about spatial direction.

Affect expressions were coded from videotapes of a standard child-experimenter interaction designed to assess prelinguistic communication skills. The experimenter presented the child with different toys, initiated social games and turn-taking activities, pointed at posters around the room, and made simple requests of the child. Results indicated that the autistic subjects were not more neutral or flat in their affect compared to the mentally retarded and normal subjects. However, the autistic children showed a greater variety of affect expressions and  spent more time displaying discrete negative affect expressions. In particular, they displayed negative and incongruous blends not displayed by any of the other children. This unique pattern of autistic children's affect expressions may be syndrome-specific, and may contribute to the difficulty that others experience in reading the affective signals of autistic children.

Major limitations are identified to include the practice of studying LD subjects as a homogeneous population (masking their heterogeneity), and the lack of a conceptual model for clarifying the components and/or skills involved in social and personal functioning.

Results of a 62-item questionnaire indicated that the group identified as having exceptionally high intelligence quotient (IQ) scores (above 150) considered a wider range of careers and perceived their families as warmer and more closely knit than did boys in the sample identified as exceptionally gifted in math/science (based on standardized measures of mathematical and science aptitude scores).

The project was to familiarize LCTL teachers with the guidelines through a series of workshops, and to provide a forum for examining issues involved in adapting them for LCTL use. The languages discussed include: Arabic and the problem of diglossia, with separate standards for spoken and written language; Hindi and the issue of code-switching to and from English; Indonesian and the importance of sociolinguistic rules that are rigid and necessary to even basic proficiency in that language; and  African languages and the problem of limited resources for instructional development in such a large and diverse language group. Much work remains to be done in extending the use of the guidelines beyond the commonly taught languages because of the issues not encountered in working with western languages. (MSE)",

An introductory section discusses the interest in these issues and the use and development of polychronometric techniques for behavior analysis. Three studies using these techniques to analyze language teacher behaviors follow. One examined the extent to which the components of the language lesson are significant in enhancing learning. The study compared components of five lesson types presented to 11-year-old students of English as a second language. The second compared the five lesson types in terms of the relative duration and frequency of didactic and language behaviors. The third study looked at the relationship between learner language use,  teacher language behavior, error correction, and the level of language learning among third- and ninth-grade students. A concluding chapter discusses the studies' findings as they relate to measuring language teaching efficiency. An epilogue addresses the persistent attitude that teaching a foreign language may really be a waste of time. (MSE)",

They can be broadly categorized as either stand-alone ESL or ESL-plus. In general, stand-alone programs group limited-English-proficient (LEP) students together and instructs them in a manner similar to that used in foreign language classes. The program focus is primarily linguistic. ESL-plus programs may include a component of special instruction in and about English, but also provide content area instruction, in English or the first language. They generally occupy more or all of the instructional day. Stand-alone program types include pull-out programs, instruction during a regular class period, and a  variation on the pull-out program bringing together students from a number of schools in a resource center. ESL-plus program types include bilingual education, structured immersion, sheltered English or content-based, and high-intensity language training programs. Choosing a program design for a given set of circumstances is complex, but the best program organization (1) is tailored to meet the students' linguistic, academic, and affective needs; (2) provides LEP students with the instruction necessary for progress through school at a rate similar to their native English-speaking peers; and (3) makes the best use of district and community resources.

        "description":"Although the teaching of English as a second language (ESL) is a relatively new profession, it is an old activity. Until World War II, ESL instruction in the United States was irregular. In 1940, the first ESL teachers enrolled in a University of Michigan training program based on structural or descriptive linguistics. The Army Language School began to expand the field of linguistics, and college linguistics programs also began to develop. The 1964 National Defense Education Act spurred the growth of ESL summer institutes and university training programs, and the newly-founded Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) developed guidelines for certification and training. Currently, 33 states and the District of Columbia have certification or endorsement  requirements. Areas of necessary training for ESL teachers include English linguistics, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and education. Most of the existing training programs are at the graduate level, and many school systems provide in-service training. Since 1970, ESL teaching methodology has seen a shift from the teacher-centered to student-centered classroom, and teachers should be trained in a way that reflects this approach. New emphasis is being placed on the theory behind methodology, but in many other ways, training developments parallel those for other teachers. (MSE)",

        "description":"Despite much rhetoric, foreign language teacher education lacks a substantial research base. Teacher education programs in general consist of subject-matter coursework, general education requirements, and specialized educational content, domains that have remained relatively unchanged in two decades. However, recent reform movements may have a significant impact on each of these areas. The subject matter content varies somewhat among programs, with linguistics and English grammar courses predominating. The general education component may consist of generic courses in psychology, philosophy of education, and general teaching methods, with some field experiences in schools in a variety of subject areas. Fortunately, many large institutions can now offer specialized methods courses  in foreign language teaching, but they are often taught by professionals with more traditional approaches. Certification standards vary from state to state, and not all states have reciprocal agreements. The language proficiency of teachers is a growing concern, and some states are considering using proficiency tests as required teacher assessment measures. Many states have also begun to require teacher testing in subject matter and teaching skills. There is much interest in teacher education reform and improvement. Now that public attention has turned toward teacher education, the critical missing factor is research. (MSE)",

        "description":"Proficiency in a foreign language combined with knowledge and skills in another professional area is highly desirable in the marketplace. Business places the greatest emphasis on this combination, although language skills rank well below other selection factors. Most employers provide language training when necessary, but the amount of time available and the level of proficiency attained are usually very limited. Many employees become discouraged at the magnitude of the language learning task. An employee with a solid language knowledge and business or managerial skills has a competitive edge over other job applicants, and bilingual individuals are in great demand. Miscommunication that occurs when employees do not have foreign language skills can mean missed opportunities and  unsuccessful business dealings. Many secondary and postsecondary schools have developed nontraditional, interdisciplinary foreign language courses as a result of this need and of general dissatisfaction with traditional language instruction. Study or work abroad is often included in the program. The integration of career and foreign language studies contributes significantly to both the business community and the foreign language education profession, filling a critical need and leading to increasingly successful global interactions.

        "description":"Children from different backgrounds come to school speaking a wide variety of dialects. Questions concerning the use of dialects in schools have become increasingly complex and controversial in recent years. A central issue is the requirement of a standard dialect in school. Some find it discriminatory, others find it necessary to broaden student opportunity. Dialect differences can affect the quality of education received. Dialect may interfere with the child's acquisition of information and skills, and school personnel and other students may make erroneous assumptions about the vernacular-speaker's capabilities, motivation, and even morality. Two viewpoints on dialects have emerged. The &quot;deficit&quot; position maintains that speakers of vernaculars have a cognitive or language  handicap. The &quot;difference&quot; position argues that while languages are different, none is inherently better than another. However, students' language and cultural background can influence their chances of success. Schools might choose to emphasize grammatical usage or writing rather than pronunciation. If a school decides to teach standard English, certain general guidelines concerning content and approach should be followed. Some educators are encouraging active standard and nonstandard dialect study in the curriculum, which can benefit students from all linguistic backgrounds. (MSE)",

The parent's influence on the child can be both passive and active, but active encouragement is associated with better language learning. Parents can demonstrate their positive attitude toward language learning by actively participating in a variety of ways at home, at school, and in the community. At home, parents can encourage, but should not push, their children by praising  them for their growing interest and ability and knowledge of the foreign culture. At school, parents can establish a positive relationship with the teacher and staff, volunteer to help, and share with the teacher evidence of the child's progress. Families can also help educate the community about the value of foreign language learning and establish new programs.

Their authenticity, specialized vocabulary, reinforced grammatical structures, and topics of interest can help encourage interest in the target language and culture. They contain current language on all imaginable topics, and are not artificial or contrived. One of the most compelling reasons for using them is the teacher's involvement in selecting and adapting materials for classroom use. Mass media can help to dispel stereotypes. Realia such as maps and schedules often contain a minimum of language and reduce potential frustration: other kinds of realia lend themselves well to demonstration. Educators differ on whether the materials should be used in their original in an adapted form.  The instructor can prepare written materials to accompany the realia, and can easily prepare audiovisual aids with it. One of the key advantages in using realia is its direct link to culture, allowing attention to subtle and not-so-subtle differences between the target culture and our own. Newspapers, magazines, movie ads, mail-order catalogs, television commercials, the Yellow Pages, and souvenirs and other printed materials gathered in travel abroad or requested from other sources are examples of useful realia.

The classroom teacher can work productively with LEP students in the classroom to maximize their exposure to authentic language during the school day. Classroom communication should be simple and clear, communicate warmth, use nonverbal techniques such as prompts and gestures, contain established oral/aural routines, and be consistent even during the student's &quot;silent period&quot; of language learning. The student should be encouraged to use as much English as possible. The first priority is to ensure that the LEP student feels comfortable and secure in the classroom, and the buddy system and other forms of class acceptance and encouragement  are helpful. Careful monitoring of the student's social and academic development for possible disabilities or psychological barriers is essential. It is important to maintain high expectations of LEP students, to be prepared for their success, and to remember that they generally do not require remedial work. These students should learn the classroom management system as soon as possible and follow it as other students do. The teacher can and should learn about the students' home culture, and should explain and anticipate students' cultural and social difficulties as much as possible. (MSE)",

ESL students are learning English from many sources, not just the teacher, and the teacher's job is less to teach English than to coach students as they modify their own idiosyncratic versions of the language to approach the standard form. Responding effectively to ESL writing is similar to responding to native English writing, with some important differences. Some are cultural and involve the student's background knowledge, internalized rhetorical patterns, and assumptions about the world. Most significantly, ESL writers need  more help with the language. Written feedback should not overemphasize grammar. The feedback should be short, focused, positive, and corrective. Error correction should treat errors as a natural part of language learning and should be clear and neatly written enough to help rather than confuse the student.

Chapter two traces the general development of English-related forms of Aboriginal speech throughout Australia and establishes the position of Kriol relative to Torres Strait Creole and Aboriginal English. The distribution of speakers, the relative use of Kriol in their communities, and variations in Kriol are also described. The third chapter considers whether or not Kriol is an Aboriginal language,  based on Aboriginal use of and attitudes toward it. Chapter four examines the effects of government policies in Kriol's development, focusing on one Aboriginal community where Kriol has been spoken as a native language for four generations and the administrative, educational, medical, and church entities within it. The final chapter documents Kriol use by the government in communication and education, especially in a bilingual education program. The importance of Kriol in future educational planning is also discussed. A number of maps and diagrams are included, as well as an extensive bibliography. (MSE)",

        "description":"In order to increase women's representation among quantitative degrees, Berryman (1985) suggested two strategies: (1) increase women's share of the initial mathematical/scientific pool; or (2) reduce attrition from the pool. However, current research indicates that the decision to enter a quantitative field of study for women is the result of a complex interaction of many factors. This study examines the manner in which these factors influence women's choice of undergraduate fields of study by proposing a model indicating hypothesized patterns of effects. The estimation of the model resulted in the exogenous background variables producing the predominant influences in the model. Data for this study were drawn from the 1980 sophomore cohort of the national longitudinal \"High  School and Beyond\" survey. The analyses reported here were based on 1,893 women who participated in all waves of that study, who had attended a postsecondary educational institution, and for whom data for all variables were available. Results suggest that while parents encourage academic performance in general, they tend to discourage daughters from entering quantitative fields of study in college. It is suggested that intervention strategies targeted no later than junior high school be developed for use with females and their parents to increase awareness of opportunities for women and to effect change in attitudes and course-taking patterns.

The members of the Council of Graduate Schools were surveyed; 250 graduate schools responded (69% response rate). Questions concerned the effectiveness of recruitment programs, responsibility for recruitment financial and personnel resources for recruitment, and evaluation of recruitment efforts. Ratings of selected recruitment strategies and marketing techniques were requested. Among the results presented and discussed here are the following: the most cost effective recruitment strategies were considered to be personal contact, publications, and financial assistance,  among others; and a significant relationship was found between the effectiveness of a recruitment program and the presence of professional recruitment personnel. Based on the results of this study and the literature reviewed, a model for graduate student recruitment was developed. Each of the following steps in the model is discussed: (1) assessment (analysis of the institution, the students, the \"competition,\" and the job market); (2) developing recruitment and enrollment objectives; (3) developing recruitment plans and recruitment strategies to meet the above objectives (involving academic and financial considerations, publicity and advertising, segmentation of the student market, and other factors); (4) implementing a recruitment program; and (5) monitoring and evaluating the  recruitment program.

The purposes were to determine whether: (1) the guaranty agencies established and enforced collection and claim filing standards for lenders that adequately protect the federal interest; and (2) the guaranty agencies promptly process and pay lender claims. The principal findings were that: most agencies' collection standards have not been approved by the Department; the standards of most of the agencies were inadequate; compliance with standards has not been enforced; federal interest  costs varied widely; and the Department's revised regulations need to be enforced. GAO's recommendation is that the Secretary of Education develop and implement a process that will provide such enforcement. (KM)",

He suggests that a college education should include values through both intellectual inquiry and example. Liberty to speak and write is an essential value if faculty and students are to achieve their academic missions. The freedom of the university ensures that many approaches to moral tenets may be tested. A key value at the university is the morality of reason that requires examination of issues to help avoid prejudice. An important dimension of what students learn is a process of self-examination through rational inquiry. The morality of respect and belief in the worth of each individual is linked to the concept of equal opportunity. The  moralities of reason and respect must be joined by a morality that recognizes the importance of learning for its own sake and for the sake of the learner. Colleges also provide a forum for public inquiry on key public policy issues. Appreciation of the arts has a special place at Indiana University. Leadership qualities of university presidents that affect the development of values are also considered. (SW)",

A special objective of the program was to assist black college students. A total of 115 Northeastern Illinois University undergraduate students participated in the Department of Special Programs in the fall 1986 term. Twenty-two of these students who received a GPA of below &quot;C&quot; were selected to participate in a tutoring and advisement program. Fifteen of these students completed the Winter 1987 term, during which time 6 letters were sent to them urging participation in systematic advisement and tutoring services. It was  found that the students did not follow any one prescribed schedule for tutoring or advisement.

Objectives were to identify (1) how many departments or programs employed department-generated exit surveys to gather information from graduating students, (2) the type of information collected and its use by departments, and (3) criteria for determining the usefulness of an exit survey for departmental needs. For the 123 responding departments and programs, 27 indicated that they use department-generated, as opposed to university-wide, exit surveys. The type of information requested by departments on their exit surveys included: student evaluation of courses or sequence of courses, student career placement information, student evaluation of instructor effectiveness, and verifying a student's completion of  graduation requirements. Results of the survey suggest six steps for designing and implementing exit surveys: identifying the goals and needs for the desired information; electing or appointing an individual or committee to create the exit survey; designing and pilot testing the questionnaire, and administering the exit survey; and using the information from the exit survey. The departmental questionnaire and exit survey are appended. (SW)",

A summer GTA training planning meeting for faculty GTA training coordinators and graduate student representatives demonstrates the use of the instructional lab and other tools, and facilitates small group discussions about training concerns of department members. Workshops are also conducted on a variety of topics, such as GTA orientation and  instructional technology. Typical workshops that are included in TA orientation are described, and a timetable for planning GTA orientation activities is provided.

Questionnaires were completed by FTAs and native-speaker TAs in science and engineering departments, as well as by department heads and faculty involved in TA supervision. Observations were made in classes, laboratories, and office-hour sessions in a variety of departments. Written material that had been graded or created by TAs were also evaluated. Findings include: TA duties varied widely by department; TAs, particularly  FTAs, were not selected as classroom teachers very often in their first year; frequently TAs were lab instructors and graders; a main problem for FTAs was pronunciation; and stress timing of English and intonation patterns also posed problems for FTAs. Consideration is also given to discourse strategies, repetition, summarizing, refocussing, non-linguistic strategies, classroom interaction, and cultural issues. (SW)",

The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 established a maximum rate (3% of the principal loan amount) that all agencies could charge student borrowers. Comparisons were made of the insurance rates charged by 17 guaranty agencies, including the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the designated guarantor for five states and the District of Columbia. Data were obtained from the Department of Education, including financial reports submitted for fiscal year (FY) 1986. Using the agencies' financial reports, insurance rates were determined for FY 1986 and the insurance income they could have earned in 1986 were  estimated if their July 1, 1987 rates had been in effect in that year. Estimations were also made of: the total income that the agencies could have earned in 1986 if they had charged the maximum rate of 3%, and the administrative cost subsidy these agencies receive from the Department of Education. Findings include: effective insurance rates ranged from 0.64% to 2.87%; 10 of the 17 agencies lowered their effective insurance rates as of July 1, 1987, while 7 increased their rates. (SW)",

This approach requires that inquiry tactics more closely match educational and clinical processes. Assumptions about naturalistic and quasi-experimental educational research are considered that indicate a common field-based approach to inquiry. Parallel processes linking conceptions of medical education, clinical practice, and inquiry are also considered. It is concluded that understanding of social and educational phenomena has too long been determined by research and evaluation frameworks that define concepts of what is good and what is bad in medical education and that have limited those concepts. The processes of medical education and clinical practice are seen as complex, nonlinear  social processes appropriate for applying a field-based inquiry approach. Most medical education research has been organized by constructs, typically psychological or behavioral, that are used to explain or predict certain patterns of human behavior. Rethinking of medical education inquiry is advocated, along with less reliance on the experimental design framework of scientific inquiry. (SW)",

Attention was directed to differences between students scoring below the first quartile on the English Placement Test (EPT) reading subscore and those scoring at or above this point. Of concern were demographic factors, persistence to the end of the freshman year, cumulative units completed in the first year, grade point average in the first year, grades in English 1, and entrance examination scores. Differences in EPT subscores related to student's sex, ethnicity, self-reported English as a second language status, and decision about a major at college entrance were also investigated. The EPT  reading subscore was not a better predictor of persistence and academic progress than other objective components of the EPT. However, the fact that the EPT essay subscore was more highly related to persistence strongly supports the accuracy and consistency of essay testing. Significantly less variability existed in the EPT essay subscore than in three objective test subscores on the basis of ethnicity and English as a second language status. Additional findings are discussed. A 154-item selected bibliography concludes the document. (SW)",

        "description":"This study investigated the effects of different structures of a synthesizer and formats of the generality component on the application and remember levels of learning. Seventy-three undergraduates participated. Four treatment groups were formed by combining two types of structure (complete versus partial) with two types of format in generality (visual versus verbal statement). A complete synthesizer contained a generality, an example, and some practice. A box-chart diagram was used to represent the visual format of the generality. Results suggest that, although the format of the generality does not make significant differences on either the application or the remember levels of learning, a complete synthesizer seems to benefit remember level learning. When comparing treatment  groups with the control group, the post-hoc comparison again shows that complete synthesizers result in significantly better learning than no synthesizer at all. A discussion of the findings concludes the paper. Seventeen references are appended. (Author/RP)",

        "description":"A simulation is described in terms of its three major aspects: the scenario, the underlying model, and the instructional overlay. The major focus of this paper is the instructional overlay as the component that serves to optimize learning and motivation. Functions of simulations are identified as the acquisition of content, the application of the content, and the assessment of learning. Five simulation features that act as vehicles for achieving these functions are then discussed: generality, example, practice, feedback, and help. A general model for the design of computer-based simulations is presented which offers prescriptions for the design of the introduction, acquisition, application, and assessment stages of simulations and for dealing with the issue of control (system or  learner). Variations on the general model are then presented which are based on the nature of the behavior (procedures, process principles and causal principles), complexity of the content, form of learner participation, form of changes (physical or non-physical) and motivational requirements. In conclusion, it is noted that these prescriptions are only a first step in an attempt to construct a validated prescriptive theory for the design of computer simulations, and that considerable research and extensive field tests are needed to provide the information necessary for both confirmation and revision of the various aspects of the theory.

        "description":"This study explores the use of the adjunct question paradigm in self-instruction and distance education materials. The subjects were 187 high school students who read text passages and answered one high level (implication or inference) or low level (verbatim or paraphrase) question. These questions were either inserted in the text or massed at the end of the passage. Subjects were either allowed to look back at the text while answering the questions (the freedom group, FREE) or were not allowed to look back (the read-read-question group, RRQ; the read-question-read group, RQR). One control group read the passages twice without questions and another neither read the passages nor answered the questions. All subjects were tested on recall of low level and performance on high level  posttest items. On high level incidental items, the RQR group performed better than the RRQ group, but the FREE group recalled more low level incidental material than the RQR group. In the two no-lookback groups, those who were asked high level adjunct questions performed better when the questions were massed together, while those who were asked low level adjunct questions performed better when the questions were inserted. In general the lookback group recalled as much, and performed as well, as the two no-lookback groups. For all incidental dependent variables, most treatment groups did not score significantly higher than the READ-TWICE control group. Discussions of the limitations of the study that may have influenced the results and the implications of the findings conclude the report.  A reference list of 101 items is appended. (Author/RP)",

        "description":"One of the major problems in artificial intelligence (AI) text generation is text organization; a poorly organized text can be unreadable or even misleading. A comparison of two AI approaches to text organization--McKeown's TEXT system and Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)--shows that, although they share many assumptions about the nature of text, they are also in strong contrast. TEXT identifies text organization with whole-text nonrecursive structures, while RST uses small recursive ones. RST has an elaborate apparatus of relations between parts of texts, and of the &quot;nuclearity&quot; of particular parts; TEXT has no correlates for these. RST works with a wide range of relation types, TEXT with just one. TEXT is an implemented system, whereas RST is developmental. More important,  TEXT develops text organizations so that they resemble patterns extracted from previous text, while RST strives for an organization which is justifiable as meeting the goals of the text being generated. This contrast raises many of the key issues in current research on the nature of text organization and how it can be created by programs. A 13-item reference list is appended. (Author/RP)",

Sowa, argues that anyone who plans to get involved with issues of knowledge representation should have at least a passing acquaintance with Sowa's conceptual graphs for a database interface. (Used to model the underlying semantics of a database, these graphs describe data from the user's point of view and access data according to the system's point of view. They also represent functional dependencies in a relational database and support inferences and computations that are not explicit in the initial query.) Sowa's ideas on knowledge representation, cognitive science, and expert systems as presented in the book are discussed, and it is argued that: (1) Sowa's ideas were  limited by his concern for Codd's relational model of databases; (2) developments in cognitive science during the eight years that elapsed between Sowa's article in the IBM Journal of Research and Development (July 1986) and the publication of the book have raised issues that he does not confront adequately; and (3) perhaps the most valuable legacy of the book will be its impressive set of references to early scholarship.

The literature review briefly summarizes findings on the following topics: (1) when keyboarding skills can be taught; (2) whether motor proficiency affects the ability to acquire keyboarding skills; (3) whether formal keyboarding instruction improves elementary students' keyboarding skills; (4) the effect of keyboarding on student achievement in other subject areas; and (5) the students' attitudes toward learning keyboard skills. The three studies conducted at the University School are then described. The  first involved observation of students learning keyboarding with a personal typing book and progressing at their own rate. The second study compared the achievement of two groups learning keyboarding using the traditional typing text and individualized instruction; one group used Apple microcomputers and the other used typewriters. The third study investigated whether students who had completed a nine-week keyboarding class would produce longer stories using a computer than students who had no formal keyboarding instruction. It was found that elementary students showed positive attitudes toward keyboarding activities, learned to keyboard through formal instruction, and showed some improvements in language arts achievement as a result of participation in keyboarding activities.

Four basic features of a good student assessment procedure are then discussed, i.e., validity, reliability, practicability, and fairness/usefulness. The differences between criterion-referenced assessment and norm-referenced assessment are also explained, and guidelines for constructing a test or other form of assessment are presented. The booklet concludes with discussions of five methods commonly used to carry out student assessment in terms of their design characteristics, functions, and strengths and weaknesses: (1)  traditional extended writing tests; (2) objective tests; (3) practical tests; (4) unobtrusive assessment; and (5) self and peer assessment.

Next, two contrasting paradigms of evaluation are described, one that concentrates on measuring the outcomes of the instructional system (the agricultural/botanical or scientific approach) and one that pays more attention to what happens during the educational process itself (the social/anthropological or illuminative approach). Finally, five diagnostic techniques commonly used as part of an evaluation strategy are reviewed and the respective uses, strengths, and weaknesses of each are discussed: (1) results  from student assessment; (2) student questionnaires and interviews; (3) observation of the instructional system in progress; (4) feedback from teaching staff directly involved with the instructional system; and (5) feedback from people having an indirect link with the instructional system. Models of the systems approach to course development, the role of an instructional system, and the general methodological approach advocated by Popper are provided, as well as extracts from a Likert scale and a semantic differential scale taken from course evaluation questionnaires.

Study findings, based on an analysis of 1,507 completed questionnaires representing 23 institutions, included the following: (1)  75% of the responding colleges had centralized counseling centers; (2) all three groups surveyed shared the same perception of what constituted the top three counseling functions; i.e., academic advising, orientation and registration, and career counseling; (3) only one-third of the counselors thought academic advising should receive more priority than it presently had, while half of the administrators and two-thirds of the faculty believed it should have higher priority; (4) over two-thirds of both the administrators and faculty believed recruiting and marketing should have higher priority; (5) all three groups were in agreement that \"administrative functions,\"\"teaching,\" and \"responsibilities to college\" were the least important functions; (6) 42% of the faculty and 43% of the  administrators felt the number of counselors on their campuses was too low; and (7) the overall image of counseling services on the 23 campuses was generally perceived as adequate.

        "description":"In 1986, a Reverse Transfer Project was initiated at Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC) in order to promote the summer school attendance at MVCC of \"reverse transfer\" students (i.e., students who attended another institution during the regular academic year). A mailing, containing a cover letter, informational brochure, summer catalog, and registration form, was sent to 5,657 college students within the MVCC district. The return rate on the mailing, as measured by the number of students who received the mailing and registered for a summer school class at MVCC, was 20%. The 972 reverse transfer students generated a total of 4,831 semester credit hours, with the most popular subject areas being mathematics (290 students), business (196 students), and communications (190  students). A survey was sent to a random sample of 536 of the reverse transfer students to determine why they came to MVCC for summer school. Responses from 138 students indicated that: (1) 50.4% of the transfers were sophomores and 45.2% were juniors or seniors; (2) the most frequently cited majors were Business and Education; (3) 68% reported a grade point average between 2.5 and 3.49; (3) reasons rated most important for enrolling at MVCC were \"lightens fall schedule,\"\"close to home,\" and \"courses transfer easily\"; (4) respondents tended to rate the academic reputation of their own school higher than that of MVCC; and (5) 78% indicated that they would take another summer school course at MVCC.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Evergreen Valley College (EVC) to examine the effects of remedial English and English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction on student persistence. All new fall 1982 day students without prior college experience (N=1,264) were divided into three groups: English students, ESL students, and students who took no placement test within two semesters of initial enrollment. The English and ESL students were further divided into remedial and nonremedial groups, and a group consisting of students who qualified for English or ESL but did not take these classes. The persistence of each student in each group was noted for four semesters from fall 1982 through spring 1984. Study findings included: (1) successful experience in reading and/or writing was one of the  most significant factors related to persistence; (2) a high degree of personal/cultural support for educational goals appeared to be related to persistence; (3) nonsuccess in reading and/or writing was one of the most significant factors related to low persistence; (4) nonsuccess had more impact on remedial than nonremedial students; (5) students who completed both reading and writing courses tended to persist at greater rates than those who took reading or writing only; (6) remedial students persisted as well as successful nonremedial students when they experienced success and/or a high level of support for educational goals; (7) students who took no placement test and no English or ESL reading or writing courses persisted at one of the lowest rates of all the groups in the study; and  (8) those who qualified for, but did not take English or ESL reading and/or writing courses had lower persistence rates than those who qualified for and took the courses. The study report includes a discussion of the policy implications of the findings. (Author/UCM)",

The system was in an informational mode for all courses for fall 1985 and spring 1986, and began implementing the lock-out mode for English in fall 1986, and for English as a Second Language in spring 1987. In summer 1987, a study was conducted to choose additional disciplines for the lock-out mode. Study findings included the following: (1) as course prerequisites were increasingly enforced and as available data became more accurate and  complete, the total percentage of students not meeting prerequisites decreased from 41% to 31% to 24% to 15% between fall 1985 and spring 1987; (2) disciplines with complex prerequisites or in which students could easily by-pass advisory prerequisites anticipated the greatest impact; (3) of the disciplines scheduled for lock-out in fall 1987 and spring 1988, the disciplines with the greatest percentage of students not meeting prerequisites in spring 1987 were Construction (57%), Laser (32%), Nursing (30%), and Drafting (28%).

A holistic grading scale, which was distributed to students as a checklist for revising writing assignments, was developed and coordinated with the assignment sheet for each of six major papers. Students were assigned to either direct-instruction or peer-critique groups. Students in the direct-instruction group submitted their drafts to teachers and received written and in-class feedback. Students in the peer-critique groups had the opportunity to grade sample papers and classmates' drafts using the grading scale. The groups were  compared on the basis of grade improvement on pre- and post-tests; the amount of out-of-class time spent by the teachers in responding to individual student papers; and student attitudes toward the grading procedures. The study found no significant differences in grade improvement or student attitude toward grading between the groups, although teachers spent significantly more out-of-class time responding to the papers of the direct-instruction group than to the peer-critique group.

The next sections describe the &quot;product&quot; to be marketed (i.e., LCC and its facilities and programs), the &quot;customer&quot; (i.e., a variety of businesses and public organizations), the &quot;target market&quot; (i.e., new, existing and expanding small businesses, professional and  service organizations, and the public sector), and the goals and objectives of the program. Next, marketing strategies and activities are proposed for each program objective: (1) accelerate contracting organizations with business and other organizations; (2) present a coordinated, positive image to both private and public sectors; (3) promote to the entire college the importance of presenting a coordinated, professional image; (4) respond to all requests for service quickly; (5) assume an assertive stance in pursuing accounts and providing customer service; (6) adapt to new market segments; and (7) provide short-term training programs responsive to changes in technology, employer needs, and business opportunities. Materials from a booklet on the services of LCC's Training and Development  Department are appended. (EJV)",

        "author":["Lettman, Dennis"],
        "description":"A retention taskforce was established at Sinclair Community College (SCC) in Ohio to develop a plan to increase student retention. The 24-member taskforce, representing key areas within the college, worked for 15 months to prepare the plan. The plan was designed to be comprehensive, touching upon all points where the students interact with the institution and encompassing the whole continuum of experiences that students face throughout college. The plan's retention model contains four distinct phases: pre-enrollment, campus entry, enrollment, and post-enrollment. This five-part taskforce report explains the retention plan and how and why it was developed. Part I provides introductory material, which underscores the importance of retention efforts, and reviews the charge and lists  the members of the taskforce. Part II presents a review of the literature, covering both student and institutional factors that affect retention. Part III describes the activities, events, projects and presentations conducted by the taskforce that led to the development of the retention plan. In part IV, the four-phase model of student retention and success is presented, and terms are defined. Finally, part V offers specific recommendations for increasing retention. Recommendations, including information on the office(s) that should be responsible for their implementation, a suggested timeframe, and anticipated benefits, are made for each phase of the model. An annotated bibliography of published retention strategies, results of a pilot study on student withdrawal, and a summary of  suggestions made by retention focus groups are appended. A 50-item reference list concludes the document. (UCM)",

        "description":"A $100,000 appropriation for fiscal year 1986 directed the Washington State Board for Community College Education and the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a pilot program for coordinating the efforts of volunteer literacy tutors. The 12 projects funded by the program recruited and trained 1,473 volunteer tutors and provided literacy services to 2,174 clients at an average cost of $46 per client. Project funds supported part-time tutor coordinators who trained the volunteers and matched them with clients. Statistics gathered on the tutoring clients revealed the following: (1) the average age of the clients was 33 years; (2) 51% were married and most had family responsibilities; (3) 37% were employed, and only 4% were receiving job training; (4) 45.2% had  received their prior schooling in Washington; (5) 36.5% were immigrants or refugees; and (6) four-fifths of the clients had reading ability at or below the sixth-grade level when entering the program, and 4% read at above the eighth-grade level. Evidence from one sponsored literacy project indicated that as few as 50 hours of tutoring could produce an average gain in reading ability of approximately one grade level. Other outcomes of the program included creating a greater awareness of literacy problems in local communities and developing cooperative relationships among literacy service providers in those areas. Funding information, quotes regarding the projects and the illiteracy problems in Washington, and the authorizing legislation for the project appropriations are appended.  (UCM)",

        "description":"John Wood Community College (JWCC) serves a district population of approximately 90,000 in a predominantly rural section of west-central Illinois. In an effort to address the needs of the rural long-distance learner, JWCC has implemented a variety of instructional delivery techniques. Since its inception, JWCC has contracted with other area colleges and proprietary schools to provide education to JWCC students. JWCC students attend class with \"native\" students of contracting institutions, yet pay the low tuition and fees of JWCC. This allows JWCC to access quality instruction without duplication of facilities and manpower. A second innovative delivery method is represented by JWCC's developed Open Learning Centers, which feature open-entry/open-exit courses taught with a mastery  learning design. The centers utilize media-based materials (audio and video taped materials and computer-assisted instruction) to individualize instruction in a wide range of courses for over 1,400 students each year. In addition to existing programs, JWCC is making plans to: (1) deliver college courses to rural communities via the computer, modems, and telephone lines; (2) promote the use of new computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology by local industries by introducing a CAD/CAM lab at a local business incubator; and (3) expand its use of a regional educational television network, which offers recorded telecourses that can be received in the home via cable television and an interactive televised microwave network which allows two-way communication between  network sites.

        "description":"It is important to examine assumptions concerning leisure time and families within the larger contexts of demographic, technological, social, political, economic, and cultural change. Many people assume that individuals have more leisure time now than did their predecessors. While there has been a reduction in the average length of the work week, there has also been an increase in the total number of hours per week that families contribute to the labor force because of the increasing numbers of working women. Leisure time is further decreased by the need to complete household chores in the time available before and after work. Home lives have taken on the routines and time-management techniques of the office and factory. Time for family members to be together is essential to the  well-being of the family. Too often programs and policies deny that individuals are in relationships with others and that they have responsibilities concerning the members of their families. It is time to consider whether conceptions of leisure and recreation have, in the past, unintentionally drawn people away from each other in segregated activities, and whether we can develop programs which will bring people together and build relationships between young and old, men and women, and able and disabled.

Over 230 day care providers in 90 homes and centers were trained to implement a prevention curriculum. Providers were trained to teach over 2,200 preschool children to recognize, resist, and report incidents of sexual abuse. Providers were also trained in methods used to: (1) recognize symptoms of sexual abuse; (2) respond to children's needs; and (3) report abuse to authorities. A goal of the project was evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum and training. Samples of 155 adults and 183 children from 65 homes and centers completed survey questionnaires and participated in interviews. These samples represented  three levels of training, namely, none, standard, and enhanced. Findings suggested that: (1) preschool sexual abuse training is effective among young children; (2) enhanced training significantly increases adult caregivers' use of materials, as well as their feelings of preparedness and confidence; (3) training beyond the standard level does not significantly increase knowledge and skills for either adult caregivers or children; (4) training significantly increases children's knowledge and skills; (5) young preschoolers with training achieve higher scores than older children without training. Five attachments provide minutes of the final meeting of the project advisory committee, a project overview in tabular form, a summary report of the project, a news release, and a draft of an article  describing the project.

This play culture is not hermetic: it is very oriented toward manipulation; has a symbolic role as a representational medium; evolves along with the child; has a certain amount of autonomy; and is stratified, compartmentalized, and absorbed into the general culture which the child belongs to. Television provides children with material for games through its fictional inventions and the diverse images it presents. Television has become the main supplier of play material. In no way does television stand in the way of play. Instead, it fosters, influences, and structures play. At the same time, play allows the child  to adapt certain television material to his or her own requirements. Children's games are partly determined by the objects children have at their disposal. Through commercials, the child discovers both play objects and play situations. The development of television commercials has therefore considerably influenced the development of toys. This does not mean that the child's play culture is wholly determined by television. There is no apparent contradiction between traditional games and those provided by television. (RH)",

One hundred and eighty students in grades 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 from two school districts were tested. Participants were 9 boys and 9 girls from each grade level for each district. Subjects were at least 90 percent right-handed, as determined by the unimanual tests from the Harris Test of Lateral Dominance, and were observed to use the right hand for writing. When subjects were first tested one year earlier, the mean age of subjects at each grade level was, respectively, 97, 121, 146, 170, and 192 months. During the treatment phase of the study, subjects sat in front of a wooden box, placed their hands into holes, manually explored two irregular wooden shapes with their fingers  for three seconds, viewed a slide projecting a shape for three seconds, and indicated whether one of the shapes they had felt--and with which hand--was the one depicted on the screen. The experimental design included verbal and manual response conditions, with 40 trials for each condition. Overall, boys were more accurate than girls, and subjects displayed a left-hand advantage for nonlinguistic shapes on the manual task. Higher order interactions were found which suggested that lateralization develops with age. It is concluded that longitudinal studies will reveal developmental trends in lateralization and that changes in lateralization will be greatest during the early school years. (RH)",

The process consists of: (1) determining what information is needed to monitor and evaluate each function; (2) ascertaining what data must be collected to obtain the desired information; (3) displaying the information in a format which can be understood by staff; and (4) analyzing the data. The workbook is organized in two parts. Part 1, including chapters 1 through 5, describes a process for identifying the types of information that should be collected for intake, location, establishment,  enforcement, and collection and distribution. Part 2, consisting of chapters 6 through 11, discusses how that information can be used by management to assess the overall performance of an office in the areas of collections, expenditures, cost benefit analysis, and caseload and staffing allocations. Each chapter contains exercises and worksheets which provide practical experience in applying the concepts learned. (RH)",

        "description":"An investigation was made of standard, nonexperimentally administered Head Start programs in the Philadelphia School District. Findings replicate and extend past findings that Head Start children more often avoided serious school problems than did control children. Head Start children were less frequently retained as they moved through the elementary grades. In later grades, they had better attendance rates and missed fewer standardized tests than did comparison children. The Philadelphia data also confirm the consensus of past Head Start and other intervention studies in finding little or no lasting effect of early childhood programs on achievement test scores. After a brief introduction to the Philadelphia study in Chapter I, Chapter II describes the data base and explains how  findings are presented and interpreted in the report. The principal findings of the Philadelphia study are summarized in the next two chapters; Chapter III concerns students' absences and participation in testing programs, and Chapter IV reports on retention in grade and achievement test performance. Chapter V discusses how Head Start produces lasting effects and considers policy implications of the Philadelphia findings and other research results. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper, which probes current knowledge about the role of conflict in the formation and maintenance of children's friendships, presents results of an observational study of the spontaneous conflicts of nursery school children. Observed were 26 males and 27 females from two classrooms in a university's nursery school and one classroom in a child care center. Mean age of the sample was 4 years, 5 months. Focal children were observed over 10 weeks during play for 6-minute segments. Observers' descriptions of each child's activities were recorded. Friendship status was assumed whenever a child spent 25 percent or more of observed time with a given peer. Subjects were categorized as mutual friends, unilateral friends, or neutral dyads. Coders identified instances of conflict and  conflict components; the latter included precursors, issues, resolution strategies, emotional intensity, outcome, presence or absence of aggression, subsequent proximity, and subsequent interaction. While contexts of conflict and issues of disagreement did not differ according to friendship status, friends used negotiation more frequently than did nonfriends. Friends also effected more equitable outcomes, had less intense conflicts, and more frequently maintained proximity and continued interaction. Conflicts involving unilateral relationships resembled those which occurred between neutral associates in modes of resolution, but unilateral peers' subsequent interaction was similar to that of mutual friends.

        "description":"Since research indicates that young children influence their mothers and that mothers may exert indirect influences on their children's language learning, this correlational, longitudinal study was conducted to identify indirect routes through which early maternal speech was related to later child language development. Participants were 10 children in Brown's early stage 1 of language learning and the children's mothers. Mean chronological age of the children when the study began was 22 months; their mean length of utterance was 1.13. For each mother and child dyad, two free-play sessions occurring 5 months apart, here called time 1 and time 2, were videotaped in the subjects' homes. Pragmatic language use by mothers was coded from time 1 sessions. Child language level was coded  at both sessions. Findings indicated that six of the eight correlations between mother interaction style and later child language development could be explained through a common relation with a child language variable at time 1. Results indicated that a mother-driven, direct influence model may be inappropriate for many mother speech-child language development relationships. Concluding remarks present logical arguments demonstrating that child-driven and mother-driven models explaining the indirect relationships are equally feasible. (RH)",

According to the Institute of Medicine's Prenatal Care Index, about 63 percent of the women interviewed obtained insufficient prenatal care because they did not begin care within the first 3 months of their pregnancy or made eight or fewer visits for care. About 81 percent of a comparison group of women with private health insurance received adequate care. For the Medicaid and uninsured women, about 12.4 percent of the babies born were of low birth weight. Nationally, about 6.8 percent of births are of low  weight. Three barriers to earlier and more frequent prenatal care predominated in virtually every demographic group of women: (1) lack of money to pay for care; (2) lack of transportation to the provider of care; and (3) unawareness of pregnancy. The importance of these and other barriers differed by community.

In order to study the social control possibilities of preschool children, a geometric presentation method based on Seligman's (1979) model of reaction-contingency space was developed. The  method is described. Through tangential transposition of the contingency relationships of defined reaction classes, the method enables the geometrical representation of the extent of control.

          "Perry, Louise C."],
        "description":"Discussion focuses on ways in which Dodge's (1986) five-step model of social information processing, which has previously been used in organizing knowledge about the cognitive mediators of aggression among children, can be used to enhance the understanding of prosocial behavior. The model describes cognitive steps thought necessary to children's appropriate and competent action in social situations, namely: (1) encoding social cues, (2) interpreting behavior, (3) generating alternative responses, (4) choosing a response after evaluating potential consequences of alternatives, and (5) performing the chosen response. This paper reviews Dodge's general model of the role of cognition in social behavior; illustrates the usefulness of the model in a summary discussion of the extent to  which the model has advanced understanding of aggressive behavior; and points out ways in which the model might be applied to the study of prosocial behavior. Supplementing the discussion is a summary of research findings on ways in which kindergarten and eighth-grade children view the relationship between altruistic behavior and the altruistic person's affective state. Suggestions indicate how such findings can be assimilated to Dodge's model. It is argued that, while much of what is presently known about cognitive factors in prosocial behavior can be assimilated to Dodge's model, large gaps exist in the knowledge of such processing; Dodge's model is useful in generating hypotheses to fill those gaps.

        "description":"The employment of over half the women in the United States with children under age 6 creates a need for quality day care that the General Services Administration (GSA) has tried to meet by encouraging the establishment of child care centers in federal buildings. Although free or reduced rent has been available, only ten such centers currently exist. A subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations investigated this situation, and found that part of the problem lies in the GSA's passive attitude; in particular, that the GSA provides the service but gives little assistance in setting up centers. Other problems stem from negative attitudes of government agencies, such as Chicago's Social Security Administration, toward sponsoring child care facilities. In contrast, other  agencies, like many branches of the Internal Revenue Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, readily set up day care centers when they determined the need was great. In light of these findings, the subcommittee recommended that the GSA: (1) actively encourage on-site day care centers by assigning officials to communicate and implement the day care policy; (2) rent more space to outside day care providers; (3) survey Federal workers about their child care needs; and (4) print a handbook to assist in establishing on-site day care.

        "description":"Children in Columbus, Ohio public schools participated in two nontraditional kindergarten programs during the 1986-1987 school year. Evaluations of the programs were undertaken to determine their success. One program involved a full day kindergarten that featured opportunities for increased personal and social development, as well as instruction in art, music, physical education, and other curriculum areas. The second program involved interactive experiences with microcomputers and the Writing to Read (WTR) program which were intended to develop reading and writing skills. For evaluation purposes, children were divided into four groups: a control half-day kindergarten group, a full-day group, a half-day WTR group, and a group participating in WTR on a full day basis. Language and  reading achievement were determined by pretest and posttest scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and social adjustment was evaluated on the basis of teacher-assigned grades. Evaluation findings indicated higher achievement for students in the full-day kindergarten and WTR programs, and better adjustment to school in the WTR classrooms. Students in the half-day kindergartens showed better adjustment skills associated with personal and social growth than did students in the full-day kindergartens. Appendixes include a writing sample prompt, a list of criteria for rating writing samples, and a sample progress report form. (SKC)",

Section 1 describes the national recognition program and the criteria and processes used in selecting schools. Section 2 presents basic background information about the schools: their community settings, characteristics of their students, the schools' organizational characteristics, and school achievement indicators. Section 3 discusses seven broad themes that appear essential to school excellence: (1) teaching which develops student competence and character; (2) setting of high expectations, monitoring of standards, and rewarding of results; (3) school leadership; (4) creation of professional work environments; (5) resources that facilitate teaching  and learning processes; (6) school-community relations; and (7) overcoming of obstacles. Themes are illustrated by examples of policies and practices in the schools. Section 4 summarizes major aspects of each theme, and provides advice to State and local policymakers. The report is not a recipe book for school reform, but rather aims to: (1) draw public attention to broad themes of success associated with excellence at elementary schools; (2) stimulate thinking about such excellence; and (3) entice readers to make inquiries about specific policies and practices of the 212 outstanding schools.

Second, from what threats do protective factors protect the child? Third, what research designs can be used to identify protective factors? It is argued that: (1) there is no point in speaking of protective factors without knowing what risks they defend against; (2) most available epidemiological research into risk and protective factors is essentially retrospective and therefore serves heuristic purposes only; (3)  researchers should shift their attention from the detection of protective factors to the identification of protective mechanisms; and (4) the best way to compensate for the uncertainties of explorations based on epidemiological research is controlled experimental manipulation of assumed protective variables in the framework of longitudinal experimental research.

The study was based on responses to 2 separate survey instruments from 722 teachers and 3,846 students in 39 schools. Data analyses showed that MTR teachers and students reflected more traditional values with respect to education, indicated less support from the community and parents, perceived their schools as having fewer resources, had lower levels of commitment to education, and perceived their schools as attaining fewer of their goals  than the GSP teachers and students. MTR teachers consistently perceived critical thinking skills as less important than did GSP teachers. MTR students perceived teachers as encouraging critical thinking less, using less variety in instruction, and placing more emphasis on the textbook. MTR teachers and students shared lower academic expectations than did GSP teachers and students. Administratively, MTR teachers perceived their schools to be more authoritarian with less involvement of teachers and students in decision making, planning, establishing rules and procedures, and evaluating school programs.

From 1976 to 1981, a period of rapid employment growth, the percentage of white women with jobs in the study area increased, while the percentage of black men with jobs decreased. Among employed persons, whites increased their share of higher wage jobs. Persons who moved into the area obtained higher paying jobs than did other residents. These immigrants, most of whom were white, in general took larger shares of the new jobs than did continuous residents of  both racial groups. Among nonworking adults in 1981, blacks were more likely than whites to report that they wanted to work. Nonworking blacks, more than nonworking whites, reported that they could not find jobs or that they could not meet hiring requirements. Low education levels, which may be reflected in low skill levels, prevented blacks from sharing more in increased job opportunities. Improving the education and job training of poor residents, especially blacks, is essential to distributing economic benefits more equally. (Author/NEC)",

The 4,364 respondents (827 school board presidents, 1,251 district superintendents, 1,283 principals, and 1,073 classroom teachers) agreed on only 4 issues: the importance of improving academic performance of students from low-income families; the need to improve students' thinking and reasoning skills; the task of recognizing/rewarding outstanding teachers; and the development of students' self-esteem and aspirations. Problems identified as least pressing were the availability of quality instructional materials, school/classroom  atmosphere, and size and/or turnover of teachers and administrators. Those closest to the classroom exhibited greatest concern about the quality of rural, small schools. Concerns varied across regions of the country, with educators from southeastern states having many concerns about the quality of their schools. About a third of all respondents shared high concern for student mastery of basic academic skills as well as foreign languages and fine/performing arts. Nearly half of the teachers desired better on-the-job training, while 36% of board presidents didn't consider staff development to be in need of improvement. (NEC)",

Functions that high schools can and should perform in rural economic development today include providing occupational training to meet immediate labor market needs, raising community educational attainment levels to meet long-term employment needs, creating new income generating opportunities, establishing an environment for innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving the general quality of life by being a family resource for education and a community resource for cultural activities/expertise. Case studies of rural schools in Georgia (Hartwell), Oklahoma (Byng), Tennessee (Shelbyville), and Missouri (Potosi) illustrate ways education can have an impact on a community's  economic climate. Education levels in each area were lower than the national average, per capita income was lower, and all but one area relied more heavily on manufacturing for employment than national norms. Factors common to the success of each program were forceful/energetic leadership; ability to raise needed funds; desire to improve community quality of life while preserving rural characteristics; community pride in, identification with, and support of the school; emphasis on small-scale rural features to create a distinctively nonmetropolitan program; and recognition of the economic value of the local school.

Responses from 1,585 randomly selected Iowa farm families showed that respondents opposed relaxing current state laws limiting foreign investors and non-farm corporations' ownership of farmland; had mixed feelings on absentee ownership, changing banking laws to allow banks to accept land as payment of debt, and organic farming research; and favored debt restructuring via the Harl-Leach proposal, changing the tax code on offsetting nonfarm income, and targeting price supports to smaller family farms. Opinions on 10 items in the 1985 Farm Bill varied widely (developing international markets and lowering interest rates ranked highest). There was moderate to strong support for federal government involvement in 10  areas (promoting international trade and insuring food quality/safety standards ranked highest). Sixty-eight percent supported reducing defense spending to reduce the federal budget deficit. Of nine recent technological developments, four were opposed by at least 20%. Two-thirds felt the financial situation of Iowa farmers was very serious, and voiced concern about local agribusiness, local lenders, and their own farms. Despite problems, farmers were generally satisfied with their occupation; 44% looked forward to retirement, 54% were planning for it, and 34% did not expect to ever retire. (JMM)",

This study of CBO's revealed significant relationships relative to the use of program services by 575 respondents randomly selected and surveyed via structured interviews in summer 1985. Data on above and below poverty level users of CBO's in rural and urban settings were analyzed. Employing the discriminant analysis technique, the study examined differences on selected dimensions of the human capital theory to assess the cumulative ability to differentiate the two groups. The results indicated that no statistically significant level was found in regard  to race. The characteristic profile of those who utilized CBO's reflected persons who tended to be retired or unemployed, female, and lacking a high level of educational attainment and additional training. The discriminant model revealed age and occupation were the important determinants for the usage of CBO's, followed by poverty level, additional job/skill training, and sex. The findings were supportive of previous research on traditional agency utilization. Concerning agency differences, the hypothesis that relevant regional differentials would emerge was not supported.

From 125 applicants, 38 were selected to attend the 2-week summer program on campus; 36 successfully completed the program. This 1986 study's objective was to determine whether participation in the ECIP had had a significant effect on participants' preparation for college and attitudes about college. The number of college preparatory courses taken,  the grade point average (GPA) for the college preparatory courses, and participants' attitudes about college were compared with the same measures for two 9th-grade control groups. Findings showed that although there were no significant differences at the .05 level between the groups in course selection or college planning, there was a significant difference at the .05 level in GPAs. Continuation of the program is warranted, and the study and evaluation are being used in development of future programs. (JMM)",

To accurately assess the small, rural school's impact on students, rural-urban comparisons must be made on students who are matched by origin, background, and access to information. Recent composite results find little difference in the academic achievement of rural and urban students or in their desire to attend college. A rural deficit model could be replaced by a rural strength model, for that is suggested by the fact that rural students do wish to attend college and make adequate grades there, notwithstanding  the fact that rural high school students have less total access to educational information. It could be argued that rural high school students are therefore, in terms of their overall progress, achieving more, not less. Twelve studies cited and discussed in this digest are listed at the end of the paper. (NEC)",

Background information was gathered on each community, and community leaders were asked a series of questions related to quality of life, the economy, leadership, and future planning. The information gathered was analyzed for characteristics in common across all communities and used to write community profiles. A synthesis of insights into community success led to development of a series of 20 possible clues to rural community survival. The clues include points such as evidence of community pride,  emphasis on quality in business and community life, careful use of fiscal resources, sophisticated use of information resources, willingness to seek help from the outside, and strong belief in and support for education. This report includes case studies of the five successful Nebraska communities (Broken Bow, Chadron, Eustis, Geneva, and Wausa) and an annotated list of the 20 clues to rural community survival.

Findings indicated empathy skills, conflict management, networking, coalition building, social action, linking clients to resources, collaborative skills, and the problem-solving process were used by both urban and rural professionals. Most social workers, both rural and urban, viewed clients as having a strong sense of family, strong religious beliefs, and extensive  family supports. Rural social workers saw their clients as less affected by the consumer culture. All social workers saw gaining access to existing resources as a major client problem, along with transportation, child care, inadequate housing, and lack of meaningful job opportunities. Urban professionals indicated their clients had greater access to medical care. Both groups expressed satisfaction with the community context of their work. Responses from 246 alumni of 8 university undergraduate social work programs revealed no significant differences between urban and rural practitioners on their use of the generalist practice skills.

Findings also indicated non-Native teachers more strongly preferred to teach from logically and clearly organized  materials than did Native teachers and Native teachers were more likely to encourage students to work independently. Although both Native and non-Native teachers were congruent on more than 65% of all instructional/learning components with all student groups, it was found that Native teachers were congruent with all student groups at a higher percentage and on a greater number of components than was true for non-Native teachers.

Eleven Likert-type items, designed to ascertain how these linkages are viewed, were included in the 1987 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll. Farmers' opinions were assessed on how much collaboration is desirable and the desired role of the private sector in selecting problems to be studied. The hypotheses were that economic hardship, scientific orientations, economic development perspectives, and personal sociodemographic characteristics would be important predictors. Findings showed that farmers generally supported stronger  university-industry linkages, and agreed that scientific research is determined by who can pay, rather than what is needed. Mixed opinions were held on how new discoveries should be made available, and whether the amount of private consulting by university scientists should be curtailed. The 11 attitudinal items factored into 4 scales with low reliability coefficients, in part due to the limited number of items in each factor. It was concluded that although farmers are generally supportive of university-industry linkages, it is too early to accurately predict whether future support will be sustained. (JMM)",

Data represent teacher and student perceptions of classroom practices, support services/facilities, commitment, and goal attainment. Results indicate high school teachers were generally less positive about their students, principals, inservice training opportunities, and expectations related to student learning than were elementary and middle school teachers. Middle school teachers were most positive. Approximately 20% of elementary teachers viewed items relating to school operation and administration negatively. Elementary teachers showed more positive attitudes  toward student learning, self-worth, acceptance of other cultures, and self-reliance than did secondary teachers. High school teachers appeared most willing to offer help to students with problems and viewed themselves as more open to alternate viewpoints on classroom subject matter than did their students. Elementary students and teachers viewed student-to-student and student-to-teacher interaction more favorably. Secondary students deemed peer relationships to be stronger. Elementary students reflected more positive images of teachers' enjoyment/willingness to work hard. Younger students viewed school work as important and school as a good place to be more than did secondary students.

The research supports the idea that writing can enhance a student's metacognitive ability. The results show that the journals served effectively in various capacities. Each student became actively involved in his or her own learning process. Writing forced the students to synthesize information and they became aware of what they did and did not know. They recognized their individual learning style and strengths and began to take advantage of those strengths. The journals served as a diagnostic tool for the instructor and they opened lines of communication between teacher and student and personalized the learning environment. The results of the  project suggest that this type of journal keeping would be effective in all disciplines but it is especially recommended that it be implemented throughout a mathematics department.

Group Y teachers were those who were trained by the Group X teachers and were using the materials during the 1986-1987 school year. Teachers of Group Z, the control group, were teaching similar classes from the same schools as teachers of Groups X and Y. A pretest was administered to all three groups in November, 1986. A March Test was administered to the two experimental groups. A May Test, posttest, was administered to all three  groups. In addition, teachers maintained daily logs of the amount of instructional time allocated to mathematics and the amount of instructional time allocated to the Quantitative Literacy materials. All teachers were requested to complete a questionnaire at the end of the study. The results indicate that using the Quantitative Literacy materials resulted in students learning approaches and techniques for describing data sets and means of computing probabilities.

The committee determined that state-level actions related to the increased availability of calculators and computers in the public schools are affecting the definition, delivery, and evaluation of K-12 mathematics in about half of the states. Due to the limited empowerment of many state educational agencies to actively promote curricular change, most actions have taken the form of model curriculum outlines, teaching guidelines, consultation, and information dissemination. A small number of states have: (1) sponsored teacher  inservice on the instructional applications of computers; (2) proposed the revision of certification standards for teachers of mathematics in order to ensure teacher competency in the use of calculators and computers in teaching mathematics; (3) mandated the use of calculators on statewide testing of secondary students; or (4) encouraged the use of calculators in instruction and testing. The use of calculators during classroom instruction is supported by 40 percent of the states. (PK)",

Collaborative research groups--including scientists and mathematicians, practicing teachers, learning theorists, and software designers--have focused on &quot;targets of difficulty,&quot; or curricular topics that are both crucial to students' further progress in these fields and widely recognized as difficult to teach and learn. More than 15 research projects have been completed to study the nature of students' difficulties, clarify the educational advantages that computer technology offers, and design experimental lessons that use computers as well as traditional materials to  address these difficult topics. Three research groups tried promising teaching units in five Massachusetts high schools to learn about their use in regular classrooms and schools. This monograph summarizes the results of the Educational Technology Center's work and their implications for policy makers, school practitioners, and others concerned about science and mathematics education. The findings of the research project fall into three categories: (1) teaching and learning; (2) technology; and (3) implementation. (PK)",

It is suggested that with little or no prior knowledge of Cartesian coordinates or analytic descriptions of graphs using equations students can successfully grasp concepts of change and rates of change as well as using multiple representations to convey their understandings. Through discussion of their solutions with each other, students also observe multiple solutions which generate debate and controversy. It is argued that having students write their own thoughts on a graphing problem will encourage further development of self-monitoring and metacognition. Diagrams are included. (PK)",

        "description":"When student achievement lags expectations, explanations are usually sought. One possibility is that the curriculum, as taught, is out of line with what is needed, and many feel that careful descriptions of the implemented curriculum are in short supply. Elementary school mathematics is used as a context for considering what can be learned from careful descriptions of classroom content and in what ways evaluating curricula and setting educational standards require exercising value judgments that extend beyond what is known empirically. Elementary school mathematics can be characterized as instruction, where large numbers of mathematics topics are taught for exposure with no expectation of student mastery, where much of what is taught in one grade is taught again in the next,  where skills typically receive ten times the emphasis given to either conceptual understanding or application, and where, depending upon the accidents of school and teacher assignment, the amount of mathematics instruction a student receives may be doubled or halved. While generally consistent with current curriculum policies, these attributes of the curriculum are seen as highly problematic in this document. (PK)",

The only antidote to prejudice, injustice, murder, and terrorism is to develop an understanding of the many different patterns of human life. However, western civilization and its educational systems have developed into fragmented forms, resulting in numerous unrelated disciplines that disregard an overall perspective and do not promote the solution of multifaceted problems. This book proposes the unification of all knowledge and offers ideas for educational systems that consider human problems and prepare persons to live in a complex world. The benefits of interdisciplinary education include the fostering of human understanding, the seeking of mutual efforts toward solutions for  human and social problems, and prevention of war. Factors involved in establishing successful interdisciplinary education programs include: (1) positive attitudes; (2) their emphasis and use by instructors; and (3) growth in the number of interdepartmental university seminars, programs, and research efforts.

        "description":"This summary describes the results of a survey that served as a needs assessment, preceding the development of a curriculum for both Arab and Jewish elementary schools in Israel. The curriculum's goals were to educate children to create interethnic contacts on a basis of mutual equality and respect for each other and their cultures. Previous attitudinal research, along with personal and intermediate culture contact studies, were described. This study tested the effect of direct contact with Jews on the attitudes of Arab children, as well as Arab children's readiness for contact with Jewish youth, and the effect of stereotypes on that readiness. The sample population included 268 seventh grade students in Arab schools located in two Arab villages, two Arab cities, and two cities  of mixed Arab and Jewish populations. Results indicated that: (1) previous contact did increase readiness for further social contacts, and programs that involve actual contacts between children from the two societies should be encouraged; (2) the designed curriculum should have special preparation activities for those Arab children who come from Arab settlements and do not have the required readiness for social contacts; and (3) curricula for interethnic groups should develop activities that stress direct contact, rather than the current emphasis which focuses on changing stereotypes.

Data for the study were extracted from the 1982 and 1985 &quot;Survey of Public Participation in the Arts.&quot; Research efforts were based upon the inference that geographic differences lead to inequalities in the supply of cultural opportunities, and this factor may outweigh differences in attitudes or values in relation to arts participation. Geographical factors relating to specific U.S. regions, subregions, and urban and metropolitan areas were investigated. Results indicated that: (1) arts participation did not increase in any region between 1982 and 1985; (2) the greatest variation in arts participation  exists in the south; (3) when demographic characteristics of a region are considered, regional differences are reduced; (4) supply and planning policies may account for high levels of participation in some metropolitan areas, while low participation may relate to poor transportation and parking facilities; (5) educational levels and number of adults who have never married are positive factors in metropolitan areas; and (6) social inequality has detrimental effects on the supply of and demand for art activities.

It examines: (1) their backgrounds and careers; (2) the rewards they receive from their work; (3) their expectations about future employment; (4) their training and their evaluation of it; and (5) their professional participation and attitudes on a number of management and policy issues. The study found that most administrators came from relatively privileged social backgrounds and were notably well educated. Administrators were initially recruited into their fields from various sources, many entering their fields immediately after completing their formal education. Arts administration careers lack  the formal structure of most professions. A lack of resources and other more subjective rewards may lead to attrition among some directors and administrators. Administrators in all four fields believe their preparation could have been much better. It appears that arts administration is a term that describes not a single profession, but a family of occupations, each with its own labor market. Arts organizations face challenges in recruiting and retaining talented administrators. (SM)",

Thirty percent live in California or New York compared to 18 percent of the general U.S.  population. California ranks first in artist population, a position held by New York in 1970. Artists continue to move to the western and southern regions of the United States, shown in the increased migration figures from 1975 to 1980. Fifteen data tables are included.

        "description":"The history of state government debt in North Dakota can be divided into three 30-year periods which should be interpreted in terms of the political, social, and economic conditions of each period. The early statehood period of 1889-1918 began with the use of debt to construct facilities necessary to carry out the normal functions of state government. Although total expenditures increased because of tremendous population growth, per capita expenditures declined significantly. During the second period (1919-1949), population continued to grow but at a decreasing rate. Farmers' organizations were successful in having laws passed to regulate railroads, elevators, mills, and grain dealers. During the Depression years, debt grew, and North Dakota's bond rating was lowered. During  World War II, state debt was reduced without undue strain on the taxpayer. The third period (1950-1978) saw prosperity and public construction. Data were analyzed and indicated: (1) regionalization of bond ratings and debt outstanding; (2) differences and similarities among economic variables within the North Central Region of the United States; (3) North Dakota in the North Central Region; and (4) determinants of the amount of state debt outstanding.

Political images are intimately linked to the definition of the issue and may have profound long-term impact. The use of content analysis in research on political imagery is useful as a supplement to conventional research methods focusing on policy arguments. Washington PressText is a computer readable database which provides the full text of White House and United States Department of State news releases, policy statements,  background information, and comprehensive coverage of all major domestic and international news. This paper details how PressText may be accessed through DIALOG, and how the information captured may then be analyzed by a content analysis system for microcomputers (e.g., the software package WordCruncher).

        "description":"Contrasting a party identification model with a rational decision making model, a cognitive model predicts voter intent on two referenda: (1) an amendment to permit a state lottery; and (2) an amendment to permit residents of each county to vote on whether to permit casino gambling. Supporters of the lottery amendment attempt to strongly link it to a highly salient social issue, such as the funding of education. Opponents of the casino amendment attempt to link it to the highly salient issue of crime. The party identification model predicts that voters will follow party cues in their support or opposition to each of the amendments. The cognitive linking model predicts that those voters who link the amendments to salient social issues will be more likely to support the lottery  amendment and oppose the casino amendment than will those voters who do not make these links. An integrated processing model suggests, in the absence of these links, that the voter is likely to adopt the rational choice perspective and consistently support or oppose both amendments because they are a form of gambling based on the voter's previous rational choices. No support is found for party identification as predicting voter choice. Support is found for the cognitive linking model, and the rational choice model predicts the voting intent of about 79 percent of those who do not make the cognitive links between the referenda and the other salient social issues.

Videotaped home interactions were coded according to the modalities in which interactions took place. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were found between the social interaction patterns of the normal and deaf blind Ss. The two groups tended not only to respond to different categories of behaviors, but also with different categories. Normal Ss were more likely to respond than deaf blind Ss and were more predictable in their interactive responses and in their  affect. Deaf blind Ss were less responsive, less predictable, and generally less interactive. The two groups of mothers differed in their overall use of change and repetition. Mothers of deaf blind Ss used kinesthetic responses proportionately more and the verbal/vocal category less, and were less active overall than were mothers of normal Ss. However, in relation to their children, mothers of deaf blind Ss were proportionately more active, engaging in twice as many interactive behaviors as the children. The complex nature of interactions is stressed, as is the difficulty of interpreting differences between populations of dyads. (CL)",

New Danish laws about services for handicapped people and their implications for such aspects as normalization, decentralization, and integration are reviewed and evaluated. Planning procedures for Danish special education are noted, as are the status of preschool special education and the types of services available to parents of handicapped children. Aspects of special education school services, such as reorganization, referral, and teacher education are covered. A section on special education for adults focuses on such matters as continued education, occupational preparedness, and recreational  programs. A checklist for an overall rehabilitation program is provided. The monograph concludes with five commentaries: &quot;Special Education and Vocational Rehabilitation&quot; (D. Brolin); &quot;Special Education in Denmark and the United States&quot; (H. Jacoby-Blanchard); &quot;Implementing P.L. 94-142&quot; (P.

        "description":"The research on which this study is based found that 50% of the errors in English of French-speaking students were due to interlingual causes and 50% had their source within the target language itself. The question of a correlation between the errors and the teaching method used is explored. Five methods are discussed and evaluated: grammar-translation, direct, audiolingual, transformational grammar, and cognitive code. In each case, a correlation is made of the method with varieties and frequency of errors, and the value of elements of the method is noted. Other pedagogical implications are drawn from the study of the frequency of errors for fifteen types of errors, chosen as representatives of important classes of grammar or as general trouble makers. Rank-ordered lists are  provided as well as tables and graphs illustrating the relative frequency of the errors. Some of the conclusions are that negative transfer is an important source of errors and that, with regard to intralingual errors, overgeneralization seems to be the most common cause. To reduce errors of all types and promote communication and fluency, an eclectic method is suggested. It is also noted that some errors persist on all levels even after many years of study. (AMH)",

        "description":"Sentences produced by children and adults in telling stories are analyzed, with particular emphasis on developmental trends in sentence length, the degree of cohesion between clauses, and the internal coherence of sentence content. Subjects for the study were 10 adults and 60 Japanese children in six different age groups. Each subject was interviewed individually by two women, one eliciting the narratives and the other serving as listener. Two types of material were used to elicit narratives: a set of picture cartoons depicting short stories, and a seven-minute videotape, which was a segment from a popular television series. In general, the task that required telling the story depicted by the cartoons proved easier than narrating the video segment from memory. Only seven of the  children under five years of age were able to produce enough narration about the videotape to include their stories in the analysis. Two aspects of the findings are isolated for special comment: (1) the nature of the adult model for sentence formation and variations in consistency used in marking narrative units with sentence boundaries, and the use of conjunctions; and (2) the way in which the development of sentences in narratives by children mirrors the acquisition of sentences in conversation at an earlier stage of language development.

Research in the psychology of language is reviewed with regard to these issues and with particular reference to the situation in Quebec. The first question addressed is the role that attitudes play both as determiners of the rate of acquisition of a second or foreign language and as outcome effects attributable to the degree of skill or lack of skill attained in the study of the other language. A second issue is the unfairness in educational systems and the connection with language styles and attitudes. The third topic addressed is the decline in interest in the study of foreign languages and the widespread immigration of speakers of  other languages. A plan is proposed for sharing languages in the community rather than concentrating on language instruction in the schools. Finally, the demand for social and political independence on the part of cultural and linguistic minorities is looked at in relation to native and second language instruction. One conclusion is that those involved with the psychology of language need to turn their attention to broad sociopolitical issues that impinge on language in society. (AMH)",

The discussion involves the extent and quality of bilingualism in the Canadian population, bilingualism and biculturalism, the role and function of translation in an officially bilingual country, and reflection on the nature of the translation act. After an introductory review of the history of the French language and sociolinguistic geography in Canada, the discussion moves to the distinction one must make between institutional bilingualism  and biculturalism on the one hand, and individual bilingualism on the other. A third chapter analyzes the scope and role of French translations in the socioeconomic and political life of Canada. Finally, the study attempts a theoretical and practical analysis of the role and nature of both oral and written translation. By way of conclusion, the findings of each chapter are synthesized in order to define the relationship which should link translation to other forms of bilingualism. (AMH)",

In the community under investigation, code-switching is an integral part of the communicative repertoire; also, the codes tend to be switched at points around which the surface structures of Spanish and English map onto each other. It is hypothesized, therefore, that Puerto Rican Spanish verb usage is being reinterpreted on the model of English. Standard Spanish and English verbal systems are compared, with particular attention to those areas where the two systems differ. The informants were 12 long-term residents of El Barrio in East Harlem, New York. Six were Spanish-dominant and six, English-dominant. Comparative data were also collected from&quot;prestige&quot; Spanish speakers, as well as from 15th century Spanish, modern Andalusian Spanish, and English. Systematic quantitative analysis revealed that: (1) an overwhelming stability exists in the systems of tense, mood, and aspect in Puerto Rican Spanish spoken in the United States; and (2) the relative importance of the various verb forms has remained basically unchanged in Spanish since the 15th century.

Children's ways of speaking were examined and aspects of their sociolinguistic competence and incompetence were identified. Speech samples were examined in the following categories: setting or scene, participants, ends or goals, act sequences, key or tone, instrumentalities,  norms of interaction, and genres. The competencies discovered included the ability to vary artfully the components of \"Ways of Speaking\" in order to accomplish a range of personal purposes and awareness of regularities in classroom language. The problems in acculturation had to do with requisite norms of interaction, participant role as unintended hearers when the teacher addressed remarks to a subgroup, and sometimes attracting and maintaining interest of their audience.

Judges from four Portuguese-speaking ethnic groups listened to a series of tape recordings of eight speakers of Portuguese reading a standard passage. The speakers represented Continental, Brazilian, Capeverdean, and Azorean speakers; half were college educated and half had a fourth grade education. Personality characteristics of each speaker were evaluated from voice and speech clues. The data provided evidence that judges recognized ethnic educational, and social class differences.  Noneducated speakers were generally rated lower than their educated counterparts. Capeverdean and Azorean speakers were given a low rating by judges from these ethnic groups.

These considerations are addressed in five sections: (1) student identification; (2) program offerings (K-12); (3) staffing; (4) prevention of programmatic discriminatory practices; and (5) evaluation. The first section describes and gives examples of a home language survey, methods of identifying students, language proficiency and student achievement, and a classification of Lau Students. The second section discusses programs for various categories of students with limited English proficiency, individualized learning programs,  factors triggering comprehensive bilingual programs, and special education concerns. The third section deals with instructional personnel requirements, staff development, and affirmative action. The fourth section on discriminatory practices includes communication with parents and parent involvement. Finally, evaluation is discussed in terms of educational context, content, process, and product. (AMH)",

        "description":"This paper attempts to integrate the results of the ethnographic and attitudinal components of a broader study into a specifically sociolinguistic analysis. While a variety of opinions can be found in the literature on code-switching, the contention here is that code-switching is a norm in specific speech situations that exist in stable bilingual communities. Satisfaction of this norm requires more linguistic competence in two languages than has heretofore been noted. The code-switching behavior of 20 Puerto Ricans from 102nd Street in New York City, who had varying degrees of reported and observed bilingual ability, was observed and described. The quantitative analyses are based on recorded speech data in both interview and natural settings. The analysis deals with linguistic  questions concerning the surface configuration of the switch, and with the code-switchers themselves. A finding considered to be crucial is that there are virtually no ungrammatical conbinations of the two languages in the 1,835 switches studied, regardless of the bilingual ability of the speaker. It is also shown that switch types traditionally considered most deviant, those switches occurring within a single sentence, are the ones requiring most skill. They tend to be produced by the &quot;true&quot; bilinguals in the sample. (AMH)",

        "description":"Bilingual programs and the socio-cultural circumstances surrounding the programs of the United States are compared with the programs and socio-cultural circumstances of three Latin American countries: Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. The legal frameworks are different. In the United States, bilingual education acts and subsequent programs came as a result of legal challenges by private citizens. In contrast to this, in Latin America the institutionalization of bilingual education programs began with the incentive of the national governments. There are differences in administration, goals, relative status of the languages involved, relative distribution of monolingual and bilingual populations, and cultural-historical backgrounds. In the United States a large number of different social  processes are reflected in the various bilingual situations, while in the Latin American case, two historical factors are dominant. These differences mean that the socio-cultural attitudes that members of language communities have toward other languages and their use are an important factor in the stance toward bilingual education programs. Implications are discussed in terms of the final linguistic state of the societies in question and the degree of mutual versus unidirectional influence of the languages involved. (AMH)",

The objective of the research was twofold: (1) to analyze the language use and behavior of the employees; and (2) to develop research instruments appropriate for evaluating the language situation of a business, and for measuring the success of programs whose objective is a modification of language usage. Two businesses were chosen in the food distribution industry; the personnel represented a mix of francophones, anglophones, and italophones. Data were gathered by a chart for noting observations of oral communication in work situations, an attitude questionnaire regarding French and English usage, and role  plays. The sample was made up of 367 persons, both male and female, of whom the majority were French-speaking. One finding is cited as particularly notable, namely that the employees' principal concern was to maintain good interpersonal relations. This concern is evident in the willingness to use the language of their interlocutor. The description of the research is accompanied by nine appendices containing samples of the research instruments and analyses, as well as numerous figures, charts, and tables. (AMH)",

Its objectives are threefold: (1) to help the service providers better understand the refugee as an individual; (2) to add to the knowledge of how to provide culturally-appropriate services and support for the needs of newly arrived refugees as well as of those who have been in this country for several years; and (3) to help service providers identify the kinds of support the refugee needs to maintain and develop personal, intellectual, and emotional resources for further social adaptation. The material is presented in five sections. Part 1 deals with culture, social adaptation, and culture shock. The second part discusses issues of adjustment, refugees' expectations,  changes in the support system, cultural conflicts, and community changes. Part 3 deals with principal values in the mainstream American culture and major pressure points. Part 4 treats support systems in most refugees' native lands and the task of rebuilding the support system in the United States.

        "description":"The federally funded Special Services for Disadvantaged Students (SSDS) program is examined for the 1979-80 academic year in 58 institutions; the program's short-term impact on participating freshmen is summarized. Up to 200 students at each site were studied to determine whether program participation levels correlated with outcomes and whether student background was related to the levels of services received. After an overview and a review of the study methodology, Chapter 3 discusses the SSDS program in terms of federal regulations, reauthorization, budgeting, funding, and monitoring. In Chapter 4 the program's context, history, resources, and administrative procedures are examined. Chapter 5 covers the interactions between programs and institutions, followed in Chapter 6 by an  overview of services. The characteristics of eligible students and their relationships to services rendered are addressed in Chapter 7. Among the conclusions are: (1) SSDS services are focused, as intended, on economically and educationally deprived students; (2) SSDS students are more likely to last through freshman year than students not receiving SSDS services; (3) most project directors are experienced and usually members of a minority group; (4) the average project has 414 participating students; (5) students having larger amounts of monetary aid tend to have higher levels of persistence; (6) students whose parents had higher incomes tend to take and complete more courses and to receive higher grades; and (7) students receiving more services are likely to complete more courses.  Extensive tables, figures, and appendices are provided, giving data on percentages of students and faculty by race, staff turnover rate, administrators' perception of SSDS academic credibility, etc. (LC)",

        "description":"The decision to create Great Britain's Open University and stages in the preparation of higher education reforms are considered. The current position of the Open University in relation to its original goals is also addressed, and the policy implementation process is examined to determine why the Open University achieved some of its original goals but not others. Attention is directed to the initial proposal for a University of the Air, and of nationally organized correspondence college courses, the advisory committee stage, the planning committee stage, the reaction of others to the proposed reform, factors underlying the survival of the proposed reform, and goal changes during the policy formulation stage. Five types of goals are distinguished: the intended students, the  curriculum, teaching methods, the organizational framework, academic standards, the size and cost of the new institution. It is suggested that the present Open University is very similar to that proposed by the planning committee in terms of teaching methods, curriculum, and organizational framework. However, the university has met with only limited success in terms of creating genuine equality of opportunity. It has largely failed to achieve the informal goal of attracting large numbers of working class students. The first students were offered places in September 1970, and 24,200 began their studies in January 1979. In the first year foundation courses were offered in arts, social science, math and science, and technology was added in 1972. Higher level courses were later offered,  together with courses in educational studies. Statistical data, an organizational chart, and a bibliography are appended. (SW)",

Harry Hienemann considers the history of cooperative education, the evaluation of outcomes integrating classroom and work experience, and mandatory cooperative education at Laguardia Community College, New York. What is known about the educational effects and economic consequences of programs that recognize prior learning is reviewed by Alan P. Wagner. Solomon Arbeiter examines a model that can be used to evaluate students in programs recognizing prior  learning, as well as the award of credit or advanced standing. Douglas M. Windham evaluates the economic effects of recognizing prior learning and considers the implications for institutional policy. The nature and value of relevant work experience in the education of primary school teachers is considered by Hannu Perha, followed by Staffan Larsson's review of five qualitatively different conceptions of experience as viewed by teachers. Maureen L. Pope suggests that a cultural transmission approach to teaching and knowledge dominates science education and that this has neglected the role of personal experience in the construction of knowledge. Erich Leitner examines the implications of cooperation between the University of Klagenfurt, Austria, and the Austrian Workers Union. Implications  for the university pertain to the philosophy of higher education and innovations. (SW)",

A total of 701 enrolled students and those who left before graduation were surveyed at a primarily residential private liberal arts college and at a primarily commuter state-supported liberal arts college. It was found that first-generation students approach the college experience with about the same degree of normative congruence as second-generation students with regard to their expectations. They value higher education for the intellectual growth and for the career preparation they anticipate receiving. In respect to a second aspect of social integration, structural or affiliational integration, first-generation  students were at a disadvantage in comparison to the students whose parents had significant experience with the college or university setting. First-generation students suffer from a lower level of structural integration since they are less likely to live on campus, be involved in campus organizations, meet or pursue their most important friendships on campus, or work on campus. As for academic integration, first-generation students appear to have equally high aspirations regarding level of education they expect to attain, but those who withdraw are not as strongly convinced that college is the only or best route to life success. First-generation students appear to have lower congruity between their values toward education and their parents' values; receive less support of all types from  their parents; and have heavier job loads. These factors increase their vulnerability to attrition. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The 68 respondents were interviewed regarding the perceived impact of the course on the instructor, the institution, the community, and students. The faculty members reported that teaching an experience-based course has helped them acquire certain facilitative techniques for counseling or group discussion and also develop some community-related skills, such as recruiting and monitoring field placements. Instructors received few tangible rewards or incentives for teaching the course, but felt they derived more personal satisfaction than from their other courses. All teachers intended to  continue teaching their experience-based courses and some planned to expand their effort by increasing the enrollment, expanding the scope of the course, or by adding new field sites. The students reportedly acquired a variety of process-related and task-specific skills that helped them synthesize their prior learning and relate it to practical applications at the workplace. The experience-based course also helped students develop their interpersonal skills, gain self-confidence, and develop a professional manner. The field component gave students the opportunity to make contracts in community agencies and to refine their career focus. Some students received jobs as a result of their field placement, and the course also helped some student decide against entering a chosen profession.  (Author/SW)",

The open-ended responses of 65 instructors regarding skills required to teach the course tended to cluster under: subject matter expertise, developing community contact, interpersonal skills, learning facilitation techniques, and real-world experience. Responses of 51 instructors concerning faculty attitudes were varied but suggest that interpersonal skills, willingness to work with field site personnel, possession of a number of learning  facilitation techniques (for both groups and individuals), and a philosophical commitment to the use of community-based experiences are important prerequisites to successful programs. The problems cited by 55 instructors were both personal and institutional. Although a wide range of problems was mentioned, time involved in performing the various tasks associated with community-based activities was the most frequently mentioned problem. A departmental philosophy that emphasized research over teaching or that viewed classroom learning as more valuable was cited as a problem. Instructors also reported that courses undergo many changes in response to outside factors, including community opportunities and student needs. (SW)",

A comprehensive marketing plan includes market research, positioning, strategy formulation; recruitment/admission, communications, curriculum evaluation, retention, and evaluation. Good marketing begins with determining a market position; that is, differentiating what an institution offers in relation to other institutions. To arrive at a market position an institution must define its mission, philosophy, and goals. Differentiated marketing, or market segmentation, calls for identifying various markets or submarkets and targeting communication to each one. Although enrollment forecasts and projects are difficult, an  institution must have a reasonably accurate estimate of how many students will enroll in order to accurately plan budgets, faculty, programs, and facilities. Marketing, as a communications process, goes beyond promotion and advertising. It involves assessing the needs and interests of potential students and promoting the programs. Parents have a significant influence on the choice of a college. Contacts, such as current students, alumni, college staff, high school counselors and teachers, are not equally effective in their recruitment efforts. Financial aid information and the way financial aid is packaged need to be assessed. In addition, student retention is a vital part of marketing, and an institution needs to research the reasons its students withdraw. A market audit or evaluation  will help an institution review its policies, practices, and procedures in marketing. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The impact of microcomputers is assessed, as is the extent to which computer science and literacy are increasing in other countries. It is suggested that given the continuing success of computer literacy at the elementary and secondary levels, computer literacy in higher education could, in time, acquire the status of a basic skill. Curricular concerns include the advantages and disadvantages of computer assisted instruction (CAI), the relationship of microcomputers to CAI, and who should be computer literate. According to  the literature, computer literacy is intended for everyone, and the literacy level that is effective at one institution may be inappropriate at another, although common characteristics are indicated. Important administrative considerations are the issues of facilities planning, the acquisition of computer literate faculty and staff, and the cost of providing literacy to students, faculty, and administrators. In brief, the relationships among goals of students, faculty, and staff members and the relationship of these goals to resource support are determining factors in the planning, development, and implementation of computer literacy programs. Issues and problems of national scope that require national strategies for their resolution include: networks, national databases, federal support  of computer education, national cooperation and coordination, and international competition.

Four channels exist through which American students can arrange placement in China: national competition, institution-to-institution links, individual application (either to a Chinese university or the Ministry of Education), and short-term study programs packaged in the United States. Somewhere between 70 and 100 formal exchange agreements to facilitate the sharing of academic resources have been concluded between U.S. and Chinese institutions. A list of American institutions reporting such agreements is appended. Data  are presented on the distribution of American students at Chinese universities during the 1980-81 academic year (excluding short-term language programs). In all the arrangements (except for the summer language programs), the majority of those going to China are American graduate students who are either taking coursework or doing dissertation research. Several small groups of undergraduates participate during the academic year, mainly in language programs. A summary is presented on general curricula, language classes, research difficulties, and field research. In addition, the following concerns are addressed: socializing with Chinese, housing, travel, supervision of students, university administration, credit and grading, and summer language programs. Appended materials include:  U.S.-Chinese Institutional agreements, summer language programs in China, and a bibliography on U.S-China educational exchange. (SW)",

Some common characteristics of the Central American countries are described. The percentage who attend secondary school in Central America varies from as low as 4 percent to as high as 15 percent. All Central American state universities are autonomous; however, the tradition of autonomy is not firmly established in all countries. All of these Central American countries are bringing into their curricula the concept of general education, or general studies, but the concept of general studies is meeting with varied reactions from students as well as faculties.

Based on the literature, it is suggested that: indirect as well as direct costs need to be measured; cost has both fixed and variable elements in relation to the number of students or faculty in an academic unit; in some analytical models, the revenue attributable to an academic unit is measured; costs per student, per full-time equivalent faculty, and per class are measures of unit cost; level of study, method  of instruction, and other factors are used to weight data about cost per student; the expected cost of an academic unit may be measured by determining its level of average faculty support and workload; and financial measures may yield important information, but the use of the information still requires discretion. Accounting for revenues of academic units is not as well developed as accounting for costs. Where actual revenue attributable to a unit is not available in the accounts, some form of allocation system is used. Mathematical models, such as trend line analysis and the cohort-survival technique offer means for projecting future enrollment and consequently revenue and expenditures that vary according to enrollment. Relating cost to quality, or fiscal efficiency to program  effectiveness may result in misuses of quantitative data. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

It is suggested that the fact that private industry has moved into the degree-granting arena, even to a small extent, may indicate that higher education needs to be more responsive to the business sector. Corporate education differs from higher education in that it tends to serve primarily institutional needs rather than personal needs, is characterized by unusually high motivation of participants, the workplace is the setting for learning and doing, and it has a pragmatic orientation. However, despite some fundamental differences in purpose and orientation, corporate education centers sometimes bear a striking resemblance to traditional  colleges and universities. A corporation may be better able to accommodate rapidly changing knowledge requirements by conducting its own education program rather than attempting to work through a college or university. Corporations and institutions of higher education are involved in numerous partnership activities ranging from national projects to individual collegiate/corporate efforts. However, higher education may have to institute significant changes in its structure and develop additional nontraditional delivery systems if it is to serve the educational needs of the business sector. Colleges and universities must become more sensitive to the manpower needs of industry and must carefully evaluate their ability to respond to these needs in a way that is consistent with their  institutional mission. Higher education needs more flexibility and adaptability in course and program approval, missions procedures, residency requirements, and course and program duration. (SW)",

        "description":"Perry's theory of intellectual and ethical development of college students is briefly reviewed. This theory was based on work with Harvard University students, and addresses dualism, multiplicity, and relativism. In the first stage, a student sees the world in right-wrong, black-white terms, with no room in the thinking process for conditional or contextual reasoning. The assumption of the dualist is that all knowledge is known, that authority knows it all, and that it is up to authority to give the student the right answer. Multiplicity represents a significant broadening of the student's understanding: the student begins to realize that there might be more than one right answer or way of looking at some things. The view of authority is that in areas where there are several  right answers, authority has not found the right answer yet, but will eventually; in other areas, authority will have the answer. Multiplistic students are still not able to weigh one perspective against another, or to see the relative merit of one perspective versus another. As students move into relativism, a fundamental shift in thinking takes place. They realize that in many areas there are no right answers and are now capable of thinking in relativistic or contextual terms. Relationship to authority changes significantly during relativism as students begin to realize that professors think that way too, and although students still look to authority for guidance they see that they themselves can reason too. Later, through a sense of identity and a series of commitments, the student is  able to make sense out of reality that was so elusive during relativism. (SW)",

The social support networks of both sexes included friends, relatives, and significant others of the opposite sex (i.e., boy or girl  friend or spouse). The females appeared to be experiencing more changes, more depression, and less general well-being than the males. About half of the females and half of the males review material for examinations by themselves without talking over confusing material with others. None of the people that the males speak to when anxious are females. It is hypothesized that increased life events may cause the more adaptive people to seek out additional help, and this help may result in measures of increased social support. The fact that the women relied more on other physicians than their male counterparts may confer an advantage on women in their overall short-term adaptation. It could be that this factor counters the potential negative impact of lowered well-being and depression. A  bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The following statistical analyses were performed: (1) correlations among 24 quantitative variables; (2) multiple regression with National Boards Average Part I and Part II as dependent variables and nine independent variables; (3) contingency tables relating location of residency and type of practice with hometown and age at matriculation; and (4) logistic multiple regression with location of residency and type of practice as dependent variables and eight  independent variables. Predictor variables included undergraduate grade point average (GPA), the four subtests of the Medical College Admission Test, age at matriculation, Biennium 1 GPA, clinical clerkship GPA, cumulative GPA, and 15 National Board scores. It is suggested that the results are valuable to the program evaluation and development efforts of a new medical school. The findings are pertinent for one class at one time period.

        "description":"The applicability of Rosch and coworkers' concept of prototypes to the mental categorization of medical disorders, and the influence of clinical experience on those memory structures were studied with 100 preclinical medical students and 77 experienced physicians from Quebec, Canada. The third-year medical students were French-speaking and read English, and the physicians had 2 to 28 years of experience and practiced in predominantly French-speaking communities. Four experiments based on the Rosch (1975) research strategy were conducted to form a logical and converging sequence of evidence about the internal structure of 14 categories of medical disorders. The experiments investigated category norms, prototypicality ratings, family resemblance, and response time. It was found  that the mental representation of the categories was better described by the overlapping feature of the prototype view of categorization than the criterial features of the deterministic view. Overall, the disorders with the highest prototypicality ratings were recalled earlier in a free-recall task than were the less prototypical ones; the higher the mean prototypicality rating of an item, the higher the mean family resemblance score. It took about one-half less time for students and one-third less time for physicians to judge category membership of central disorders as opposed to peripheral ones. Additionally, clinical experience did affect the internal structure of the categories: physicians used a narrower range of points on the prototypicality rating scales. It is suggested that  prototypes are valuable in describing the internal structure of medical categories. (SW)",

Twenty-four academic indicators of success or difficulty, primarily examination scores or clerkship evaluations, and 10 other indicators of progress toward graduation were assessed by 23 faculty and 43 medical students. In general, the examination-related indicators were estimated to have similar importance by the students and the faculty. Students placed their major emphasis on passing the major examinations, while faculty gave equal value to evidence of academic excellence (e.g., high scores, publishing a paper, presenting one's own research), and evidence of participation in academic or professional organizations. It is suggested  that these differences probably reflect the different career orientations of the faculty and students. Greater relative importance was placed on the negative indicators than the positive ones. Three items for which the faculty responded less homogeneously than did students were \"attempted suicide,\"\"sought psychiatric help,\" and \"sought short-term counseling.\" Students perceived these three indicators more negatively than did faculty. The implications for academic advising of students' career orientation and attitudes toward grades are briefly addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"The budget decision making process at Stanford University, California, from 1970 through 1979 was evaluated in relation to the allocation of general funds to 38 academic departments. Using Simon's theory of bounded rationality and an organizational level of analysis, the Stanford decision process was tested for its rationality through triangulation, mixing qualitative and quantitative methods. The elements that must be present for rational decision making required that the provost who directed Stanford's budget process must have had a consistent set of budget allocation priorities throughout the decade; that he considered a wide range of expenditure alternatives simultaneously rather than sequentially; that he made budget decisions himself, with information about the likely  effects and costs of each request; and that his choices were consistent with his prior goals. It is suggested that the provost considered the following four priorities to guide his decisions about allocating general funds in the operating budgets: academic importance, student interest, possibility for excellence in the program, and funding potential. The number of alternative expenditure requests considered by the provost is documented, and the evidence indicates that he made simultaneous decisions. Content analysis of the rationales for expenditure requests is evaluated along with a regression equation to determine whether the provosts made choices consistent with prior goals. Although the results suggest that the process was rational, the decision processes probably conform to more than  one theoretical model. In addition, the decision process and decision outcome may be independent, so that one cannot be predicted from the other. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"In an examination of the meaning and measurement of quality in the undergraduate experience, quality is compared with the conceptually similar but distinct concepts of adequacy and excellence. Most of the conceptual frameworks available for assessing quality are essentially unidimensional assessment strategies that rely almost exclusively on quantitative indicators such as student ability or library resources. The most popular multidimensional approach to assessing quality is the input-environment-output model. A redefinition of Stufflebeam's et al. planning and evaluation model includes: context, input, involvement, and outcome. Using these categories, the opinion and empirical research related to quality were reviewed to assess indices of quality. Quantitative quality  assessment usually focuses on institutional factors about which objective, standardized measures are available or can be collected, and produce data that (1) can be used for both intra- and interinstitutional comparisons; (2) are amenable to computer-assisted analytic procedures; and (3) are compatible with the psychometric paradigm. For qualitative quality assessments, manifestations such as students' reports of satisfaction with various aspects of the institution or observations of students' involvement in the classroom or other activities are primary data sources. Holistic quality assessments are concerned with: the purpose of the target programs, information about involvement and outcomes of college attendance, an action-orientation, multiple forms of data-gathering, a public and  educative function, and a value orientation.

Approximately 1,150 students in nine major doctoral-granting universities participated. Based on work by Bengtson (1975), a humanism/materialism score was constructed for each professional student by summing scores for respect or recognition, attractive appearance, financial comfort, possessions, sense of accomplishment and skill, and by subtracting scores for a world at peace, service, and ethical life. Collectivism/individualism scores were constructed by summing scores for an exciting life and personal freedom and by subtracting scores for religious participation, loyalty to one's own, and patriotism.  Three groups of students were distinguished: full-fledged professions (law and medicine); semi-professions (education, nursing, social work, and librarianship); and private enterprise professions (engineering and business administration). The private enterprise professional student scored on the humanist end of the continuum, whereas full-fledged and semi-professional students scored on the materialist end. The full-fledged professional students were relatively collectivist while the semi- and private enterprise students appeared more individualist. Members of the semi-professions appeared to be relatively materialist and individualist. There was no evidence of systematic differences in value orientations of professional student as they progress through their preparatory programs. It is  suggested that the findings challenge some popular beliefs about professionals and professional students. A value ranking questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Single- and double-loop organizational learning are discussed in the context of higher education retrenchment. A model of the research university illuminates impediments to internal resource reallocation, program elimination, and integrative leadership, and suggests the need for alternatives to usual efforts to increase efficiency while retaining existing norms, goals, and organizational structures. It is suggested that if planning is done solely in terms of present images and structures, the planning may or may not be appropriate. If all that is needed is greater efficiency, then single-loop learning is feasible and adequate. Using existing images and norms for planning will not be useful in those cases in which the adaptive course of action requires changing the basic premises.  There is also a larger context within which one can discuss both single- and double-loop learning. It is suggested that if one is in a position to consider various alternatives, it would not imply change for the sake of change, but might avoid hasty reaction to crisis. It is proposed that the university president has limited influence on the institution's research or educational missions. The ultimate test of an institution's responses to retrenchment is the achievement of equilibrium between its functional activities and the external environment. When there is equilibrium, single-loop organizational learning is sufficient but when an institution faces dilemmas, double-loop learning is needed for survival. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

Eighty-six percent of GC students, 87 percent of the university counselors, and 63 percent of high school counselors rated GC as very important. Seventy-seven percent of GC students said that they would attend GC again if they had it to do over; reasons for this view included the supportive environment, specific GC programs or courses, the use of GC as a stepping stone to other colleges, and the openness of GC to students with poor scholastic records or inadequate backgrounds. Despite the basically positive views toward the college, 44 percent of GC students said that GC has a negative reputation on campus, and  59 percent said that others looked down on GC students. While most students in the other colleges said that they personally saw GC as fairly or very important, they also concurred that most students on campus look down on GC students and that GC has a negative reputation. Faculty tended to be less certain than were the students about the negative reputation of GC on campus, and generally assigned somewhat lower ratings concerning the importance of GC than did the students. All surveyed groups except GC students, saw GC students as having less academic ability than other university students. Both groups of counselors tended to be positive toward GC and to see it as having a distinctive and important role; many respondents commented on the need for more informational and public relations  efforts from GC.

Responses from 1,236 riders indicated support for the concept of accessible transit and satisfaction with the current service. Both disabled and nondisabled gave relatively high marks to the current service. Ten percent or fewer said that the routes, the number of buses, the comfort, the number of stops, and the ease of getting on and off the buses needed improvement. Many of the 63 people with physical disabilities who were riding the buses on the day of the survey were not only positive toward the service, but reported that the  service had benefited them in several ways. Most said that the service had saved them energy and effort, and had made them less likely to be late for classes. Approximately a third said that the service had expanded the range of alternatives they would consider taking, or had already allowed them to take courses that they could not have taken otherwise. Ninety-four percent of respondents said that the special bus service should be continued or expanded. Most riders knew that they were riding a specially equipped bus, although about one in six did not. About 80 percent of all riders had ridden on the adapted buses at least once in the previous week. Those with disabilities were more likely to have ridden five to eight times in the past week (30 percent) than were those without disabilities  (15 percent). The questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

Views on the way which vet centers are being used, the effectiveness of the centers, and ways in which the service provision of the centers can be improved are presented by representatives of a VA Medical Center, various Vet Centers, veterans associations, and individuals. Stephen B. Levenberg suggests that (1) the Vet Center program use a novel concept in mental health treatment by using trained survivors of a trauma to treat other victims of the same trauma, and (2) that the diagnostic entity of post-traumatic stress disorder did not exist until 1980. Wyche Fowler notes  that a large part of the suffering of Vietnam veterans is not only from war experiences but also from the lack of reception they received when they came home. Harry Doughty notes some symptoms that occurred in Vietnam veterans, including the inability to conform to stateside duty, a lack of respect for superiors, marital problems, alcohol and drug abuse, and feelings of isolation. He suggests that not recognizing the Vietnam experience and its impact on the youthful soldiers resulted in alienation among some veterans. However, the Vet Centers have provided veterans with a sense of caring about them as individuals. He suggests that Vet Centers should remain autonomous and outside the VA medical centers. Joseph Gelsomino suggests that in addition to readjustment counseling for the Vietnam  veterans, community sensitization to the plight of the veterans had been a part of the whole process. Additional testimonies are presented. (SW)",

Given the long-term contractual obligations of colleges and universities to individuals and the significant size of personnel budgets, institutional administrators often have little choice in the short-term in determining the object of cutbacks. Some of these approaches may include using fund balances; reducing expenditures for such items as equipment, travel, and telephones; cutting energy costs, curtailing library expenditures, and reducing expenditures for secretarial help; deferring  maintenance efforts, reducing course offerings, student services and counseling; and hiring freezes. However, these short-term solutions cannot deal adequately with the longer-term problems created by repeated reductions in public support. Alternative approaches to retrenchment are suggested: building of reserves and developing contingency plans, improving institution flexibility, raising revenue from nongovernmental sources, restricting access through enrollment limitations, reducing faculty personnel costs through academic program reduction, reducing administrative and academic support costs, and merging or closing institutions. The case of reorganized statewide governance in Massachusetts and the merging of Boston State College and the University of Massachusetts is briefly described.  (SW)",

        "description":"Evidence of decline in academic performance and academic standards in schools and colleges, and examples of reform are considered, based on work of a Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) task force. Declining scores on college entrance examinations and other standardized tests imply that students have been learning less in high school. Symptoms of slackened standards include continued grade inflation, more lenient high school graduation requirements, and lower college admissions requirements. There is widespread agreement among experts in education that the quality of the curriculum greatly influences achievement. Some trends in the United States include: a serious decline in electing to take more advanced academic courses and a marked reduction in content and expectations in  advanced courses students do take. Students in the South, making higher grades in high school, have scored substantially lower on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than students nationally. High school graduation requirements in the 14 SREB states are identified. Additionally, admissions practices of colleges according to three categories of accessibility or selectivity are identified for the United States and the South for 1979. A decline in selectivity, as measured by college entrance test scores, has occurred in most colleges, including leading universities. It is suggested that to be effective, reforms must align college preparatory programs in high schools with the academic prerequisites of college work. Examples of schools' efforts to elevate academic standards are cited. In addition,  some individual colleges are tightening their entrance requirements, and several states are making progress in their efforts to improve the preparation of college-bound students. (SW)",

Needs are identified and recommendations for immediate and intermediate action, as well as long term plans, are provided for the library building and library materials. Activities recommended for immediate action require little or no funding, e.g., the development of written guidelines for emergencies and disasters. Plans for intermediate action focus on measures for conservation in the Rare Book Room and Special Collection Archives. Upgrading of conditions in other library areas is recommended under long range  building plans. The discussion of library materials covers special collections, recent preventive conservation measures taken, a program for replacing worn books, and the microfilming of medical theses and heavily used books. Library staff and patrons are discussed in terms of training in the proper care of books and acquiring funding. Four appendices include a statement of aims and goals, the library collection development policy, library special collections policy, and a proposal for the establishment of a Friends of the Library organization.

The core collection was identified by collecting samples from circulation records and shelved materials and recording on cards the latest due date and circulation date for each item, along with its accession number. The cards were then manually sorted into groups by 6-month periods for analysis. A juxtaposition of the circulation and collection data was used to determine the percentage of  circulation that was being met by given percentages of the collection. This collection analysis technique is expected to be useful in the conversion of manual records for automated circulation, the evaluation of collection development policies, and the establishment of continuity in a weeding program. The report includes discussions of these applications, the background of the library, assumptions and definitions used in the study, 20 references, and 24 tables of data. (RBF)",

A review was conducted of the treatment of library science materials in a number of existing classification schemes and thesauri, among them Library of Congress Classification, Classification Research Group Classification, and the Thesaurus of Information Science and Technology. CERLIS, the scheme tested during this project, is a twice-revised version of the Classification Research Group's Classification of Library and Information Science. Established to classify people rather than documents, CERLIS is  designed for self-classification by the individual to be classified. The test version of CERLIS was sent to a random sample of 100 full-time personnel in library education programs, and 28 persons responded with completed classification forms. Specialization profiles and tabulations of the responses were then drawn up. Though there were some problems with CERLIS, testing indicated that it can be used by educators and researchers to describe their specializations, courses, and research. A guide to CERLIS is appended, and six tables, four figures, and a 23-item reference list accompany the text. (Author/JL)",

The first of three sections provides a basic inventory of California's telecommunications resources, focusing on electronic means of transmitting information over long distances and time, e.g., television, radio, and telephone. The second section identifies five areas of knowledge as major social needs, including basic adult competencies or survival skills, and employment information and occupational skills, and discusses how these needs can be met on a statewide basis with electronic media. Primary barriers hindering the use of these resources by postsecondary institutions are identified as  lack of incentives and coordination and high initial costs, and recommended steps for marshalling the necessary resources to meet the state's educational needs are described in the final chapter. The four appendices include a summary and findings of the first report on telecommunications issued by the commission, a reference list on major societal needs, and catalogs of taped instructional materials for postsecondary use.

        "description":"Technology transfer, that is, the dissemination of the results of research and development to the general community, is discussed in this report in relation to the learning society and the mission of the community college. First, definitions of technology are presented and the rapid pace of technological change worldwide is examined. Then, the role of technology transfer as part of an institutional commitment to lifelong learning is explored, with emphasis given to community college partnerships with business, industry, and community organizations. Institutional commitment to service is then recommended as a means of enhancing the spread of technological literacy and as a requirement for achieving functional relationships with various agencies and organizations in the community.  After guidelines for facilitating such relationships, especially with business and industry, are provided, the need for statewide coordination of technology transfer is underscored. Next, such coordination efforts in Ohio are detailed, notably the Ohio Technology Transfer Organization, a statewide information network consisting of Ohio State University and the state's two-year colleges. The problem of technological obsolescence in the work force is then considered, and strategies to prevent or counter it are presented. Conclusions stress the need for strategic planning and the statewide coordination of educational efforts. Sample materials from Ohio projects are appended. (KL)",

First, the DEA model is described, and three of its properties that make it particularly useful are identified; i.e., it measures efficiency of units relative to each other rather than to absolute criteria; it permits the use of multiple inputs and outputs; and it provides management information relative to the inputs and outputs of particular units. After detailing the theory and method of the DEA, the report applies it to measure the efficiency of 22 occupational programs in a comprehensive community college. First, the college setting is described, and then its decision-making units (DMU's) are identified, output and input measures  currently used to make program and budgeting decisions are defined, and the results of the analysis are presented and discussed, with particular emphasis on the information produced by the analysis that has administrative significance. Examples of the use of such information are provided for three allied health programs. Finally, the limitations and requirements of the DEA technique are considered, as well as theory extensions that are under development. A technical appendix, specifying the mathematical model, and an extensive bibliography are included. (Author/KL)",

        "description":"In spring 1981, resources were allocated for the establishment of the Center for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning, which would coordinate strategies to improve methods of instruction and learning in the community colleges of the United States. The emphasis of the Center is on the development of strategies that require relatively small changes in teaching methods, but that yield large effects on student learning outcomes. Ideas, methods, and processes are tried first on a pilot basis in one or more colleges and, if the pilot is successful, a demonstration project is conducted at five or six institutions. If the project proves to be educationally and economically sound, findings are made available through publications, workshops, and conferences. Current projects being  undertaken by the Center include studies to improve student achievement in the crucial first term of college; an examination of the teaching methods and procedures of particularly effective teachers; the development of mastery learning strategies (that is, those which involve conventional instruction followed by feedback correction procedures); and the study of ways to teach higher mental processes in order to improve learning and information retention. Future directions for the Center include the coordination of projects developed across the country and the establishment of consortia of faculty and administrators to initiate and participate in further studies.

In the monograph, the CIA model is applied to agreements reached in the Illinois Community College System (ICCS), although it provides a framework for negotiating contracts at any academic institution. The first of the report's three sections studies the common characteristics of community college contracts in the ICCS and compares provisions relating to bargaining status, length of contract, teaching load, academic freedom, benefits and leave, grievance definitions and procedures, management rights, and no-strike clauses. The second section outlines the use of the  CIA model for: (1) analyzing current or proposed contract language; (2) developing alternative language or counter-proposals; and (3) reacting to union language presented at the outset of or during negotiations. The third section applies the CIA model to four key contract provisions (i.e., grievance procedures, class size, teaching load, and office hours); discusses sample contract language and its implications; and proposes alternative language and actions. Appendices provide a breakdown of bargaining unit membership in the ICCS and a glossary of collective bargaining terms. (HB)",

Problems of unemployment, underemployment, skilled worker shortages, national defense needs for well trained armed forces, the fragmentation of government training programs, and conflicting program requirements all underscore the compelling need for a national policy framework for employment development and training. While America's community colleges can and do provide educational upgrading programs, prepare skilled workers, assist local industries, and provide expertise in state and local planning, these institutions must be  better utilized in solving the problems of employment development and training. This can be accomplished through occupationally specific training, focus on skill shortage areas, programs promoting entrepreneurship, collaboration with local businesses and labor unions, and productivity studies and local work force planning efforts. However, national leadership and a policy framework are required if these programs are to be implemented. Existing legislation must be reviewed and new legislation initiated to promote school industry cooperation, increase state-level determination of resource allocations, promote preparation for jobs with regional priority, and unify federal job training programs.

The primary objectives of the study were, first, to describe students' course-taking patterns, science background, and attitudes toward science; second, to identify institutional patterns that enhance science enrollments and course completion; and third, to describe intervention strategies that will increase student participation in science. Information for the study was gathered through an analysis of 8,873 student transcripts; a survey of 6,425 students in 268 courses; a survey of 268 instructors; a curriculum analysis; and interviews with 65 administrators,  science faculty, and counselors. Selected findings from these activities include: (1) just over 40% of the students completed one or more science courses; (2) withdrawals accounted for 32% of student grades in their first science course; (3) the majority of student respondents had not been encouraged to enroll in science classes in high school or college; and (4) there were large discrepancies between students' career objectives and the courses in which they enrolled. Based on the study, expanded recruitment efforts, redesign of curricula to reflect student objectives and abilities, increased retention efforts, and improved faculty development programs were recommended.

Three colleges were chosen as representative of the eight City Colleges, and the English, Business, and Mathematics Departments were chosen from the departments with the largest enrollments. From within each of the three departments at the three campuses, ten teachers, each teaching one introductory course and one higher-level course in spring 1981, were randomly selected. Statistical analyses revealed significant variations in completion rates between teachers and between colleges, with these two factors accounting for about two-thirds of the total variation. There was also significant variation  between departments across colleges and considerably greater variation between colleges than between departments within a college. The study revealed an insignificant level of variation between upper and lower-level courses. Since teacher effect accounts for the largest amount of variation in earned credit rates, staff development should be considered as a method for improving student achievement and retention rates. Differences between colleges may be due to policy, administrative expectations, or procedures, and an examination of these factors may be appropriate. (HB)",

To achieve these objectives, 452 students in developmental courses were surveyed; 211 student high school transcripts were examined; and the Comparative Guidance and Placement Test (CGPT) scores of 4,577 public and private high school graduates were compared. The survey revealed that while a large percentage of respondents studied a lot (49.9%), could get  help if needed (67.5%), and felt they had improved as students (65.3%), 25.8% did not feel ready for college after high school, 50.3% felt they had not learned to study in high school, and a majority would take additional math and English courses if they could start high school over. The transcript analyses revealed that students in lower-level high school curriculum tracks were more apt to be placed in remedial courses than students in accelerated courses. Only slight differences were revealed in the CGPT scores of public and private high school students.

        "description":"An instructional management system, called Response System with Variable Prescriptions (RSVP), is described in this report as it is used at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC). Following introductory material, the relevance of such a system to current educational issues is explored and the use of computer technology in education is discussed. The RSVP system is then introduced, and its applications in subject area instruction, student advisement, and other areas are reviewed. The RSVP Feedback Program for Individualized Analysis of Writing is the focus of the remainder of the report. The program description indicates that the sequence of activities in the writing program includes the following: (1) students turn in writing assignments; (2) the instructor chooses a level of  achievement represented by the writing sample; (3) the instructor identifies the errors which should be addressed; (4) the instructor makes comments on the writing sample; (5) the computer generates exercises and feedback to address the identified errors; and (6) the RSVP feedback letters are distributed in class with the assignments. Samples of student writing and the RSVP materials generated by the teacher and computer are provided. The report then presents results of a field test of the RSVP writing program and a discussion of how the writing program has been implemented with particular groups of students. A bibliography of literature on RSVP is followed by concluding remarks on the success and future of RSVP. (KL)",

These studies have sought to identify trends in college-going rates and examine the gains and losses in college-going rates experienced by various counties in light of statewide trends; to compare the ethnic distribution of high school graduates with that of first-time freshmen in higher education; and to examine trends in community college transfer, comparing the ethnic distribution of transfers to that of first-time freshmen in the community colleges. Highlights of the 1980 study included: (1) college-going rates for recent high school graduates  continued to increase for public higher education; (2) the percentage of male high school graduates enrolling in the University of California (UC) and the California community colleges was higher than the percentage of females enrolling in these institutions, while a greater percentage of females than males enrolled in the California State Universities (CSU); (3) the percentages of Blacks and Hispanics continued to be smaller in the distribution of first-time freshmen in public higher education than in the distribution of high school graduates; and (4) community college transfers to the UC continued to decline while transfers to CSU increased.

First, trends in business and industry are identified which point to an increased role for the colleges in training skilled technicians for high-technology industries. The problems of skilled labor shortages and lack of international competitiveness are highlighted, and a proposal for the development of a national policy on human resources and economic development is outlined. Second, five major issues faced by Texas are addressed: (1) the community college mission in the area of vocational education; (2) the identification of state needs and institutional responsibility for providing training; (3) the establishment of state policies for economic development and  manpower training; (4) the determination of the relationship between industry and community colleges; and (5) the establishment of sources of funding for programs to train skilled workers. Third, potential solutions to these problems are proposed based on experiences in other states. The paper recommends that community colleges work as partners with industry to achieve economic development; that colleges identify themselves as the main deliverers of skilled training; that input on college role in human resource development be provided; and that new programs be started with state support to address industry needs for skilled workers.

First, Jim Hammons provides an overview of OD and its value to the community college. Then, Richard Woodman and William Muse describe techniques and methodologies that have been successful in improving work group or organizational effectiveness and examine private sector experiences with OD as they relate to the community college. Glenn Varney then reviews the history of OD and identifies professional issues. Next, David Kest describes a project of the Higher Education Management Institute (HEMI) which designed a management development and training program for colleges and universities. Characteristics of a successful OD intervention are  considered by George Baker, who details the results of a National Institute for Staff and Organizational Development project, which sought to improve teaching and learning in the community college through an OD approach. The advantages and limitations of survey feedback, a widely used OD strategy, are explored by Gordon Watts, who outlines the survey feedback process and provides an annotated list of available instruments. Byron McClenney stresses the role of the college president in a successful OD program. Finally, an annotated bibliography of ERIC documents and journal articles about OD is provided. (KL)",

        "description":"In 1981, Daytona Beach Community College was designated as the site for a national demonstration project to aid older adults in setting up their own businesses--the Older Persons in Small Business (OPSB) program. In summer 1981, outreach to the community, scheduling and promotion of classes, recruitment of instructors, and the development of instructional materials prepared the way for the program to begin in the fall semester, and an advisory committee was established to oversee the program. Preliminary workshops were attended by 49 older adults, and five courses were planned for the fall quarter. Due to insufficient enrollments, only two of these five courses were actually offered: a 45-hour Small Business course and a module entitled Self-Employment in the Small Business.  Seven of the ten students who took the Small Business course and six of the eight students in the Self-Employment module completed the activities. A follow-up survey of 14 of the original 18 students revealed that five had started their own businesses, and four were actively planning to do so. Recommendations arising from the project included the following: continued communication with senior citizens and organizations to assess their needs for OPSB programs and services; a rescheduling of courses with two offered in the fall and three in the winter; the opening of OPSB programs to students of all ages; and the assignment of a counselor for older students.

To assess this mandatory placement policy, all sections of fall 1980 and fall 1981 C101 courses were compared with respect to grade distribution and course completion rates. Individual student scores on the Test of Written Expression (TWE) and the Nelson-Denny Reading Tests (NDRT) were correlated with measures of academic performance, such as grades in communications courses and grade point average (GPA). The study revealed that: (1) under  mandatory placement, a higher percentage of enrollees in C101 successfully completed the course than under advisory placement procedures used the year before; (2) TWE scores were not significantly correlated to student course grades or overall GPA, while NDRT scores were strongly correlated to course grades; (3) NDRT total scores (which combined vocabulary and reading comprehension scores) were strongly related to students' GPA's for courses other than communications courses; and (4) grades in C101 were not related to grades in other courses. Based on the findings, recommendations to use the NDRT for placement and to track subsequent performance in developmental courses were made. (KL)",

Interview questions addressed four major areas: general information, student personnel service, instructional services, and administration. The interviews revealed that the range of experience with foreign countries varied  greatly. For example, in metropolitan areas enrollment of foreign students could be over 1,000, while in isolated areas enrollments were rarely over 12 students. The benefits to the colleges included direct financial gains in terms of tuition, administrative expenditures, and expenditures in the community, and intangible benefits acquired through intellectual stimulation and the representation of diverse cultures on campus.

The study compared the performance of 48 students in four sections of a remedial English class with that of 24 students with similar skill levels enrolled in a freshman composition course. The performance of the two groups was measured by scores on the three sub-tests of the McGraw-Hill Writing Test. A separate comparison of randomly chosen student essays from the freshman composition control group and from 12 freshman composition classes not involved in the study was made to ensure that the purposes of the freshman composition course were not being compromised to accommodate remedial students. The study revealed that: (1) there was  no significant difference between the experimental and control sections on the essay criteria, indicating that the purposes of the freshman composition course had not been compromised; (2) statistically significant gains were made by the remedial students in two of the writing sub-tests, though these gains were not significantly different from those made by students in the regular freshman classes; and (3) the attrition rate was higher in the remedial courses than the regular courses.

        "description":"A study of community college services for handicapped students compared colleges identified as having model developmental programs with a random sample of community colleges. Comparisons between these groups were made with respect to services to two major categories of students: mildly handicapped students and moderately/severely handicapped students. A broad preliminary survey of 142 colleges obtained information on the proportion of handicapped students in the surveyed colleges, scores on computed measures of service, specific types of services available, demographic information, and opinions as to the kind and importance of improvements needed in educational services to handicapped students. Survey results, based on responses from 13 of 16 colleges with model programs and 78  of 127 randomly selected schools, indicated that: (1) community colleges were serving all types of handicapped students to a greater extent than other postsecondary institutions; (2) colleges with model programs were serving mildly handicapped students more than the randomly selected colleges; (3) colleges serving either category of student could also be expected to serve the other category; and (4) agreement existed between both types of college as to priorities for improving service to handicapped students. The study report includes recommendations and a discussion of study implications for handicapped student services. (Author/HB)",

        "description":"In 1980, a study was conducted to evaluate the cognitive development of community college graduates. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The control variables used in the analysis were three socioeconomic variables and scores on two standardized tests of verbal and mathematical achievement. The independent variable was level of education (i.e., high school, two-year college, or four-year college) and the outcome measures were scores on verbal and mathematics tests administered in 1979. Separate analyses were performed for blacks (N=327) and whites (N=1273). The study revealed that: (1) for white students, verbal and mathematics achievement was higher among those who received postsecondary education than those who terminated their  education after high school; (2) both black and white students who went on to postsecondary institutions received higher scores on the verbal test in 1979 than in 1972, though during this period their mathematics scores declined; (3) the greatest relative improvement in verbal skills among blacks came from those who had graduated from four-year colleges; and (4) blacks from two-year colleges did not perform better on the 1979 verbal test than blacks with a high school education. A major study conclusion was that two-year colleges contribute to students' cognitive development, but that benefits to black students are less evident than benefits to white students. (HB)",

        "description":"Participants in the Second Eastern Hemisphere Seminar (held at Salisbury, Zimbabwe in 1981) discussed topics related to the theme of integrated and early childhood education. The seminar was organized into plenary and small group discussions centered on four sub-topics of the broad theme: (1) Early Childhood Education: The Community Dimension; (2) Integrated Education: Key to Social Development; (3) A Different School: Preparing the Teacher for New Roles; and (4) Planning and Evaluating Alternatives. The primary purpose of the seminar was to bring together people from Bernard van Leer Foundation projects in Africa and Australasia, and selected representatives of projects elsewhere, so that they could examine their common achievements and problems and share their experiences with  others. The seminar was viewed as an occasion for many of the interventions supported by the Foundation to be examined in terms of their general social accountability and their capability for wider dissemination. In addition to a summary report of the topics discussed, the document includes conclusions reached by the seminar participants, a list of participants and observers, and the President of Zimbabwe's opening address, in which he emphasizes the need to set up kindergarten centers in the rural areas of Zimbabwe.

        "description":"Some of the principal research advances of the 1970s related to pregnancy and newborn infants and consequent changes in obstetrical practice are summarized in this report. The process of infant-parent attachment (bonding), adolescent pregnancy, and the reproductive hazards of tobacco, alcohol, and poor nutrition have been investigated and, in several problem areas, new risk-reducing medical practices have been developed and implemented. Still, prematurely born and low birthweight infants comprise a disproportionate share of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prevention of such births continues to be a research priority in the 1980s. Additionally, birth problems associated with the Rh factor of red blood cells of mothers and their infants have not been eradicated. Ultrasound, a  diagnostic technique that uses the reflected echoes of high frequency sound waves to see inside the human body, has been used in intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells, thus avoiding fetal irradiation. Other technological advances include the monitoring of fetal health during labor via electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and fetal blood tests. To provide all necessary maternal and neonatal care in the most cost-effective manner, a system of regionalized graded levels of perinatal services has been successfully established. Newborn transport and continuing education programs have been critical to the success of these services. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Research related to identification of delinquents, causes of delinquency, and effective intervention to stop delinquency is reviewed in this paper. In summary, the review indicates that adolescent problems appear to be concentrated among those disadvantaged in a variety of ways. Further, the reviewed literature indicates that biases in the justice system tend to exaggerate representation of minority groups and members of the lower class as criminals. Whereas the evidence about who is delinquent leads to reasonably clear conclusions, the evidence about why there is delinquency has largely failed to support previously entertained beliefs. Theories of status-frustration, labelling theory, and Freudian theory have been shown inadequate in accounting for and explaining crime and  aggressive behavior. On the other hand, among the studies reviewed, a variety of measures of parental rejection and parental aggression appear to be consistent in showing a positive correlation with crime. Caution has been recommended in interpreting these relationships. It is concluded that (1) perhaps the most significant result of recent research has been the discovery that programs designed to help adolescents actually risk damaging those they are designed to serve, and (2) well-considered professional opinions should not be substituted for pilot programs and mandatory evaluations as preliminary steps for instituting larger projects designed to help adolescents.

Approximately 8 to 10 per cent of the pediatric population suffers from one or more developmental disabilities. The most common of these are learning disabilities, which include some behavioral problems, such as attention deficit disorders. Cerebral palsy, mental retardation, epilepsy, and autism are other disabilities that occur frequently in the pediatric population. Recently, there have been remarkable advances in understanding the cause of some developmental disabilities, notably epilepsy, mental retardation, and cerebral palsy. However, knowledge about other disabilities, such as learning disabilities and autism,  is still very limited. Future progress in the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disabilities depends upon (1) an increased understanding of the causes of this disorder; (2) prevention of the occurrence or a decrease in the severity of developmental disabilities by treatment of their causes; (3) an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of the symptoms and signs that constitute a developmental disability; and (4) a realization that, in many instances, the symptoms and signs themselves can be treated by understanding their pathophysiology and without reference to their etiology.

First, three examples of research approaches that reflect current attitudes are given. The first example represents those studies in which there is an effort to closely coordinate physiological and behavioral studies. The second example represents studies focusing on the infant and the caretaking environment as a living, biological system. The third example represents interest in the systematic study of affect development, some of it with the goal of theory building. It is pointed out that these three large and overlapping areas of currently intense inquiry are applicable to clinical practice in the early years and each depends partly on the study of deviations in  development and in the parent-child relationship. In subsequent material, several other categories of studies relevant for the field of infant mental health are cited in condensed form. These include studies of (1) congenital characteristics and individual tendencies, (2) vulnerability and resilience, (3) competence and effectance motivation, (4) separation-individuation, (5) deprivation, separation and loss, (6) parent-infant interaction, (7) speech development, (8) parent-child attachment behavior and disorders of attachment, and (9) early intervention.

This research has included cross-sectional studies (which have attempted to determine current drug usage, age of onset for each drug used, and maximum frequency of use in the lifetime); longitudinal studies (which have attempted to predict which children would become future drug users); and other evaluation studies (which have searched for ways to prevent or reduce drug use). Indeed, today we know more about children's drug use than we know about any other type of adolescent psychopathology. However, it is not clear to what extent illicit drug use is psychopathology. The present paper, after reviewing what is known about the frequency with which  various types of drugs are used by young people, raises the question of the extent to which illicit drug use appears to be pathological, either in terms of its predictors or its consequences. Topics reviewed include age at first use, popularity of different drug classes, motivation for use, heavy drug use, trends in use, correlates and predictors of drug use (e.g., sex differences and socioeconomic status), and drug users compared with delinquents.

        "description":"Environmental influences can significantly affect (both positively and negatively) the developing child. Three ways in which the environment affects the developing organism are induction, facilitation, and maintenance. In the case of induction the presence or absence of specific stimuli totally determines whether or not a particular developmental event occurs, such as sexual differentiation. Facilitation is apparent when the rate and/or maximal level of maturation is altered, as in the case of the influence of thyroid hormone on the rate of cell division. The term maintenance refers to the presence of any environmental factors necessary for the preservation of an already developed state. Alternately, and in particular reference to human development, certain aspects of the  environment, such as toxic compounds, heavy metals, pesticides, food additives, and parental drug abuse may have predominately negative effects on the developing child. Although every part of the developing organism is subject to this environmental influence, in recent years considerable emphasis has been placed on the developing nervous system. As a result of scientific investigations, significant advances have been made toward understanding the consequences of toxic exposure. Future research should increasingly emphasize basic research approaches designed to reveal how toxicants produce their effects. In addition, special attention must be given to the developing organism in any assessment of the consequences of neurotoxic compounds. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of these Hearings of Subcommittees of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, is to investigate the effects of medicaid cutbacks on infant health. After introductory statements by the chairmen of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, the testimony of medical experts from Florida and Alabama is reported verbatim. In addition, testimony from a Texas legal services agency is reported. The difficulties of the poor in obtaining neonatal care for pregnant women is repeatedly described by the witnesses, and an overview of the impact of medicaid and other Federal health programs on the health of the poor is provided. Also included is a policy paper from the national health  law program. In the paper, statistics on maternal care for the poor, denial of prenatal and delivery care, the effects of medicaid cuts on public hospitals, plus proposed reductions in federal health programs for the poor are discussed. Concluding testimony records the positions taken by witnesses representing the Reagan administration's perspective on the issues raised. (Author/RH)",

The introductory section focuses briefly on the complexities of defining child abuse and neglect and offers a definition from an environmental viewpoint. In the second section the scope of the problem is discussed. Three explanatory models of child abuse are discussed in the third section. The models discussed are the psychiatric, the sociologic, and the social-situational. The fourth section examines environmental effects on child rearing and specifies appropriate child rearing environments. In the concluding and fifth section, aspects  of Helfer's (1978) intervention program (based on the thesis that abusive parents have not progressed normally through developmental stages), and the Head Start example of community intervention to improve children's environments are discussed.

Field notes, teacher journal entries, and student diary entries demonstrate how diary time was started, modified, and sustained. The activity is analyzed in terms of teacher planning, implementation, audience, and the function of diary writing for young children. Conflicting messages regarding issues of privacy, correctness, and audience illustrate the complexity of carrying out this kind of writing occasion in an elementary school classroom and account for the eventual  deletion of diary time from the schedule of classroom activities.

        "description":"The adoption of philosophy into the public school curriculum has been advocated on the grounds that it improves students' creativity and basic academic skills. That &quot;philosophy for children&quot; programs can have such an impact on children should be of no surprise to students of John Dewey. Although John Dewey did not directly advocate implementing a &quot;philosophy for children&quot; curriculum, it does seem that he was proposing that it should occur. To understand the world of the scientist is, for Dewey, to employ conceptual tools as a scientist employs them and to avoid the egotistical Gestalt idiosyncrasies of non-scientists or young children. Not much has been done to initiate children into the self-conscious practice of seeing the world as a scientist sees it. Education has done little  to free students of over-simplified images of scientific practice. If children are to gain any real sense of what it is to &quot;do science,&quot; they must first philosophize about the scientist's use of certain inferential techniques and all that follows from the use of such decision-making practices. Not only science education, but all discipline-oriented curricula can be similarly enhanced by making philosophy a part of every public school curriculum program. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to describe and compare kindergarten and first-grade children's performance on addition and subtraction problems presented in two contexts: verbal (in which problem data were linked to physical referents such as objects or people and their actions), and abstract (in which no such links to physical situations occurred). Fifty kindergarteners and 54 first-graders were individually interviewed in mid-year to observe their solution strategies and errors on 12 abstract and 12 verbal addition and subtraction problems. The kindegarten problems contained sums and minuends less than 10. For first-graders, the sums and minuends ranged from 6 through 15. All problems were based on the open sentences a+b=?, a-b=?, and a+?=c. Upon completion of the problems,  subjects in each grade were clustered according to the solution strategies they employed and according to the types of problems they could solve. Results indicated that verbal and abstract problems were of equal difficulty for subjects in both grades. Although kindergarteners used essentially the same strategies to solve verbal and abstract problems, first-graders exhibited less frequent use of concrete representation strategies on abstract than on verbal problems. Subjects in the two grades committed essentially the same types of errors, although the frequency of occurrence of most errors was lower at the first-grade level. At both grade levels a variety of individual differences were evident in the types of strategies subjects used and the types of problems they could solve.  (Author/MP)",

        "description":"As the child care field moves toward professionalism, it is necessary to consider the ways in which academic instruction may enhance professionalization. One dimension of the definition of a profession is that a profession has control over the key elements of its own destiny. For example, a profession (1) controls entry into the profession, (2) establishes its own standards of expertise, (3) develops its own organizational structures, and (4) regulates its own membership. Given these &quot;keys&quot; to control, the pragmatics of the situation require a &quot;top-down&quot; approach to professionalization. Consideration of the structure of knowledge and of academic institutions, links between academic institutions and professional organizations, and the relationship between academic subjects and  certification suggests that the preparation of senior academic leadership is an essential ingredient for movement of the child care field toward professionalization. Future leaders of the child care field will need an educational program that promotes the integration of knowledge on three levels: disciplinary and hierarchical, interdisciplinary and holistic, and thematic and hierarchical.

The extended paradigm or framework, called Antecedent/Transaction Interaction (ATI), consists of three major components: antecedents, transactions, and outcomes. Following a brief description of each component, the antecedent's component is elaborated in terms of the resources and life events history adult learners bring to learning situations. A taxonomic scheme for categorizing life events history is provided and biological, psychological, and sociological resources of adult learners are characterized. To further specify  antecedent variables, historical and concurrent events affecting the field of early childhood education are pointed out in terms of macro-, exo-, and microsystem environmental contexts. In the concluding section, questions related to applying the ATI framework to inservice and continuing education programs are specified.

In addition, program trends related to these aspects of teacher education programs were identified. A questionnaire relating to program characteristics, and admission and retention requirements was developed and sent to 343 institutions of higher education preparing early childhood education teachers. In general, results from 172 programs responding indicate that early childhood teacher education is a relatively new activity for most institutions, with over half (57.6 per cent) being in existence for 10 years or less. Almost  two-thirds of the programs (64.8 per cent) are housed in departments of colleges of education rather than child development or similar units. The primary criteria for admitting students to these programs are grade point average and test scores. The primary criteria for retention in these programs is grade point average and a practicum performance by college personnel. Finally, the main criteria reported for graduation from the program is the successful completion of courses and demonstration of competence.

In the first study, a pretest posttest control group design was used. Two experimental groups, including seven children from divorced homes and eight children from intact families, were given an 18-week preschool program experience. A further eight children from intact homes served as controls for maturation effects. Children ranged from 3.5 to 5 years of age. Measures of children's intelligence and locus of control, mothers' perceptions of their child's social adjustment, similar teachers' ratings, and parents' self reports were used to gather data. The second study was  conducted to investigate the effects of a preschool education program on the development of important social competency skills. It was hypothesized that a highly structured, adult-directed preschool program, which uses discussions, role playing, and social modeling would, in contrast to control group comparisons, positively accelerate listening skills and perspective taking competencies for children from both intact and divorced families. It is concluded overall for the two studies that some but not all behaviors might be assisted by placing young children of recently divorced parents in preschool programs. (Author/RH)",

The effects of task structures (or patterns of instructional organization), and the impact of the racial composition of the classrooms on the frequency and type of cross-sex interactions were also explored. Ethnographic observations were completed in 30 to 90 minute sessions over a 5 or 6 month period in each classroom. Results revealed the following: (1) a child's gender had a systematic effect on his or her peer relationships, with girls playing supportive roles and having less social power in their interchanges with boys; (2) classroom organizational patterns, while influencing the frequency of cross-sex interactions, had little effect on the  quality of these interactions; and (3) majority-black classrooms displayed more egalitarian interchanges between male and female students. In general, these results provide support for the study's hypotheses that within classrooms, cross-sex peer interactions would mirror traditional sex role relationships among males and females, and that female students would have less social power than males in peer interchanges. Implications of the study's results for the design of effective programs to achieve sex and race equality are discussed. (Author/MP)",

French and Brown claimed that it would be impossible for children to learn the meaning of temporal terms except by hearing them used in contexts where they referred to already known sequences, and further proposed that the terms would be understood in such contextually supported settings earlier than in settings where they established an order between inherently unordered events. Subjects were sixteen 3- and sixteen 4-year-old children. To assess subjects' understanding of the terms \"before\" and \"after\" 16 stories were composed that described activities with which young children could be assumed to be familiar. Half of the stories described activities having a  more or less invariant real-world order. The remaining stories described activities that were familiar to young children, but that had no inherent real-world order constraints. The experimenter read each story and placed the picture corresponding to the sentence being read in front of the child. The order of the pictures corresponded to the order of events in the story. Following the presentation of each story the subject was asked what happened either before or after the third event. Results are discussed. (Author/RH)",

It is pointed out that, whereas in traditional societies education has been a function of the home, the school, through its power, authority, knowledge and professionalism, dominates the relationship between the home and the school through paternalistic or aggressive behavior. The position is taken that, while it is possible to provide an early childhood education at home, parental access to an early childhood learning center would be an advantage, generally. The gap between the culture of the school and  of the home is seen to be widest for children from disadvantaged homes, all of whom need an early childhood education that is specially designed to initially diminish differences between home and school through involving parents in their children's schooling. Additional topics briefly discussed include (1) attitudinal obstacles to coordinating school and home, (2) the need for schools, (3) the role of language in educational settings, and (4) teacher, parent, and adult education.

Initially, unresolved problems in the developmental literature are pointed out to support the view that those concerned with intervention in the developmental process can only proceed heuristically by basing their action on theoretical considerations. Subsequently, the findings of studies investigating the effects of early educational interventions are cited. Results are taken as supporting the thesis that cultural influences are relative. Demographic characteristics of the citizens of Zimbabwe are provided as a basis for projections of the future educational needs of the Zimbabwian people. The influence of early learning programs in providing foundations for future development  in a rapidly changing, technological context is discussed and the much stronger influence of parents on their child's development is pointed out.

After establishing the importance of sensitive periods when learning can be massive and intervention is most likely to be rewarding, two maxims for intervention are stipulated. Subsequently, problems inherent in bringing about change are addressed and their implications for different styles of innovative change are examined. A number of basic propositions concerning the nature of change are advanced and linked to the problem of psychological stress engendered by change. Criteria thought to be crucial for judging any innovation project  (i.e., criteria related to individual coping and personal security) are expanded upon in subsequent passages. An educational model based on habilitation is put forward as preferable to the usual, implicit model based on rehabilitation. Implications arising from the analysis for planning, implementing, and evaluating educational interventions are briefly explored in terms of the need for preliminary information, and determination of aims and objectives, as well as consideration of the type of intervention strategy, leadership style, and experience-based assessment and revision of the intervention model used. Several conclusions based on the presentation are offered. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Catastrophe theory may provide a possible model for describing and explaining the boom town phenomena at a generalized level; catastrophe models deal with phenomena in which changes in continuous independent variables lead to sudden, or abrupt, discontinuous changes in a dependent variable. Rural energy boom towns are the result of sudden, abrupt changes in rural communities and the changes can be regarded as catastrophe events. Catastrophe models can be used to explain and describe two of these events--the overall community change from a relatively stable rural community to a boom town, and the change in the integrative mechanisms in the community from informal to institutional. Used properly, with the appropriate phenomena, catastrophe models can be very beneficial in social  impact assessment (SIA). Catastrophe models can bring some order and understanding to events that initially appear to be random or inexplicable by other models or theories, may force the search for independent variables that are related to the behavior observed (the catastrophe), and can point to areas or variables that need further research. The main drawback to using catastrophe models is that only a limited number of variables can be considered. (BRR)",

        "description":"Comprehensive staff development approaches described in this paper are based on on-site work with school districts and a 1980 National Rural Project investigation of problems experienced by over 80 rural districts and cooperatives across the country as they attempted to implement staff development programs. Three models are described which employed staff development as a vehicle for change in rural districts; each process involved inter- and intra-school levels as well as rural communities. Model A is described as a management model which allowed members of the district to develop and implement strategies creating growth-promoting interaction for all who would influence children, including the handicapped child in the least restrictive setting. Model B is described as a  comprehensive management information system which optimized school and community resources to implement special education mandates in ways beneficial to all students within individual schools/total districts. Model C is described as a trainer-of-trainers approach which was used on district-specific and statewide bases. The paper concludes that these models stem from value systems emphasizing (1) identification of resources as well as needs, (2) environmental monitoring of the local culture of a particular district and community subculture, and (3) identification of creative alternatives for use in the specific district, analyzing effectiveness as well as cost-efficiency.

APEID had undertaken four development themes in its second cycle: universalization of education at early school levels and functional education for out-of-school youth and adults; integrated rural development; productive skills; and health and nutrition. The four themes were found to have continuing relevance to the concerns of the countries. The gains from APEID were regarded as high although their spread among the countries and the Associated Centres was, not surprisingly, uneven. The Meeting recommended eight programme areas for APEID's third cycle (1982-1986)  which fell into two clusters: first were programme areas in which education was linked to a development goal, including education itself as a development goal. The second cluster comprised programme areas which were in the nature of infrastructure development and contribute as such to a whole range of development goals. The document includes group discussions and reports on programme areas, agenda items, and an appendix listing innovative projects of some of the Associated Centres for 1982-1986. (BRR)",

Next, the process of identifying and retrieving appropriate materials was facilitated by the Alaska Department of Education's contract to use the services and resources available through the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory (NWREL) Information Center, a special purpose library with a computer terminal for direct access to the ERIC  files and other data bases in the Lockheed Information System. Sample &quot;Item Report&quot; and &quot;Summary Report by Category&quot; forms are included to show how material identified for its usefulness and quality of study is analyzed. An information flow chart depicts the search, analysis, and synthesis procedure. Appendices include formats of the two forms used, a list of standards for rating studies, and a sample copy of a decision display. (ERB)",

Using an ERIC search and conventional library methods, 26 documents were judged to be both relevant and sufficiently well-designed to yield believable and meaningful results. Overall, the studies and evaluation reports were of two kinds: those which sought to determine whether specially funded programs for Native American students have been successful in promoting improved achievement and affective outcomes and those which studied the cognitive and affective outcomes produced when instructional practices and teacher behaviors are (or are not) compatible with the cultural characteristics of Native  American students. Based on the information found, three of six recommendations concerned developers and funders of programs who should consider instructional activities which are compatible with Native American cultural traits (e.g., noncompetitiveness, openness to visual and oral learning); school personnel should acquaint themselves with cultural traits of Native American students they teach; and Native American history and culture should be introduced into a school's curriculum with a sizeable Native American student population.

Although the conclusions must be regarded as tentative because of the small number of studies, it does appear that when principals assume an active instructional leadership role, student achievement is enhanced. The fact that several of the supportive studies focused on disadvantaged students lends additional weight  to this conclusion. It also appears that the positive effect is both direct (when principals observe and participate in instructional activities with students) and indirect (when teachers work closely with principals to develop instructional plans that are clear, shared, and supported).

Two conclusions were drawn: first, children in primary grades evidence higher achievement levels when they receive instruction in  closely supervised, highly structured small group settings, and second, for older elementary and secondary students factors other than grouping arrangements appear to influence achievement and effective outcomes. It is recommended that children in primary grades should receive as much small group instruction as possible, and reasons other than hoped-for outcomes in student achievement and attitude should guide decisions about grouping arrangements for older elementary and secondary students.

CAI was also popular with students and often improved their attitude toward subject matter. It is recommended that the use of CAI be actively promoted and expanded, especially in  small schools in rural areas where it is difficult to offer full schedules of classes to limited numbers of students. It is also recommended that CAI be increased with low-achieving students and with students alienated by traditional teaching methods.

        "description":"Efforts have been underway since 1973 to determine if there are elements of Navajo culture that potentially impact upon a Navajo student's attainment of mathematics concepts. Extensive reading and discussion with Navajo students and educational leaders on the Navajo reservation show that basic concepts and objectives of Navajo philosophy (a quest for unity, harmony, order, and beauty) appear to be entirely consistent with views of the greatest contributors to the development of mathematics. However, there are no words for &quot;multiply&quot; and &quot;divide&quot; in Navajo, and no agreed upon word for &quot;if,&quot; and difficulties arise when Navajo students handle situations calling for use of those functions or syllogistic reasoning. While Anglo folklore has many references to numbers (e.g., the three  little pigs), Navajo folklore is more personal. Sentence word order (nouns in particular), the role of imaging in problem solving, clan characteristics, and cultural views of geometry pose additional hazards. Navajo culture has traditionally been transmitted orally, and it is possible that the students' facility for memorization has not been fully appreciated. The teacher should have visual classroom models of certain basic mathematical entities, and should make every effort to close the gap between the hypothesis form of teaching and the real world of the Navajo.

Chapter 1 discusses the public awareness of Indians and Indian issues during the late 1970s. Chapter 2 traces the major events in Federal-Indian relations from the precolonial period to the present, briefly summarizes the major concepts of Federal Indian law, describes the historical developments of the concept of Indian rights, and discusses the relations between tribal governments and state, local, and federal governments. In the next chapters, detailed  case studies (i.e., Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, Oneida v. County of Oneida, the Mashpee Jury Trial, claims by the Cayuga Indian Nation, St. Regis Mohawk Indians, and Catawba Tribe) trace the historical origins of the conflicts, focusing on the governments' role, particularly the federal government, throughout the crises. Generally, the report concludes that the present system for protecting Indian rights has significant limitations, that coherent mechanisms for determining and implementing Indian policy are lacking, and that conflicts over Indian rights exacerbate preexisting problems Indians face concerning denials of equal protection of the laws.

        "description":"Christian (1880-1900) and Progressive (1920-1940) reforms affected the U.S. government's attempt to acculturate and educate American Indians. Religious groups supported the Dawes Allotment Act (1887), which allotted parcels of land, previously tribally held, to individual Indians. This led to de-tribalization, loss of cultural identity, and loss of Indian land. Commissioner Morgan established the first uniform course of study and began the gradual shift from sectarian, mission schools to government-managed schools. Day schools were adopted in policy because of economic advantage over boarding schools. Progressive reform attempted to reverse policies that encouraged Indian de-tribalization and cultural dissociation. The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) (1934) repealed allotment of  lands; encouraged Indian arts, culture, and community; and encouraged replacement of boarding schools with day schools. This period saw defeat of the Bursum Bill, which proposed giving legal Pueblo land ownership to white squatters; a boost in educational appropriations effected by the Merriam Report; John Collier's attempt to create an educational program that helped strengthen tribal political and cultural solidarity; and Indian bilingual education, which grew equally from Merriam Report recommendations, IRA educational provisions, and efforts of educationists who attempted to implement the approaches of social science and progressive education.

        "description":"The Structure of Intellect Learning Abilities (SOI-LA) Test was administered to 244 Navajo students (second through eighth grades) at Leupp Boarding School in northern Arizona to determine behavioral characteristics in regard to intellectual and creative ability. Comparison of SOI-LA test scores of Leupp students with norm scores revealed 54 of the 244 students scored in the gifted range in 3 or more subtests (memory scores were highest consistently for all 24 subtests). Teachers completed the Scale for Rating Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students (SRBCSS) for 100 of 244 students in order to correlate behavioral characteristics to creative thinking and intellectual abilities. Comparison of SOI-LA and SRBCSS results revealed low positive to negative correlation with  behavioral characteristics and a greater number of significant correlations for any intellectual ability with all behaviors. Grade level made a difference in intellectual and creative ability (second grade had twice the number of significant correlations than other grades). Sex also showed a difference in number and type of correlations (girls had 79% more correlations between intellectual or creative abilities and behavioral characteristics than boys). One of four recommendations made is for development of a comprehensive training program for teachers to identify gifted Navajos. (ERB)",

        "description":"Project REACH (Rural Education Approach in a Consortium for Handicapped) was designed as a model program to demonstrate methods of service for mildly, moderately, and severely handicapped children located in 14 school district areas in 5 counties of the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado from October 1978 through June 1981. The main emphasis was on serving the severely handicapped in rural areas where adequate programs designed to meet their need seldom exist. The model had a 3-part thrust: service, education, and interagency cooperation. Of the 168 children in the area identified as needing supplementary services, 136 had been served by the end of the project. While parent group involvement did not prove practical, the most effective activities reached individual families on a  one-to-one basis. REACH was directly involved with integration of children from a community center to either transitional or regular classrooms in 6 of the 14 districts; service was provided for handicapped children in the existing population in the remaining 8 districts. Students and staff members were given integration inservice prior to receiving mentally retarded or Cerebral Palsy students. Project REACH continued to coordinate referrals to various state and local agencies. Approximately 700 people attended various community workshops conducted by REACH from 1979 to 1981. (BRR)",

Identification and recruitment was conducted by local project schools and recruiters. Services were provided in reading, language arts, and math. Data revealed that 1,039 students received services in reading, 788 in language arts, and 890 in math. The average normal curve equivalency (NCE) gains (weighted mean) was 5.75 overall for reading, language arts, and math. Parents were involved in the overall development of migrant education within the state (i.e., needs assessment, program development, implementation, and evaluation). Inservice education was accomplished through a 2-day statewide workshop, a regional workshop, Migrant Student  Record Transfer System training workshops, and a 1-day workshop conducted in reading, math, or language arts. Mail-outs, memos, the Oklahoma Educator, the Superintendent's Newsletter, education fair, television, PTA, newspapers, brochures, and other printed materials were used to disseminate information. Overall, projects felt that significant gains had occurred in migrant education and the related components. This report provides brief information on the national, state, and local goals; state administration; dissemination activities; parent involvement; inservice; identification and recruitment; recommended changes; evaluation data; and student achievement in reading, language arts, and math.

        "description":"Teachers from a rural Pennsylvania elementary school were the focus of a 4-year (1977-1981) field-based Teacher Corps delivery system program. The school site was located 30 miles from its administrative offices and 75 miles from Pennsylvania State University. Inservice workshops held over a 2-year period identified the need for an on-site, field-based M.Ed. program. The resulting program allowed a practicing teacher to take all courses toward an M.Ed. at the school site and have such courses accepted as resident courses. Students took one course per term and could accelerate their program during the summer. Coursework was geared toward immediate classroom use. Announcement of courses was made well in advance and in a personalized, multifaceted way. Development and implementation  of the model was a more time consuming process than originally expected. Standardized tests administered yearly to the teachers indicated a large percentage had negative self images of their professional capabilities and the position of their school site in the school district. Over time the scores also showed considerable growth in teacher self concept, and, in conjunction with other data, revealed improved staff communication, more satisfaction in teaching, and a greater understanding of problems of other teachers at different grade levels.

        "description":"A 1977 study in Clinton County, New York, investigated collaboration among human service agencies in the delivery of services and amenities to rural citizens. A major assumption was that agencies working together would be more effective in meeting local needs. Thirty public, private, and non-profit agencies were chosen based on their supposed interest in a rural transportation network. The highest ranking administrator plus 1 or 2 other professionals or board members from each agency made up the sample (n=57). Interviews were held with the sample regarding themselves and their agencies and a questionnaire was mailed to them requesting views of each of the other 29 agencies in terms of agency interaction. A Guttman Scale construction provided characteristics of agencies having  high interaction scores. Over 70 people attended a day-long workshop which communicated results and planned for future inter-agency collaboration activities. Since participating agencies wanted additional feedback, 28 individual agency sessions of 1 1/2 to 2 hours were conducted in the fall of 1978. An evaluation at the session showed agency personnel wanted to increase communications internally with staff and staff/board members in terms of daily activities and long-range program planning. Scripts for two audio-visual programs plus six appendices of agency and workshop materials comprise the bulk of the document. (BRR)",

The child and his values and experiences are central to the project's methodology, which emphasizes prewriting activities that stimulate motivation for writing, collection of impressions, and production of rough drafts. Teachers provide a supportive learning environment and situations which promote positive self concepts and encourage the children to be active  participants in their education and to freely express themselves and their values. The school supports teachers in their efforts through writing seminars held twice a month and the classroom support network which emphasizes hands-on demonstrations in the classroom and intra-classroom visitations by teachers and administrators. Parents are kept informed of their child's involvement in the writing process through work taken home and class publications. Major writing projects developed within the various classrooms are formally published and redirected into the classroom as supplemental reading materials and into the young authors' homes. (NQA)",

The final sample included 116 students, 71 dropouts and 45 graduates. A questionnaire and two information forms were designed to obtain information on biographical, pre-college and college factors of those who dropped out and those who graduated. Conclusions were based on statistical treatment of data gathered. Biographical conclusions included: sex of student does not influence completion of college degree; older students tend to persist and graduate; dropouts tend to be single; graduates have more dependents; and American Indian blood quantum bears no indication of influence. Determining  pre-college factors were high school grade point average and ACT test scores. College factors revealed the Center for Teaching and Learning had more Indian graduates; campus support services were used more by graduates; and social activities hindered dropouts. Effective factors of graduates were higher college grade point averages, more semester hours completed, clearer career goals, and American Indian heritage viewed as an advantage. Recommendations requested a continuation of this study with a control group, expanding the study to include all 11 BIA Area offices, and 6 recommendations for the university. (ERB)",

Expectation States Theory analyzed the sources of status and their effects on peer interaction at learning centers in an ongoing classroom setting. A path model illustrated how classroom peer interaction can simultaneously have positive and negative effects on learning. The bilingual curriculum, designed to teach thinking skills, used math and science concepts and  featured multiple learning centers each with different materials and activities. For one hour per day for 15 weeks, children were required to complete each learning center and to fill out accompanying worksheets. Instructions in English, Spanish, and pictographs were available with each learning center. Data were obtained from behavioral observations, questionnaires, and test scores. Findings indicated children with higher social status were more likely to talk and work together than children of lower social status; and the more children talked and worked together, the more they learned from the curriculum.

Exploratory interviews and group sampling studies were conducted. The interviews were conducted with approximately 25 freshmen and sophomore engineering students. As a result, the project was able to discover new misconceptions about qualitative concepts in physics, develop and refine more simple and elegant problems which would expose and isolate those misconceptions with a minimum of distraction from other possible difficulties, and form hypotheses about four  levels of knowledge being used in successful problem solving. A series of three different 45-minute diagnostic tests were conducted with entering freshman engineering majors, using sample sizes of 150, 34, and 38 respectively. These each involved approximately 18 of the questions which had been pilot tested in interviews, including both algebra and physics questions. A parallel test was given to an older group of 24 engineering majors who had just completed a course in introductory mechanics. These tests allowed for the comparison of students before and after taking introductory physics to determine whether the students' learning had been formula-centered. Findings and comments on the research methodology are presented in this final report. (Author)",

This study, a natural experiment, examined the effects of long-term instruction emphasizing a relational definition of &quot;equals.&quot; In a partially standardized clinical interview, first- through third-graders evaluated a variety of familiar and unfamiliar equation forms. The curriculum seemed effective in inducing a relational view of &quot;equals.&quot; An operator interpretation was also clearly evident, but attributed to the cognitive factor of assimilation--not to relatively immutable (age-related) cognitive limitations.

        "description":"This document is designed to provide a concise introduction to the theory of generalized inverses of matrices that is accessible to undergraduate mathematics majors. The approach used is to: (1) develop the material in terms of full-rank factorizations and to relegate all discussions using eigenvalues and eigenvectors to exercises, and (2) include an appendix of hints for exercises. In addition, the Moore-Penrose inverse of a matrix is introduced and its use in characterizing particular solutions to systems of equations is immediately explored before many of its algebraic properties are established. This is done to provide some motivation for considering generalized inverses before developing the algebraic theory. This material was originally assembled as lecture notes for senior  seminars in mathematics at the University of Tennessee, and requires a knowledge of basic matrix theory as found in many current introductory texts. It is noted that it may be helpful to have a standard linear algebra textbook for reference, as fundamental definitions and concepts are used without the detailed discussion that would be included in a self-contained work.

        "description":"This project investigated the effects of increasing teachers' wait times on general questioning skills in science teaching. Variables were separated through the use of four treatment groups, each containing ten science teachers. Schools were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions from a subsampling of middle schools in a central New York state county. One group received instruction in wait time using a newly developed electronic feedback device that monitors the duration of teacher and student pauses; a second received general questioning skills instruction; a third received both types of instruction; and a comparison group received no instruction of either type. Use of written materials on questioning produced only a slight increase in teacher wait times, but feedback  devices caused significant increases. Interaction effects were found significant favoring those who had access to the devices without the additional complication of reading the written materials. Treatment effects were maximized at the project's fifth week, and diminished as the school year's end approached. The greatest behavior change noted in analysis was the increase in the amount of total classroom discussion time with active student participation. (MP)",

These are: 240-Pi is Irrational; 241-The Wallis Approximation of Pi; and 242-Buffon's Needle Experiment. The first of these units focuses on a proof of the irrational nature of pi, and provides exercises and answers. The second module of this group reviews the history of attempts to calculate pi, and leads to a discussion of sequences in the Wallis formula, as originally discovered by the English mathematician John Wallis in about 1650. The third unit covers a &quot;fun and games&quot; method of approximating pi using needle tosses. The module gives a brief review of aspects of probability prior to discussing details of the experiment. A fourth unit in this document set focuses on applications of calculus to  physiology and psychology: 251-A Strange Result in Visual Perception. The module describes an experiment on the process by which the eye sees bright light, and reviews the physiological background of eyes. A model is shown to predict seemingly paradoxical results. Exercises are presented at the conclusion to encourage further thought. Answers to these problems are included. (MP)",

Following the award of these studies NSF requested Battelle, one of the award recipients, to assist in coordinating the five projects. This report briefly describes: (1) the objectives and scope of and the rationale for the coordination effort (to maintain and promote communication between directors of the respective projects and to promote agreement on common definitions or other issues affecting the general area of continuing education under consideration); (2) the five awarded studies; (3) the coordination activities; and (4) conclusions and recommendations regarding future work in the area.  It was suggested that, in future endeavors, NSF utilize the &quot;standardization of methodology&quot; approach or &quot;technical direction&quot; approach in lieu of mere coordination of issues and definitions, since either approach would likely result in greater comparability of results. Included in appendices are the coordination agreement with Battelle, documents related to establishing the coordination meeting, topics for discussion, press release, Battelle's survey instruments, and a bibliography in the area of continuing education.

In 1977, the National Science Foundation conducted a survey of firms (N=1,232) presumed to be active in research and development (R&amp;D) and sponsored several in-depth follow-up interviews of company executives (N=71) to better assess the nature and extent of these problems. Eleven problem areas were identified. An underlying factor in most of these was lack of funding. More than half of the surveyed firms indicated that each of the problems (except patenting and licensing) was of major concern. Four areas were identified as major concerns by two-thirds of the firms: providing competitive  salaries and benefits, maintaining R&amp;D work at adequate levels, dealing with procurement regulations, and obtaining venture and/or working capital.

Students were told to list up to five science subjects they were interested in, and to choose from a list of 18 reasons provided to indicate why they liked or were interested in a subject. Pupils were also asked to think of a science subject they did not like, and to give a reason. A total of 1,855 pupils indicated they liked at least one science subject, while 802 indicated a dislike for a course. Among the results, the survey  showed 87% of those who liked at least one science subject area gave liking to go outdoors as the main reason. Liking to see things live and grow was second at 71%.

Part I identifies personnel from the Agency for International Development (AID), other agencies, and international organizations who are concerned with the issue of female education in developing countries. Part II relates representative projects and studies dealing with women and education in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Near East. Part III assesses interest in an interagency forum  of meetings to discuss operational, not theoretical, problems related to women, education, and development. Part IV suggests steps by which the Women in Development office of AID can maximize its impact on AID educational policy. Part V summarizes major points covered in the report. (Author/AV)",

Opening sections of the report elaborate on problems of sex bias in printed curriculum materials, resistance to new methods and content on the part of traditionally conservative teachers, and distractions in open-air facilities. The remainder of the report presents 10 guidelines for curriculum revision. These include identification of a target  population, determination of relevancy of curriculum, incorporation of the needs of the population being served, assessment of indigenous culture for female role models, acquisition of baseline data to document economic and social ramifications of sex bias in education, effort to revise instead of replace existing curriculum, and statement of goals in objectively quantifiable terms.

The broad goals of the project were to: (1) analyze the dynamics of research utilization in social work; (2) identify the obstacles to research utilization, especially those that may exist in social work education; and (3) recommend ways of achieving effective research in social work. Chapter 2 reviews the development of research curricula in a number of social work degree programs over the decade ending with 1979. Chapter 3 identifies five models of research in social work and analyzes their implications for social work education. An initial report of a survey of social work students designed to have students  describe what they know and think about research is presented in chapter 4. Chapter 5 analyzes nine innovative approaches to research instruction in social work education and considers their implications for research preparation in social work. Chapter 6 summarizes some of the major themes that emerged in the project's regional conferences. Qualitative research methods are discussed in chapter 7. The final chapter discusses project recommendations. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the historian's method of handling evidence and explores some approaches to the improvement of college students' reasoning skills through the analysis of historical documents. The starting point in the development of the reasoning skills should be an exploration of the historian's task and the nature of the evidence, preferably in a small group discussion format. The student must be made to understand that an effective assessment of a piece of evidence can only be made against an informed background. Recognizing that a historical document does not exist in a vacuum, the student must inquire into the events surrounding the piece of evidence under consideration and place it in its social, political, and economic context. A concern for context also necessitates  an exploration of the background of the witness whose writings are under consideration in the classroom. The instructor should then raise the question of whether contemporary attitudes or the students' own values influence criticism and understanding of the source. The next step should be an intensified focus on the text itself. Careful attention should be devoted to the words, their meanings, and their implications. One good guideline for students is that they accept as historical fact only those particulars that may be confirmed by the testimony of two or more reliable sources. The instructor should then introduce the concept of reasoned interpretation as inherent in the historian's work. Suggestions for the use of historical documents in the classroom are made.

        "author":["Zeigler, Donald J."],
        "description":"Because of the rising real cost of energy, geographic patterns that have dominated the contemporary metropolitan landscape are in a state of change. A conceptual model of the contemporary and future metropolitan landscape is presented to stimulate thought about the changes which may evolve in the spatial organization of urban regions as the real price of energy continues to increase relative to the other factors of production. It was also designed to suggest changes which should be implemented by local metropolitan regions in order to ease the transition to the post-petroleum age. The graphic model consists of a map and a population density curve for the contemporary and future metropolitan area. Each side of the diagram represents an idealization of population densities, land  use patterns, and settlement structures displayed at a high level of generalization. Overall, the model shows that the contemporary metropolis has segrated land uses and is linear in growth, dispersed, dependent upon using automobiles, energy dependent, and energy wasteful. In contrast, the future metropolis has centralized energy growth, integrated land use, implemented mass transit lines, and is clustered, energy efficient, and energy self-reliant. Finally, this model has been and can be used as a learning activity, an inquiry exercise, in the geography energy college classroom. (Author/NE)",

        "description":"The purpose of this unit is to provide activities to help 7-12 grade students understand some of the physical handicaps and social problems that the elderly must face. The unit, designed to be used in six class sessions, is arranged into two parts. In the first, students vicariously experience what it is like to have some physical handicaps that are common to older people by participating in simulations in which they experience impairment of vision, hearing, and mobility. For example, students' eyes are covered and then they are asked to walk across a stage. Objectives are for students to feel empathy for elders with physical handicaps, describe specific physical problems that frequently come with advanced age, and cite ways in which good health habits can minimize the effects of  aging. The second set of activities deals with relations between older and younger persons. Students read a problem situation, such as, \"a retired factory worker with a heart condition must persuade a manager in an apartment building that he is capable of being a security guard in an apartment.\" Then students use these problem situations to prepare skits which they act out for the class and invited older guests. Objectives are to help students understand typical social problems faced by elders, cite ways in which society often places restrictions and demands on the behavior of older people, and recognize similarities in the way society often expects old and young people to behave. Skit situations and skit analysis handouts are included. Each unit activity contains an overview, a list of  objectives and materials needed, information on the advance preparation and teaching time required, and guidelines for each day's activity.

        "description":"A social studies educator responds to a paper by Glen Aikenhead titled \"Science in Social Studies.\" To remind science people that social issues are ultimately human as opposed to ultimately scientific, the author begins the paper with a discussion about the ways humans come to gain knowledge through science, religion, philosophy, and art. If science education is to deal correctly with social issues, it must deal with the full range of how humans come to resolve these issues. The author then addresses four issues raised by Aikenhead. First he disagrees with Aikenhead's portrayal of science as formal and his statement that the mission of science educators is to produce professional scientists. For a student to use science as a tool to help resolve social issues, science must become  more available to the student. Courses must not be just for the training of professional scientists. Secondly, the author disagrees with Aikenhead's portrayal of decision making--i.e., that decision making in society is done mostly by those in key power positions. Every person is a decision maker, including scientists and regular citizens. The third issue addressed is Aikenhead's statement that because the human environment is changing, humans are changing. Many social studies people disagree with this view. Science and society change, but the fundamental social issues remain essentially the same. The fourth issue addressed is the idea of the resolution of social issues. Scientific knowledge alone is not sufficient for solving social problems. Knowledge from several sources must be  utilized.

Its goals are to exchange information, materials, and personnel and to develop educational materials with a multicultural perspective. The paper is presented in five major sections. Section one explains the Consortium's origin, structure, membership, purpose, and activities. Section two defines the concept of international collaboration and outlines various methods of collaboration, stressing three important types of activity within  collaborative efforts. These are parallel, cooperative, and integrated activities. Section three discusses four key elements of any type of collaborative activity: commitment and decision making, location of activity, structure and roles of participating agencies, and size and scope of activity. The discussion related these elements to specific Consortium procedures. Section four describes exemplary Consortium activities of parallel, cooperative, and integrated natures. Section five offers comments on constraints of collaborative ventures and specific implications of the Consortium's experience. (AV)",

The unit begins by asking students to think about reasons why they enjoy music. A format for examining personal reasons for their listening habits evolves from this process. The materials then ask students to examine the idea that music is both a reflection and a reinforcer of cultural values. Three specific themes are explored and compared. Political socialization is examined and compared in the form of  patriotic music and its similarity in function. Attitudes toward work as reflected in music are examined. And third, students are asked to infer the phenomenon of change, first in their own society, then in Chinese society by comparing music in different time periods. The culminating activity of the unit asks students to look at the three societies as common members of a single planet. Students role-play visitors from outer space. Questions are structured to elicit similarities among earth creatures in terms of their music. (Author/RM)",

These two concepts were singled out as appropriate skills for students to develop because they bring into focus the enormous numbers involved in the future of the growth of energy demand and technology. Students are first given a five-question pretest to determine their understanding of the arithmetic of exponential growth. A simple exercise helps them see the relationship between a million and a billion. Other exercises include having students  draw a line graph of exponential growth and having them do some compound interest problems. Miniunit Two, \"Lateral Thinking for Creative Problem-Solving,\" attempts to present concrete ways to enhance the creative-thinking process for attacking specific personal and societal problems. The exercises in this second miniunit provide an opportunity for the practical use of lateral thinking so that students may acquire the lateral thinking habit. Lateral or \"zig-zag\" thinking, as it is sometimes called, is a means of broadening the scope of alternatives in problem solving by allowing oneself to think about the problems more than the solutions.

The source of the data in U.S. government sources includes surveys, censuses, and vital statistics. In general, children are defined as persons under 14 years old, and youth as persons 14 to 24 years old. Exceptions to these age divisions sometimes occur in the report because of data restrictions by age. The analyses trace changes among children and youth in the areas of population growth and distribution, migration, education, family and marital status, living arrangements, fertility, mortality and health, labor force participation, occupation, income and poverty status, voting, and crime and victimization. Some historical perspective on the  current socioeconomic conditions of American children and youth is also provided in the report. Selected topics are examined in time series beginning with 1950; trend data for other subjects are shown for a more recent time span. Some highlights of the report include the following: (1) in 1980, 92 million people (or about 4 out or every 10 Americans) were under 25; (2) a general movement away from early marriage has been noted in recent years; (3) 53 percent of all children under 18 in 1980 who were living in families had mothers in the labor force; (4) 43 percent of children under 6 had mothers who were working or seeking work; and (5) 50 percent of youths 18 to 24 voted in 1972 while only 40 percent voted in 1980.

        "description":"This final report describes the objectives, the evaluation design, and the findings of a project which provided training and support to elementary teachers to enable them to integrate drama, dance/movement, visual arts, and music into their daily academic programs. The project had two main components carried out by an arts team with members representing the various arts. The first component was demonstration lessons. Classroom teachers selected the art form in which they wished to participate. Presentations were made in the classroom by arts team members, of specific art activities in dance/movement, drama, and music, demonstrating ways in which the skills could be used to support and supplement other curriculum and developmental areas. The classroom teachers followed up the  presentations by providing opportunities for students to practice and refine the skills and understanding taught by the special teachers. The second component was an inservice course offered each semester to provide training for teachers. The course consisted of 15 sessions of two hours each. The project evaluation followed the Planning, Monitoring and Implementation (PMI) Model for Decision-Making which was developed by the Division of Quality Assurance, District of Columbia Public Schools. The PMI model is included in the appendices. Project staff developed tests to evaluate student progress. Findings indicate that the project was very successful. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses six steps which must be taken on a global level to put society on a sustainable path. Of the various steps none is more important than bringing population growth to a halt. The official United Nations medium-level population projects, used by planners throughout the world, show world population reaching some 10.5 billion before eventually stabilizing a century or more from now. It is recommended that the world population be stabilized at the six billion level by the year 2000. The second step to a sustainable society is protecting the croplands that are the main source of food worldwide. An understanding that soil loss eventually means less and costlier food is needed if a national soil conservation ethic is to be adopted. The third step is reforesting the  earth. The World Bank now supports community-based forestry projects along with the commercial timber ventures it has traditionally backed. The fourth step is to repair, reuse, or recycle goods. The fifth and sixth keys to the evolution of a sustainable society is the conservation of energy and the development of renewable energy. (RM)",

The &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; were used as a point of departure to promote discussion on the continued efficacy of the political principles and structures established in our country two hundred years ago. The &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; were a series of articles addressed to the people of the state of New York by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. They are important today because they contain perhaps the most complete and profound original record we have of the founders' thoughts on government and the American constitutional experiment. Each of the six seminars, attended by League participants, historians,  journalists, lawyers, political scientists, and public officials, was loosely structured around a core reading list including the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; and discussion questions sent to participants in advance. The Bill of Rights, Congressional performance, the American Presidency, judicial power, and American federalism were among the topics discussed. The pamphlets summarize the themes that emerged in the course of the discussions. The contents include edited seminar dialog, selected passages from &quot;The Federalist,&quot; questions for further discussion, and bibliographies of additional readings. A community guide suggests ways to get communities around the country to reexamine the &quot;Federalist Papers.&quot; (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Research on teacher thinking generally has failed to take into account teacher beliefs and understandings in both research methodology and in interpretation of data. Two models prevail in research on teacher thinking. The decision making model, which has undergone several modifications, tends to focus on explaining and understanding deliberate teacher activity. The second model for research on teacher thinking is the cognitive information process model, which focuses on how the teacher limits and structures the complex environment into what are called \"problem spaces,\" which essentially are simplifications of environmental components. A review of research dealing with teacher thinking reveals that inadequate attention to the beliefs of both the teacher and the researcher can  seriously weaken the inferences drawn. Problems arise when assumptions are made about teacher perceptions, when inadequate survey instruments are used, and when it is not recognized that teachers can have several widely varied and complex types of beliefs. An alternative methodology is being used to understand the various beliefs that drive teachers to plan and teach in different ways. The technique involves the identification, through interviews with teachers, of constructs or beliefs that form a grid that can be analyzed factorially. After discussion and analysis with the teacher, patterns of underlying factors emerge and lead to understanding of relationships and significant behaviors. This methodology could be used with lesson observation and stimulated recall to produce an effective  research tool on teacher thinking. (FG)",

        "description":"Two hundred and eight junior and senior high school English teachers responded to a survey on variables related to the teachers as individuals, their educational backgrounds and professional training, their current teaching situations and other professional activities, and their attitudes toward selected educational issues. Eight hundred fifty-one teachers of other subjects taught at the schools were considered together at each level (junior or senior high) to form groups for comparison with the English teachers. A demographic profile emerged that indicated that English teachers as a group were slightly older than teachers of other subjects, were predominantly white females, and were likely to be politically more liberal. Their median incomes did not differ significantly from  those of other teachers, and their reasons for entering teaching were similar to the reasons of other teachers. A higher percentage of English teachers reported that their career expectations had been met and that they would enter teaching again. The majority of them believed themselves to be well trained for their work. While there was little difference in the amount of education and training between English teachers and others, English teachers appeared to be motivated more often by personal growth and less frequently by salary advance. In measuring professional attitudes, English teachers considered together as a group appeared to take their teaching more seriously and were more involved in their subject than were other teachers. The English teachers emerged as less traditional in  their responses to statements of educational beliefs than other teachers. In comparison with other teachers, they were less supportive of strong teacher control and discipline and of an emphasis on basic skills. Generally, English teachers held similar views on educational issues and differed mainly from others in that they were more seriously focused on the intrinsic aspects of teaching. (JD)",

        "description":"Classroom climate has been found to predict a significant portion of the variance in student achievement, independent of student background and intelligence quotient scores. This study sought to more clearly define classroom climate by determining to what extent climate measures teacher characteristics, student characteristics, and classroom characteristics such as curriculum and class size. After delineating the domains measured by classroom climate and establishing a climate construct, concrete and manipulable variables that covaried with the climate scale were identified. Data were obtained from 895 junior and senior high school classes. Students and teachers responded to questionnaires and interviews, and each class was observed on three separate occasions. Attention focused  upon classroom climate variables of: (1) teacher concern, punitiveness, authoritarianism, favoritism, enthusiasm, and clarity; (2) student decision-making, peer attitudes, competitiveness, cliqueness, satisfaction, compliance, and apathy; (3) classroom physical appearance; and (4) instructional practices: knowledge of results, task difficulty, and organization. Evidence from the study indicated that the climate construct is affected by a wide range of variables that merge together in the classroom context, and the construct is most affected by the variables most proximate to the classroom. Two major findings support this evidence. First, climate scores are sensitive to variation from several domains. The background and beliefs of the students and teachers and the conditions within the  classroom all affect the climate of the class. However, these variables accounted for, at most, 18 percent of the variance in the climate scores and were not considered a threat to the construct's validity. Second, teacher perceptions of classroom occurences were closely related to the climate scores. Five appendices provide additional information. (JD)",

        "description":"Classroom variables and student track levels were studied to determine the impact of tracking and the resulting differences in student educational experiences. A secondary analysis of nationwide data collected for \"A Study of Schooling\" was used in an analysis of the classroom experiences of students in 297 secondary school English and mathematics classes. The investigation focused on how track levels differed in three major aspects of daily classroom life (curricular content, instructional practice, social relationships and interactions) and in selected student attitudes. Tracked classes were compared with heterogeneous classes on the same dimensions. An uneven racial distribution was found among tracks, particularly in schools where minority students were poor. The data  analysis indicated that education in the schools studied was not available to all on an equal basis. Low track students were least likely to experience the quantity and quality of instruction associated with achievement. Teacher student relationships and other classroom interactions in low track classes focused on punitive and negative expressions, with low levels of peer esteem and high levels of class dissonance. Although low track students were as satisfied with their schools as their high track peers, they had the lowest self esteem, leading to the supposition that school processes contribute to societal inequalities. Heterogeneous classes were considerably more advantaged in terms of classroom content and processes than many of the average and nearly all of the low track classes,  further supporting the theory of cultural reproduction. Sixty tables present study results, distributions, and classifications, and appendices present classroom learning environment scales, supplementary findings, and the degree of student satisfaction in the four samples.

        "description":"In this report, the 25 secondary and 13 elementary schools participating in \"A Study of Schooling\" are described in two ways. First, the emphasis given to academics and vocational subjects in the curriculum is estimated and compared with that of the other schools at the same level. Second, tracking policies and practices at each of the schools are described. These school-by-school descriptions provide a look at one aspect of the schooling context: how students at schools were stratified and separated according to their abilities, achievement, or expectations for their futures. Information was gathered on five dimensions: (1) extent, the percentages of classes which were tracked at the school; (2) pervasiveness, the number of subject areas at the school which were tracked; (3)  flexibility, whether students were tracked subject-by-subject or across more than one subject on the same criteria; (4) mobility, the amount of student movement among tracks and the direction of that movement; and (5) locus of control, the primary decision makers in student track placement. In describing the tracking policies in each of the secondary schools, an overview is presented, followed by descriptions of the extent and pervasiveness of tracking, student flexibility, and mobility within the system, the rationale offered for student grouping, and sample classes that fit into the tracking system. The 13 elementary schools were examined for the extent, pervasiveness, structure, and rationale of tracking. It was observed in the elementary schools that, while few classrooms were  homogeneous, grouping for instructional purposes was almost always used to some extent. Tables are appended displaying the percentage of full time equivalent teachers in subject areas in the secondary schools, an estimate of the extent of tracking in the schools, and the percentage of tracked classes in the secondary school samples.

        "description":"The relationship between secondary school students' socioeconomic status and ethnicity and their participation in vocational education programs was examined. Analysis of data from 25 secondary schools focused on three questions concerning: (1) the emphasis on vocational programs in non-white, ethnically or racially mixed, and white secondary schools; (2) percentage of non-white students in vocational education courses; and (3) the substance of vocational programs at non-white, mixed, and white schools. Each school's vocational program was described in terms of the teacher resources allocated to it, the content and format of courses, and the race/ethnicity of students taking the courses. Data analysis indicated that white and non-white students participated in fairly equivalent  ways in vocational education. Non-white schools and mixed schools were not more vocational in nature than were white schools. Non-white students in mixed schools did not appear to be consistently enrolled in disproportionate numbers in vocational programs. However, a substantive difference emerged in the content of vocational courses offered to white and non-white students. It appeared that socioeconomic status was associated with differences in the types of programs offered. Non-whites and poor whites were being directed in their vocational training toward futures in lower-class social and economic positions. Vocational skills taught to middle and upper class white students were regarded as useful regardless of occupational status. Business courses offered to whites emphasized managerial  and financial skills. Those offered to non-white and poor students taught clerical or retail skills. It is hypothesized that vocational education plays a role in reinforcing the low economic and social position of non-whites in American society. (JD)",

        "description":"This report describes the improvement of the University of Michigan Elementary Teacher Education program evaluation system through analysis of computerized longitudinal data generated by student self reports from 1977 to 1980. Students enrolled in the elementary certification program received a list of 96 instructional competencies and were given the opportunity to report on them in three dimensions: knowledge, demonstration, and confidence. They were asked to report their perceptions of their competencies at three points in time: before and after their methods-practicum and after student teaching. Cooperating teachers and university supervisors completed feedback forms for a reduced number of the competencies during and after each of two major field experiences. Provision was  made on the report forms for assessment of the difficulty of achieving mastery in each competency. The competencies were in eight content areas: (1) planning; (2) establishing goals and objectives; (3) pupil evaluation; (4) using educational materials and equipment; (5) selecting and organizing classroom activities; (6) using teaching methods and strategies; (7) classroom management; and (8) providing pupil guidance and services. A description is given of the methods of establishing the validity of the competencies, and descriptive statistics are provided on the standardized mean scores for the three dimensions of instructional competency at the three points in time. A sample student report form is included as well as the form used by the supervising teachers. Following an analysis of the  data obtained from this longitudinal study, the assessment instruments for the program were refined by revising some competency statements and by providing for more effective feedback to the students.

A section on the purpose and development of the laboratories provides an annotated bibliography on regional educational laboratories from 1966 through 1976. Based on NWREL experiences and interviews with staff members in other laboratories, the critical ingredients of a regional educational laboratory were identified as: (1) clarify purpose; (2) define region; (3) choose an operational site; (4) create institutional framework; (5) choose directors; (6) select staff; (7) organize for work; (8) identify  needs; and (9) specify research and development functions. Each of these elements is briefly defined, followed by examples from the NWREL model, reactions and comments from NWREL constituents, and perspectives from seven other regional laboratories. Along with these descriptions are four discussions on how to build the constituencies who use the services provided by the laboratories. Recommendations are made for planners of new regional research and development centers. The appendix includes tables displaying annual NWREL organization charts, membership patterns, and its board member profile, from l966 to l976. (JD)",

        "description":"An analysis is presented of a review of research reports on the efficacy of direct instruction in fostering basic skills development. The review process began with a topical literature search using the ERIC database and conventional library methods. Articles and other documents were analyzed and abstracted into &quot;Item Reports.&quot; Each of the items was judged against a set of pre-established criteria and ranked on a five-point scale. The collection of Item Reports was examined to identify issues which could be stated as hypotheses. Each hypothesis became the subject of a &quot;Decision Display.&quot; The Decision Displays were created by sorting the Item Reports into those which supported or negated the hypothesis. A Summary Report was then generated from consideration of the Decision Displays  and the file of Item Reports. For this analysis, 33 relevant documents were selected for examination, from which four hypotheses emerged: (1) Use of the Distar (Direct Instruction System for Teaching and Remediation) programs with disadvantaged, primary level children has a positive effect on basic skills achievement and affective development; (2) Use of the teaching strategies and behaviors collectively termed &quot;direct instruction&quot; has a positive effect on the basic skills achievement of primary and upper elementary school children; (3) Higher achievement results when skills and concepts are taught directly than when they are presented indirectly or not at all; and (4) Direct instruction is inappropriate for some educational settings, especially those involving older students and learning  activities beyond basic skills development. The research documents strongly supported these hypotheses. This report includes the Item Reports on the 33 documents, the Decision Displays justifying the formation of the hypotheses, and an interpretive summary of findings. Recommendations are offered based on the findings and conclusions. (JD)",

All respondents maintained some knowledge of the course components, although the amount of implementation of skills learned through the project decreased over a three-year period. In spite of a  generally positive view of Project T.E.A.C.H., fewer than half of the respondents expressed an active desire to pursue its sequel, Project P.R.I.D.E.

Data was collected from the responses to questionnaires by 2,478 high school seniors, 387  preservice teachers, and 315 inservice teachers in ten southeastern states. Among the major findings were that 40 percent of the high school seniors interested in teaching made the decision prior to age 15. Thirty-four percent of the preservice teachers did not become interested in teaching until after they entered college. Seventy-one percent of the inservice teachers would encourage a capable student to enter teaching. All respondents perceived salary, discipline problems, and working conditions as discouraging factors. Some aspects of teaching were perceived more positively by females than males, and blacks generally perceived teaching in a more positive manner than whites. The factor that best independently discriminated whether students would consider teaching was whether or not  other individuals had discussed the possibility with them.

        "description":"Part I summarizes data on the final version of the Student Self-Report, an affective, multiple-chioce questionnaire developed to measure the kinds of behavioral and attitudinal chanqes which elementary counselors most often attempt to produce when providing services to students in Grades 3-6. Part I contains reliability and validity data for the instrument, a model of affective development resulting from a path analysis done on these data, a measure of the traits exhibited by students referred for counseling services, and a measure of the effects of counseling services. The measure does not consistently show gains for students receiving counseling services. Nevertheless the data provide insight into the development of affective problems in elementary children and the way in which  counseling programs address these concerns. A parallel instrument was developed to measure similar affective content for children in Grades 1-2. Part II presents validity and reliability data collected in developing a pilot version of the Student Self-Report. In general, results suggest that this instrument measures the same attitudes and behaviors measured by the upper level instrument. However, the instrument is difficult for primary children and invalid results are produced for many of these students. (Author/AL)",

The material developed in earlier stages was pilot-tested in Phase Three in 26 departments that represented the fields of English, biology, and psychology. The major purpose of this study was to investigate the instrument developed in Stage Two in terms of technical soundness, and the feasibility of its use in the admissions process. This study represents the transition of the use of documented accomplishments to predict graduate school achievement from a research phase to a more operational phase during which the instrument would be tested in actual admissions situations. The departments were asked to administer the  instrument to their newly enrolled graduate students. Straightforward descriptive and correlational analyses of the responses to the inventory were conducted to describe characteristics of the students and the instruments and identify the most reliable clusters of items and indices of accomplishment. Students were followed up at the end of their first year to assess their graduate school accomplishments and their relationship to previous attainments. Students' reactions to the inventory were obtained by interview and by additional questions at the end of the inventory. (Author/CM)",

Testing to evaluate educational innovations and experimental projects is criticized as being too narrow in scope for fair evaluation. Test use to guide teachers is seen as exercising a limiting effect in the classroom. The first recommendation is to develop equivalent tests better tailored to cultural background. A further suggestion is to better fit testing to educational objectives by increased research on criterion-referenced skills tests; application of information-handling  technology; and by clarification of basic testing concepts for educators, parents and policy makers. Appropriate test use is discussed. Merging testing with teaching is recommended, using cognitive science analyses, interactive automated teaching-testing and involvement of teachers and scholars in testmaking. Expanded research and development of testing-learning models are suggested within natural classroom situations. A partial list of new test strategies, references, comments and an appendix of subject papers are given. (CM)",

Data from a sample of 766 students and their 34 teachers supported the ICEQ's internal consistency, discriminant validity, and ability to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. Use of ICEQ scales as predictor variables revealed, first, that student perceptions accounted for a significant increment in the variance in  affective but not cognitive outcomes and, second, that students achieved cognitive aims better when in their preferred classroom environment. Also, certain factors in the school-level environment were found to be associated with dimensions of classroom individualization. (Author/GK)",

The self-rating scale contained six vocational/educational aptitudes. These were general intelligence, verbal, numerical, spatial, form perception, and clerical aptitudes. A seven point rating scale of very high to very low was included for each aptitude. Components analyses were carried out on each six by correlation matrix and canonical correlation analysis was used to identify maximal relationships between weighted linear components of self-rated and tested aptitudes. Two separate components analyses  revealed the major proportion of variance can be accounted for by one factor on which all the scales loaded highly. The high degree of congruence between the first two components in the unrotated analyses was revealed by Tucker coefficients of 0.992 and 0.794. The size of the maximum canonical correlation (0.58) indicated some overlap between self-ratings and test scores. (Author/DWH)",

Responses to 12 questions were identified as indicative of attitudes toward deschooling education. These attitudes were explained by means of patterns exhibited within the responses given to some questions which best discriminate between people for and against deschooling education. Because limited relevant information is available on this subject, the approach taken was to build an a-posteriori index to describe the attitude under study. The index was obtained by running a canonical correlation between a set containing information from the 12 attitudinal questions, and another set containing information from 52  explanatory questions that were most relevant to the study. This analysis produced canonical variates and each of these was taken as the index for each set. Based upon actual distribution of index values, subjects were associated with a &quot;clearly against,&quot;&quot;clearly for,&quot; or &quot;other&quot; attitude toward deschooling education. A discriminant analysis was run on the 52 &quot;explanatory&quot; questions to assess which of these could best account for the difference between groups.

This review on competency testing programs and competency based education (CBE) covers several areas. The emphasis on educational accountability has increased during the past 28 years. CBE consists of three elements. Minimum competencies should be defined by how effectively students can function in life roles. The attainment of specific competencies should be a standard for graduation. A summary of what constitutes successful performance of competencies should be included in the certification process. Activities of other school districts in this area are discussed. The  alternatives to be tested in a competency based testing program include basic skills, school subjects, life role competency areas, and basic skills applied in school subjects and life role competency areas. The various methods to assess minimum competency in these areas is discussed. An illustration is given of how one district began its program as well as a listing of benefits and problems.

The principal objectives of the research project were to assess the vocational aptitudes of a nationally representative sample of youth 18 through 23 years of age and to develop current national norms for the Department of Defense enlistment test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) was used as an index for comparing the test performance of civilian and military groups. Comparisons are between the 1980 youth group and the World War II reference population, military accessions, and subgroups within the youth population on the basis of age, sex,  race, education level, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. The results of this study will be useful in addressing the issue of the compatibility between complex and demanding military weapon systems and personnel capabilities. That is, if a national emergency necessitates the reintroduction of conscription, military policymakers must be able to establish entrance standards and induction quotas that are compatible with manpower resources. To plan for possible mobilization, the Department of Defense must be able to relate attributes, abilities, and other characteristics of the national youth population to requirements for military manpower.

Data Collection instruments and procedures have been designed to both validate the constructs upon which the Connecticut model is based and to provide information for school improvement. The characteristics that describe instructionally effective schools include a safe and orderly climate, a common sense of purpose or mission, strong instructional leadership, high expectations and a sense of efficacy, a substantial amount of time spent on focused teaching and learning, and purposeful parent and community involvement. Efforts in this area are designed to extend and develop the present  research base and to establish a solid foundation on which to build focused school improvement projects. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"Students' achievement in school is undoubtedly multi-faceted. Research has suggested that one important variable in student achievement is the interaction between the teacher and the student. Such interactions may serve to enhance or diminish the achievement of an individual student or group of students. Results of anonymous questionnaires given to 80 fifth grade and sixth graders are reported along with data obtained from teacher ratings of each student's abilities. On the basis of the teacher ratings, high and low expectancy groups were created. Responses to items asking for student perceptions of classroom interactions in general showed no significant differences between the two expectancy groups. These data suggest that the investigation of student perceptions of differential  treatment by teachers of those expected to do well and poorly is not as informative as previous research suggests it should be. Other findings are also discussed along with the implication of the research for future work in this area. (Author/GK)",

The study is based upon a review of literature, discussions with the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Research on Evaluation Program, and visits to SEAs in California, Montana and Washington. The main findings of the study deal with the current practice of evaluation in SEAs, and with management metaphors which throw light upon the evaluation unit considered as a supplier of services within the SEA, and upon the unit's clients who are its customers for such services. The central theme of the study is that the basic paradigm underlying SEA evaluation is in the process of change, moving from the big study, advanced methodology glamor of the late 1960s to an  organization-based function supporting SEA management in a variety of ways, alongside other staff specialists. The study suggests that in the long term the SEA evaluation function will condense into two sets of roles, namely, that of evaluation systems analysis, and a consulting role. The study then goes on to identify three possible intervention strategies: (1) clarification and confirmation of the new paradigm; (2) assistance to the supply side of evaluation services; and (3) the building up of informed and understanding demand among evaluation clients.

Section 2 presents a brief critical examination of the notion of objectivity in evaluation, and introduces the concept of fairness as an alternative focus for qualitative evaluation. In Section 3, there is a discussion of the ways in which the notion of fairness might be applied when an evaluation is being conducted. The issues addressed in this section include selecting the general style of the evaluation, formulating the questions to be answered, deciding on the sources of information, selecting methods for information collection, analyzing the information collected, and reporting the findings. The focus of Section 4 is the implications of adopting a&quot;fairness&quot; approach, for funding bodies and policy makers; for program participants and for evaluators. Some cost implications are also discussed. Finally, Section 5 draws together some conclusions about the use of a &quot;fairness&quot; criterion in educational evaluation. (Author/GK)",

How useful photography is to evaluators may be viewed as a function of how important they think descriptions and interpretations of program operations and activities are rather than learning outcomes.

Chapter 3 examines the manipulation of the frame with respect to its stratified design, while the actual school selection procedures and results are reviewed in  chapter 4. Chapter 5 then describes the construction of the student sampling frame, the selection of students, and those results. The last two chapters examine the calculations of the sample weights and the sampling errors. (Author/GK)",

The results indicate that the negative picture of use prevalent in recent literature stems from the unrealistic expectation that local decision-makers will behave in a classically rational manner. Such a view ignores the political settings of real world evaluation use where the non-use of results may constitute a viable and &quot;rational&quot; alternative. Empirical research has suggested that results are used and in a variety of ways. Factors that have not been demonstrated to affect use include the methodological quality of the evaluations and the timeliness of its report. Factors that do seem to affect use include the report source, content, and receiver; political considerations;  and the &quot;personal factor,&quot; i.e. the presence of at least one person who cares about the evaluation and its results. A collaborative approach to evaluation capitalizes on the factors that have been shown to affect use, although the practicability of such an approach at the local level may make it unfeasible.

The following recommendations for improving access to resettlement information are discussed: (1) dissemination of a bimonthly information  resource report; (2) creation of a refugee resettlement information library; (3) production of a practitioners' information resource handbook; (4) development of practitioner information exchange networks; and (5) development of an information services task force.

Indications of what has and has not worked in other districts are based on experts' recommendations, on case studies from other communities, and on the findings of a research project that examined school desegregation in 52 American cities. Chapter one describes some publications that can serve as practical guides to school desegregation. Chapter two examines the historical and legal context of school desegregation by reviewing early court cases and deseqregation policy standards that emerged from them, changes that have taken place in schools over the years, and the issues of white flight  and metropolitan plans in connection with desegregation. Chapter three deals with strategies and techniques, and reviews findings from experience and research of practices which yield the best results. Chapter four discusses issues and problems involved in busing. Chapter five considers the public leadership role in school desegregation. A concluding chapter summarizes the handbook. Appendices include some guiding principles for desegregation planners, a directory of desegregation assistance centers, and information on how to locate court decisions. (Author/MJL)",

A diaqram outlining the evolution of Federal civil rights' mandates, a  comprehensive procedural compliance check list, and an outline of the deadlines for section 504 compliance are also included. Each procedural regulation is reviewed in terms of its application to Title VI (race and national origin), Title IX (sex), Section 504 (handicap), and the Office of Civil Rights Guidelines for Vocational Education. Since the Lau remedies for students with limited English proficiency have some regulatory application to educational institutions, they are also covered as an adjunct to Title VI. (Author/JCD)",

The following conclusions are offered: (1) Schools can improve the achievement level of language minority children through proper programs. (2) There is not sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of transitional bilingual education to justify the Federal government's exclusive reliance on this method of instruction. Therefore, each school district should decide what type of special program is most appropriate locally. (3) Evidence does not support the necessity of teaching nonlanguage subjects in the child's native tongue, thouqh it is necessary to structure the curriculum  differently from that of English monolingual students if the subject matter is to be taught to non-English speakers. (4) Immersion programs, which involve structured curricula in English, show promising results and should be given more attention in program development. (5) The Title VII program for bilingual education must take steps to improve the quality of its program evaluations. (Author/GC)",

The report is designed to provide policy makers with: (1) an assessment of student achievement on the California Achievement Test (CAT) and the Criterion Referenced English Syntax Test (CREST) administered in April and August 1981 and January 1982; (2) descriptive information about program implementation; and (3) analyses which may affect pending program design and funding decisions in the fiscal 1983 budget. Although program implementation is reported to have been completed smoothly and effectively, problems in administrative orqanization, pupil identification procedures, and teacher training and selection are said to  need further improvement. It is suggested that errors in the placement of limited English proficient holdovers may be attributed to the inconsistent and inadequate criteria for determininq who should take the CAT and who should take the CREST.

The center's activities include the following components: (1) individualized instruction; (2) positive motivation;  (3) continuous assessment of student progress; and (4) parent participation in classroom instruction and educational planning. The results of the evaluation indicate that most of the components of the behavior analysis model were implemented at the two adoption sites surveyed and that eleven new adoptions were achieved. Likewise, information about the model was disseminated through a variety of channels and resulted in an expanded audience. It is suggested, however, that more follow-up training time is needed for pre-service training workshops. (JCD)",

The project, implemented in a laboratory school setting and continuously monitored, is described as a reading instruction program for children in kindergarten and in first to third grade. The report provides a historical background on the multidisciplinary research that led to the development of the program, explains evaluation procedures followed, and discusses results of evaluation obtained as of the reporting period. A brief description of a typical morning in a KEEP classroom leads to discussion of two program components, the direct teaching of comprehension through the  reading program, and the social organization of the classroom. The laboratory teacher's role in program development and implementation and teacher training processes are then examined. Included as appendices are an explanation of the Kamehameha Reading Objective System developed to guide teacher planning and program monitoring, samples of teacher training materials used in the program, and a detailed list of specific program goals for teachers and for pupils.

The factbook concludes that Title I programs are effective in improving reading and mathematics skills for Title I students, in increasino test score gains of low achievers, in getting extra funds to poor schools, and in providing a model for designing state programs for low achievino and poor students. It is reported that the major services provided by Title I funds include supplementary proqrams for educationally deprived children, remedial readinq and  mathematics, special teachers and aides, smaller classes, more instructional hours, varied instructional approaches, special needs of migrant children, and services for handicapped children. The factbook reveals that in 1979-80, participants in Title I programs included approximately 5.2 million students; about 241,827 teachers, professional staff, and support staff; and parents who served in advisory councils and as home tutors, aides, and organizers. Also discussed are policy considerations for the continued improvement of services for educationally disadvantaged children. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This is Volume I of a two-volume report of a study on the exchange and use of knowledge for school improvement in three paired educational systems in Boston, Massachusetts. The pairings, which involved the collaboration of a college/university with one or more of the Boston public schools, were among 26 such collaborative arrangements mandated by court order in 1975 as part of Boston's desegregation program. The pairs investigated were: (1) Harris University-Boston Public Schools District A; (2) Massachusetts College-District B; and (3) Dunfey University-District C. The study investigated the process of interorganizational collaboration on school improvement projects within each of the paired systems. Case studies of the systems investigated are contained in the second volume of  this report. This volume explains the study purposes, defines key terms, and discusses the study approach. A conceptual model of the interorganizational process derived from the case studies is described, followed by an application of the model in cross case analysis. The report concludes that in varying degrees, knowledge was exchanged and used in the pairings primarily through face-to-face rather than written communication. Such knowledge exchange/use was found to be governed by the interaction of the systems' structural arrangements, history and environment, and the hierarchy of needs and resources. Details of cross-coding schemes, a bibliography, and a directory of similar collaboratives are included as appendices. (Author/MJL)",

The pairings, which involved the collaboration of a college/university with one or more of the Boston public schools in carrying out school improvement programs, were among 26 such collaborative arrangements mandated by court order in 1975 as part of Boston's desegregation program. The first volume of the report provides background information, describes the conceptual model and methodology used in the study, and summarizes conclusions and recommendations. This volume contains reports on the case studies of the three paired svstems. The pairs investigated were: (1) Harris University-District A; (2)  Massachusetts College-District B; and (3) Dunfey University-District C. Each case study describes the paired institutions and their settings, explains the study methodology, describes projects studies in each paired system, provides a cross project analysis of the collaborative processes involved, analyzes the nature of roles/functions that evolved from the collaboration, and examines factors that contributed to program success. The case studies conclude with a discussion of the types of knowledge exchange that occurred within the pairing-sponsored projects. (Author/MJL)",

The pairings were among 26 such collaborative arrangements mandated bv court order in 1975 as part of Boston's desegregation program. This summary is based on a two-volume final report, Volume I being a cross case analysis based on case studies of the three systems contained in Volume II. The method used to examine how school improvement ideas are effectively put into practice through interorganizational collaboration focused on projects being implemented within each of the paired systems. Analysis showed that  knowledge exchange/use for school improvement in these interorganizational systems was governed largely by an interaction of the systems' structural arrangements, their history and environment, interorganizational processes, and the hierarchy of needs and resources. The study found that knowledge flow was largely dependent on personal interaction rather than on written communication, and the predominant type of educational knowledge often exchanged was situational in nature, although there was also a flow of craft knowledge and research knowledge.

        "description":"This research investigated the phenomenon of underrepresentation of blacks in advanced level secondary school courses in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Initial interviews revealed that the problem of racial imbalance in advanced level courses was not one of identifying black gifted youth or of offering attractive programs for them, but of black children choosing not to take demanding advanced course work. A comprehensive literature review and surveys among teachers, students, school personnel, parents, and residents in the Shaker Heights school district and in other school districts provided information on perceptions of the major problems in the advanced placement system, yielded suggestions for improving the system, and examined the factors thought to influence student selection of  courses and curriculum. Among the variables identified as influential in black students' course selection were teacher, parent, counselor, and peer influence, student motivation, school success and failure, and lack of information about options. Exploration of educational interventions to correct racial imbalance in high level course enrollments provided several options for support and development programs, and indicated the need for a strong commitment to educational intervention strategies on the part of the local school board.

        "description":"Four television stations were studied and potential audiences surveyed in Los Angeles, California, to explore the extent of ethnic television, determine how its content reflects community influence, and examine viewers' attitudes toward ethnic television broadcasting. Fourteen ethnic oroups were represented in ethnic television during the year-long period of the study, with Spanish programs comprising the majority of ethnic broadcasts. Programs were imported from the native countries of specific ethnic groups or developed locally under the responsibility of ethnic consultants or private groups. The multiethnic orientation of stations was derived from station policy influenced by economic and cultural considerations. Commercial support, community interest, and stations' scheduling  demands affected the amount and content of broadcasts. Programs incorporated local affairs to promote ethnic involvement in broadcasts. Among ethnic group members interviewed, a third had watched programs designed for their groups, but less than three percent preferred such programming over general television fare. However, there appeared to be a demand for more ethnic programs. The data suggest that smaller scale television operations are more likely to involve the community. It is predicted that changes in the nature of ethnicity on television will continue with developments in general television production. (Author/MJL)",

Reynolds cites P.L. 96-247, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, as an important legal basis for implementing the Department's correctional activities. Reynolds asserts that, before the Department can act on complaints involving correctional facilities, sufficient evidence exists of basic and fundamental deprivations; the Act leaves no room for legal exploration of constitutional rights in otherwise unobjectionable facilites. According to Reynolds, the Reagan administration supports a policy that both gives States the  primary responsibility for correcting unconstitutional conditions in State institutions and emphasizes negotiation to correct problems before resorting to litigation. He illustrates litigation alternative with the case of Chapman v. Rhodes, which demonstrated that a complaint of overcrowding in a correctional facility should be determined in the context of overall conditions rather than judged an isolated factor. Finally, he discusses the Department policy on appropriate remedies for overcrowding in correctional facilities. (MJL)",

It follows that citizen satisfaction with services delivered might vary from sector to sector within a city. A study of residents' satisfaction with trash collection and police service delivery in Wilmington, Delaware, indicates that analysis of data by subarea provides information on variations in citizen satisfaction that were not apparent when the data were analyzed on an aggregate, city-wide level. The study suggests that decision makers who formulate policy on the basis of data should be aware that analyzing data from different  perspectives provides different types of information. Furthermore, the study implies that by collecting and analyzing public service data accordinq to well-defined subareas rather than by considering data in the aggregate, policy makers can plan for appropriate service delivery measures that maintain or increase citizen satisfaction.

        "author":["Brumberg, Stephan F."],
        "description":"This paper explores the effects on both immigrants and schools of the historical encounter between New York City's public schools and East European Jewish immigrants to the city. The immigrants' background, their reasons for migrating, and the lifestyles that emerged from their efforts to adapt to American life are described. The paper examines the educational experiences and expectations that the Jews brought with them, the factors that influenced them to send their children to public schools in overwhelming numbers, and immigrant students' perceptions of how schools changed them. It is suggested that with the incorporation of numerous Jewish immigrants into the New York City public schools, the schools increasingly took on the task of social transformation to Americanize the  alien poor, and in the process underwent transformation themselves by broadening their scope, becoming more practical in orientation, and reflecting a culture that encouraged public conformity but generally tolerated private diversity. Within that culture, immigrant Jews are perceived to have emerged as a diverse group, comprising some who cut all ties to the traditional community, others who sought reaffirmation of tradition, and still others who sought to synthesize the secular world of the schools and the spiritual world of their past.

        "description":"Case studies of a black boy and a white boy from a kindergarten class in a desegregated school examined the effects of teacher attitudes on students' conformity to classroom behavior norms. Both boys had been referred to the school psychologist by their teacher because of their disruptive classroom behavior. Information collected on the two boys included their family background, the psychologist's diagnosis and observations, and researcher observations of the boys' behavior and interactions with the teacher. The findings showed that the teacher appeared to perceive the boys differently, behaved differently toward them, and tended to direct more positive actions for behavior improvement toward the white boy. It was suggested that stricter controls were placed on the white boy's  behavior with the expectation that he would eventually control himself. It was further stated that the black boy's behavior was allowed to escalate to the point of requiring special measures (a Learning Adjustment Class): the underlying expectation being that there was no point in controlling him because his status (race, socioeconomic background) conspired against him. It was further suggested that the differences in treatment were not an isolated example of personality clashes, but instead reflected institutional racism in the wider sociocultural context of the school, where standards of behavior are applied differently to white and black students.

        "description":"The inability of the schools to meet the educational needs of economically disadvantaged minority children has prompted efforts to identify alternatives to the traditional school curriculum. One such alternative emphasizes the use of the arts in developing basic academic skills. Research indicates that the arts can be used to develop perceptual skills which lead to complex and subtle views of reality that disadvantaged learners often fail to develop; that the arts can promote understanding of relationships basic to reading comprehension by providing opportunities for students to deal with abstractions; and that experience with the arts helps develop visual sophistication in disadvantaged students. In addition, motivation and enjoyment essential to learning are provided. Several  educational programs in which arts activities have been integrated have demonstrated success in improving achievement and enhancing learning. Successful programs are generally characterized by the presence of an integrated curriculum, clearly defined objectives, teacher training, initial student assessment, an effective teacher-student ratio, sufficient time and facilities, and ongoing evaluation. While the growing body of research supports the significance of the arts in the education of the disadvantaged, other questions concerning the actual relationship between the arts and the dynamic forces in a school require further study.

The program, which offered intensive individualized reading instruction through the integration of a total arts program with a total reading program, served elementary school children, including some special education students, who were reading at least 1 year below grade level. The report presents the results of program evaluation in four components: (1) assessment of reading achievement of 1,066 regular students; (2) assessment of reading achievement of 94 special education students; (3) assessment of communications efforts between L.T.R.T.A. program staff and teachers in students' sending classes; and (4) analysis of  the impact of the L.T.R.T.A. program's involvement in the National Diffusion Network (NDN), a system supported by the U.S. Department of Education to provide assistance to educational programs in materials acquisition and in the incorporation of improved practices in programs. Descriptions of programs and recommendations based on evaluation results are presented. (Author/MJL)",

The project, which was funded under Title VII of the Elementary Secondary Education Act, provided instruction in English as a Second Language and in native language skills for limited proficient students. Bilingual instruction in science, mathematics, and social studies was provided for Spanish speaking students, while those from French Creole (Haitian), Italian, or Portuguese backgrounds were placed in mainstream classes for content area instruction, but were eligible for tutorial support through the bilingual program. Some students whose dominant language was English were involved in the program to facilitate social integration. The report describes the  setting in which the program was carried out; student characteristics; program history, funding, organization, goals and objectives; instructional content and procedures; strategies to avoid participant dropouts; curriculum development; staff development; and parent/community involvement. Student response to the program is determined by examining students' attendance, participation in extracurricular activities, achievement of honors/awards, post-graduation plans, and general behavior patterns. Evaluation results presented include student achievement in English language development; growth in mastery of their native language; achievement in mathematics, social studies, science, and native language arts; and student attendance rates.

Two interrelated types of research were used to accomplish the project's research objectives: deductive analysis and field study, with the deductive analysis of the Vocational Education Act (VEA) and related statutes, rules, and regulations used to identify the issues to be addressed during the field study. It was found that the VEA legal framework consisted of the following--a goal &quot;to assist states in ensuring that all persons in all communities  have ready access to vocational training or retraining which is of high quality, which is realistic in light of actual or anticipated opportunities for gainful employment, and which is suited to their needs, interests, and ability to benefit from such training&quot; and five major objectives; three parts, encompassing state vocational education programs (general provisions, basic grants, program improvement and supportive services, programs for the disadvantaged, and consumer and homemaking education programs); national programs, including bilingual programs and emergency assistance for remodeling vocational facilities; definitions; state administration and planning; funds distributions; and civil rights obligations. The study concluded that there are six principles which relate to the  achievement of compliance with and enforcement of the provisions of the VEA, and other laws, and that these principles are being met with varying degrees of success.

        "description":"As part of a study of the Vocational Education Act (VEA) (see note), the clarity, consistency, and adequacy of the VEA fiscal requirements were examined. Six statutory provisions were identified. Three of these provisions govern the distribution of federal VEA funds from the state to local recipients: the application approval priorities, which require that states give priority to applicants proposing new programs located in depressed areas; the two funds distribution factors which states are to use to distribute VEA funds to applicants; and the additional priorities which states in funding certain programs are to give to applicants. The other three statutory provisions, in turn, affect the distribution of non-federal funds for vocational education: the matching requirements; the  requirement that states and recipients maintain their efforts with respect to the aggregate amount of VEA funds received by each: and the non-supplanting provision which requires that VEA funds be used by states and recipients so as to ensure that federal funds supplement non-federal funds. Four major issues which cause problems in regard to the federal interpretations and state implementation of these fiscal requirements were identified in the study. They are (1) whether the statutory language describing application priorities is clear and adequate; (2) whether the provision specifying two funds distributions factors to local recipients is clear enough so that Congress's goals of equalizing the availability of vocational education resources can be realized; (3) whether the legal  framework gives adequate guidance with respect to priority criteria and funds allocation; and (4) whether the legal framework contains adequate standards with respect to the interrelationship between federal VEA funds and funds from other sources used for vocational education programs.

        "description":"As part of a study of the Vocational Education Act (VEA) (see note), equity provisions were examined and the adequacy of incentives, oversight mechanisms, and sanctions in the VEA was addressed. Three areas of equity were studied: federal civil rights laws and regulations; provision of funds in the VEA to help recipients meet their civil rights obligations to handicapped and limited-English-proficient students and to assist recipients to help disadvantaged students; and the mechanisms and processes contained in the VEA which are designed to overcome sex discrimination and sex stereotyping and lead to the elimination of sex bias. Major problems between intent of the Act and compliance as a result of vague wording and unclear rules were identified and recommendations for clarifying  or changing these provisions were made. An analysis of the use of incentives in the VEA showed that the incentives included do not induce states to exceed the minimum desired behaviors; however, because of the structure of the vocational education funding establishment, no major changes were recommended. In regard to oversight mechanisms and sanctions, it was found that the structure of the basic enforcement system is sound; however, several significant problems with the language of certain sections were found and recommendations made to correct them.

In particular, the Commission examined, during 1980, the role of education and employment and training programs in helping women to prepare for better paying occupations, and then made 20 recommendations to Congress for actions to be taken to improve women's opportunities. Recommendations for vocational education improvements included that Congress review provisions of the Vocational Education Act (1) to again focus attention on sex equity provisions; (2) to require a report on the progress that has been made in implementing these provisions; (3) to mandate states to detail sex equity considerations in their Five  Year Plans; (4) to drop separate funding of consumer and homemaking programs; (5) to develop model programs to overcome sex stereotyping; (6) to direct the Department of Education to improve sex equity coordination and dissemination of information; (7) to work with the Office of Civil Rights; (8) to provide supportive services such as day care for children of women students; and (9) to increase the role of sex equity coordinators. The Commission recommended also that employment and training programs emphasize preparation for better paying occupations; provide linkages to unsubsidized employment; serve significant segments of the eligible population; provide supportive services; accept recently separated women regardless of income; increase participation of women in training and employment  programs; and remove age limits from apprenticeship programs.

Interviews were conducted with a state director of business and office education, superintendent, curriculum director, director of vocational education, principal, business education department chairman, business education faculty member, parent, and student. The instrument used was \"What Do You Believe?,\" 15 statements of ideas expressed in educational literature pertaining to a line of action for curriculum improvement. Reactions to six statements were in strong agreement. The functioning philosophy of  participants would, therefore, include those statements dealing with exposing students to what man knows and does not know, personalized curriculum, benefits of learning from peers and groups, learning difficulties beginning in disturbed home relationships, limits of the subject-matter patterns of organization, and encouragement of developing creative thinking. A statement dealing with a uniform policy of increased homework would be discarded because of strong disagreement. The remaining eight statements would require additional discussion and clarification. A comparison of the school district or high school's expressed philosophy with the individual's functioning philosophy was consistent for all participants.

        "description":"This volume contains a series of papers written for a symposium entitled &quot;Adult Education and Allocation Policy in Sweden.&quot; Intended to provide a broader framework for analyzing allocation policy in adult education, the first paper is organized around the assumption that the effects of allocation policy both on participants and society are greatly determined by institutional roles defining who gets recruited to what kind of adult education and to what extent different programs and self-directed learning contribute to the creation of resources. Discussed next is the allocation policy in various Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden). The next paper, which examines recruitment in the context of allocation policy, focuses on the ways in which changes in the  occupational structure over time can illustrate long-term effects of education. Also presented is a study of dropouts in municipal adult schools in the context of allocation policy. Finally, an analysis is made of the municipal adult education teaching process in the context of allocation policy. (MN)",

More than 60 publications on computer-related topics and K-12 computer literacy were reviewed to determine competency requirements for computer programmers and computer operators, as well as six dimensions of computer literacy. In addition, data were collected through visitations to recognized data processing education centers; a telephone survey of two-year colleges to examine the hardware being used in training programs; a mailed survey to employers of computer programmers and operators who had been  enrolled in a community college program; and a telephone survey of placement officers at Iowa area schools with programming/operations departments. All four of the surveys indicated the following similar necessary characteristics: the need for current, relevant curricula in step with technology advances; the need for modern equipment used by the industry in the primary service area; the need for modern equipment used by the industry in the primary service area; the need for experience through field study, cooperative study, or other arrangements; and the need for various options for enrollees to satisfy their needs and to take advantage of the employment opportunities available. As a result of the study, a listing of required and optional topics as well as recommended non-computer course  work for programmers and operators was proposed to aid postsecondary schools in building their curricula; and a list of proposed topics and hardware requirements for a K-12 computer literacy curriculum was developed.

Following an introductory explanation of the purpose and uses of the handbook and related publications, guidelines are presented for establishing and maintaining a local linkage committee. Development of local agreements is covered. Also examined are the roles of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) and the Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program (IWRP) in linkage agreements. In the next three chapters the following local level concerns are addressed: cost considerations in  establishing and maintaining interagency linkages, inservice training to implement and sustain interagency linkages, and evaluation of interagency linkages. Guidelines are set forth for implementing interagency agreements. Comprising the final three chapters are discussions of three interagency linkage models in Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia.

        "description":"The National Institute of Education supported a program of basic research studies dealing with career decision-making processes among high school and college students and the career experiences of youthful workers from 1976 through 1979. The 11 studies funded under this grants competition are diverse. Some examine the experiences of secondary students while in school; others consider how such experiences relate to students' postsecondary educational and work histories. More than half the projects focus on college students. Some of these are restricted to what happens to students in school, while others trace their work experiences after graduation. The studies also trace the decision-making processes of students of different races, backgrounds, and both sexes. A review of the  studies concluded the following: (1) educational attainment, educational experiences, and educational decision-making all matter a great deal; (2) it cannot be assumed that the actual course of career decision making approximates at all the idealized models so prominent in the literature; (3) it also should not be assumed that all that is required for effective career planning is to get youth to act like the future-oriented rational actors implied in such models--having well-conceived goals no doubt is important, but youth also have to be prepared for the realities of the world; (4) optimizing often involves trading off competing values; (5) finally, many factors contribute to the different levels of occupational success experienced by men and women, blacks and whites, and youth from  various backgrounds.

These build on the technical knowledge contained in each discussion, as well as the students' own perceptions and experiences, and relate all these elements to their future roles as primary health care workers. The book is organized in three parts. Part 1 contains a discussion of the social process skills needed by the primary health care worker. It considers the necessary skills and qualities, how they may be  acquired, and how they become translated into action. Parts 2 and 3 contain instructional content and associated learning strategies. They address first the health of the community, and then discuss the health of the individual. Topics covered include health education, nutrition, population control, health services, prevention and control of disease, health data, providing care for mothers, children, and adults, and health-related sciences.

Two thousand NAM members were randomly selected and mailed the survey, with a 40 percent response. Analysis of their responses yielded the following findings: (1) most manufacturers gave secondary vocational education a &quot;C&quot; grade and gave postsecondary vocational education a &quot;B&quot; grade; (2) more than 50 percent of the respondents indicated that their company benefited from  vocational education, and about 85 percent prefer hiring vocational graduates rather than nonvocational graduates for a job requiring less than a four-year college degree; (3) companies, especially large companies involved with vocational eudcation, rated it more satisfactory than companies not involved; (4) many manufacturers are willing to provide work experience programs for students; (5) manufacturers thought both job skills training and employability skills training need to be taught at the high school level; (6) they thought basics should be emphasized and that more employability skills should be taught in high school, and more courses should be offered, for adults as well as young people, at the postsecondary level; (7) the manufacturers did not favor increased spending of public  funds for job placement or for training in nontraditional occupations. In general, the survey analysis concluded that vocational education is perceived as doing well and as being beneficial to employers and that they would be willing to help vocational education be more effective.

A sample of 209 NCSL members were surveyed, with a 45 percent response. Analysis of mail survey responses yielded the following findings: (1) legislators saw vocational education as doing an &quot;above average&quot; job--a &quot;B&quot; grade; (2) legislators thought that vocational education was performing especially well in teaching job skills, increasing awareness of career  opportunities and technology, and teaching good work habits; (3) legislators thought employers should be more involved in curriculum development and in the evaluation of vocational education; (4) the broader goals of economic development in the community and training for nontraditional occupations are in lesser need of emphasis, according to the legislators; (5) most of the respondents felt that the federal government should be involved in vocational education, and that if the federal government did not provide sufficient funding, the states should try to do so. The survey analysis concluded that the general views of the legislators toward vocational education were positive, but that several changes are needed. Legislators also felt that they needed more information about vocational  education but they did not have strong opinions regarding the appropriate emphasis of employability skills versus job skills at the secondary level. It was also suggested that a state-level advocacy position would emphasize continued federal funding for vocational education but with greater state control over these funds. (KC)",

Vocational teachers and administrators with curriculum development and management competencies will be required to develop curricula. Instructors will need to familiarize themselves with curriculum sources. As one part of the human resource development plan, instructors recruited from industry, vocational teachers and administrators, and students in teacher preparation programs will need to develop or upgrade skills in curriculum development and management. Vocational educators must be trained to use the best and most current curriculum as part of the human resource development plan. A knowledge utilization system is  needed in which vocational instructors can gain access to the best available vocational curricula. A training program, vocational education curriculum specialist (VECS), has been field tested and found effective in creating or upgrading vocational education curriculum development and management skills (see note). The 17 competency-based modules in the program are appropriate for all instructional settings and teaching methods. (Project descriptions show how five field test sites used the modules.)

During the hearings, testimony and prepared statements were taken from persons involved with unemployment programs, with Black community leaders, union representatives, teachers' representatives, police officials, and research professionals about the effects of the nation's current unemployment rate on those who are unemployed and their families. Some of the problems cited by the witnesses were rising crime rates, increased mortality for all age groups peaking at two to three years after periods of high unemployment, lack of training opportunities, especially for Black youths and for older displaced workers, and eventual lack of hope by the persons involved. Witnesses emphasized  that the proposed federal cuts in already strained social services budgets would severely harm persons needing these services, especially in depressed areas of high unemployment, such as major cities. Witnesses proposed making training programs that have proven successful more available to youths who need them; removing income eligibility requirements for the structurally unemployed, such as displaced autoworkers, to make them eligible for retraining without waiting until their incomes go below the poverty level for six months; and creating programs such as subsidized employment, to encourage private employers to provide on-the-job training.

        "description":"This directed study, part of the applied research and development effort of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, focused on the use of emerging telecommunications technology to facilitate communication among vocational education program improvement agencies. The study attempted to introduce and implement new developments in computer-based message systems to take advantage of cost savings and time management. A system was identified using message switching with a central computer to provide a link between terminals. It was noted that the introduction of new technology and new patterns of communicating, although demonstrated to be more cost effective, is not easy. It involves re-education of the format, equipment, and habits developed over the years. The  findings of this study illustrate the need to incorporate new technology to decrease the response time in answering requests, share available information across state and regional boundaries, and disseminate information in a more cost-effective manner. Tight budget conditions in vocational agencies impaired the quick adoption of message switching, but at the end of the first year, the quorum of six had joined with an additional six agencies expressing strong interest. If additional funding is approved, it is anticipated that message switching will be used to provide faster access to the program improvement database, plan conference agendas, support an electronic mailbox, and provide for the successful application and implementation of new and improved practices for vocational education  program improvement agencies.

It was conducted in response to the need expressed by educators in the field for a comprehensive, centralized, computerized database of information on the availability of curriculum materials. The National Center for Research in Vocational Education Clearinghouse staff worked cooperatively with the National Network for Curriculum Coordination in Vocational and Technical Education to design and prepare the specifications for the database, enter test records, and prepare recommendations for further development. The Vocational Education Curriculum Materials (VECM) database established during the feasibility study includes  information on both print and nonprint products. One hundred and fifty records were entered into the VECM during the feasibility study. Each entry includes the following information about the curriculum product: title, date, sponsoring agency, developer, subject matter classification, educational level, intended user, student target population, description of the print or nonprint material, copyright restrictions, and availability source. The database is now ready for retrieval of information by the National Center Clearinghouse and the Curriculum Coordination Centers; efforts will be made to open the database to the public during 1982-83. Also, an additional 1,500 records will be entered into the database during the next year. (KC)",

After supplementing study data with data from two other national data bases, researchers drew conclusions pertaining to the long-range effects of vocational education on participants' earnings, employment, education, and aspirations. Included among the main findings of the study were the following: (1) both men and women vocational graduates generally earned more than did graduates of general curriculum programs, and indirect effects of vocational education on earnings are felt through all forms of postsecondary education as well as through tenure and  unionization; (2) participation in vocational education was associated with a lower likelihood of unemployment; (3) overall, vocational graduates were more satisfied with the adequacy of their preparation to get a job than were their general curriculum graduate peers; and (4) female vocational graduates most frequently aspired to professional and clerical jobs, whereas male graduates generally aspired to managerial, professional, and crafts occupations. Recommendations called for further research concerning the effect of vocational education on later labor market experiences, dropout prevention, and achieving sex equity. (MN)",

Data for the study came from a review of the literature, case studies, and a mail questionnaire received from 2,599 persons in 31 postsecondary institutions. Concerning the postsecondary educational institutions, findings indicated that higher job placement seems to occur in institutions in which (1) personnel and teachers are committed to and enthusiastic about the placement of students in a job related to their training; (2)  administrators and teachers are committed to interactions among community, labor, and business organizations in order to support job placement; (3) job placement specialists and counselors serve as the initial sources of information about job openings and provide clearinghouse and support functions; (4) advisory committee input is sought; (5) planning is related to community and state economic development efforts, especially to anticipated labor demand and supply; (6) work experience programs are available; and (7) job placement rates are used as a program evaluation criterion. Higher job placement rates were also found in postsecondary institutions where there is a high demand for labor in the surrounding area; and the medium-sized community is supportive of vocational-technical  education. Recommendations for action were made to Congress, the Department of Education, state government agencies, postsecondary institutions, and teacher education institutions. (KC)",

Following an introduction, the methodology used to compile the data is described. The findings section presents the data in six tables: (1) state program improvement projects by state, (2) state program improvement projects by legislative section, (3) recipients of project funding, (4) target educational levels, (5) problem areas addressed by projects, and (6) products and outcomes of projects. These conclusions are listed: the reporting system works, more funds are obligated for support services than program improvement, states obligate about equal amounts on the three  categories, amounts obligated for projects vary considerably, projects have focused on every educational level and are being conducted by educational institutions and agencies at every level, and the greatest number of projects have focused on instructional improvement. Five recommendations are made: clarification and reinforcement of responsibility of state research coordinating units (RCUs) to supply program information, RCU personnel training to improve reporting of project information, expansion of tracking system to accommodate information about state support service and administrative activities, study of results of funding patterns and levels, and planning of multistate cooperative research and development efforts.

Discussion is divided into three sections. The background section provides descriptive data concerning involvement of vocational education students in the military and expands upon the three major military and training issues. The second section introduces possible roles that vocational education could play in assisting the military to meet its training responsibilities, including being sensitive to preenlistment needs, increasing occupational knowledge concerning a military  career, developing lateral entry programs, providing surge training capacity, assisting in reservist training, and providing post-enlistment services and training and civil service personnel training. In the final section, implications of those roles for vocational education and the military are discussed. These consequences of a closer cooperative relationship are outlined for vocational education: financial support, updating of technological capacity, increased sensitivity to military training requirements, and interchange of instructional methodologies. Disadvantages discussed are perceived engagement of public education in quasi-military training, less military control, and diversion of planning resources. (YLB)",

A data-based discussion is first provided of the current state of affairs in regard to cooperative education enrollment, student employment, and employer involvement in work experience efforts. In the next section, the major policy issues are examined that would affect the desirability and feasibility of expanding cooperative-type work experiences, including maintenance of program quality, student recruitment, changes in the workplace, readiness of students to benefit, legal constraints, cost to education, new approaches, and displacement of workers. The last section sets forth policy options that facilitate expansion. These federal options are  suggested: targeted tax credits, flexibility in minimum wage, federal job opportunities, and vocational education and related legislation. State/local options suggested are closer linkages with general and college curricula, increased latitude to local districts, research and development, and shared control with business/industry/labor.

Four alternatives that are examples of national needs that vocational education would appear to have a potential to address are (1) training and retraining of workers in national critical skill shortage occupations, (2) training and retraining of individuals in high technology areas, (3) training and retraining of displaced workers, and (4) improving employability of hard-to-employ youth in the inner cities and depressed rural areas. (The discussion of each area includes background information, implications, and federal and additional considerations.) Three alternative funding strategies could be used for directing federal vocational education dollars through state  agencies towards national priorities; block grant, set-asides, and national incentives. Two additional funding strategies that represent a more significant departure from historic precedents are direct funding and directing a greater federal emphasis towards program improvement. (YLB)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"The purpose of secondary vocational education has traditionally been occupational preparation, with the primary activity for achieving that purpose being occupationally specific skill training. Today, however, a significant amount of effort is also directed toward outcomes that prepare an individual for work rather than for a specific job or occupation, or outcomes that relate to satisfaction in life roles other than wage earner. These non-occupationally specific outcomes call for an examination of the issues for vocational education policy formulation. Four major types of non-occupationally specific outcomes can be identified: vocational knowledge and maturity; employability skills; consumer and other self-help skills, and citizenship and leadership. Some of the major  implications of giving increased legitimacy and emphasis to non-occupationally specific outcomes include the following: (1) such an increase could lead to a one-to-one reduction of funds for occupationally specific skill training; (2) concern about tracking or restricting the future choices of students should be reduced, making vocational education more appealing to more students; (3) more emphasis may be placed on the needs of disadvantaged students; (4) business/industry may view this shift in emphasis as an attempt to be more responsive to their needs--or they may complain about youth's lack of specific skill training; and (5) program content may change. Federal policy options concerning non-occupationally specific vocational education include expanding the federal definition of  vocational education; encouraging experimentation and demonstration; encouraging interdisciplinary courses; and encouraging research.

In addition to distribution, the study addressed questions of the nature of the products, to whom they went, the potential benefits from using the products, and how they were distributed. Some of the results were as follows: (1) the 572 products captured by the study resulted in 320,549 copies being distributed in three years--an average of 560 copies was distributed per product; (2) about 50 percent of the  product copies went to elementary and secondary schools, with the rest nearly equally divided between postsecondary schools, universities, and state education agencies; (3) principal users were teachers in local settings, while less than 18 percent of the products were distributed to students; (4) the majority of products in the sample were instructional guides, with research reports the next most common type; however, instructional guides were most often distributed, while research reports were second to last in type of product distributed; (5) vocational education and curriculum/instructional materials were by far the most common subjects of the products; (6) improved planning and accountability was the top-rated perceived benefit to be gained from use of these products, which were  usually distributed by mail.

It was illustrated that follow-through services were needed to help the significant number of CETA terminees who do not become employed after their departure from the program. By means of consultation with national experts and a wide range of CETA personnel, and a literature review, it was determined that follow-through services were extremely rare, and, where they did exist, delivery was unsystematic and limited. CETA staff attributed their absence to insufficient federal and state leadership, absence of specific funding, and lack of acknowledgement of programs providing such  services. They supported the concept almost unanimously. Arguments for follow-through services included job placement assistance, further education and training for career development, strengthening of self-esteem, and reversal of long-term employability problems. Advantages for programs were protection of training investment, fewer program repeaters, feedback for program improvement, and improved program image and credibility. Arguments against services included lack of central administrative impetus, fostering of client dependency, and implication of program failure.

In &quot;The Future of Educational Equity&quot; Shirley D. McCune focuses on three questions of importance in developing strategies to gain equity: (1) What is the current concept of educational equity and how may this need be modified? (2) What are trends in society and education that provide a context for seeking equity? and (3) What are tasks that must be accomplished to continue the search for educational equity? In &quot;The Justice of Equity&quot; Samuel D. Proctor discusses bases for belief in the dignity of persons; five stages of development--disintegration, survival and acculturation, alienation, lawsuits, and reintegration; and  implications for education, including professionalism and vicariousness. The overview, &quot;Equity and Vocational Education: Guidelines for the 1980s,&quot; synthesizes 17 papers about equity and vocational education from three major perspectives: selected academic disciplines, vocational education, and special interest group advocacy. It describes a concept of equity and examines the current status of equity in vocational education by focusing on eight commonly agreed upon problems and issues. Recommendations for the future are then explored. Brief summaries of the papers conclude the publication. (YLB)",

        "description":"Programs must be designed to remove barriers to equitable vocational education. Barriers to such programs are erosion of public and special interest group confidence in the educational system; lack of systematic student services; and lack of mutual awareness, communication, and cooperation between vocational and general educators. To remove barriers, adequate funds must be available to distribute by efficient methods. Local involvement and endorsement are also required. Vocational educators must work with parents and family members who influence career decisions to change attitudes toward vocational education. Career assessments are a practical strategy to recognize interests and aptitudes. Vocational education linkages with federal agencies could help coordinate efforts.  Accessibility in rural areas could be increased by school districts' cooperation. Additional funds would ensure more programs, vocational counseling, and access to health and social services. Research and development strategies for elimination should focus on new program designs, competency-based modular instruction, basic skills development, and work experience. Successful removal of barriers to equity relies on focusing awareness on problems of inequity, providing corrective pre- and inservice personnel education, refining the curriculum, developing innovative teaching/learning materials and techniques, providing vocational guidance services, implementing career education, providing necessary facilities and equipment, and adequate funding.

Income inequality and poverty may be attributed to ability differences, education and training, job tastes, property ownership, market power, and discrimination. In economics, the concept of equity and its relevance to employment and education can best be understood through an analysis of two theories of labor markets--the human capital theory and the dual labor market theory. The theory of discrimination is important for human resource development because discrimination has been a major cause of labor market segmentation, inequity, and low incomes. Minorities, women, and other groups will continue to experience  severe problems in the labor market in the 1980s. Education has been instrumental in alleviating the economics crisis of the poor, unemployed, and disadvantaged. Unemployment, however, has continued to rise, and some studies show continuing inequality in education. Since 1968 vocational education has had to be more responsive to training the disadvantaged, minorities, and handicapped. Equity programs must be developed to eliminate discrimination in vocational education. Equity considerations should be integrated at all levels of the vocational education system, including planning, administration, and specific programs. (YLB)",

        "description":"Equity is a significant area of public administration which is integral to all disciplines that relate to the public interest, including vocational education. Vocational education is designed to achieve equity. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 mandated ready access of all persons of all ages in all communities to vocational education of high quality and suited to their needs and interests. The 1968 Amendments reinforced this directive, and sex equity was clearly stipulated in the 1976 Amendments. Vocational education was further linked with employability of any person with passage of such laws as the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. A chief barrier to equity is absence of public interest. In public administration the improvement of testing is a feasible way to  effect equity. Agencies should be required to show evidence of criterion-related, content, or construct validity of their personnel selection procedure. As regards research and policy recommendations, public interest should be the foundation of equity, enrollment should be regularly researched, intergovernmental fiscal relationships in vocational education should be studied from the standpoint of equity, and employability and energy equity should be studied.

They face societal, institutional, and personal barriers to equitable employment. The American job market and employer expectations may be confusing, and the concept of lifelong learning is foreign to them. Barriers presented by educational and employment institutions to the limited English proficient (LEP) adult include standardized entrance examinations, diploma requirements, and employment performance tests. Adults also fear loss or rejection of their culture, ethnicity, and identity when they speak a second language. Four English as a Second Language (ESL) curriculum models integrate vocational and English language skills and provide special  assistance to LEP students: prevocational ESL classes, vocational ESL, bilingual vocational training, and on-the-job training with vocational ESL support. Vocational instructors can help LEP students by allowing culturally diverse students to learn in diverse ways, using demonstrations or audiovisual aids and relying less on lectures, and using bilingual assistants. Research and development is needed in the areas of the elements of English needed to be taught and their order, strategies to reduce language demands of LEP jobs, and identification of successful program materials and instructional strategies.

This growth has paralleled increased funding under the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 for sex-equity related research and demonstration activities. Funding has not, however, kept pace with needs of institutions trying to ensure equal access to all students. Administrators must assess the financial success of sex equity programs. Institutional policy developers should reassess policies to ensure access to equity in vocational education. Hidden barriers for adult women in institutional admission practices include less financial assistance and college catalogs designed to perpetuate sex stereotyping. Reentry women have different problems than typical students do--conflict  between traditional and nontraditional roles, lack of confidence in abilities--for which they require support systems. Career counselors for these women must overcome personal biases concerning womens' role in careers. Other barriers to entering nontraditional occupational training are sexual harassment, family pressures and adjustments, self-image, and parental influence. A plan for developing a program for dealing with female vocational needs should include a community-based advisory committee, workable timetable, 12 month funding, staff selection and training, outreach recruitment, selection of counseling models, financial aid options, public relations campaign, ongoing evaluation, and research component.

Although occupational opportunities for women expanded beyond the traditionally sex-segregated occupations during the World War II era, in the seventies legislators decided to require further changes. State vocational education sex equity coordinators have been challenged to accomplish their federally regulated tasks within the conservative confines of state educational agencies. They have worked to develop a multi-dimensional definition of sex equity, technical assistance systems, philosophies regarding sex equity's importance in vocational education, and support networks. Needs assessments have been conducted to identify groups without full  access to vocational education. Variables contributing to a sex-equitable teaching-learning system with vocational education as a student option include general education system commitment, vocational educator's concepts of equity, role of counselors in career decision making, and attitudes of business, community, and students. Strategies coordinators have found successful include incentive grants, inservice education, career education, and materials development. Local education agencies are recommended to accent and reward sex equitable actions, and accentuate sex equity in all areas of the vocational education delivery system. (YLB)",

To ensure equity for the handicapped in vocational education, certain issues must be addressed, including compliance with state and federal laws, availability and accessibility of comprehensive vocational education, least restrictive  environment and mainstreaming, making individual and programmatic accommodations, policymaking, equity in vocational education funding, preparation of vocational education personnel to teach the handicapped, and need for revision of curriculum materials for fair representation of handicapped persons.

Black studies courses are essential to the professional preparation of vocational education teachers.

Early United States Supreme Court opinions (1873) on issues of newly asserted claims by women provide evidence of preconceptions concerning women and their stereotyped positions. Occupational exclusion was reinforced by law to maintain a caste system. An even more fundamental right denied to women was the right to vote. Again, in 1948, male judges relegated women to &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; occupations. In 1908, enacted legislation to shield women from excessively long hours of labor in stressful work situations was upheld. Appeals for equity were muted by supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment, since women voters were promoted as having more sensitivity and integrity.  Protective legislation based upon traditional stereotypes about women continued to be upheld into the seventies. Progress toward equity include the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the accomplishments made since its passage from the perspective of cases won by women, and the relationship of equity to the newer affirmative action mandates.

The cause, nature, and personal and social consequences of inequality are its proper objects of study. Study of equality is embroiled in a continuing controversy among conservative (functionalist tradition) and radical (dialectical or conflict tradition) theorists. Functionalists take inequality as a necessary &quot;given&quot; in society; radical theorists see inequality as a social illness that requires treatment. America is not committed to the principles of social and economic equality in theory or practice. Equality of opportunity is endorsed in principle but not in practice. Here equity, rather than equality, becomes an issue, and with more  equity comes less equality. Women who are entering the labor force in increasing numbers are handicapped by occupational sex typing. Encounters of women in the labor force are a picture of gains and losses--gains with respect to entrance into it and losses in kinds of work and monetary benefits relative to men. Occupational imbalances remain but are gradually diminishing. Vocational education can promote more equality by developing a personal values system for students and avoiding sex typing. (YLB)",

It begins with a framework of assumptions that relate the discipline of anthropology to concepts of equity. Education or schooling is discussed as a special form of socialization, and four operational elements are cited that are displayed in equitable schooling: access; treatment; allocation of resources; and awareness, evaluation, and program correction. A review is provided of the literature of occupational choice in American culture, occupational socialization (effects of different socializing influences on occupational preferences, including influences of parents, peers, television, school books, teachers and counselors), and programs of nontraditional vocational  training. A developmental model is provided for a set equity program that includes these stages: awareness, analysis, access and action, affirmation and allocation of resources, and acceptance. These recommendations for promoting equity are made: intensified research by social scientists, monitoring systems at state and local levels, development of decisions models for a continuum of equity from school to workplace, and policy decisions and actions based on research data indicating that sex-role socialization takes place early in life.

Possible solutions are local business and labor advisory group input into program planning, business tax credit for wages to trainees, employment opportunities  for students and job placement, summer work programs, and funding for vocational research that is limited to areas demonstrating a direct benefit to students served by the local area program. The most effective operating program design addressing both the educational and employment needs of disadvantaged youth is encompassed in the Federal Vocational Education Act of 1963. (Recommendations are made for vocational education programs, the future of educational research, and changes in federal legislation.) (YLB)",

Although the elderly population has become increasingly &quot;older,&quot; this group is retiring earlier. There will be a decrease in active workers supporting retired citizens whose income continues to be decimated by inflation. In addition, social security financing problems loom ahead. With the gradual reduction of the educational disadvantage of the elderly, the question will be whether these workers would take advantage of increased work options. A need exists for affirmative action for the aged. Barriers to equitable job training and placement are previous work history, lack of credentials, lack of access  to job information, inadequate health status, attitudes and values of union and management decision makers, transportation, stereotypes, self-discrimination, employer discrimination, and job performance (employer fear of decreased productivity). Strategies for barrier elimination include federal age discrimination legislation, federal support programs, advocacy groups, adjustments in personnel policy, and training of vocational educators and public to promote a better understanding of aging.

        "description":"Equity in vocational education cannot be addressed until the question of urban cultural pluralism has been fully analyzed. This question involves problems of minorities, the disadvantaged, and those with limited English proficiency. Barriers facing urban youths enrolling in vocational education include close-knit ethnic pockets attempting to adhere to their own culture, dropping out before exposure to vocational education, and labor market changes (automation, immigrant workers, later retirement, large rural industrial parks, and increased numbers of working women). Strategies to eliminate barriers include caring teachers, administration and school board willingness to fund alternative methods and situations for problem students, remedial programs, and early instruction in  employment and coping skills. Seven detailed solutions are teaching basic skills with meaning for the world of work, teaching employment skills, teaching job seeking skills, placing students in part-time civil service jobs, appointing state equity coordinators, restructuring jobs, and cultivating collaboration of social and community agencies with vocational educators. Areas for further research and policy consideration are federal government role, vocational education evaluation criteria for job placement, and delivery systems corresponding to needs of subcultures.

        "description":"Vocational teacher educators need to take an active role in the move toward ensuring equity in vocational education. Tradition appears to be the major obstacle to achievement of sex equity in vocational occupations, and the workrole perception of vocational teachers, teacher educators, vocational guidance counselors, and administrators has likewise been molded by the sex role traditions of society. Race and ethnic discrimination is more subtle. Grossly unequal enrollments continue in vocational programs, and this can only lead to prepetuation and prolongation of inequity in employment for women, the handicapped, and minorities. Some strategies that have been used to promote equity in vocational programs include sensitivity workshops or activities; interdisciplinary teams; using  sound research relating to equity concerns and problems that pertain to vocational education, occupational equity, and employment opportunities to modify teacher education programs; redesign of teacher education programs; and selective recruitment for equity. Vocational teacher educators can become involved in some activities to facilitate sex equity, including infusing equity awareness activities into courses, encouraging students from nontraditional backgrounds to enter graduate vocational education programs, helping nontraditional students, encouraging research, and cooperating with administrators and guidance counselors in developing sex equity strategies.

Testimony was given by J. Lynn Helms, Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and by John Edwards, vice president, air traffic, Professional Association of Aeronautical Center Employees, with additions by their staff members. Mr. Helms testified that the FAA is beginning to train 500 new controllers a month to replace those who were fired, with a goal of bringing the traffic controllers' ranks up to or above  the previous strength in about 3 years. He said that the training, which is conducted by the FAA Academy and the University of Oklahoma, is maintaining the same high standards it has always held, and that many retired controllers had been or would be called back to supplement the training force. Mr. Edwards, head of the Union of Traffic Controller Instructors, testified that the instructors' morale was low because they had been left out of a pay raise package proposed for field controllers; because they had lost the benefit of working regular hours--for which they had signed on at the Academy; and because they had not received any appreciation from the FAA for staying on their jobs during the strike. He also said bureaucratic regulations were making it difficult for instructors to care  about or help their students. Additional statements by Earl Hobbs, Jr., Air Traffic Contoller, and James King, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, were read into the record. (KC)",

Specifically, the survey provided (1) a demographic profile of adults in Florida, particularly those described as displaced homemakers, single heads of households, part-time workers, and people desiring work in occupational areas not traditionally considered job areas for their sex; (2) their present employment, if any; (3) their employment aspirations; (4) their need for support services; and (5) their training needs. After conducting 22,465 telephone interviews, researchers coded these data by congressional district, county, and zip code. According to the survey, the average Florida displaced homemaker is a white woman, over 25 years of age, who  is interested in securing employment, but who needs assistance in finding a job, acquiring support skills, locating career information, and gaining self-confidence. Besides needing more job training, many single heads of households need help in identifying appropriate careers and jobs as well as information about enrollment in educational programs. Recommendations called for developing educational awareness campaigns, increasing support services to special needs groups, broadening the definitions of the above-mentioned groups, and developing cooperative programs to service both groups.

        "description":"The United States Departments of Energy (DOE) and Labor (DOL) have cosponsored a number of demonstration programs to train economically disadvantaged migrant and seasonal farmworkers for energy-related technical and skilled occupations. A descriptive study of the first DOE/DOL demonstration was made to determine the impact of training on participants' subsequent labor force activity and the effectiveness of the program in meeting the needs of this target group. Analysis of participants' employment and wage rates before and after training indicated favorable outcomes--both wages and the number employed increased significantly. Wages after training were approximately double those before training, with women, nonwhites, and high school graduates reporting the largest increases. The  data on farmworkers, compared to those of clients enrolled in Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs, showed the farmworkers to have employment status gains similar to CETA clients enrolled in vocational training nationally, but lower than other CETA participants enrolled in energy-related programs. Farmworkers' wage gains were significantly greater than those reported by CETA groups. Apparent key factors contributing to the success of the program include the farmworkers' desire to leave agricultural labor, their willingness to relocate to accept employment, the existing network of employers developed by the training program, and the program's ability to provide needed supportive services. The findings of this study support other research which has demonstrated that  skill training, in contrast to public jobs programs, can provide farmworkers with a more permanent solution to under- and unemployment.

It is intended as a tool for the development of relevant activities which will result in innovative solutions to community problems. The manual is organized in four sections. In the first section, approaches to community planning are discussed, and a rationale for game playing is provided. This section also contains an overview of participative decision making. In section 2 readers are instructed in how to create planning games, including information on where to get games and other ideas, aims or purposes of gamesmanship, principles to observe when planning games, criteria for conducting games, and hints for  planning games. Section 3 provides ideas on when and how to use games (to get acquainted and improve interpersonal relationships, to arouse creativity, to determine group values, to reconcile differences, and to develop or maintain interest). Finally, section 4 concludes with some additional thoughts on the purpose of games, a summary of decision-making principles, and what to do instead of using games. (KC)",

Three self-report instruments (a needs satisfaction inventory, a goal scaling measure, and a measure of perceived life status) were completed at service entry by 122 clients of various Arkansas intermediate medical centers or comprehensive rehabilitation centers. Included among the major study findings were the following: (1) postservice adjustment to spinal cord injury is clearly multidimensional and spans at least four major dimensions--satisfaction in meeting basic needs, participation in vocational  activities, participation in avocational activities, and accomplishment of highly personal goals; (2) there were no relationships of preservice psychological status to adjustment followup; (3) clients' psychological status remained stable from service entry to followup; and (4) at followup a significant number of spinal cord-injured clients positively revised their life status perceptions toward personally important goals.

Through a review of the literature, terms were defined, and incentives and benefits, facilitators, and barriers were identified. A naturalistic approach to inquiry was used to study the interagency relationship between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Danville (Virginia) Public Schools. Data collection techniques were interviews with individuals and groups; observations of interagency programs, staff meetings, meetings between key staff and others; document analysis; and \"shadowing\" of key staff. Findings are reported and discussed in the final two sections of the report. The first of the two sections presents (1)  information about the city of Danville and its community services; (2) data gathered for the study, including staff roles and attitudes, relative influence of each organization, costs and benefits of the interagency relationship; and (3) \"A Day in the Life of...\", a description of the community education coordinator. The final section first compares findings with the general review of the literature on interagency relationships. Each category summarized in the literature review is contrasted and compared with the findings in Danville. Responses are then provided to the five research questions that served as framework for the study. (YLB)",

A mailed questionnaire collected data on these variables: career salience, organizational level aspired to, innovativeness of career, and plans to pursue graduate education. One-way least squares analyses of variance indicated that more career salient women tend to plan for graduate education and enter less traditional careers but their aspirations on the organizational ladder are no higher than those of less career salient women. Results  raised questions about women's career aspiration levels and women's roles and about measurement of women's aspirations. (YLB)",

The mailed questionnaire included questions on the five factors under investigation.

Results indicated that actively choosing an occupation, undergraduate grade point average, and career salience at graduation were highly correlated with career involvement and desire to work. It was suggested that the career-involved woman is a mixture of the traditional female and the &quot;new woman,&quot; a phenomenon that needs to be more closely researched.

        "description":"Implementation of competency-based education in Virginia career exploration and preparation programs has served as the basis for establishment of a paradigm for statewide implementation. Competency-based education in Virginia is defined as educational programs with required knowledges, skills, and attitudes based on role-relevant competencies and is further defined by four state standards. Six factors were found to enhance changes of successful implementation: developing course definitions or standards, developing plan of action, providing inservice education, securing administrator commitment, identifying and establishing format of material and product development, and identifying and using existing materials. Four deterrents to implementation were also identified: lack of  coordination between state department and local supervisory staff, involvement of individuals not committed to competency-based education, failure to provide uniform inservice education information and materials, and involvement of too many individuals providing technical assistance. Based on Virginia experience, a nine-component competency-based education implementation framework has been proposed: (1) identify lifework domain, (2) review available resources, (3) identify competencies, (4) verify competencies, (5) identify competency standards, (6) develop objectives and criterion-referenced measures, (7) develop instructional activities and materials, (8) develop support plans, and (9) initiate the program.

An 85-item survey assessed attitudes toward sex equity and satisfaction with district efforts to achieve sex equity. Major findings were that (1) although respondents felt males were less well accepted in traditionally female classes than the reverse, 1978-79 enrollment figures indicated more males enrolled in traditionally female classes  than the reverse; (2) students, faculty, and counselors had less positive perceptions about sex equity efforts than did vocational administrators; (3) employers were perceived as more reluctant to hire a female than a male in a nontraditional job; (4) more ROC/Ps had sex balanced employee counts, while more secondary districts had balanced enrollments; (5) while guidance and counseling activities were the most frequently mentioned means of achieving sex equity, vocational counselors were less positive; and (6) most secondary districts supported sex equity activities with state or local funds, while most community college districts used federal Vocational Education Act funds.

Two instruments were developed to sample 1,198 one-, two- and three-year graduates of 35 Pennsylvania high schools (to provide five samples of each of seven instructional areas of vocational agriculture) and 31 agricultural businesses. The  end product was an eight-stage job opportunity planning model: (1) survey graduates; (2) determine miles to first job, graduates' programs, graduates' first job; (3) survey employers in area including at least 80% of the graduates; (4) determine labor and student occupational needs; (5) determine skills and skill levels needed for meaningful jobs in industry; (6) match skills with courses and course requirements; (7) teach students skills and competencies; (8) place students in jobs.

Analysis showed completion of a public postsecondary vocational program was positively associated with the marketing area for YAW men. For the class of 1972 a significantly positive coefficient was found for the trade and college prep variables. College prep and high socioeconomic status were positive predictors of college completion for  the YAW sample. Significant negative predictors were the trade area for men and the business area for women. Trade areas were significantly positively associated with completion of apprenticeship training. Positive earnings effects were found for male marketing and trade and female business and trade graduates. Graduation from a vocational high school curriculum was negatively associated with completion of traditional postsecondary education, but positively associated with completion of nontraditional postsecondary.

        "description":"Like most cooperative education programs, the one at Nashville State Technical Institute in Tennessee benefits all concerned--the student, the college, business and industry, and the community. Among the many benefits of the cooperative education program are the following: clarification of student career goals, provision of relevant professional experience, establishment of a good rapport between the college and the community, development of a pool of highly motivated individuals for entry level positions, and development of the possibility for employer input into college programing decisions. Available to all students enrolled in any engineering technology or business program, the Nashville State Technical Institute cooperative education program involves three credit plans.  These are the alternating plan (alternate quarters of full-time employment and full-time study), the parallel plan (simultaneous part-time employment and study), and the extended day plan (simultaneous full-time employment and part-time study). Credit for each plan is awarded on the basis of several criteria, including employer evaluation, academic advisor evaluation, student notes made during the work experience, and a final student paper explaining how the experience met certain objectives. Highly successful, the Nashville program has provided many benefits to business, students, and the community. (MN)",

VEDS statistics were to be collected in the form of state-aggregate data (that is, state-level data is submitted by each state, based upon records and data collected by the state for this and other purposes); and VEDS data, which cover only that portion of the vocational education enterprise which is covered by state plans under the Vocational Education Act (about 90 percent of vocational education students). Data contained in the VEDS database are the following: (1) the results of mandated state evaluations of the extent to which program completers and leavers find employment in occupations related to their training and are considered by their employers  to be well trained and prepared: (2) data on vocational students, including race and sex; (3) programs; (4) program completers and leavers: (5) staff; (6) facilities; and (7) expenditures. The system was installed for the school year 1978-79, and has continued on an annual basis since that time. At present, data through 1980 are available for access by educators and researchers. (The main part of the document contains detailed information on the various categories of data available in VEDS; an annotated listing of key publications which contain data about vocational education; and an annotated listing of the available data tapes and instructions about how they can be ordered.)

        "description":"This study used a new specification of participation in vocational education to estimate the effects of high school curriculum on the labor market experiences of youth. Five patterns of participation developed in an earlier study--intensity of training, continuity of training, proximity of training to time of graduation, diversity of program areas, and the addition of logically related study outside the main area of specialization--were identified and labeled Concentrator, Limited Concentrator, Concentrator/Explorer, Explorer, and Incidental/Personal according to degree of involvement in vocational education. Estimates were derived for effects on earnings, training-related placement, labor force status, job prestige, and other job characteristics using data from the National  Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience (NLS), New Youth Cohort, supplemented with high school transcripts of survey participants. It was found that increasing concentration in vocational education (the three concentrator patterns) increased likelihood of holding a conventional job (as classified by Holland). It was also found that Incidental/Personal and Concentrator/Explorer participants were much less likely than Concentrators or Limited Concentrators to be in training-related employment; and that Women Concentrators earned more per week than respondents who took no vocational courses. The study concluded that vocational education policy should be concerned with inducing pride in work, with looking at long-term training needs, with emphasizing helping disadvantaged groups, and  with working within the prevailing economic conditions.

Data used in the study were taken from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, New Youth Cohort (NLS Youth), supplemented with information from the respondents' high school transcripts. Findings included the following: (1) a majority of high school graduates, both vocational and nonvocational, enroll in some type of postsecondary program; (2) higher levels of educational aspirations were associated with higher probabilities of postsecondary participation; (3) less frequent participation in postsecondary programs was found for minority youth with at least some vocational experience, although, for whites, secondary vocational education did  not seem to reduce overall postsecondary participation; (4) class rank, and, for whites only, parents' education influenced secondary participation; (5) living in the West was associated with a higher attendance in two-year colleges; and (6) for certain subgroups, a higher unemployment rate and residence in a rural area showed an increased likelihood of postsecondary participation. Issues raised for policy considerations are these questions: Should secondary vocational training programs take the responsibility for fully equipping graduates with the necessary skills to enter the labor market immediately? Or, should vocational education simply provide the needed prerequisites for further training after high school? The study concluded that policymakers should be aware of the diversity of  secondary vocational education when deciding these questions. (KC)",

Among the key findings of the study were the following: (1) the unions surveyed were either unaware of or did not oppose the use of selection procedures that may have an adverse effect on the job advancement of minorities and women; (2) women and minorities are severely underrepresented in leadership positions in the surveyed unions; and (3) those unions surveyed have a mixed record in the establishment of programs designed to ensure equal opportunity in the  workplace. Based on the study, the EEOC urges unions to increase representation of minorities and women in all levels of leadership; develop a Title VII compliance program; initiate collective bargaining to remove discriminatory provisions from their agreements; work with employers to establish voluntary affirmative action plans; and, in the event of employer recalcitrance, be prepared to file charges alleging employer discrimination and refusal to bargain.

While the starting point for the CTEA procedure developed is always a task description, the procedure has not been made dependent upon any one participation task format, but instead records task information into a set of descriptive variables. Functions of training programs addressed by the procedure include (1) the stimulus media presenting the training information; (2) the response  media accepting the responses made by the student to the stimulus media; (3) the feedback media performing evaluations of student response; and (4) the method within which the media are used. Steps of the CTEA procedure include preparing task descriptions, choosing the task media, describing the functional context of the group task, recording efficiency for each task, selecting the group method, reducing the media set, costing the program, forming efficiency ratios, and normalizing costs for cost/efficiency ratios.

The guide is organized in five chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of the publication's contents, while chapter 2 reviews the rationale underlying the community collaboration and the encouragement for its development provided by federal, state, and local legislative statutes and policies. Chapter 3 concentrates on how to monitor local teams'  progress toward short-range outcomes and how to evaluate the extent to which intended outcomes occur. In chapter 4, summaries of available data on the results of initial community attempts to implement the collaboration concept are presented, while chapter 5 includes recommendations that can facilitate future career guidance improvements through community collaboration. Each recommendation is followed by the key steps required to implement it. Appendixes to the guide include an evaluation auditor's report and nine community team career guidance projects. (KC)",

It includes a short discussion of several vocational education accounting concepts and identifies important reporting procedures with bearing on data interpretation. The section following uses NCES data to refine the picture provided by the BOAE numbers for 1973. It examines course enrollments disaggregated into unduplicated counts of persons taking one or more vocational courses,  and these are converted into full-time equivalent program and non-program students. The fourth section provides estimates of the number of secondary students in occupational programs in FY 1978 and forecasts increases and declines through FY 1987. Three estimates are made for FY 1978, and two projections are made for later years based on differing assumptions. The final section explores implications of the findings, including substantial revision of estimated costs per vocational student and future research on vocational education effectiveness that is more cognizant of the differential exposure patterns among vocational program areas.

        "description":"This document contains transcripts of United States Senate hearings of March, 1981, on the Youth Opportunity Wage Act of 1981. The proposed Act would set a lower minimum wage for work performed by youth under the age of 20; and extend the allowable lower wages to be paid in other industries besides the food service and retail industries where they are now legal under certain circumstances. Testimony and statements were given by Senators, union representatives, representatives of minority advocacy groups, and representatives of various business and retail industry groups. All those testifying expressed concern over the impact of teenage unemployment, but held varying views on whether a lower minimum wage for teenagers would alleviate the problem. Proponents of the proposed  legislation testified that it would create thousands of jobs for unskilled young people who are now priced out of the job market by increases in the minimum wage. They said that these youths' skills are just not worth the minimum wage to employers, but if the minimum were lowered, employers would be able to hire more youths rather than doing without this marginal labor. Opponents of the bill contended that a subminimum wage would benefit fast food chains and other major employers of young people while thousands of adult workers, who make up 70 percent of the minimum-wage work force, would be displaced by youths earning lower wages. In addition, opponents of the bill argued that the country has a moral obligation to maintain a living wage for its workers. (Prepared statements are included  in the document.) (KC)",

The program is described as a peer-led intervention to promote the use of contraception by teenage girls at high risk for unintended pregnancy, designed on the basis of findings from a survey of girls (N=120) in the target population. A summary is included of survey findings which provides an assessment of important demographic, intrapsychic, and interpersonal factors differentiating successful contraceptors from unsuccessful contraceptors. The population is described, the intervention techniques are outlined, and perceptions of the strengths and  weaknesses of the peer intervention are discussed. The content and peer group discussion format of the 12-week program are described along with the training and performance of peer leaders. General conclusions are drawn from the peer intervention experience and the success of the program is reviewed. (NRB)",

The eight chapters in Part I, written by the staff of the Child Protection Center, Children's Hospital National Medical Center, Washington, D.C., discuss the etiology and short-term management of child sexual abuse, describe an approach to crisis intervention services, and provide an outline of suggested case management procedures to be implemented upon intake and throughout the crisis phase of treatment. Materials in Part II deal specifically with incest, treatment and interviewing techniques, and sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes. Several of the chapters focus on the problem of father-daughter incest and the issues associated with the long-term  treatment that is often required in such cases. Many different perspectives concerning various theoretical and clinical aspects of child sexual abuse are presented. A collection of writings by adult and teenage victims of child sexual abuse is also included. The appendices contain several different hospital protocols developed to aid medical personnel in the physical examination and diagnosis of child sexual abuse cases, and a list of child abuse and neglect treatment programs that are equipped to treat child sexual abuse.

To determine whether counselor trainees held similar biases against elderly clients, counseling (N=40) and non-counseling (N=25) graduate students were given an intake summary of a female client exhibiting symptoms of depression. The client's age was manipulated on the summaries by presenting the client as either 25, 45, or 65 years old. Subjects rated the clients on five dimensions, i.e., self-awareness, openness to change, self-esteem, duration of counseling, outcome of counseling, using a sevenpoint scale. Results indicated that the client's age did not significantly affect the ratings on any of the five dimensions. The results suggest that students do not show the same forms of client bias  toward the aged as professionals. (Author/NRB)",

A re-examination of these variables focused on the concerns and gratifications experienced by women in various domains of life and their relationships to family status, employment status, age, and sense of well-being. A disproportionate random sample (N=238) of women aged 35-55, who were never married, married with children, married without children, or divorced with children, were interviewed using a structured survey instrument developed empirically on the basis of first-stage interviews with approximately 72  women. Results showed that women in the middle years scored high on all well-being indices. Eight indices of well-being included in the survey protocol were subjected to further analysis; two factors, mastery and pleasure, emerged. The findings indicated non-significant and/or weak relationships between these well-being factors and the five constructs. The results question the utility of these constructs that are often cited as critical to understanding psychological well-being among women in the middle years. (Author/NRB)",

As a component of identity, temporal orientation should be affected by social contextual variables. Temporal orientation was assessed in a random sample of 94 men and women aged 24-61 years. Respondents were requested to \"draw your life\" as part of a 3-hour identity-life history interview. Markers were not pre-defined for age, nor was there a vertical axis specified, permitting respondents freedom to construct their own time referents and evaluative criteria. Four dimensions of temporal orientation were defined: time concept as linear or spatial; temporal perspective; content of most significant life event; and cognitive-affective  evaluation of the life course as a global entity. Age alone had no significant effects when social contextual variables were evaluated. Women tended to be more present- and past-oriented than men, who exhibited greater future orientation. These effects were mediated by occupational prestige among men and homemaker versus employed working status among women. Affective descriptions of life course events also varied by sex and social status. The findings suggest that age is not related to the dimensions of temporal orientation. (Author/NRB)",

Four of the briefs provide data on health, available services, income, and employment from a report comparing the well-being of older people in three rural and urban locations. National estimates are provided about the need for meals for older people, and about the number of older people at the poverty level. The housing situation of older adults is examined in one brief and is followed by a report on congregate housing. Services and care needs of the elderly and the cost of such services are discussed in nine briefs dealing with: (1) preventive care; (2) the comparative costs of home services and institutionalization; (3) the cost impact of possible changes to Medicaid and Medicare; (4)  total national expenditure for nursing home care; (5) provision of services; (6) older adults' consumption of health resources; and (7) home care services for older people. Other briefs discuss the nutritional health status of older people, the need for a national information system on the conditions of older people, disability problems of men, and crime and the elderly.

The first paper, &quot;Research on the Aging Process,&quot; explores the scope of research on aging and considers biomedical, behavioral, and social science research. The paper on health care investigates shortcomings in Medicare coverage, mental health needs, and the delivery of health care services to older people. An examination of housing and housing services for older people discusses owner-occupied housing, rental housing, and the need for coordination of community resources. A social services report focuses  on the Older Americans Act and the delivery of services to older people. A paper on long-term care considers the continuum of care needed by chronically ill older people and discusses both institutionalization and home-care alternatives. Employment opportunities for older people and the ramifications of a national retirement policy are also reviewed. The final paper focuses on the elimination of negative stereotypes toward aging and older people. (NRB)",

Of the 41 abstracts from the Mini-White House Conference Reports, 10 deal specifically with health care issues: alcoholism, Alzheimer's Disease, vision, hearing impairments, foot care, oral health care, long-term care, mental health, national health security, and nursing. Eleven mini-conference abstracts focus on the aging of specific populations, e.g., American Indians, Blacks, Asian  Americans, Hispanics, Euro-Americans, women, veterans, rural elderly, urban elderly, low income persons, and the institutionalized elderly. The remaining mini-conference abstracts deal with services, self-sufficiency, stereotypes, housing, and other issues relevant to aging. Abstracts are also presented from the State White House Conference Reports of all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the Navajo Nation, the Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Alternative approaches to social support are considered, e.g., congregate housing, multi-purpose senior centers, day services and respite care, homemaker-home health aide services, and hospice care. Committee recommendations for the formation of  public policy are categorized under the headings of: (1) economic security; (2) social services, informal support, and the family; (3) in-home and community-based service; (4) linkages, access and follow-up; (5) diversity and choice; (6) prevention, wellness and independence; and (7) newer service programs. The appendix contains additional documentation in support of the committee recommendations. An executive summary of this report is also included. (NRB)",

Key issues and recommendations to improve the quality of life of older Americans are then enumerated. The remainder of this report addresses the areas which contribute to quality of life, including: (1) housing; (2) transportation; (3) crime against the elderly; (4) legal services; (5) arts and humanities; and (6) creative use of time. Discussions for each topic focus on the present situation, key issues, and committee policy recommendations; a  bibliography is also provided for each topic. As an example of the format used for each topic, the section on housing examines the number of elderly, where they live, their status as home owners or renters, poverty, health, and the family. Suggestions to meet the housing demands of the elderly consider non-metropolitan housing programs, coordination of federal programs, funding, special architectural features, displacement, and housing choice. Findings, issues, and recommendations for each topic are provided in the executive summary of this report. (NRB)",

A section of the philosophy and experience of government in the field of aging considers, among other issues, age-integrated  and age-segregated approaches to aging. Government organization is discussed at the federal, state, and local levels, and general issues of government structure are examined, i.e., decentralization versus centralization, advisory structures, advocacy, and citizen/client accountability.

Several opportunities for older persons which have been promoted or expanded by the federal government are described, including: (1) the Retired Senior Volunteer Program; (2) the Foster Grandparents Program; (3) the Senior Companion Program; and (4) the Senior Community Service Employment Program. A discussion of barriers to the fuller utilization of older persons examines age discrimination and negative attitudes about age, along  with the older person's functional ability, fear of rejection, lack of finances, difficulties with transportation, fear of crime and concern for personal safety, and lack of information about opportunities to be a resource.

The section on options explores alternative images of an aging society and policy implications of these alternatives. Three images of future society are outlined and the policy implications of each are illustrated as a society: (1) in which adulthood is perceived to be indivisible and in which chronological age differences are irrelevant to policymakers; (2) that redefines the social meaning and boundary of old age; and (3)  that recognizes the special status and special responsibilities of older persons. This third image, veteranship, is presented as an attractive image of future society; subsequent committee recommendations for a future aging policy are based on this concept of veteranship.

The work of two committee-appointed subcommittees on stereotypes and new media technology are explained with a special emphasis on the influence of television. Age stereotyping is examined in prime time television, daytime television serials, and television commercials as well as in print magazine advertising and children's literature. Age discrimination in employment is mentioned in relationship to the underrepresentation of older persons in televised programming and commercials. Key issues related to the media's portrayal of older persons are identified and recommendations are made. The new technology section of this report considers the potential uses of  videotape recorders, video discs, cable television, interactive cable, and cable and computer technology. Advantages of this new technology are discussed, problems are addressed, and key issues and recommendations are listed. This report concludes that new media technology presents the potential for more programming directed toward the needs of older Americans in entertainment, news and information, and offers the potential for innovative services to help solve the problems of older Americans.

Four factors which may cause the elderly to be a highly susceptible group for alcohol problems are: (1) retirement and its boredom, role changes, and financial problems; (2) increased concern with death and losses of relatives and friends; (3) poor health and chronic discomfort; and (4) loneliness, particularly among older women. Although surveys in older age groups are of questionable value, anecdotal evidence and early studies suggest that a high proportion of elderly (10-15%) who seek medical attention for any reason have an alcohol-related problem, and that elderly alcoholics are relatively easy to treat. If these findings can be confirmed,  detection during health-seeking encounters could have great potential value. Research in detection and treatment is critical. A prevention strategy aimed at persons aged 55 to 64 could prevent subsequent alcohol problems among these people and might indirectly reach those at older and less accessible ages. (Author/NRB)",

Many older Americans, for whom English is a second language, need instruction in both English and basic literacy skills. Many older adults living at or near poverty levels have no high school diploma and experience great difficulty in finding employment. Adult basic education could provide work-related educational programs for these people. Because health is a key factor affecting older adult participation in education, educational programs in nursing homes and home-bound programs are needed to reach more elderly persons. This lack of education appears to affect the mental health of some older adults; thus,  education for this group could improve their self-esteem. Older adults with little education view their lack of education as a problem, yet few are attracted to adult basic education classes. Although researchers have begun to identify the illiterate elderly in relation to their involvement in educational literacy activities, future research is needed to clarify and solve the problems of the illiterate elderly.

The next section on education concerns older adult learning, lifelong learning, and information education for service  providers as well as a description of a public library model project which concentrates on information provision and education to increase information literacy. The third section discusses information, including information on demand, career and employment information, information and referral services, and information through programming. The final section on management and training to provide public library services for the aging addresses administrative issues in service provision and education for library and information professionals; the future of the public library system is also considered.

        "description":"Business firms are an integral part of the age stratification structure of society. Although the age structures of people and roles within the organization are dynamic, these structures yield a fairly stable strata in which norms exist to suggest the various roles expected of certain persons. Those in roles with greater financial rewards, power, and prestige tend to be older. This is true, not only because age suggests knowledge and experience, but also because such a system provides motivation for younger workers to improve performances and stay with one company. Furthermore, older members in the top ranks also ensure turnover in the top ranks. Several organizational practices, such as career paths, serve to maintain the age stratification system. Three observations can be made  about formal organizations and the aging process, i.e.,: (1) several kinds of individual aging take place within an organization; (2) aging is a form of automatic mobility; and (3) work organizations need a continual replenishment of the ranks in order to survive. The study of the aging individual cohort and of the succession of cohorts is needed to further the understanding of organizational processes and aging. (NRB)",

        "description":"Aging of the national population coupled with shifts in long-term redistribution trends have sparked interest in the spatial distribution of the elderly population. The insufficiency of economic models for explanations of elderly migration has been recognized and new approaches are being developed. Findings regarding the effects of retirement, climate, and family, as well as other variables, support the notion that the elderly are more responsive to amenity or quality of life variables. The formulation of models to explain the origins of spatial variation in age structures and to predict the consequences of this variation should take into account the demographic dynamics of the aging process, recognizing that: (1) the behavior of both the young and old can influence spatial  variation in aging; (2) in low fertility, low mortality societies, fertility and mortality will move the society toward spatial homogeneity; and (3) in such societies, migration is the major process generating spatial variation in age structures. Research must concentrate on investigating the consequences of elderly redistribution. (Author/NRB)",

A review of facts and figures about the older population is followed by a discussion of programs and responses to the needs of older Americans by libraries and other agencies, such as Books for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, services to the homebound, and information and referral services. A historical look at library services for the elderly is provided, characteristics of such services are described, and suggestions for program development and improvement are given. Several library programs for the elderly are described, classified by the geographic location of the library system which provides support. The  next section on perceptions of aging reviews research, studies, and opinions which confirm the lack of a typical old age or reaction to aging. The final section discusses recommendations for libraries and lists 10 areas that should be considered in developing new library programs and activities for the older population. (NRB)",

The Artley-Hardin \"Inventory of Teacher Knowledge of Reading\" was administered to three classes of senior education majors following their eight-week reading methods course and again following their eight weeks of student teaching. Supervisory teachers were rated on the \"Teacher Effort Scale in Reading.\" Results of the knowledge test showed no significant differences between student teachers with supervisory teachers rated high in teacher effort and those with supervisory teachers rated low in teacher effort. The results raised questions  about the accepted intent of student teaching and the perfunctory treatment given the whole area of classroom organization and management in preservice training. If, as the results suggest, student teaching does not make a significant contribution to prospective teachers' knowledge of reading, the current emphasis on extensive field experience would seem to be of benefit only if systematic training and practice is given to student teachers in various management techniques.

The paper argues that for such a dialogue to occur, each participant's language must have not only ideas to share and questions to ask, but also spaces that invite the other to enter and contribute. It also suggests that a barrage of information and instructions from a teacher, the textbook, or another aspect of the curriculum might seem to the student to be more like an assault than an invitation to join in learning. The paper concludes with suggestions for ways that teachers can best participate in the dialogue between student and text. (FL)",

        "description":"Three previous investigations of the effects of students' metacognitive awareness of question-answer relationships on reading comprehension led to the development of a four-session question-answer relationship (QAR) training program which can be used as a supplement to a regular reading program. The QAR in the proposed training program is based on the Pearson and Johnson taxonomy, which categorizes questions in terms of the relationships between the questions and possible sources of response information, both in the text and within the reader's background. As a result of the QAR instruction, the students should be able to identify a QAR, select the appropriate strategy for locating the response information, and provide an adequate response. The first lesson in the training  program introduces the QAR concept and terminology, while the second lesson introduces slightly longer passages with up to five questions per passage. The third lesson provides practice on the QAR task using one longer passage on a single topic, and the last lesson involves work with material typically found in classrooms. (Appendixes include transparency masters, student handbooks for lessons one through three, basal-type passages, and maintenance passages.) (HOD)",

The subjects, 64 college students, were timed while they drew inferences from syntactically affirmative and negative sentences containing the implicative predicates &quot;remember/forget&quot; and &quot;bother/neglect&quot; in different linguistic contexts that met the presuppositions of the sentences at varying levels of generality. Different patterns of inference latencies were obtained for the two implicative predicates studied, suggesting that there are important differences among negative implicative predicates that influence their representation and processing. Regardless of these  differences, inference latencies for all sentences decreased when they were presented in contexts that met some of their presuppositions indicating that context can facilitate inferential processing.

The 100 subjects, equal numbers of three-, four-, five-, and six-year-old children and college students, completed similarity statements by choosing one of two words from (1) a metaphorical/literal word pair, (2) a literal/anomalous word pair, and (3) a metaphorical/anomalous word pair. Selections were also made in a categorization task. The results suggested that even the youngest children could distinguish meaningful comparisons from anomalous ones. It appeared that four-year-old and older children were aware that the terms from the metaphorical comparisons, unlike the literal ones, belonged to different conventional categories. These results were interpreted as  indicating that as early as four years of age children have some rudimentary metaphorical competence. (Author/RL)",

        "author":["Pearson, P. David"],
        "description":"Cognitive research of the 1970s has shown that both content factors (topical world knowledge and knowledge about textual organization) and process factors (attention, encoding, inference, retrieval, and executive monitoring) influence comprehension. Classroom research during the same decade has shown that the greater the proportion of time students spend on a task, the better their performance on the task; content covered tends to be positively related to achievement; that error rate seems to add a significant amount of power in predicting achievement above and beyond engagement and content covered; and that group instruction (particularly small group instruction) is consistently associated with positive gains in achievement. The research surveying current practices for teaching  reading comprehension, however, is limited to two studies by D. Durkin that showed virtually no direct instruction in comprehension. Other recent studies have evaluated the effects of direct explicit attempts to help students develop heuristic strategies (if not rules) for dealing with a range of comprehension tasks typically required in schools. These data suggest comprehension skills can be taught. Future research should focus on explicit attempts to help students develop independent strategies for coping with the kinds of comprehension problems they are asked to solve in school. Current knowledge of basic comprehension processes and instruction, while not complete, is sufficient to allow its application to issues of reading comprehension instruction. (HOD)",

An account of cognition is proposed in which mental relations are transient functional relations, and in which psychological permanence is a functional characteristic of the neuronal system, making cognition a &quot;psychobiological&quot; phenomenon. The literature relevant to this psychobiological character of cognition is discussed, and the central concept in this approach to cognition--the schema-of-the-moment--is examined, emphasizing a functional organization created by the activity of anatomically distributed constellations of neuronal elements. Comprehension,  remembering, learning, awareness, and affect also are discussed briefly in terms of this active neuronal schema-of-the-moment and the direct role of the nervous system in cognitive functioning.

        "description":"One of the most consistent findings of research on discourse is that important text information is better learned than less important information because readers devote more attention to the important information. There is now very good reason to believe that questions cause readers to attend selectively to question-relevant information and that a process supported by the extra attention causes more of the question-relevant information to be learned. However, despite superficial appearances, attention does not lie on the causal path between the interest value of a sentence and the learning of this sentence. Children do pay more attention to interesting sentences and they do learn more interesting sentences. However, a deep analysis suggests that the extra attention is a secondary  phenomenon. So far, research on whether attention plays a part in the learning of information important in the light of a reader's perspective has been inconclusive. The problem may not be so much with the concept as with the method of assessing the level of cognitive effort using discrete secondary task probes. (HOD)",

Matched groups of 15 American and 15 Australian Aboriginal women heard and recalled two stories that incorporated Aboriginal and Western conceptions of illness and health. Results showed that the American subjects, because they were completely unfamiliar with Aboriginal culture, provided strong support for the claim that the presence of schemata is a factor  influencing comprehension and recall of a text.

The 104 college students in the study read three passages, each of which was preceded by different combinations of questions about information high or low in the structural hierarchy of the text, then completed a vocabulary test and free-recall tasks on the selections. The results indicated that questions directing the subjects' attention to material at the top of the organizational structure facilitated the effective encoding of the central organizational idea within the passage segment. Indirect recall (recall of nonquizzed information) was greater for high-level questions than recall in both the low-level question condition and the  no-question condition. A significant interaction also was found between subjects' vocabulary ability and question condition. The facilitative effect of high-level questions declined with increasing vocabulary ability. This interaction is consistent with the view that high-ability and low-ability people differ in their tendency to use the superordinate organizational structure of the passage and thus in their tendency to benefit from processing aids such as adjunct questions.

The experimental treatment consisted of three parts: (1) making students aware of the importance of relating new information to their existing knowledge structures; (2) getting students to speculate, prior to reading, about what they would do in the protagonist's situation and to predict what the protagonist would do; and (3) getting students to answer a number of  inferential questions. Students in the control group received literal/inferential questions in a pattern most often reflected in elementary school reading instruction. The results showed that poor readers tended to benefit from the instruction more than did good readers. The poor readers did not differ substantially from good readers in answering the inferential questions. The poor readers also outperformed their control group peers, indicating that the experimental teaching approach was successful.

A secondary task was used to measure the amount of cognitive capacity expended during sentence comprehension; on half of a subject's trials a brief click was presented through headphones while the subject was processing the verification-task sentence. The results showed that more cognitive effort was  required for analyzing the meaning of a metaphor than for a literal sentence. The recognition data also showed that a sentence was remembered better when the meaning was conveyed metaphorically.

A study was conducted to examine the nature of the nonreview constraints and to compare the results to those obtained in a naturalistic setting in which review was allowed. Subjects were 99 secondary school students who were placed in either an experimental (review) or a  control group (nonreview) and given a 1,700 word passage to read. Those passages used by the control groups did not contain inserted questions; however these subjects were told that they would be asked to recall as much as possible about the passage after reading. All subjects were given free recall and cued recall tests following the experiment. Results showed that, contrary to expectations, relevant learning was not enhanced by inserted questions in the text. In addition, incidental learning was also slightly depressed by the use of inserted questions. This was true for both review and nonreview groups. (Materials used in the study are appended.) (FL)",

Focusing primarily on the use of illustrations in textbooks designed for able readers, a literature review has revealed the following: (1) illustrations have been shown in a few instances to facilitate comprehension, although a number of other studies have not been successful in showing this; (2) a number of studies have shown that illustrations can enhance recall, but recall is suspected of often being confounded by comprehension; and (3) that pictures can assist with attitude change in some situations has been demonstrated, while one of their attributes, namely the attractiveness of illustrations, does not seem  to have been directly tested. In summary, despite many failures to support the value of illustrations in texts, their value has been confirmed by recent studies and by the long tradition that constitutes the practice of graphic design.

Testing as a means of directly enhancing prose learning is generally not recognized and is not used much in the schools. If it were, every period of instruction would be brought to a close with a short test. Such a test could well be an ungraded self-test, for its purpose would be not to manage the instructional process, but to consolidate the learning experience that has just taken place. Testing in this sense is similar to practice or rehearsal. The  testing effect consolidates learning in terms of degree of processing, not structurally. A test thus provides a stimulus for engaging in the consolidation of learning. The context here is similar to that of most adjunct aids, such as learning objectives, inserted questions, and typographical cueing, all of which suggest certain strategies to the learners. Research on the testing effect has generally excluded, for experimental reasons, the provisions of feedback, review opportunities, and test anticipation effects, in order to isolate the consolidation effect per se. However, all of these other factors would likely be present in educational contexts and would further add to the value of testing. (HOD)",

Eight expository passages from a standardized reading test were revised by using word lists to simplify the vocabulary and a restriction in syntactic structure to simplify the sentences. The passages were presented to recruits in five different conditions in which the reading task (reading-to-do or reading-to-learn), the time allowed for reading, and the comprehension test format (multiple choice or cloze) were varied. Results showed that, with the exception of one instance, the readable writing revisions had no practical effect on comprehension regardless of the reading skills of the recruits. The one positive  instance of practical significance was for low ability readers when the reading task was in a reading-to-learn format. The results indicated that readable writing revisions can facilitate comprehension only under very particular circumstances, and that changes in the readability score are not in any way predictive of the changes in comprehension. Thus, a readability formula score is neither an effective guideline nor an effective criterion to impose on a writer. (Materials used in the experiments are appended.) (FL)",

The videotape also records the exact sequences of verbal and nonverbal events, which classroom observers cannot always do. In contrast to videotape recordings, the narrative observer will always have a wider angle of vision than the video camera, viewing a number of  events at the same time while recording one particular event. The experienced narrative observer also brings to the classroom a sense of \"history\" and context that the camera does not have. The observer can usually evaluate intensity and saliency at the time of the event better than a videotape can show later, and is better able to focus on particular students without losing view of the class as a whole.

The results showed that particularly high levels of agreement on better readers occurred in the classes with whole-class instructional formats. While the data did not indicate that students' ages had  any effect on their perceptions, ability differences suggested that students in ability-based instructional groups were less likely to make accurate judgments about task performance, and that being in a classroom where reading groups operated at the same time may provide low-ability students with useful information for judging other students in the classroom.

Questionnaires were mailed to the approximately 1,400 black students attending LSU and an equal number of white students, and responses were obtained from 129 black and 114 white students. A lower participation rate in extracurricular activities was found for black students compared to white students. Black students participated significantly less in: professional, career, or honorary groups; on-campus football games; on-campus religious services; and classes. Blacks appeared to substitute off-campus activities, probably at Southern University, for LSU on-campus activities. Black students perceived  discrimination from faculty members significantly more than did white students, and more often felt that less discrimination and more acceptance would increase their participation in extracurricular activities, as would more information about the extracurricular activities. In addition, black students more often felt that an outreach program for recruitment would enhance black participation, and that organizations of activities interesting black students would help induce black participation. Whites preferred predominantly white organizations, while blacks preferred mixed groups. While a large groups of blacks wanted the administration to further integrate on-campus activities, an equally large number advocated the formation of exclusively black organizations. (SW)",

        "description":"The need to continue or renew the Teacher Certificate Program at Barber-Scotia College was examined. Data are presented on student enrollments in the education programs during 1977-1980 by subject area and sophomore, junior, and senior classification. Although student enrollment declines were found in education programs at the college, an evaluation of 1977, 1979, and 1981 graduates appeared to indicate that the education program provided more career opportunities than other major courses at the college. According to the Education Division Head, the only major reason affecting student attrition was a requirement that a grade point average of 2.50 be maintained. Other possible reasons for poor performance of education majors may include undertaking too many credit hours in a  semester and not enough flexibility in the required core courses. Based on the findings, it is recommended that education programs at the college be continued and a support program for education majors be established, including tutoring and remedial classes. It is noted that some southern colleges and universities are attempting to limit the enrollments in teacher education programs in response to a reported national surplus of teachers. It is proposed that such a limitation at a predominantly black college like Barber-Scotia may be unwise, and that the 1980 enrollment of 31 education students needs to be increased to the 1977 level of 74 students. In the attempt to increase student enrollments, the college's standards should be preserved. (SW)",

Students provided assessments concerning the impact of the college's course offerings, the effectiveness of their instructors, and the difficulty or amount of effort instructors required from students. Overall student attitudes toward course materials, assignments, quizzes, instructors, and student responsibility were used as a measure of the degree of student academic motivation. Of the 200 students surveyed, 32.5 percent were found to be academically unmotivated. It was found that the more highly academically motivated the student, the greater the impact a  course had, and the less complaints the student had about learning course materials. Additional findings include: students from rural areas seemed to be more academically inclined than students from suburban and urban areas; and students who studied an average of 4 or more hours per day were more academically inclined. It is recommended that the Office for Total Student Development and the Counseling Office become more concerned about academic problems. Potential dropouts tend to complain about a number of areas, including classwork, instructors, and college services. Most academically unmotivated students at Barber-Scotia College reject assignments and are deficient in study skills. A questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

In addition, a brief historical review illustrates accessibility to full participation of citizens and noncitizens of early civilizations as well as present-day performance on pencil-paper measures as a means to gain access to fuller benefits in society. An illustration of misuse of testing results was the use of Army data by C. C. Brigham (1923) to indicate the ability of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Data on recent Italian immigrants were used to indicate innate ethnic differences and there was no cross-tabulation by years of schooling or  other relevant factors. A 1974 study (Robert Williams) measured the effects of test instructions written in black dialectical language and in standard English on the performance of black children during intelligence testing. Children who took the test representative of their cultural background scored significantly higher than the other group. It is suggested that a criterion will be enhanced if it is developed by the population for which the measure is designed, and that minorities engage in such research and evaluation activities. The design and use of the Pupil Evaluation Measure with prekindergarten children attending a federally funded program at Baltimore City Public Schools is also addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"Assumptions that many academic psychologists have concerning the undergraduate research experience are reviewed, and comparisons are made to the educational process in the physical and natural sciences. In addition, the development of undergraduate research conferences is discussed in terms of some general assumptions about science education in psychology. The assumption that a few good methods courses in the undergraduate psychology curricula are sufficient is challenged. It is suggested that the usual course offerings in psychology provide little direct experience with the majority of the techniques and methods, and that the nature of the techniques taught in the research methods courses are biased by the research interests of the instructor. A second assumption is that the  goal of the undergraduate curriculum is to prepare students for the demands of graduate education. It is noted that the majority of baccalaureate graduates never go on for advanced degrees in psychology. The University of Texas, Austin, encourages students considering graduate school to undertake additional research courses. A third assumption challenged is that teaching undergraduates to do research will not be helpful in attaining tenure. Although it is the faculty member's own research efforts that are typically rewarded, an undergraduate researcher might be integrated into the established research programs of the faculty. Finally, the assumption that it is better to have undergraduates do a mediocre study than no study at all is acknowledged, since it is important to increase the  awareness of research techniques for all undergraduate majors, while at the same time encouraging good and potentially original research.

The former emphasizes scholarship, textual explication and criticism, and, in general, a knowledge of the views of traditional thinkers. Philosophy as conceptual therapy seeks an improvement of intellectual skills, and fosters a therapy for concepts and, by inference, a therapy for thinkers. It is argued that the traditional information-oriented approach to philosophy does not help its students effectively to develop intellectual skills, and that a conception of philosophy as conceptual therapy can provide a valuable contribution to the teaching and to the subject-matter of philosophy. It is suggested that the  information-oriented historian of philosophy is frequently incompetent to judge the relative merit of incompatible systems and ideas because, although adept at scholarship, the historian-philosopher tends to be unable to evaluate the worth of theories investigated. On the other hand, the conceptual therapist is limited by historical incompetence (i.e., not being informed of the lessons learned over the centuries). Current attitudes toward education foster almost exclusively the first approach: an educated person is above all informed. It is claimed that the well-educated person unfortunately has not learned to think much better than peers who never attended college. The validity of the fixed intelligence hypothesis is briefly addressed. Based on current evidence, it is proposed that  abilities of intelligence can be systematically developed in individuals by means of suitable training. (SW)",

For 14 professions, data are presented on the average number of hours of continuing education needed annually to meet the requirement, the costs to the practitioner, and the total annual cost in fees for each health science discipline. It is claimed that mandatory continuing education costs the state virtually nothing, either to deliver or to enforce through licensing agencies. Information is presented on the status of required continuing education among the 50 states and the District of Columbia for 16 professions, 9 in the health sciences, 2 in the social sciences, and 5 in nonhealth fields. Apparently, no 2 states  agree on which of the 16 fields need continuing education requirements. It is concluded that: (1) government should encourage licensed health professionals to keep up systematically with developments in their fields; (2) for self-employed practitioners such as physicians and optometrists, continuing education tends to concentrate on developing greater depth or specialization, but for salaried practitioners such as nurses and pharmacists, it may concentrate on the development of breadth and flexibility; (3) neither the statutes nor implementing regulations for continuing education indicate what is expected of the professional learner; (4) no way exists to determine whether these educational activities are achieving any useful purpose; and (5) access to continuing education varies greatly  depending on location and profession. It is suggested that these requirements place burdens on geographically isolated and low-income practitioners, are costly to both professionals and consumers, and cannot ensure professional competence.

After an introduction by Anne Fuller, papers by three women's studies scholars are presented. \"Feminist Scholarship--The Extent of the Revolution\" (Florence Howe) suggests that the study of women is not only an academic question but a question of allowing women images of achievement and aspiration comparable to those the curriculum has generally afforded at least to white middle-class males. \"A Feminist Critique of the Liberal Arts\" (Elizabeth Kamarck Minnich) proposes that schools are still educating people in a system that grew out of a hierarchical  and partial vision of what humanity is. \"The Challenges of Women's History\" (Gerda Lerner) suggests that women's history challenges the traditional periodization of history and indicates a need for a redefinition of categories and values. Lastly, conference recommendations for institutions, administrators, education associations, and disciplinary groups are also presented. Among the conclusions are: (1) liberal education is \"illiberal\" if it does not take adequate account of the values, accomplishments, lives, and perspectives of half the human race; (2) research on women integrates new information into the curriculum to provide a more complete understanding of human experience; and (3) a new feminist scholarship, which examines a topic or discipline from the points of view of both men  and women, can change assumptions, values, and methodologies of many areas of study.

Federally-supported TRIO programs (also including Education Opportunity Centers, Talent Search, and Upward Bound programs) provide support services for disadvantaged college students. The GC's Special Services program, designed to help prevent attrition among nontraditional freshmen, has four components: an integrated course of study, including help with study skills, career planning, writing, math, and stress management; educational, vocational, and personal counseling; individual tutorial services; and a summer institute. During the 1981-1982 academic year, TRIO services were utilized by 252 students. Survey results  indicate that TRIO students, compared to new GC students, were older, received a higher percent of financial aid, and included more minorities and disabled students. A higher percentage of the new TRIO students stayed in school and completed a higher proportion of credits than a similar low-income comparison group who did not receive special services. New TRIO students also maintained grade point averages similar to, or higher than, the comparison group and ended the year with higher self-esteem than the control group. A followup of second-year TRIO students revealed more TRIO students attending each quarter than control group students, but no notable differences in grades, credit completion, and overall retention for the two groups. Case studies of two TRIO students, course evaluations,  a brief description of the summer institute, and a special evaluation of sign language classes and hearing impaired students are included.

Students were also given the opportunity to indicate their social and political attitudes and their specific concerns about adjusting to the university. The UMCP international students were quite similar in terms of general characteristics to a national sample, as reported by the Institute for International Education (IIE) in its annual survey. The majority of both samples came from South and East Asia, followed by the Middle East. However, unlike the IIE sample, the UMCP sample consisted of both immigrant and nonimmigrant students. Sixty-one percent of the  sample were males and 66 percent were undergraduates. Half of the respondents had been in the United States for less than a year. Forty-three of the incoming international students had graduated in the top 10 percent of their class, and 47 percent expected to earn a doctoral degree in their lifetime. For 67 percent of the students, UMCP was their first choice, while it was second choice for 22 percent. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents chose investigative occupations as part of their occupational goals, followed by social (17 percent) and enterprising (10 percent) occupations. In terms of adjusting to college, the international students were most concerned about meeting financial expenses and budgeting time, and least concerned about selecting a field of study and/or career, and  getting to meet and know other students. Some of the questionnaire items are included. (SW)",

Approximately 920,000 bachelor's degrees and over 400,000 postbaccalaureate degrees were awarded nationally. In 1979, 87.3 percent of bachelor's degrees went to white graduates, with the next largest portion (6.6 percent) going to blacks. Bachelor's degrees were awarded to 3,410 American Indians, 15,407 Asians, and 17,839 nonresident aliens. Although Hispanics accounted for 6.4 of the population, they accounted for only 2.2 percent of all bachelor's degrees. Business and management was among the top three degree fields for all groups, while education was the field most often chosen among blacks and American Indians. Engineering was the top choice of nonresident  aliens, and social sciences ranked number three for each of the groups and for all groups combined. Of the 300,255 master's degrees awarded, 83 percent went to whites, and blacks and nonresident aliens each accounted for 6.5 percent. Education ranked first for all groups except Asians and nonresident aliens, and business and management was either first or second for all groups. Public affairs and services and engineering were also frequently selected. A total of 32,675 doctoral degrees were awarded, and 80 percent went to whites. The second largest number went to nonresident aliens. Three fields were among the top five for all groups: education, social sciences, and biological sciences. The field of physical sciences was among the top five for all groups except Hispanics. Lastly, 68,611  first-professional degrees were awarded, 91 percent to whites, and the next largest number to blacks. Law was by far the largest field, followed by medicine, theology, and dentistry.

During the third project year, these objectives guided the program: (1) provision of practical experience for six second-year doctoral students in (a) project design and data collection in research and evaluation projects, (b) analysis and interpretation of data, (c) report writing, and (d) paper and proposal presentation; (2) student participation in colloquia and mini-courses to enhance research amd administrative skills; (3) interaction of project personnel through structured exercises in  group dynamics; (4) project personnel attendance and participation at regional and national conferences and training workshops; (5) student internships; and (6) student evaluation of the project. Eighteen doctoral students (1 black male, 4 black females, 13 white females) received fellowships during the project's 3 years. Each completed at least two research projects and most presented at least one paper at a national meeting. All said they had undertaken research they would not have done without the program's impetus. Most believed the experience enhanced their employability. Students valued most the opportunities to engage in interdisciplinary research, present the research results at professional meetings, and develop or strengthen professional networks. (Author/MSE)",

Data were drawn from the 1980 High School and Beyond national survey of 58,000 high school sophomores and seniors, which was sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. The study sample was 14,287, or 52 percent of the High School and Beyond seniors. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and eight multiple regression analyses were performed. Four important predictors of college attendance plans were found: socioeconomic status, high school grades, academic ability, and race. The two most important predictors were grades and ability; socioeconomic status was found to have an indirect effect through its influence on grades  and ability. A nonwhite student was more likely to plan to attend college than a white student with similar grades, ability, and socioeconomic status. Initially, the theoretical model included the variables of father's and mother's education, family income, and sex. However, father's and mother's education and family income were found to be a part of the socioeconomic status composite. (SW)",

According to 1972-1979 data, the greater the educational attainment of the young adults, the higher their starting wage rates. Although the wage rates of young women college graduates quickly caught up to and overtook those of their female high school classmates who did not attend college, the wage rates of young men who did not attend college remained higher than their college-educated classmates for at least 8 years after high school. However, within every educational level and age group, females earned less per hour than comparable males. While in school, young people worked for lower  hourly pay than they could get were they not in school. The women studied showed a crossover point (when the wage rates of those with differing levels of educational attainment show only minimal differences) in wage rates in 1976, when most of them were 22 years old. In that year, the wage rate of women with no college was $4.27 per hour, of those with less than 2 years of college was $4.61 per hour, of those with 2 years of college or more or a two-year degree was $4.54, and of those with a bachelor's or advanced degree was $4.72 per hour. For men, the crossover point in earnings came in 1979, when most were 25 years old, when the median hourly wage rates of men were $7.06, $6.94, $6.50, and $6.88, respectively.

Major demographic trends that have major implications for postsecondary education are a birth rate decline, fewer persons of traditional college age, and an aging population. Two dilemmas will confront higher education as enrollment-driven revenues for many institutions level and decline: new bases for justifying budget increases will be needed, and migration and population growth patterns will result in some campuses growing, some remaining stable, and other contracting, often within the same state. Changes in  participation in higher education are analyzed by student sex, race, age, part-time enrollment status, income level, and ability level; by type of academic program; and by type of institution (public, private, and proprietary sectors). Economic trends affecting revenues available for postsecondary education include inflation, the scarcity of energy and natural resources, a growing competition for funds, the cost of higher education, productivity, and shifting sources of revenues. Social trends include views on the economic value of higher education and the production of advanced degrees. Contemporary trends will also affect the following goals of postsecondary education: access, diversity, quality, and economy. (SW)",

University presses in the United States have their roots in 15th century England when the Oxford University Press was established in 1478. The first U.S. press to use the term &quot;university press&quot; was Cornell University; the press operated from 1869 until it was closed in 1884 due to lack of funds. Johns Hopkins University Press, established in 1878, is the oldest university press in continuous operation. Today 77 members of the Association of American University Presses face financial problems related to their desire to expand scholarly communication while faced with a small readership. University press books rarely make money; university presses stay in business essentially because of subsidies.  Additional problems include a falling market due to the downturn in higher education that began in the early 1970s, an apparent movement away from purchasing scholarly monographs by university libraries, and recent unfavorable government legislation. Possible solutions to these problems include: the rise of paperbacks, dual publication, increasing foreign sales, gaining additional foundation support, and on-demand publishing. Recording or on-demand publishing is a plan for producing books only when needed; the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) system works in this way. It can be accessed by computer and allows users to examine documents on microfiche. (SW)",

Statements by various college administrators, higher education association representatives, and state legislators are included. The proposed regulations were issued pursuant to Title III of the Education Amendments of 1980. In addition to clarifying the Department of Education's (ED) proposed regulations, the hearing is also designed to identify the data needed to carry out Congress's intent and to assure smooth operation of the grant process. Attention is directed to four basic issues: (1) institutional eligibility and use of 1978-1979 Pell Grant data in determining institutional eligibility; (2) the definition of &quot;substantial&quot; as proposed in the regulation; (3) emphasis on  achieving institutional self-sufficiency or graduation from the Title III program; and (4) the regulatory limitations placed on explicit statutory set-asides for community colleges and historically black colleges. To be eligible, an institution must enroll a substantial percentage of students receiving need-based student financial assistance under Title IV, and the average amount of this student assistance must be high as compared with similar institutions. Based on the ED assumption that Congress expected that the statutory eligibility criteria would identify institutions that serve low-income students, the Department suggests that 35 percent be used as the definition of &quot;substantial percentage,&quot; and advises that the high-average award requirement in the law be deleted.

        "description":"The origin and extent of program reduction and discontinuance at colleges and universities, the elements of program review, and a framework for developing long-range organizational planning are considered. Program discontinuance refers to the merger of related programs, the elimination of certain degrees or programs within departments, and the closing of entire departments. Attention is directed to discontinuance initiated by state higher education agencies, institutions, and individual schools and colleges. Most of the information for the analysis is based on case studies and research on large public institutions and state higher education agencies; a survey of 46 state agencies also revealed that a nucleus of 26 states are initiating or recommending terminations. Additionally,  a literature review considers society at large and the psychology of decline and policy formation, especially policies of termination. The following steps of program review are examined: initiating program discontinuance; the review process itself, including the selection of models and evaluation criteria; the decision-making step; and implementation of the decision and assessment of impacts on students, faculty, academic programs, and institutional budgets and organizational behavior. It is proposed that the institution needs: policies, data, and personnel to design strategies for program discontinuance; review teams and a continuous review process; sunset provisions (i.e., a stipulation calling for periodic program evaluation); and provisions for incentives and rewards at various stages  in the discontinuance process.

        "description":"Statewide planning for higher education and the approaches that states take to budgeting and accountability are reviewed in this monograph. Statewide planning involves identifying problems and collecting relevant data, analyzing interrelationships among variables, and choosing the most desirable alternatives to reach objectives. State-level higher education planning typically is done by the state higher education board. Requisites for planning effectiveness are university participation in state-level planning and university planning on the foundation of the state-level plan. There appears to be a trend toward: continuous, short-range planning due to uncertainty of the future; the refinement of scope and mission review, a close connection between statewide planning and program  review; and attention to plan implementation problems. State boards have attempted to ensure diversity of instructional programs, and most states include private institutions in their planning perspectives to reduce duplication and competition. It is suggested that higher education retrenchment will continue to be required in most states during the 1980s and 1990s. State budgeting approaches are categorized as incremental, formula, or rational, and the budgeting decision-making process may be assisted by information systems. State interest in accountability for the private sector, the relationship between accountability and institutional autonomy, and efforts of governing and coordinating types of statewide boards to balance state and institutional interests are addressed.

        "description":"This report describing the use of operations research techniques to determine which courseware packages or what microcomputer systems best address varied instructional objectives focuses on the MICROPIK model, a highly structured evaluation technique for making such complex instructional decisions. MICROPIK is a multiple alternatives model (MAA) whose overall goal is to formulate an evaluation and decision-making procedure and to model or simulate this evaluation framework as closely as possible, involving the school environment's established needs. An overview of the technical workings of the modeling framework and its performance of the evaluative comparison and final selection of alternative functions is followed by an explanation of the primary and secondary goals of the  model. Alternatives evaluated by the modeling framework are discussed, as well as the criteria necessary to evaluate and compare these alternatives. Additional topics covered include constraints, the execution, results, and the general utility of such a model together with common advantages and potential pitfalls. (LMM)",

        "description":"This study compared teachers instructed in use of Landsat satellite maps through one-way television and simultaneous telephone group conferencing to another teacher group instructed directly. Thirty teachers of intermediate children in Edmonton and Sherwood Park, Alberta, received 5 hours of instruction about Landsat maps over a 2-week period; they began instructing their pupils in Landsat map use during the second week. The Edmonton teachers received direct instruction in one center while Sherwood Park teachers received TV-telephone instruction in three different centers. Both groups had the same instructors and materials. Pupils taught by these teachers were tested on their ability to interpret Landsat maps, and teachers rated their inservice training with a mail questionnaire.  Results indicated that the TV-telephone mode was acceptable as an inservice delivery system, and was rated desirable by a majority. A substantial minority, however, viewed the experimental mode as undesirable, indicating a need for future analysis and some improvement on the present delivery mode. The TV-telephone mode was superior on physical comfort and convenience ratings, but no significant intergroup differences were found in capability to impart instruction. This report includes two references and suggests topics for further research. (LMM)",

        "description":"Designing teleconference programs for the physician learner puts unique demands on the teleconferencing medium. Typically, physicians expect a 1-hour lecture presentation with high information density. To effectively present the medical content material in an audio medium, strategies which structure and organize the content material are necessary. When high information density programs are teleconferenced, modifications in the format of a typical educational teleconference are necessary. A format which previews, presents, and reviews the content material has proved effective in such programs on the South Dakota Medical Information Exchange (SDMIX) teleconferencing network. This format structures the presentation, making the organization of the content apparent to the physician  learner. Visual techniques are employed in this organizational pattern to reinforce the structure and facilitate retention of the presentation content. The use of a stimulating title slide, a slide of the presenter, program outline, internal visual outlines, frequent changes in the visual elements, summary or transition visuals, color coding of visual and print materials, and humorous visuals have been found effective as means of presenting educational teleconference programs for physicians.

Another cooperative program provides graduate library education at Simmons College and practical training at Ohio University for a staff member from the Institute of Scientific and Technical  Information of China. The internship program has special features, including adaptation of the program to individual interns' needs.

The first chapter describes the history and development of library networks and defines terms used in the report. An examination of the current status of networks in the second chapter includes an outline of some of the most critical issues confronted and descriptions of four major information utilities and 21 state or multi-state service centers. Seven federal agencies specifically concerned with library networking are described in the third chapter, with particular attention given to the Library of Congress (LC) and the Office of Libraries and Learning Technologies Federal Library Committee (FLC). The fourth  chapter outlines networking issues of specific concern to the federal government, explores interrelationships among the federal agencies involved with library networking, and identifies political and economic trends which affect the agencies. The role and future strategies of the federal agencies in networking are examined in the fifth chapter, which presents six objectives for future federal participation in library networking based on the decentralized development of library networks in response to local and regional service needs, and the historically supportive but non-directive federal role in this process.

There is a brief examination of the roots of IRM in libraries, information centers, and computer and telecommunications technologies. The human uses of information in the decision-making process are considered. A review of information processing in hierarchical organizations identifies approaches which either reduce the causes of information expansion or increase the organization's capacity to deal with greater amounts of  information. Costs and benefits of each method and various roles and functions of information resource managers within organizations are discussed. Examples are drawn from both educational and business environments.

        "description":"This introduction to the major concepts of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is intended for individuals involved in health care provider education who are attempting to measure the costs and benefits of their educational activities. After tracing the development of CBA, the paper defines it as an attempt to quantify and compare the expenditures for a project with the value of the finished project and identifies the ways information gained from CBA can be used. In addition, the paper looks at problems associated with the use of CBA, such as the difficulty in assigning dollar values to attitude changes, aesthetic values, and increased quality of life; the costs of the analysis; and the inability of CBA to take social and environmental effects into consideration. Next, a summary is  provided of methods used to determine fixed and variable costs, and examples are cited of less expensive ways of providing health care training, such as cooperative programs, student self-training, the elimination of unnecessary units, and student-financed training. The following section of the paper looks at ways of determining direct, indirect, and long-term benefits, considering problems in evaluating revenue-producing services; citing possible assessment areas such as employee turnover and effectiveness of training; and reviewing a CBA of a physical fitness program as an example of setting objectives and determining benefits. A glossary of terms and bibliography conclude the paper. (AYC)",

After introducing the historical antecedents of CBVE, the first section defines the concept; enumerates the characteristics of an individualized, self-paced, open-entry/open-exit, competency-based program; and discusses the instructor's role in CBVE. The second section describes the CBVE programs offered by Central Community College (Nebraska), South Oklahoma City Junior College, the Employment and Training Office (Hawaii), and Hennepin Technical  Institute (Minnesota). The advantages claimed for CBVE are discussed in the third section, along with related potential problems and the findings of available research on the method's effectiveness. After warning of the unwiseness of a total commitment to wholly individualized CBVE in Hawaii at this time, the fourth section identifies the concepts and procedures that can be borrowed from the CBVE model to improve instruction. This section explores myths about CBVE, offers suggestions for developing a CBVE course or program, and reviews the procedural modifications necessary to implement such courses. The report concludes with a cautious, positive assessment of CBVE's potential in Hawaii. (AYC)",

Sexual thinking is defined as thinking about that broad area of sex and sexuality which impinges upon the child's world from birth. Face-to-face individual clinical interviews were devised to apply to children 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 years of age. Administered in Australia, England, North America, and Sweden, the interviews covered six areas: (1) aging and the best time to be alive in the human life sequence; (2) parents' identities and roles as mothers and fathers and as men  and women; (3) children's sex preferences and the way in which children perceive sex differences in the newborn and during puberty; (4) the origin of babies and the role of mothers and fathers in procreation, gestation, birth, and related processes, including the area of &quot;not having babies&quot;; (5) children's ideas about sex education at home and at school; and (6) clothing and nakedness. Children were also asked to define words on a sexual vocabulary list. Results are discussed in reference to developmental theories of childhood and implications for sex education. (RH)",

Conversely, the basic strength of any people results from their experience of historical and cultural continuity. The strengths of African-American children and families are to be found in their participation as members of a distinct cultural group. African-American culture, like all others, functions as a basis for the group's mobilization to work in its own behalf and provides for group identity, purpose, and direction. African-American children and families are strong when they feel themselves part of something much larger than themselves. Although such strength is not recognized in the  typical speculations and research of academics, nor in the distortions of television sitcoms and media fantasy, overwhelming evidence of strength in African-American children and families exists and can be seen, for example, in strong work orientation, achievement motivation, and kinship ties. Remedies for low performance among African-Americans are the same remedies other groups employ and enjoy; where group identity exists, the strengths of children and families will be manifest. (RH)",

Five days of field hearings held previously in various cities in the United States led to the conclusion that, despite the President's assurances that the administration's plan preserves a safety net, major cuts have been made in those programs specifically designed to assist those least able to help themselves--children, working mothers, the handicapped, the disabled, and the elderly. These cuts have had greatest impact on those who are on the  verge of self-sufficiency, pushing them back into total dependency. Private initiative and voluntarism cannot fill the void created by the cuts.

As part of Head Start, CFRP had as its primary goal enhancing children's development. The demonstration was designed to develop models for service delivery that could be adapted by different communities to serve different populations. CFRP operated in 11 sites, with each program receiving approximately 178,000 to 199,000 dollars per year to serve from 80 to 100 low-income families. In October of 1977, a longitudinal evaluation was initiated by ACYF in five sites. The evaluation employed an experimental design supplemented by descriptive and qualitative methods and focused primarily on CFRP's Infant-Toddler Component,  the portion of the program serving children from birth or the prenatal period until 3 years of age. This report summarizes the operation and effects of the Infant-Toddler Component. Chapter 1 provides a close-up portrait of CFRP in operation, while chapter 2 deals with the effects and effectiveness of CFRP. The third and final chapter draws implications for policy and program management. The design of the CFRP evaluation, study components, measures, and statistical methods employed are described in an appendix. (RH)",

Forty-eight unmarried adolescent fathers and 50 unmarried adolescent nonfathers were identified by social service workers. Data were collected by an adult black male interviewer in a face-to-face private interview. Questions pertained to the social and demographic characteristics of the subjects; their sexual knowledge, attitudes, and practices; the problems they encountered as adolescent males; and the ways they coped with their problems. Results indicate that if a black adolescent male's locus of control, contraceptive use, church  attendance, and school status are known, his status as a father can be predicted. Policy implications of this research include the suggestion that unmarried black adolescent fathers should be given birth control counseling and, if other forms of counseling are warranted, attention should be paid to issues of locus of control. Concluding remarks point out weaknesses of the study limiting its generalizability. (RH)",

All citations date from 1971 to 1982 and have been organized into eight categories: conceptual issues, developmental issues, historical context, legal issues, policy issues, political advocacy, role of government, and role of the family. The references primarily address children's needs, children's rights, and social policy from a generic viewpoint. Generally, references concerning specific services to children have not been included, while articles relating specific services to the eight categories listed above have been incorporated. In the main, then, references reflect issues related to the development of a conceptual framework for meeting children's needs and  addressing their rights. (Author/RH)",

The variables studied are locus of control, interpersonal and impersonal problem-solving ability, and objective and subjective life stress. Subjects were 47 students in the fourth grade, 58 students in the fifth grade, and 29 students in the sixth grade of a coeducational public school in a midwestern city. Several measures were employed, including the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Social Means-Ends Problem Solving Procedure, the Emotional Means-Ends Problem Solving Procedure, the Optional Thinking Test (Alternative Thinking), the Anagram Task, and Coddington's Life Events Scale for Children. Testing  was done either in groups or individually, depending on the nature of the instrument used. Results indicate that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with an external locus of control, increased level of life stress, and lower performance levels on an impersonal problem-solving task. The level of depressive symptoms was also found to be inversely related to socioeconomic status as measured by father's occupation. No consistent relationship was found between depression and interpersonal problem-solving ability. (Author/RH)",

As the number of working mothers increases, so does the need for reliable, quality child care during the work day. Heightening its traditional concern for working parents in need of quality child care services, the Women's Bureau has chosen as a primary initiative the establishment of employer-sponsored child care systems throughout the United States. One aspect of this thrust has been the updating and expansion of the contents of a widely used Women's Bureau publication, issued in 198l, to produce the present edition. It is hoped that planners of child care programs in business and industry, unions, employee associations, and communities will find this document rich in data,  guidance, and shared ideas. Contents focus on (1) the need for child care and the services presently available, (2) employer/labor involvement in programs that support working parents, (3) the establishment of a task force and the assessment of needs for employer/labor involvement in child care services, (4) program planning and cost analysis, (5) funding sources for chid care services, (6) tax issues and employer-sponsored child care services, (7) program components of a child care center, and (8) implementation of the program plan.

This function was selected for study because it is one of the earliest language functions to appear and because it has been the object of both theoretical and empirical research. Fourteen normal English-speaking middle-class Caucasian children 5 to 8 years of age participated in the study. Each child was tested individually at home by one female experimenter. Children's metapragmatic knowledge of the request function was explored with three tasks concerning production, comprehension, and reflection. The metaproduction task involved a role-playing activity with dolls in which requests were elicited in an imaginary classroom. The  metacomprehension task involved eliciting judgments of the appropriateness of requests in hypothetical classroom situations. The reflection task consisted of an open-ended interview which provided subjects an opportunity to talk about the use of requests in the classroom. Results showed effects for age of child and type of request. In comparison with younger children, older children were more likely to produce indirect requests, judge a request as inappropriate in a particular classroom situation, and refer to pragmatic violation as the basis for judgment. Requests for action were found to take indirect forms, while requests for information more often took direct forms. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to provide information about how formal features of television are related to children's selective attention and to determine how selective attention is related, in turn, to comprehension of content. Formal features are defined as attributes of television productions that are relatively content-free and that result from visual and auditory production techniques. Specifically, it was hypothesized that features influence comprehension in two ways: (1) salient features may draw attention selectively to certain content--that is, they may serve to emphasize and mark important content, or (2) salient features may provide a developmentally appropriate mode of representation for encoding content in iconic or symbolic codes. Analysis included an  investigation of the information processing chain from the effects of salience on attention to later comprehension of content. A total of 128 children at two age levels (kindergarten and and third/fourth graders) viewed a prosocial cartoon in same-sex pairs. Each child's visual attention to the television screen was continuously scored on a Datamyte. Children were then given a recall test consisting of 60 multiple-choice items. These questions had previously been cross-classified according to dimensions of content (either central or incidental) and formal features used to present that content (either salient or nonsalient). Results are discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"This report summarizes findings from an ethnographic study of the Child and Family Resource Program (CFRP), a Head Start demonstration program providing child development and family support services to low-income families with young children. Designed to describe program operations from the perspective of staff and client families, the study was mounted at one site in each of five states. Families with single nonworking parents, families with single working parents, two-parent families, and families with teenage mothers participated. Methods employed by the ethnographers included a review of CFRP records, interviews, home visits, and observation. Each researcher worked half-time for 6 months gathering data on the CFRP experiences of from seven to nine families. The investigators'  work was guided by a set of research questions that were to be addressed to each family. Chapter 1 of this summary volume provides an overview of the CFRP demonstration and the various components of the CFRP evaluation. Chapter 2 summarizes the findings of the ethnographic component, highlighting common features of program operations and major differences among programs. Chapter 3 lists the five major study conclusions. Attention is directed to the fact that the discussion of implications for Head Start policy and program management offered in this summary, and in the full program report as well, is to be considered preliminary and limited in scope.

        "description":"A longitudinal evaluation of the Child and Family Resource Program (CFRP) was conducted to describe programs and their operations, identify program models, link family outcomes to participation or nonparticipation, and relate family outcomes to aspects of CFRP treatment and family characteristics. An experimental design supplemented by descriptive and qualitative methodologies was employed. This final report assesses the effects and effectiveness of the program's 3-year infant/toddler component, the main focus of the evaluation. Chapter 1 provides an overview of CFRP and the evaluation, while chapters 2 through 4 provide a portrait of CFRP in operation. Chapter 5 deals with the effects of CFRP, and chapter 6 assesses the effects of different degrees of participation within the  CFRP group and investigates whether the program had different effects for different types of families with potentially different patterns of need. (Chapters 5 and 6 are nontechnical and are addressed to the general reader.) Chapter 7 summarizes the main findings, conclusions, and implications for policy and program management of the 5-year evaluation. Finally, a methodological appendix addressed to the technical reader amplifies the brief description of the study's statistical methods and results provided in Chapters 5 and 6, specifically providing discussion of measurement instruments and their administrative and psychometric properties, sample attrition and its analytic consequences, and the various statistical approaches used in data analysis. The appendix also presents some  representative statistical findings. (RH)",

Chapter 1 briefly summarizes the design of the CFRP evaluation and addresses the issues of sample selection and attrition, data collection procedures, and analytic strategies. In chapter 2, profiles are presented of the participating families and children. Chapter 3 provides a brief overview of program services along with a profile of CFRP staff, additionally examining the relationship between the CFRP staff and families, families' and staff's expectations, and the extent to which the views of staff and families were congruent. The impact of the CFRP on families  and infants after 6 months of program participation is the focus of chapter 4. Also described in this chapter is preliminary program impact in relation to changes in four outcome domains: (1) family circumstances (i.e., employment, education, income, housing, and so on), (2) maternal and child health, (3) parent/child relationships and interaction, and (4) family capacity for independence (use of community resources, locus of control and coping strategies, and affiliation with family and social networks). Finally, chapter 5 presents preliminary conclusions of this phase of the CFRP evaluation and gives recommendations for the future direction of evaluation. Related materials are included in six appendices. (MP)",

A Head Start demonstration project initiated by the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) in 1974, the PDC aimed to stimulate the development and implementation of comprehensive programs linking Head Start centers with local elementary schools in order to provide continuous developmental support through the third grade for children from low-income families. Full-fledged implementation of PDC programs began in 1976 at 13 sites distributed across the Head Start regions and the Indian and Migrant Program Division. Findings of the evaluation suggest that (1) the program model intended by ACYF was not fully realized anywhere, (2) local versions  of PDC had few effects on parents and teachers that were likely to enhance children's social competence, and (3) children's social competence was not generally enhanced by their program participation. In conclusion, reasons the evaluation failed to demonstrate PDC's effectiveness are explored. (RH)",

        "description":"The hearing's purpose was to begin building a record, from a national perspective, regarding older Americans who live in smaller towns and rural areas. It is not fully known what the real impact is of such matters as lack of transportation, nutritional deficiencies, distance to and shortage of health care, non-availability of adult education opportunities, inequalities in social security benefits for farmers (particularly farm wives), etc. In 1970 there were 125 counties in the nation with one-sixth or more of their population aged 65 or over. By 1978 that number had risen to 500. Although a large percentage of rural elderly are located in the midwest and south, recent migrations of older Americans have moved them to the Sun Belt and other areas. Much of this migration is caused  by older Americans returning from urban to rural areas for reasons of preferred environment and safety. Although availability of 1980 census data may supply some answers in numbers, still little is known about the people those numbers represent. There is much research to be done and programs that could be continued or initiated. For example, does high technology hold potential for uniting health needs with health answers? Three appendixes conclude the document. (BRR)",

The project's service delivery model was designed to reflect the state's rural remoteness (e.g., summer campus-based training with field-based academic year &quot;special problems&quot; follow-up) and tricultural diversity. During the second and third years of the project, 28 leadership personnel were brought to the  NMSU campus for 5 weeks of intensive didactic and &quot;hands-on&quot; inservice instruction. In-state tuition and $75-a-week traineeships were provided by the project. The majority of these personnel (representing 23 or 72% of New Mexico's 32 counties) are currently providing inservice training upon request in their own or contiguous counties and employing project-acquired competencies in their home programs. Among project-supported activities were provision of a regional infant, toddler, and preschool education of the handicapped conference attended by 74 New Mexico preschool personnel and development of of a materials collection within NMSU's College of Education.

The institute and inservice sessions were developed to aid teachers in the Hastings schools, located in a rural agricultural area of northeast Florida, in improving the oral communication skills of the primarily migrant students and children from low socioeconomic families. Teachers attending the institute rated the oral communication skills of 138 students and 142 students were  rated by teachers attending the inservice sessions. Pre- and post-tests examined student performance. A time series design checked the correlation between grade levels. Grade levels were compared weekly. An onsite observation of the methods and approaches used by the teachers was conducted. A weekly checklist identified the type of oral communication curriculum activities used during the week and the number of times certain speaking/listening dimensions were used. Results indicated a statistically significant improvement in student performance; students of teachers attending the institute showed more gain; and teachers used different patterns of oral communication activities.

        "description":"Planners in multicounty rural areas can use the Rural Development, Activity Analysis Planning (RDAAP) model to try to influence the optimal growth of their areas among different general economic goals. The model implies that best industries for rural areas have: high proportion of imported inputs; low transportation costs; high value added/output ratio and value added/labor ratio; low percentage of labor skill that is most scarce; and low capital/output ratio. The model likewise suggests that conversion of agricultural land from the land use pattern of lower income farms to that of higher income farms is always desirable in a region. The linear programming model was specifically applied, in this report, to a region of northwest Arkansas comprising Benton, Madison, and Washington  Counties (BMW region). Alternative objectives included the following: regional balance-of-trade surplus, regional balance-of-payments surplus, gross regional product, local value added, and a regional rate-of-return index. Data were obtained for 1960-70 to compare growth of employment by industry in the model with the actual growth in the area. Because a portion of the BMW region has recently been designated a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), this study can provide a vehicle for examining how an area might be developed optimally from a rural to a more urban status.

        "description":"To gain a basic understanding of some factors (i.e., community composition, family environment, and general retention of Mexican values) influencing the vocational aspirations of the Mexican American, several studies are reviewed. The literature reviewed disproves some of the common stereotypes as deterministic ethnic factors for the vocational attitudes of the Mexican American and empirically supports the fact that the level of acculturation and family style is one of the main determinants of the Mexican American's values and attitudes, specifically when dealing with vocationally related issues. The idea that ethnicity is not the single predominant determinant is supported. In spite of all argumentation in favor of or against a specific factor or factors which influence the  vocational aspirations of Mexican Americans, no particular response seems to provide an adequate answer to the question. In general, research has found a lack of differentiation in the perceptions of vocational aspirations of Mexican Americans when compared to Anglo Americans. However, the attainment of aspirations appears to be greatly influenced by the level of acculturation rather than one's ethnicity. Therefore, the \"level of acculturation\" must be considered when providing vocational counseling to the Mexican American. (Author/NQA)",

Data indicated that in March 1980 there were about 13.2 million persons of Spanish origin in the United States. Of these, there were about 60% of Mexican origin, 14% of Puerto Rican origin, 6% of Cuban origin, 8% of Central or South American origin, and about 12% of other Spanish origin. About 84% of all Spanish-origin families resided in metropolitan areas. The median age of Hispanic persons was 22 years. About 13% of the Spanish-origin population was under 5 years of age and about 4% were 65 years old and over. About 5 million Spanish-origin persons were in the civilian labor force. The unemployment  rate for Spanish-origin persons was higher (8.9%) than that for non-Spanish persons (6.5%). Only about 9% of Spanish-origin persons were working in professional occupations, 24% worked as operatives, and abut 3% were employed as farm laborers. The median income in 1979 was $14,600 for Hispanic families and $20,000 for non-Spanish origin persons. Differences in family income were also evident in 1979 by type of Spanish origin. (NQA)",

Half of these children completed the English version of CIRCO (1980) sub-test 10-C, a productive language measure that requires children to relate a description of a two dimensional picture. Half of the children completed the Spanish version of this same instrument. Analyses were performed on these English and Spanish samples regarding Mean Length of Utterance and intrasentential language switching. Comparisons were possible across: age, rural/urban status, and region (and to some extent, Hispanic ethnicity). On measures of linguistic proficiency, consistent  differences were observed in developmental trends for Spanish and English. For Spanish, linguistic proficiency measures increased from ages 4 to 5, then decreased at age 6. For English, these same measures showed a continuous increase across age groups. On language switching measures, regional differences were observed regardless of age. Almost no rural/urban differences were observed. These findings are discussed from both a language acquisition perspective and a bilingual education perspective. (Author/AH)",

Data have been collected with an operant interviewing method termed the Behavioral Event Analysis (BEA). The BEA was developed at Harvard for the purpose of identifying competencies for effective job performance. In this study, 20 bilingual teachers were interviewed to differentiate those competencies demonstrated by &quot;superior&quot; bilingual teachers, compared to those of other bilingual teachers. Detailed descriptions of successful episodes and less successful episodes were elicited from the subjects. Behavioral episodes encompass the teachers' perceptions, thoughts, acts, feelings, and conclusions. A content analysis of interview transcriptions has yielded a set of  competency clusters, which along with their accompanying sub-categories, reveal the following characteristics for effective bilingual teachers: sociocultural knowledge, positive regard, non-authoritarianism, pedogogic flexibility, self-confidence, and communication skills. Given further validation of these competencies, teacher-educators can more adequately select potentially effective bilingual teachers, prepare effective bilingual teachers and develop relevant teacher preparation curricula.

An attendance task force was formed to study the problem and to recommend possible solutions for improvement. Recommendations included: identifying high risk students and interviewing their parents to determine their perception of the importance of attending school; undertaking a district-wide effort to reduce factors contributing to frequent absenteeism; and implementing a positive program. The  program was designed to recognize both individual and class groups for outstanding attendance records which included a monthly invitation to a special movie; in 9 weeks receiving a ribbon of recognition; and for the year presented with a &quot;Ganado Attendance Star&quot; T-shirt and a certificate at an assembly. At the end of the first year of the attendance program, 22% of the student body accounted for 40% of all absences averaging 9 absences per year and by the end of the third year absences ranged from 3.9% to 2.5%.

Owen County, in central Kentucky, has a completely consolidated school system. Johnson County, in eastern Kentucky, has a county system with multiple elementary sites and an independent system. In Johnson County, 177 fourth graders, 525 tenth graders, and 88 parents were surveyed. In Owen County, 128 fourth graders, 123 tenth graders, and 64 parents were surveyed. Traditional community values chosen for examination were social responsibility, acceptance of authority, individualism, expression vs. restraint, equalitarianism, and localism vs. cosmopolitanism. It was expected that in the highly consolidated school system the  effects of consolidation would be reflected in a greater disparity between values of parents and their children. Results indicated various social, economic, and cultural influences have greater impact than consolidation on values held by individuals. Knowledge of the history and economic development of the two differing areas came to be seen as fundamental for an adequate interpretation of results. (Author/BRR)",

        "description":"A discussion of the two predominant theories of power (the juridical-liberal and the Marxist theories) notes the limitations of the two theories, the historical reasons for their common grounding of the analysis of power in terms of repression/sovereignty, and why the theory of sovereignty persisted as an ideology and organizing principle of all major legal codes. An analysis that reverses the trajectory followed by these two theories is presented. The paper defines Chicanology (&quot;an elusive yet systematic hegemonic discourse that expresses and actualizes Anglo domination over Chicanos&quot;); Chicano discourse (&quot;a diffuse, subjugated knowledge resulting from the struggle against Anglo power&quot;); and Chicano Studies (&quot;a specific discursive practice within Chicano discourse which attempts  to acquire power by claiming academic validity&quot;). Chicano discourse is mapped in terms of (1) the specific discursive and non-discursive (i.e., institutional) power relations which gave rise to it; (2) the status given to individual speakers of Chicano discourse; (3) the concepts to which it refers; and (4) the strategies that define its struggle with Chicanology. Chicano Studies discourse is discussed, focusing on the &quot;micro-mechanisms by which the discourse of Chicano scholars is appropriated and robbed of its power in order to deflect its impact on public policy.&quot; (NQA)",

        "author":["Nowak, Peter J."],
        "description":"At issue is the extent to which one can employ an adoption and diffusion of innovations model(s) to explain and predict the use of soil and water conservation practices. Much, however, can be gained from using models in this area. Four dimensions that should be present in any research design if it is to account for adoption and diffusion of conservation practices are the nature of the innovation, the characteristics of the adopting unit, the position of the adopting unit within the social system, and the characteristics of the social system. There is little disagreement that the nature of the innovation influences adoption and diffusion processes. There are no pre-packaged \"conservation machines\"; conservation is a blend from agronomy, engineering, economics, and, at times,  superstition and luck. Although it is easy with hindsight to look back upon the adoption-diffusion model as it evolved in the 1950s and see shortcomings, it offered then, and now, a tremendous utility. Perhaps the major problem with this model is the researchers' tendency to accept the model at face value--to take it for what it is. Instead, this model, or any model, should be constantly challenged and modified to account for new situations and old criticisms. (BRR)",

The overall goal of such projects is to increase academic performance and motivational levels among participating students during their formative high school years. The SSD project involves two related but distinct components: a Summer Institute and an Academic Year Program. The Summer Institute design is based on academic skills improvement in an intensive developmental curriculum structure including experiential  learning modules. It also incorporates an in-depth counseling program, cultural enrichment aspects, and unique motivational tools. The Academic Year Program, lodged within the students' respective home schools, provides access to tutors, counseling, and advanced math/science curriculum with an Indian orientation. Project funding mandates service delivery to 75 students from 15 target schools in 8 states. This breakout impacts more than 20 reservations and at least 22 distinct tribal groups. (Author/AH)",

Philosophical and theoretical perspectives adopted for conceptualization and analyses are Western Utilitarian and Sarvodaya. Materials are both conceptual and factual and relate specifically to the major thrust of the paper: the interrelated topics of women's issues, community development, and self-help in organizing and bringing about all rural social development/welfare activities. For observation and  insights, the major societal contexts used are that of the Third World and the United States.

School transportation, a food program, and health screening were also provided. Migrant staffs received inservice training on how to present basic skills in a fun way, and yet meet the children's basic educational requirements. The Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) was  stressed as an important program component and training was conducted as needed. Parent involvement in the program's planning, evaluation, and operation was emphasized. Seven directors received training on the organization and implementation of parent advisory councils. Inservice training for parents included a reading awareness program. Since parents present could neither read nor write, a special picture/sound presentation was made on how to help their children feel at home with books. This program met with great success and will be implemented, by request, during FY 1983. (NQA)",

It differs from other Agency for International Development (AID) Impact Evaluations in that, rather than a single project, a series of projects (1954-1975) were evaluated, dealing with primary education, teacher training, vocational and secondary education, curriculum materials and development, and the institutional development of the entire education system. Following the introduction, the background/setting, and accomplishments/problems/analyses of results are discussed, the latter focusing on the areas previously indicated. In addition, impacts on education, agriculture, family planning, health, people's attitudes/behaviors, women, equity, and the Nepalese society and body politic are discussed.  Major conclusions indicate that: (1) AID's assistance to Nepal has had positive impact; (2) there is an urgent need to find more efficient and effective approaches to educational problems through experimentation with innovative approaches; (3) vocational programs are more successful if training is started early; and (4) AID should continue its influence on basic education programs in this country.

The book was written under the philosophy that students enter statistics courses with a variety of aptitudes and experiences, and that traditional teaching approaches can do little to accommodate individual needs. It sets up an individualized course, and is designed to support teaching strategies where pupils do much of the learning on their own. The material is divided into 11 units, and the first part of each unit informs pupils of the general content area and how it relates to other topics. Each unit lists specific learning objectives, and provides instruction which includes a practice test for each stated objective. A major characteristic of the text is its emphasis on concepts  rather than computations, with greater stress given on the why of procedures than is thought to be usual in most books. The presentation also attempts to reduce pupil anxiety often associated with statistics. This is done through an informal writing style that intersperses anecdotes, &quot;conversational&quot; prose, and humor. Students seem to like this approach, and have indicated that it seems to make reading easier and helps concepts stand out in memory. (MP)",

A program was developed that allows pupils to solve word problems on a microcomputer. A pilot study was carried out with four first-grade children. The subjects were individually instructed for a series of nine 20-minute lessons. The results of the study indicated that the program is effective in teaching representational and problem-solving skills. Before instruction, the subjects consistently wrote incorrect sentences for incorrect problems and generally did not use their number sentences for their solutions. Following  instruction, three of the four children consistently used number sentences to solve a wide variety of addition and subtraction problems. It is concluded that further investigation seems warranted, and that this pilot investigation suggests that microcomputers can have important roles in instruction. (MP)",

Two fundamental factors affecting or controlling the mineral composition and texture of the resulting rock (initial magma composition and cooling rate) are also stressed. In addition, reasons why scientists classify materials in general and how they classify rocks in particular are explored. However, the ability to name or identify rocks is not a necessary result of attaining the  module's goals. Supplemental questions included at the end of the module may prove difficult for the average non-major; they are intended to challenge the superior student. Like other modules in the series, this module is inquiry- and problem-oriented, dealing with interdisciplinary, contemporary, and pragmatic aspects of the subject matter. It is designed to be open-ended so that ideas can be incorporated into higher level classwork. (Author/JN)",

The references thus range from chemistry texts to papers on complex geochemical applications. The emphasis has been on those books and papers concerned with the application of chemical concepts to geology. Citations are arranged topically to provide a quick guide to the literature on the topics. Within each section the citations are arranged alphabetically. Where a paper selected for inclusion fits well into two or more sections, an arbitrary assignment has been made to one in order to avoid unnecessary duplication. An estimate of the mathematics and chemical background necessary for comprehension of each citation is noted. Topic sections include: (1) crystal chemistry; (2)  physical chemistry; (3) kinetics; (4) applications of chemical concepts to high-temperature geologic systems; (5) applications of chemical concepts of low temperature geologic systems; (6) application of chemical concepts to natural organic systems; and (7) application of chemical concepts to isotope geology.

        "description":"Many new directions for science teaching were developed during the post-Sputnik era. Hands-on science teaching remains a popular direction, yet may be seen as something complex or mysterious by those not familiar with some of the jargon which usually accompanies any discussion of science teaching. This paper responds to several questions teachers may have about hands-on science teaching. These questions include: What is hands-on science teaching? What are the benefits and liabilities for teachers and students? What should be taught? How should science be taught? Focusing on discovery as hands-on teaching/learning, the nature and benefits of discovery learning are explored, including the use of this teaching method in elementary school science programs. Since the teaching of  processes is fostered, examples of what children can do when observing, classifying, measuring, communicating, inferring, and experimenting are provided. Various instructional strategies teachers can use, including questioning techniques, are also provided. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"The intent of this yearbook is to provide a positive posture for nurturing desirable changes in the status of science teaching. It is written for elementary school teachers and all who are involved or concerned with curriculum and instruction in the elementary school. The yearbook provides the basis for continued professional growth of teachers by stressing ways to logically and realistically infuse science and science-related instructions into schools and to assure that science will remain valued as new patterns of schooling evolve. As a means of promoting science relevancy and literacy, interfaces between science teaching and other areas of human concern are identified and a rationale for encouraging and defending the desired state of science teaching is provided. The book is  organized into four parts: providing focus, establishing credibility, exploring interfaces, and discovering applications. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on science teaching and science teaching goals. Chapters 3-5 focus on valuing (1) science content; (2) preparation in science methodology/goals; and (3) the infusion process. Chapters 6-12 address relationships between science teaching and personal/career concerns, children's intellectual development, educational technology (microcomputers) environmental concerns, energy concerns, special education concerns, and cultural concerns respectively. Perspectives from practitioners and on professional growth are addressed in chapters 13 and 14. (Author/JN)",

The bill, introduced into Congress by Doug Walgren and Don Fuqua, would establish a fund to develop United States technical, engineering, and scientific manpower resources. Money would be spent from the fund on a one-to-one matching basis with other money provided by private industry. The money would be available for fellowships, instructional equipment, salaries of teachers, or other costs of solving the manpower problem. The bill would provide $50 million for the fund in its first year of operation. Following introductory remarks by Congressman Walgren, transcripts of testimony presented as the  hearings are provided. This testimony focuses on the manpower bill and on issues related to the impact of reductions in Federal programs supporting science and engineering education on universities and industry, especially in the Pittsburgh area.

The first, the theory of industrialism, suggests that as development occurs, the attainment of educational and occupational status through kinship ties (ascription) decreases and status is gained on the basis of individual achievement. The second theory, status maintenance, argues that when educational expansion surpasses occupational demand the advanced industrial state will resort to ascription (kinship ties, social background) to fill prestigious jobs. Although both theories agree that education becomes more universal with industrialization, they disagree on  occupational and social status attainment. Research in the 12 Japanese regions used both the individual and the region itself as units of measurement and involved several stages of analysis. Final results disprove the industrialism theory; ascriptive processes do not diminish with industrialization. Inadequate occupational demand does, however, restrict the degree to which educational attainment becomes prestigious. (KC)",

A total of 140 women in engineering, science, and management completed a forced-choice questionnaire concerning the personal and professional treatment of women subjects by male and female professionals. Specific areas addressed included the informal division of daily management responsibilities, the allocation of power and opportunity as reflected in job assignments, and types and frequency of sexual harassment. The majority of women surveyed failed to acknowledge sexism as debilitating. Specifically, they believed that social and legal remedies for sex discrimination have been achieved. Most felt they avoided discrimination  by being professional, becoming \"one of the boys,\" and displaying a sense of humor about women's jokes. The achievement of equality for any group is contingent upon the recognition that the group as a whole is the object of discrimination and an understanding of the objective, ideological, and institutional character of oppression. However, the women surveyed held none of these perceptions and firmly denied the minority group status of women. (Author/KC)",

There is a range of public opinion from little or no concern to very intense concern about an issue. Polls translate personal beliefs into collective public opinions, often losing the strong feelings at the one end and the moderate feelings at the other. The result is a poll which is supposedly representative of the general public, but which, in reality, may give a misleading picture of real concerns. When government officials view this poll data, they often concentrate on the middle range of feelings and interpret this as the public view on an issue. Officials thus feel less pressure from the public. Data from polls may also be used to modify the attitudes of those  polled and those who read the polls; also to help predict negative attitudes before they are manifested in outward behavior, such as riots.

For example, people tend to remember instances which confirm their beliefs; make decisions based on the most easily accessible information stored in their memories; generalize on the basis of small samples; attribute other people's behavior to predispositions rather than consider the situation; and exhibit overconfidence in their conclusions. Further, psychobiological theories speculate that  these heuristics probably operate below the conscious level; the outputs (decisions) made on an unconscious level then become accepted as valid thought during conscious thought processes. Research also indicates that both the masses and the politically elite (trained scientists) are susceptible to the use of heuristics and poor information processing. The costs may be high in many political decisions, especially when leaders are convinced they are behaving rationally. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Black, Hispanic, and Chinese Americans resisted oppression in 19th century United States by maintaining a strong family unit. As second class citizens, these groups were denied rights of citizenship and protection of the law. They experienced not only economic exploitation, but political and social domination as well. Responses to cultural assaults on these racial/ethnic groups were varied. In some cases they adopted patterns of behavior in direct contradiction to the expectations and desires of the dominant group. For example, black women withdrew from field labor and focused on domestic life after slavery. Chinese families used the discriminatory legal system to their favor. Chinese laborers could not bring spouses to the United States nor could they marry whites. However, when  the 1882 San Francisco earthquake destroyed municipal records, many Chinese claimed American birth and thus became eligible to bring relatives (either real or fabricated) into the country. Hispanic women sacrificed and modified traditional norms to maintain family cohesion by becoming part of the labor force in answer to a wage labor system that did not provide the man with enough money to support his family.

        "description":"A relationship exists between high birth rates and the lowered status of women in developing nations, resulting from their country's economic development. Research was based on data from various sources on 34 developed nations and 92 developing nations throughout the world. Variables included income inequality, foreign trade structure and investment, women's share of tertiary education and the labor force, infant mortality rate, and family planning program efforts. Findings indicate that economic structures produced by foreign investment and dependency generate inadequate economic and social resources, especially for women. Specifically, with the introduction of new industries and investment from developed countries, women who previously produced similar goods in cottage  industries lose their market and are unincorporated into the industrial labor force. Even though women tend to be primary agricultural producers, new technology grants access to cash crops and financial credit to men only. Thus, women can only raise their status by childbearing since the social and economic value of children remains high. The incorporation of women into development is necessary to reduce fertility rates; without such, family planning programs will continue to have limited effect. (KC)",

        "description":"Because the attitude research approach to determining public opinion typically yields data irrelevant to public policy formation, researchers need to consider nontraditional approaches to public opinion measures. Attitude research assumes that people actually have readily measurable opinions and that each attitude can be measured singly. Measurement is directed toward uncovering a person's most preferred position. To be politically relevant, however, survey data must indicate the intelligibility of public responses; require respondents to set priorities and make trade-offs; depict what costs would be tolerated for a given policy; and distinguish degrees of political acceptability. Alternative measures include the \"budget pie\" technique in which participants are asked to allocate  a fixed amount among different programs. A second technique involves providing participants with chips that they allocate to slots which represent government programs. Disadvantages of these methods include the amount of time required and the capacity of citizens to make resource allocations. A third approach allows respondents to select ranges of responses categorized according to acceptance, indifference, and rejection. Aggregation of data in all of these approaches is a major problem. Nonetheless, the goal should not be to measure public attitudes, but rather, political preference. (Author/KC)",

The project, which can serve as a model for education in developing countries, focuses on creating self-concepts and values to counteract those of an acquisitive society. In a free enterprise society, the economic system dictates social relations among people and the educational process. The Upward Bound project, however, focuses on the social change goals of a person's being a subject rather than an object, valuing responsibility over authority, learning through creativity, being autonomous rather than conformist, and valuing cooperation over competition and community over excessive  individualism. Participants' work is not graded, authority is decentralized, financial resources are pooled, and participants tutor each other. When developing countries are influenced to restructure their systems to favor free enterprise, they become dependent on the &quot;having&quot; mode of existence. The Upward Bound Project would foster peace over greed. (KC)",

        "description":"Teachers do not intentionally use or consider research findings in making teaching decisions. This lack of use is usually blamed on research deficiencies; e.g., educational research does not address the realistic demands of classroom teaching, research findings are inconsistent, and research articles are difficult to obtain and read. A major difficulty is that teachers and researchers have different orientations, as well as different reference groups which set and apply divergent standards of professional achievement. For example, the American Educational Research Association encourages research aimed at the interests of academicians, not teachers. There are many problems to implementing any solutions. One proposed solution is to shift from a research to a research and  development orientation. But such a shift would conflict with the researchers yearning to be social scientists and with the academic standards often applied in judgments of their work. Another solution is to encourage research by teachers. But, without relief from teaching demands, where would teachers find the time and energy for such efforts? Making research reports more readable is difficult because of the over-sophistication in statistical analysis. Despite the complex problems, dialogue between teachers and researchers might move educational research toward greater usefulness. (RM)",

A sample of 293 students was questioned (during their sophomore year in 1974 and again in 1976 when they were seniors) about political orientation, number of social studies classes taken, social studies classroom climate, school activities, and gender. The purpose of the study was to expand upon earlier research (Beck and Jennings, 1982) linking high school activity with youth civic orientation. When path analysis was applied, the study replicated Beck and Jennings' findings, which also resulted from path analysis. The contribution of social studies classes to political attitudes was found not to be significant while an  open social studies classroom environment led to positive political attitudes. However, when two-stage least squares analysis was applied, classroom climate was found not to be a significant predictor. Also, while prior political attitudes led to political participation, increased participation resulted in more negative attitudes. For various reasons, the two-stage least squares method appears to be the most reliable, least restrictive technique and thus more appropriate for analyzing complex relationships. (KC)",

Seventeen percent chose social studies as the most important subject. Social studies ranked neither high nor low as a favorite or least favorite subject. Student comments indicate that it is not perceived as a particularly enjoyable subject and is not  considered especially difficult. Elementary students enjoyed history and cultural studies while senior high students favored psychology, sociology, and anthropology.

Data were analyzed to determine if modality preferences are a significant component of student learning styles, whether or not male and female students differ with respect to learning style preferences, and whether or not learning style preferences are related to self-concept and general affect. Ten learning style preferences identified were: (1) reading; (2) manipulative activity; (3) teacher explanation; (4) auditory stimulation; (5) visual demonstration; (6) visual stimulation (electronic); (7) visual stimulation (still pictures); (8)  games; (9) social interaction; and (10) personal experience. The conclusion was reached that modality preferences in adolescent learners are complex and interwoven with other preference aspects. Males differed from females in showing a greater preference for manipulative learning activities and a lesser preference for teacher explanation and direction and for learning by reading. Correlations of learning style preferences with self-esteem and general affect were not significant for the sample as a whole. Teachers should use caution in using modality preferences of students as a basis for planning instruction or selecting curricular experiences. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"A physical fitness curriculum, designed to provide cumulative benefits in a sequential pattern, is based upon a framework of a conceptual structure. The curriculum's ultimate goal is the achievement of greater physiological efficiency through a holistic approach that would strengthen circulatory-respiratory, mechanical, and neuro-muscular efficiency. These components of the fitness curriculum are illustrated in the framework by thinking, feeling, and acting components, involving: (1) a knowledge of what physical fitness entails in terms of physiological efficiency; (2) an understanding of the necessity of applying the knowledge of physical fitness in day-to-day life; and (3) a realization of the necessity of movement in physical fitness. The model of this conceptual structure is  divided into three parts: physiological concepts, psychosocial concepts, and activities concepts. Diagrams illustrate each of these concepts with accompanying outlines of the subconcepts implicit in each; training results emerging from designated physical activities; and the long-term beneficial physical changes resulting from extended participation.

Each participant then rated the listed strengths and concerns on a scale of &quot;strongly agree,&quot;&quot;moderately agree,&quot; or &quot;slight or no agreement,&quot; and reactions were recorded. Workshop organizers categorized reactions into clusters of similar statements (goals, communication, administration, resources, etc.), which then were listed on  a transparency showing exactly what the participants had said. Interpretations by the organizers were confirmed and clarified by the group. A second workshop meeting focused on concerns identified by the group, and participants again divided into four small groups, ranked the concerns, and &quot;brainstormed&quot; to identify possible actions and agencies that could help alleviate these concerns. Results were presented at a final session and additions, deletions, and revisions were made based on the group reaction. (JD)",

        "description":"An investigation identified environmental factors influencing the activities of university-based teacher educators and described the interaction effect of environmental factors and selected faculty roles. Environmental factors examined were personal influences, the departmental promotion and salary committee, central university administration, national professional organizations, federal and state governments, accrediting and certification agencies, and public schools. The interaction effect of these factors was explored as they influenced teacher educators in two different faculty roles--rank and teaching assignment (campus vs. field based). Interviews were conducted with 7 assistant professors, ll associate professors, and 4 full professors. Seven of these teacher educators  were exclusively campus-based faculty members, 4 were public-school-based, and 11 had mixed responsibilities. The perceived influence of the departmental promotion and salary committee declined across ranks. While assistants indicated this factor to be one exerting rather high pressure, it was deemed less important by associate and full professors. Personal influence was high across all ranks, particularly as it reflected self-esteem. Federal and state government influence was perceived as an important factor by all ranks because government agencies awarded research grants and established public school policies. The perceived influence of national professional networks increased with rank. Influence from the university, beyond the department, was not apparent among assistant professors  and was apparent to the greatest degree in associate professors. Faculty working mainly in the field did not see accrediting and certification agencies or government agencies as strong influences, while the reverse was true of campus-based faculty. (JD)",

Like punishment, discipline applied as control can cause more difficulties than it remedies; continual emphasis on discipline with constant surveillance by the teacher for infractions may produce more problems than it solves. By clearly connecting learning to discipline for students, the teacher demonstrates that the goal has required behavior. This helps students to understand that what they need and want is directly related to how they act. This understanding is essential for effective discipline and student self control. When practiced as such, students are no longer cast into a position of submissive obedience. Instead, they can see themselves as acting responsibly toward desired  goals. With this approach, the emphasis is on learning and teaching with discipline playing an important but subordinate role. Research findings indicate that classroom organization and management, as part of instruction, are key processes in establishing and maintaining an effective and disciplined learning environment. Effective school and teacher characteristics which reinforce a positive learning environment are cited. (JD)",

Subjects were 57 males and females, aged 14-18, who spent 9 weeks with the Man and His Land program, travelling on eight camping expeditions. Three hypotheses were tested through pre-, mid-, and posttests: (1) Differences would be shown in pre- and posttest global self-concept and self-esteem measures; (2) Differences would be seen between global prettest and situationally specific midtests; and (3) A relationship would exist between pre- and posttest global self-concept and the situationally specific self concept measures gathered at the midtests. Global self-concept was assessed before and after the program through the Adjective Check List (ACL) and the Tennessee Self Concept  Scale (TSCS). Midtests were conducted, using the ACL at three points during the program, to measure self concept at specific program junctures. Significant improvement was found in the posttest scores of the TSCS. Analysis of the ACL showed that most of the scales shifted positively from pre- to posttest. Four patterns of adjective use were discerned, three of which reported positive results in the areas of goal direction and task oriented behaviors and attitudes. (FG)",

These interactions are classified as public and nonpublic, and examples of measuring the incidence and qualities of behaviors are given. In a section reviewing general coding conventions, the validity of the procedure is interpreted,  and observation techniques are suggested. In Part 2, the method used to study the proportion of time students are engaged in mathematical activities, and characteristics of those activities are introduced, based on a system designed by Romberg, Small, Carnahan, and Cookson (1978).

        "description":"In the fall of 1977, the College of Education of the University of Washington (Seattle) instituted a socio-ethnic course requirement for teacher certification candidates. To satisfy the requirement, candidates must successfully complete a course from each of two categories: Category A courses provide the student with a broad look at socio-ethnic differences, while courses in Category B focus on specific ethnic and social groups. A descriptive research study evaluated the effectiveness of the socio-ethnic course requirement through examination of student enrollment patterns in the socio-ethnic courses. The study population included all students enrolled in the certification program in the spring and autumn quarters of 1981. Five variables were used to construct comparisons with  the socio-ethnic enrollment data: (1) sex; (2) student teaching placement (urban, suburban); (3) level (elementary, secondary); (4) ethnic group (White, Asian, Other Minority); and (5) major (broadly classified as social science, humanities, natural science, and other). Results showed that students are, for the most part, satisfying the socio-ethnic course requirement by electing courses which reflect their own particular ethnic or social group. It was concluded that the College of Education may wish to consider a mechanism to ensure all students some study of ethnic and social groups different from their own. Tables and charts are appended which show the numbers and percent of student course enrollment characteristics. (Authors/FG)",

The general strategy is to consider fitting (linear) models as partitioning data into a fit and residuals. The fit can be parsimoniously represented by a summary of the data. A fit is considered adequate if the residuals are small enough so that manipulating their signs and locations does not affect the summary more than a pre-specified amount. The effect of the residuals on the summary is shown to be (approximately) characterized by the output of standard regression programs. The general process of linear fitting models by least squares is covered in detail and discussed briefly in its relationship to standard hypothesis testing and to Fisher's randomization test. Fitting in weighted least squares and a  comparison of fitting to standard methods are also discussed. It is shown that some of the output (e.g., standard errors, t, F, and p statistics) from standard regression programs can be interpreted as approximate measures of goodness-of-fit of a model to the observed data. The interpretation is also applicable in weighted least squares situations such as robust regression. (PN)",

A second framework, the Intervention Coding Framework (ICF), emerged to code  each identified intervention in terms of a defined set of sub-dimensions. The resultant TI and ICF provide both the conceptual and analytic tools to describe and compare the actions taken by the various individuals within or across change efforts. Illustrations of the developed analysis option concepts include a definition of the intervention; and the frameworks used for collecting, describing, and analyzing principals' behaviors as they intervened in the change process in their schools.

        "description":"Do choice-type tests (multiple-choice, true-false, etc.) measure the same abilities or traits as free response (essay, recall, completion, etc.) tests? A large number of studies conducted with several different methodologies and spanning a long period of time have addressed this question. In this review, attention will be focused almost exclusively on the measurement of the traditional product of education, namely knowledge. This review is limited to empirical studies of the equivalence of free-response and choice-type tests. The major methods used to study the relationship between free-response and choice-type measures are the direct correlation, the criterion correlation and the treatment effect. Contrary to widely held beliefs about choice-type tests, the studies indicate that  the two types of tests do generally measure the same traits or abilities. To the extent that there are minor differences, the choice-type measures tend to be more valid; and use of choice-type measures does not seem to have adverse effects on study habits. However, the generalizations are limited by insufficient diversity in the groups studied and may not apply to certain types of more divergent processes.

Three of these methods involve the application of human judgment in scoring or rating a piece of writing: holistic, analytical, and primary trait scoring. Two methods involve anatomical or taxonomic analysis of a piece of writing: computer analysis and syntactic analysis. The final method involves the use of objective (usually multiple-choice) tests of writing-related skills. The research on relationships among the various measures of writing skills admits of relatively few well-established generalizations.

UNIACT reports results for six basic types of vocational interests corresponding to Holland's interest types: science, creative arts, social service, business contact, business detail, and technical. An overview of UNIACT describes the inventory, its historical basis, and interpretive aids. The rationale for  sex-balanced interest scores and scales; norming; scale reliability, stability and sex-balance; and the scales' convergent and divergent validity are examined. Criterion-related validity and the scales' appropriateness for minority group members are discussed.

Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) research provides background for how evaluation utilization can be defined and why it might be useful to view evaluation as an innovation. A change process-based definition of evaluation utilization is that (1) use of evaluation is a process; (2) it must be assessed at the individual level as well as for the organization as a whole; and (3) it must be considered across evaluations within an adopting organization, or across organizations for regional and national study. To assess use would entail conducting focused interviews to assess Levels of Use (LoU) and development of an Innovation Configuration Checklist that could be  assessed through a combination of interview and observation procedures. The resultant data could be analyzed to identify and describe the various configurations of the evaluation that were being used. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (Author/PN)",

A review of test score trends over the past 15 years indicates that compensatory education programs (competency-based education, minimum competency testing, etc.) have had a positive impact and that the back-to-basics movement is primarily responsible. The review also indicates that courses for the above-average high school student are being adversely effected by a too-narrow curriculum emphasis on basics. The better students are showing the greatest score declines, and, in tests of high order skills, all students, even the brightest ones, continue to show a downward trend. According to current test score trends, tomorrow's  students with a more solid foundation in basic skills will be prepared to face an academically challenging curriculum, but the schools may be unprepared to provide it. Another consideration is the effect of current policy on the school system itself. If the same kinds of curriculum changes continue to be implemented, public high schools may inadvertently put themselves out of business. They may reduce their academic standards so drastically that they will no longer be viewed as credible educational institutions. (Author/PN)",

Quantifiable information was obtained through a needs' assessment form, administered to participants (n=48) and staff (n=13), through observations of the formal and informal sessions and staff meetings, and  through open-ended questions on an evaluation form.

Three new latent trait models are described. They differ in their complexity, though each is designed to yield a single parameter to measure student achievement. The simplest, a &quot;partial credit&quot; model, has a single difficulty parameter for each item. This model takes no account of the variations in distractor attractiveness from item to item, nor of which distractors were actually selected by the respondent. The second model treats the test as a sequence of distinct steps, each of which has a difficulty parameter. This method does not assume that all items have the same logical  structure with regard to difficulty. It takes no account of which distractors are selected. The third model is an extension of the second. In this model, the step difficulty values for an item vary in terms of which distractors were previously selected.

        "description":"Phase I of the Test Use Project, begun in 1979, was directed at gaining a representative picture of achievement testing in the nation's public schools. The project was designed to examine testing practices, uses, impacts and costs encompassing a wide range of formal and informal assessment measures. Phase II of the Test Use Project explored the direct and indirect monetary costs as well as the opportunity and psychological costs of testing in an inner city and suburban elementary school, and costs of basic skills testing in their districts. A cost accounting model was selected to identify and determine the magnitude of costs in testing. Data were gathered in the districts from relevant documents, discussions with appropriate officials, and interviews with personnel involved in  basic skills testing. School data on costs associated with all achievement testing was collected by formal interviews with principals, instructional staff, school specialists, and resource personnel. Findings by the districts and the two schools regarding testing costs are discussed in separate chapters. A chapter on psychological costs examines teachers' attitudes toward tests and the psychological cost study procedures, and summarizes teacher and student commentaries. Appendices include teacher, administrator and student interview documents. (CM)",

The succeeding papers present actual case studies of the cost estimate process in three different evaluation contexts within local school districts. &quot;The Cost of a District-Wide Testing Program,&quot; by N. James Myerberg, identifies the specific applicable cost parameters and suggests a method to compare testing across school districts. &quot;The Incremental Cost of Conducting a Summative Evaluation of a Special  Education Program From an Existing Data Base,&quot; by William T. Denton, examines a computerized system. &quot;The Cost of a School Level Needs Assessment,&quot; by Floraline Stevens, discusses cost estimates according to school size and staff familiarity with the process. The question of assigning value to the extensive time expenditures required in the procedure is examined.

        "description":"On well-constructed multiple-choice tests, the most serious threat to measurement is not variation in item discrimination, but the guessing behavior that may be adopted by some students. Ways of ameliorating the effects of guessing are discussed, especially for problems in latent trait models. A new item response model, including an item parameter to describe guessing is presented. Rather than estimating the asymptotic probability for success for a person of infinitely low ability, this parameter is shown to indicate the location on the ability scale below which guessing may be anticipated to be dominant for any item. Multiple choice item data are examined to establish typical shapes for item characteristic curves and to identify possible reasons for their unanticipated variation  in the lower ability scale. The model is viewed as the sum of two logistic functions: the classical Rasch model of correct response probability, and an added function where the maximum success probability is constrained by item format (number of alternative choices) and the probability that an individual will choose to guess at random in inverse relation to the person's ability. An estimation algorithm for improved item calibration and person measurement is presented. (CM)",

CMS describes the general skill area and the generic task or problem type. It elaborates features of the problem situation and required responses found by research to influence performance. Stimulus features specify particular concepts and procedures necessary to answer a question and place limits on the structure and range of content or examples that can illustrate a problem. Response requirements indicate the mode as well as solution procedures and operations. The task content describes time constraints and the purpose, function, or audience of the task. CMS was used to classify and compare the contents of a Stanford  Achievement Test and a criterion referenced test, both administered in 1982. Content analyses indicated the tests measure different aspects of reading and with different degrees of emphasis. Response patterns implied that CMS may be a promising tool for describing, analyzing, and interpreting test performance. The detailed partitioning of skill requirements used in the CMS appears to present a clear and interpretable test analysis tool. (Author/PN)",

This study assessed whether a carefully-targeted instructional sequence could influence the effects of bias. A reading comprehension test with items previously identified as biased for certain groups was administered to two samples of minority children. This was followed a week later by two in-class sessions of the instructional intervention. Participants were then retested on the same instrument, first at the end of the same week in which they received the intervention, then again 4 weeks later. This pre/post/follow-up repeated-measures design allowed analysis, both statistical and graphic, of bias characteristics as they arose  between groups at any given testing session and within groups across time. Results indicated that the test materials were generally very difficult. A few items improved significantly from pretest to posttest, although this improvement diminished somewhat across time. California Test of Basic Skill items which were targeted by the intervention showed a stronger degree of change for the treatment group than for the control group. (Author/PN)",

Analysis of these field study data revealed the salient characteristics of school districts as complex organizations and the implications these attributes have for the focus of this research. The sections are organized as follows: introduction; generic factors which inhibit district linkage of testing, evaluation,  and instruction; situation-specific conditions which can override those generic factors; variations observed among the school districts; and conclusions that may be helpful to district managers wanting to develop management strategies to coordinate their own testing, evaluation and instruction operations.

The author proceeds to support these claims by identifying 10 goals of school desegregation and examining the rules and consequences of incremental and democratic desegregation policies in the light of these goals. Investigating the rules of temporal, spatial, organizational, and analytical incrementalism, and citing supportive evidence, the author maintains that minorities in all cases, and sometimes whites, are the worst off when gradual or partial procedures are used. Similarly, the author explores the rules of democratic desegregation planning and concludes that while citizen participation  and control are fundamental values, they are rarely effective in ending racial isolation; on the other hand, people with official roles can have an impact. Several policy options are suggested: (1) continue muddling along; (2) stop imposing desegregation against majority desires; or (3) proceed to full and complete desegregation. It is concluded that if the political and moral will to undertake desegregation properly are absent, alternative solutions for granting minority rights and satisfying citizen preferences ought to be pursued.

The techniques compared were (1) the traditional peer nomination method, in which children list a few classmates whom they consider friends; and (2) the roster and rating method, in which each child rates all classmates on an interval scale. The first study involved meta analysis of existing data. Results of research using the two sociometric methods were compared and it was found that peer nomination studies tend to find more same-race preferences than roster and rating studies. The second study involved field research. Sixth graders at a newly desegregated school were asked to show their peer  preferences on both types of measures. Results indicated that the peer nomination method results in larger differences in preferences for same-race peers over peers of a different race. These findings suggest that peer nomination techniques, which restrict the number of choices a child can make and thus encourage the naming of best friends, should be used to assess close friendships; roster and rating methods may be more appropriately used to assess more general intergroup acceptance.

College presidents and program developers should encourage an institutional environment that reflects and supports ethnic diversity, and they should actively examine existing  practices and policies that might have a discriminatory effect. In addition to strong leadership, successful efforts regarding minority student opportunity and retention require the commitment and participation of the entire college or university staff. The third element necessary for improving institutional responsiveness to and retention of minority students is the ongoing evaluation of any programs that are implemented. Effective formative evaluation can serve as an indicator of progress and a guide for future endeavors toward equal educational opportunities. (Author/GC)",

Findings provide further documentation of the increased net flow of populations from the North and East to the South and West regions of the United States. Migration differentials with respect to age increased among blacks and decreased among whites, while migration differentials by educational attainment increased among both racial groups. For the 1965-70 period, the propensity to migrate is associated with employment status. For example, persons who were not in the labor force in 1965 were substantially more likely to migrate. This finding supports the conclusion that migration is associated with entrance into and exit from the labor force.  (Author/WAM)",

Specifically, it provides insights concerning the types of things adults try to learn, the number of learning experiences they have, their methods of learning, and the sources of the subject matter that they attempt to learn. The learning project interview can be used with groups containing anywhere from 10 to 200 participants. First, participants are asked to list anything that they tried to learn during the past 12 months. After narrowing their list to include only learning projects that were deliberate, more than 7 hours in duration, and designed to retain a skill for at least 48 hours, participants are asked to select the one project that  was most important to them. Next, participants provide information concerning the planning process they used during the learning experience, the main source of the information they learned, and the amount of time spent learning it. By sharing this information during a debriefing and discussion period, the adult learners become aware of their own learning processes as well as that of others. (MN)",

To engage in professional life planning (or self-directed professional development) is to take greater control of one's life. Four major actions comprise the essence of professional life planning; they are self-assessment of professional strengths and weaknesses, planning professional growth through goal setting, organizing activities and records in line with goals, and evaluating periodically one's professional situation and goals. Aside from continuing professional education, a number of professional development opportunities are open to the self-directed planner. They involve (1) joining professional associations; (2) attending professional conferences; (3) participating in  relevant seminars and meetings; (4) attending workshops to enhance strengths or overcome a weakness; and (5) integrating professional information into one's life. A systematic approach to one's professional growth requires a willingness to grow and readiness to become involved. With systematic effort, growth and change become natural aspects of one's life and professional stance. (KC)",

Four different strategies have been proposed for dealing with these problems. The free market approach promises economic prosperity by reducing the government's role and relying on the private sector. Advocates of this approach feel that it will produce more growth over the long run, but the price to be paid for such growth will include increased bankruptcies and unemployment. Advocates of a second strategy, a national industrial policy, argue that the government must take an active role in guiding the economy back to sustained growth. This policy would target investments in promising industries of the future and cushion the negative impact of such actions through job  retraining and relocation assistance. Both the free-market and national industrial policy strategies are geared to the long term and both entail costs in the present. A third strategy proposes a redefined work contract--cooperation--between management and workers. This approach promises more growth and a fair chance of introducing new technology, but it could not be put into place overnight. Finally, the fourth proposed solution involves more protection for American industries and workers. Although this policy would require the fewest short-term sacrifices, it may worsen the long-term problem. A consensus must be developed among Americans about which strategy should be adopted and who will pay the price if American industry is to improve its performance. (KC)",

        "description":"The social security system in the United States is becoming increasingly unstable, as the amount of benefits paid to an ever larger number of retirees grows and the number of younger workers paying taxes to the system decreases. The problem will become especially acute in the years 2011 and after, as the members of the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation begin to retire. There are four ways to restore the solvency of the system. The first is to regard current eligibility rules and benefit levels that keep pace with changes in the cost of living as a commitment that must be met; the problem with this decision is how to pay for these benefits. A second option in resolving the nation's retirement dilemma is to reduce the level of benefits. Although this proposal meets with resistance, it may  meet with less resistance if changes do not affect current recipients. A third choice is to change the eligibility rules so that fewer people qualify for benefits--or qualify for fewer years; this option would require far-reaching changes in attitudes to remove the incentives for older workers to retire. The fourth suggestion is that social security be made a voluntary system. Critics of this suggestion point out that if it were voluntary, the number of workers who wished to participate in the system might not be sufficient to make it work. Whichever option is selected, some choice must be made about how to provide for the needs of the large group of elderly Americans without imposing an unacceptable burden on younger workers. (KC)",

        "description":"The Green Thumb Project was designed to test the feasibility of operating a computerized system for disseminating weather, market, and other agricultural production and management information on a day-to-day basis; to develop a prototype software support system for the test; and to provide essential project information on conduct of the test to enable the evaluation agencies to evaluate the usefulness and acceptability of the information and its dissemination system. Included among the project activities were the following: a review of systems similar to Green Thumb; administration of a baseline survey to 172 Green Thumb users to collect data concerning their background, farm operation, and orientation toward the use of weather and market information; interviews of extension  personnel concerning the usefulness of the Green Thumb system; and maintenance of time logs of extension personnel to verify the time they spent on the Green Thumb system. Analysis of these data indicates that the Green Thumb system is reasonably successful and that the overall design of the system is workable. Recommendations were made concerning improvement of computer design problems, aggregate usage, project administration, and project staffing. (MN)",

Specific objectives of the study were to compare the workers' compensation experience of the insured and self-insured employer populations, to provide an empirical description of the workers' compensation system in Michigan, and to determine the role of litigation in the system. Based on abstracts of 954 unlitigated and 1,224 litigated workers' compensation cases, researchers drew the following conclusions: (1) while 48 percent of cases from employees of the big three automakers are litigated, other self-insured employers and insured employers experience 19 and 22 percent litigation rates respectively; (2) the litigation process generally results in more lump sum payments;  (3) the big three automakers and the insured employers have similar average disability durations, whereas other self-insured employers enjoy average durations that are 30 percent lower; and (4) only 20 percent of beneficiaries actually received the two-thirds gross replacement rate specified by law. Because Michigan's workers' compensation litigation system seems to have grown into a miniature replica of the tort liability system it was supposed to replace, a general overhaul of the litigation system is urged.

Yet, in many ways social statistics underestimate the degree of hardship caused by extended unemployment, underemployment, and low wages. Therefore, new measures are needed to reassess long-term and cyclical labor market developments, the changing status of minorities, the interrelationships between family patterns and employment problems, the effectiveness of income transfers for the working poor, and alternative macroeconomic policies. The proposed hardship measurement and assessment system consists of three sets of core indicators to measure the adequacy of individual earnings, family earnings, and family incomes in terms of both the numbers who fall below minimum standards and dollar  shortfalls relative to these standards. After using these measures to examine hardship trends over the period between 1974 and 1980, researchers determined that the number who suffer severe hardship as a result of labor market problems experienced during the year far exceeds average annual unemployment. In addition, the burdens of hardship are even more maldistributed than are those of unemployment. (Appendixes to the report include technical details of the hardship measures and hardship data for the period from 1974 through 1980.) (MN)",

During the study, on-site observers utilized the following data collection strategies: document analysis, respondent and informant interviews, direct participation, and extensive observation of the various facets of given local projects. In all, 51 projects were investigated. The focus of the program observations was on the various linkages that projects have made with the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) system, with community-based organizations, with other youth service projects, with other components of the educational system, and with the  private sector. Researchers sought to identify linkages that are generic across variations in program design as well as those that appear specific to each of the following four program models: academic credit for work experience, career awareness, expanded private sector involvement, and youth-initiated projects. While different linkages appear most appropriate to each of these four strategies for service delivery, it was consistently found that linkages work best in those settings where enlightened self-interest and reciprocity are evident.

        "description":"Through a study, strategies were investigated to increase the role of in-school youth in creating job opportunities. Drawing upon qualitative data provided by the Youthwork National Policy Study, researchers examined four youth-operated employment projects in order to isolate those factors that either hinder or facilitate the implementation of a youth participation strategy; they subsequently made recommendations on how best to implement a strategy for youth participation. Two factors that especially seemed to inhibit youth participation were the location of the project in a traditional school setting and the failure to encourage youth to take an active role in managing the project. Included among those factors found to promote the youth participation strategy were the following:  a high ratio of adults to youth, the delegation of authority for the everyday activities of the project to the youth involved in it, relatively small numbers (10 or less) of youth working together, and access within the community to persons with expertise in the area of youth enterprise. Recommendations included a call for hiring staff members partly on the basis of their commitment to the idea that youth can and should manage their own affairs. (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined the process of awarding credit to youth participating in a special group of employment and training programs. Using a student questionnaire, field researchers collected data concerning 21 Youthwork, Inc., Exemplary In-School Demonstration Projects with one of the following four program focus areas: academic credit for work experience, career awareness, youth-operated projects, and private sector projects. Of the 21 projects studied, 18 offered credit for work experience as a regular program feature. In general, those projects affiliated with an alternative school, and hence under state education jurisdiction rather than local affiliation, were most likely to grant required credits for experiential learning. Fifteen of the 16 projects routinely awarding academic  credit for program participation placed youth on a job. Only those projects placing youth in the public sector more than 70 percent of the time awarded credits for required courses. All the remaining credit-granting projects placed youth in the private sector and awarded elective credits. Among those factors ranked as the most important determinants of receipt of credits were employment-related factors such as employer evaluations, job attendance, and the job attitude of youth. (MN)",

Also collected was preliminary information concerning the extent to which the identified employability skills are outcomes of the postsecondary general studies curriculum. For the first part of the study, 48 empolyers in the San Francisco Bay area and the Salt Lake City area were interviewed to obtain their priorities. For the second part, six educators from four-year postsecondary institutions completed questionnaires designed to generate information about potential usefulness of the study outcomes. Non-technical skill requirements named by employers were of two types--functional skills, especially in the  communication (interpersonal) and persuasion categories, and adaptive skills, covering a wide range of attitudes, personality traits, and work habits. Educators' responses to the employers' skill priorities suggested that such information is welcomed by educators, but a communication gap exists. Employability of their graduates was a concern but not a high priority among faculty, an attitude reflected in the curriculum. The most significant barrier to implementing greater opportunities for skill development was attitudinal. (The employer interview form, employer data, and educator questionnaire are appended.)

Two in five were systems analysts or programmers; one in five was a keypunch operator; one in 20 was a computer service technician; and more than one in three were computer and peripheral equipment operators. Employment was concentrated in major urban centers in four major industry divisions--manufacturing; services; finance, insurance, and real estate; and wholesale and retail trades. Between 1970 and 1980, employment of computer workers more than doubled. Educational requirements ranged from high school graduates to those with a college degree and beyond. The shortage of qualified computer workers is due to the relative newness of the field, its rapidly changing technology, and lack of qualified teachers. Overall  employment is expected to increase by nearly one-half from 1980 to 1990. New technologies that will affect employment are in three major areas: hardware, software, and applications. Employment of computer and peripheral equipment operators and computer service technicians is expected to increase, while the demand for keypunch operators will decrease. The shortage of computer personnel is expected to continue, resulting in higher wages, more job mobility, increased job security, and greater opportunities.

Experiences in delivering vocational services to teachers of handicapped students are also described. Recommendations are made for planning, staff development, curriculum, and instructional materials. The fifth paper considers the importance of advisory and advocacy input regarding the LRE.

The fifth  paper examines the basis for personnel preparation in organizations providing vocational services to special needs students. The possibility of interagency cooperative activities and suggested competencies for special needs vocational trainers are examined. Two hypothetical approaches are proposed to increase agency interaction through training of staff from all agencies. The sixth paper identifies problems of implementing, operating, and maintaining CETA/vocational education programs for special needs clients and the use of evaluation to facilitate program development and maintenance.

        "description":"Five policy papers address methods of funding vocational/special education and relative benefits versus expenditures for different employment training systems for moderately and severely handicapped persons. The first paper critiques the present vocational education funding system for handicapped students. Federal funding mechanisms, state and local matching of set-aside funds, and problems in complying with legislative mandates are discussed. Tentative suggestions for improvement are offered. The second paper reports Abt Associates study fundings regarding the impact of the 1976 Vocational Education Amendments on services to special needs populations. Patterns of expenditure of set-asides for special populations are highlighted. The third paper proposes changes in the Vocational  Education Act to clarify and simplify the present law and make federal spending for vocational education more effective. It calls for centralization of purpose and decentralization of process in delivering vocational education. The fourth paper reports an investigation to determine whether the costs and benefits of the train-place-train approach to competitive employment are comparable to the costs and benefits of individuals working in extended, sheltered employment. The fifth paper reports an analysis of several cost and benefit dimensions associated with Project Employability, a job placement program for moderately and severely handicapped individuals. (YLB)",

As compensation, workers receive a comparable percentage of their unemployment insurance benefits. Although Western European countries have used work-sharing programs and Canada has implemented an experimental SWC program, the United States has had limited experience with SWC. Each of the groups--labor, business, and government (taxpayers)-- that could in some way be affected by SWC have an interest in and concerns about the program. Their unresolved questions are of two broad types: those relating to administrative and operational considerations and those relating to program impacts on the various interest groups. To learn about SWC in a real-world  context, a demonstration should be planned as a comprehensive, voluntary, entitlement program replicated in several sites. A suggested demonstration design is based on a state model. Regulations would be required in three areas--employer eligibility, employee eligibility, and benefit calculation and payments procedures. A minimum of four sites would be chosen to provide variation. Evaluation should include an analysis of the process of implementation and operations and a quantitative participation and impact analysis for the respective groups. (YLB)",

        "description":"An examination of the employment service's operations in Maryland, Michigan, and Florida showed that its functions fall into two broad categories: labor exchange and non-labor exchange. State and local employment service officials and many employers believed the non-labor exchange functions detract from the labor exchange missions. The extent and use of automated systems varied considerably depending on the importance state and local offices place on the data provided. Budget cutbacks resulted in reducing staffing levels and the closing of some offices. Although access to the service was available to anyone, fiscal year 1981 job applicants were often younger and less educated than the general labor force. Jobs listed by the service were most often in nonprofessional and lesser  skilled occupations and were frequently of short duration. Many of the 30 employers contacted said they did not place better jobs with the service because they felt qualified applicants do not use it. The 18 employers who used the service generally had a favorable opinion. The service was usually integrated or linked to local Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs.

Thirty-six firms were interviewed that had productivity sharing plans. Nine firms that had either rejected adoption of a productivity sharing plan or were still considering implementing one were also interviewed. Productivity sharing programs were found to have evolved from individual incentive systems to group incentive systems. Besides profit sharing, the three most commonly cited group-gain sharing plans were Scanlon, Rucker, and Improshare. Information obtained from employees, union representatives, and firm officials provided evidence of monetary benefits and nonmonetary benefits (improved  labor-management relations, fewer grievances, less absenteeism, and reduced turnover). The majority of respondents expressed satisfaction with their plans and believed current benefits warranted their continuation. Depending on a company's reason(s) for adopting a productivity sharing plan, certain factors varied, including types and numbers of employees covered, roles of consultants, basis and conditions for bonus payments, and amount of assurance employees receive that payments are equitable. Difficulties encountered with productivity sharing plans were development of a workable bonus formula and resistance by employees and management. (YLB)",

Section 1 considers planning evaluation (determining program goals and selecting the program strategy). Section 2 describes process evaluation focusing on the implementation aspects of a program. Three case examples describe evaluation activities conducted for a short-term  workshop, a course, and an inservice project. Section 3 examines impact evaluation that looks at the outcomes and effects of a program on its graduates and their respective work environments. Two case examples of impact evaluation designs in vocational/special education personnel preparation projects are highlighted.

As one of several tools for evaluating success of local youth training programs, &quot;benchmarking&quot; provides a system for measuring the development of those trained with Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds. The paper consists of five sections. Section 1 contains definitions and a discussion of the terms and concepts involved in any consideration of benchmarking. Section 2 provides a historical overview of the development of competency measures in the secondary education and vocational education systems, along with the Consolidated Youth Employment Program (CYEP) experience  with benchmarking. In section 3, a number of issues that should be considered before a benchmarking system is designed are discussed, and the importance of developing benchmarks in conjunction with local employers is emphasized. Section 4 focuses on the problems that could be encountered in implementing a benchmarking system. The final section contains a brief listing of the qualities one would expect to find in an exemplary benchmarking system.

        "description":"A study was conducted (1) to obtain an estimate of the amount of error in prediction that occurs when static measures are used to interpret work-sample performance; (2) to identify a number of dynamic performance measures that reflect learning that might occur on the task; and (3) to compare the predictive accuracy of those measures to that of static measures. The participants in the study were 10 male and 10 female handicapped vocational evaluation clients. The clients practiced on a work sample involving a relatively simple psychomotor task for 5 consecutive work days (50 trials/day). The data collected showed that the participants improved an average of 31 percent in performance speed over the 5 days, with 11 exceeding the industrial standard by day 5. The accuracy of eight  methods of predicting day 5 performance was investigated; all of the dynamic prediction methods proved superior to the traditional static work-sample measure. It was concluded that the use of day 1 total response-time scores seriously underestimates the level of performance that a handicapped individual can potentially achieve on a task following practice, while analyzing the performance data with dynamic performance measures can result in significantly more accurate estimates of the level of performance that someone can achieve. It was suggested that microcomputers be used in data collection and analysis of dynamic performance measures. (KC)",

The main focus of the report is on how to identify and test interactive relationships between individual differences among learners and instructional conditions or treatments. The report directs considerable attention to problems of measurement that are basic to diagnosis and evaluation. The report rests on the conviction that no acceptable substitute for careful empirical experimentation exists; an approach must be tried, often several times, before evidence sufficient for credible evaluation is available. Underlying this conviction is commitment to principles of measurement. Detecting and quantifying  the effects of instruction require dependable measurement. Thus, a portion of this report concerns (1) the development of measures of learner aptitudes (e.g., the learner's repertoire of knowledge, skills, and abilities) as a basis for assignment to instructional treatment and (2) learner achievement as a function of instructional treatment. Particular emphasis is given to the importance of homogeneity among items that comprise a test of achievement because a reliable test cannot be composed of nonhomogeneous items. Also emphasized is that an unreliable test cannot be useful for either diagnosis of evaluation. (Author/KC)",

The study was also designed to ascertain differences on the basis of disadvantagement, race, and sex. Subjects were 306 students from Hudson County, New Jersey. A 42-item questionnaire was developed to measure attitudes toward vocational education. Part 1 was a Likert-type summated rated scale; part 2 was a forced-choice multiple-choice section. Attitudes of males and females as well as Black, Hispanic, and White adolescents toward vocational education did not differ significantly. Differences occurred between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged youth.  Nondisadvantaged youth had a more favorable attitude toward vocational education. All participants perceived vocational education with a positive attitude. Disadvantaged youth, even though they had a lower attitude score, indicated a greater preference for the vocational program than did white youth. Male youth indicated a greater preference for the vocational program than did female youth. No difference in attitude scores was shown among the youth selecting the vocational, general, or college preparatory high school programs. Conclusions suggested barriers to participation are not directly related to attitudes of disadvantaged youth. (YLB)",

Key employment programs for disabled workers were reviewed, including the Employment Services System (Job Service), the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, Title III--Special Projects, Sheltered Workshops, additional demonstration efforts funded by the Department of Labor, private sector initiatives for disabled persons, and services by the Rehabilitation Services Administration of the Department of Education. These programs and projects indirectly addressed the need to work closely with private employers to eliminate stereotypes of the abilities of disabled workers  and to identify processes to facilitate job placement. Four specific barriers to employment faced by handicapped individuals were explored: job modification, employer hiring practices, productivity concerns, and fringe benefit packages.

The JOBS program was designed for personnel who scored in the lower mental aptitude categories on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery to increase their mastery of the skills and knowledge deemed to be prerequisites for success in Class &quot;A&quot; technical schools. Volunteer recruits were randomly assigned to two groups: JOBS direct-track and JOBS delayed-track (completion of apprenticeship training and time in the fleet prior to JOBS training). Control groups were also specified. Of 1,551 students who attended JOBS school, 1,493 (96 percent) graduated. The JOBS delayed-track  group had a higher percentage of attrition from JOBS school than did the JOBS direct-track group. Class &quot;A&quot; school data for 1,256 JOBS graduates showed that 996 (79 percent) graduated and 260 (21 percent) attrited. Comparable figures for the &quot;A&quot; school comparison group were 90 percent and 10 percent. Thirty-three months after JOBS and comparison groups had graduated from &quot;A&quot; school, the &quot;A&quot; school group had over twice as many fleet discharges, thus reducing the total loss rate between the two groups to 3 percent.

Computer programmers do not understand educational processes well enough to produce effective software, while the majority of special needs educators lack computer training. Special needs educators need to use existing knowledge in the area of computer assisted instruction (CAI) to modify or develop programs to meet their students' learning styles. Some other suggestions to get CAI initiated are preservice and inservice on computers, learning material development, and incentives for teachers to learn CAI. The role of CAI in the curriculum can be to supplement the regular curriculum; reduce instructional time; operate at the special needs students' pace; give  instant feedback; provide tutoring, drill, and practice as well as tests and questions; and provide surprise, challenge, and curiosity. Components of good CAI program designs are student control, individualized instruction, modularized programs, multisensory presentations, and clearly written support materials and documentation.

        "description":"Through the late 1970s the idea was expressed that community education provides a structure for citizen involvement in local decision-making processes and that democratic processes would be reintroduced at the community level through a new commitment to it. Minzey and LeTarte proposed the concept of process--to develop a community process of citizen involvement in a more democratic decision-making system. Community education has been located, for the most part, however, in a closed bureaucracy--the local school system. Perhaps Minzey and LeTarte went too far in their claims of process, and community education is capable of the following: making better use of the capital and knowledge resources of the local school system, aiding in the development of an educational system  comprehensive in its response to community needs, fostering interaction between schools and community agencies toward resolution of community problems, and serving as an open area of the school bureaucracy. Three projects in rural communities in Mid-Atlantic states were studied to see if community educational projects moved toward process as they aged. Findings supported the conclusion that the community educational programs were basically bureaucratically structured as part of the local school system. However, the findings also showed that community educational programs served to open the school's bureaucracy by suing the local schools for classes for all citizens and that the projects cooperated with other agencies to provide resources and programs.

First, a positive relationship exists between the quality of participation and the quality of leadership. Leadership should aim for team-directed action that meets member interests and concerns in the team's environment. Shared leadership activates the resources of all of a group's members in directing and conducting group tasks. Second, grassroots leadership can be taught and learned, as exemplified by the Leadership Development Program offered by the Community Leadership Training Center of Western Michigan University. Its learning objectives are trainee awareness, understanding, and use of specific skills that drive the processes of group communication, consensus  formation, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, and evaluation. Skills are described in brief lectures followed by trainees' working on a structured experience. In a processing stage, data of trainees' experiences are closely examined. Third, the costs of teaching and learning leadership abilities are low enough in terms of time, energy, and money to make training practical. Fourth, very few opportunities exist for grassroots people in neighborhoods to obtain leadership training. Fifth, community educators are strategically placed and qualified to deliver grassroots leadership training. (YLB)",

Also investigated during the study was an alternative method of scoring the Purdue Student-Teacher Opinionnaire. (The Purdue Student-Teacher Opinionnaire is a 60-item questionnaire that yields factor scores pertaining to the following areas: rapport with supervising teacher, principal, and university supervisor; teaching as a profession; school facilities; professional preparation; rapport with students and other teachers; and student-teacher load.) After administering the opinionnaire to 95 student teachers who were enrolled in the Department of Agricultural Education from the fall of 1980 through the spring of 1982, researchers analyzed the relationship of the nine factors to  the student teachers' plans to teach. Six of the nine factors showed statistically significant correlations with plans to teach. Of these, teaching as a profession and rapport with students exhibited the highest correlation with plans to become a vocational agricultural teacher. Recommendations called for increased efforts to improve the image of teaching as a profession and for more careful selection of student teaching centers. In addition, the researchers concluded that the certainty method that they used to score the opinionnaire produced sufficiently reliable results to warrant its use. (MN)",

        "description":"Human ecology and indispensable components of a quality system in vocational education are two operational frameworks that could help to facilitate cross-national cooperation in vocational education. As the exhaustion of natural resources is recognized as resulting partly from the dysfunctional behavior of people, human ecology becomes a necessary frame of reference for the development of vocational education programs. Implications of human ecological research will be used to indicate tolerance levels for environmental strain on people. The aim in curriculum development for vocational education should be to give priority to an extensive common prevocational curriculum preceding specialized skill training to lessen school stress. Another traditional issue that needs  reconsideration in human ecological terms is general human development versus work force utilization. The second framework for cross-national cooperation in vocational education calls for definition of components that constitute a quality system in vocational education in different countries. These components are emphases on (1) non-job-specific interpersonal skills and skills related to coping in the work environment, (2) the integration of general and vocational education, (3) basic skills, (4) sequencing curricula for lifelong vocational learning, and (5) the formation of compound systems for in-school and out-of-school learning resources.

To maintain the present standard of living, Americans will be dependent on a continuous infusion of scientific breakthroughs and productivity-enhancing technology. Periodic upgrading of skills will be a necessity for more and more workers. Of the three types of post-high school education--liberal, professional, and vocational--the most pressing need exists for more vocational education leading directly to employment opportunities. Unemployment figures show that many Americans need and wish to be taught how to earn their living in a more technological and changing world. Retraining obsolete workers is a subsection in vocational education that  requires more attention. Economic necessity and individual motivation will encourage more women to return to school to prepare for more challenging, higher salaried ppositions. Although jobs in the service sector are expanding, long-term economic growth and vitality will only be possible if Americans work to maintain their advantage over the global competition in expertise. American workers will have to be better educated and trained. Increased investments in vocational education as well as professional education can help to accomplish this, especially if American industry plays a more actively supportive role in the educational system.

The National Longitudinal Survey of Women, who were 30 to 44 years of age, provided the data base. To determine if women's work decisions were consistent with maximizing their economic return to work (the maximum market value of their maximum work hours), a wage rate and a time frame of socially required and unconstrained time were formulated. An income test (the family income excluding the woman's earnings does not equal the poverty threshold) was also considered. Use of the standard efficiency test based on wages indicated that women's work decisions were not very economical. The majority of the decisions were  market-oriented; women were working more than predicted. The standard interpretation of the outcome would be that these women subjectively value the market goods and services they buy with their earnings more than they value the output of their home activities.

        "description":"These proceedings contain 27 papers developed for a conference at which information was provided on currently available and future technological alternatives for delivery of career information. The presentations by staff of State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees, Career Information Delivery Systems, and hardware vendors are grouped according to the categories of alternatives discussed. The four presentations on automated alternatives cover batch processing, mainframes, telephone linking, and new distributed processing approaches. The next five papers focus on nonautomated alternatives: needlesort, the SCAN process, microfiche, telephone hot lines, and printed materials. Career information delivery through microcomputer use is addressed in seven papers that  consider microcomputer delivery in Kansas; the move from a centralized system in Washington; microcomputer capabilities and costs; microcomputer effects on education; TRS-80 computers; and Winchester drives. The four presentations on special programs cover talking computers for the visually impaired; computer adaptations for braille and bilingual; Project Discovery, a guidance-based, simulated work, career educational system; and Systems Exploration and Research for Career Help (Search). The last seven presentations consider the use of a combination of alternatives to deliver career information in Iowa, Colorado, Georgia, Oregon, Maine, Florida, and Wisconsin. (YLB)",

The 12 activities are the following: examining student evaluation of instruction, conducting student/employer followup, measuring student competencies, assessing basic skills, assessing student services, assessing special needs services and identification practices, assessing access and equity, evaluating facilities, evaluating instructional materials, analyzing cost-outcome analysis, analyzing community resources, and assessing  community needs. The guide contains five sections following the description of 12 evaluation activities in the first section. The second section of the user guide suggests steps in getting ready for locally directed evaluation, such as, why evaluate, what should be evaluated, who should conduct the evaluation, and how to overcome possible barriers to evaluation. The third section of the user guide provides a procedure and task breakdown for conducting the evaluation. For each of the 10 tasks, subtasks and steps are suggested for carrying them out. The final two sections of the document suggest ways of using results and provide samples of documents to be used in the evaluation process. (KC)",

The Stress Response Scale was developed to test whether a child's behavior rating scale could be constructed based on a theoretical model of personality and if it could be validated by empirical means in order to obtain clinically useful factor scores. The scale was based on a model of personality functioning based on clinical experiences of the common response patterns adapted by children in coping with stress. A series of factor analytic studies done with previous versions of the scale yielded five factors labeled impulsive, passive-aggressive, dependent, repressed (withdrawn), and repressed (anxious) which were consonant with the predicted categories of the model. The results of these studies  suggest that empirical evidence exists to support the conceptual model upon which the Stress Response Scale is based and that, while results are preliminary, further development is warranted so that the Scale may be used in future in clinical, community, and school settings.

Several linear-causal theories of addressing wife-battering are discussed in detail including the victim-agressor model and the cybernetic or negative feedback/homeostatic model. Common shortcomings of each theory as models for treatment are identified. A systems approach to intervention and treatment is proposed and illustrated with a detailed discussion of how the interactional systems model might work in treatment with an abused wife. This systems approach to treatment for abuse is  illustrated in a case example providing initial client presentation of problems and the intervention strategies used. Implications for a wider application of this systems model of intervention are discussed. (PAS)",

        "description":"Individual variability in response to behavioral weight loss programs remains an unresolved and perplexing issue for health psychologists. Determining in advance who will succeed or fail at losing weight would be useful in devising programs that produce a more homogeneous and dramatic response to treatment. In order to examine which responses to an application and a relationship questionnaire relate to weight loss success, 23 couples participated in a 1-year correspondence weight reduction program. One person in each couple enrolled to lose weight and the other agreed to act as helper. Reducers completed an application form recording demographic information, reactions to past attempts at weight loss, and number of previous methods used. Helpers rated their willingness to perform  weight-related tasks to help the reducer. Both reducers and helpers completed the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale. Analyses of results indicated that better educated reducers and helpers with fewer negative attitudes about past weight loss attempts and fewer prior attempts at losing weight performed better, and that those with partners less willing to aid them or with unsatisfying marital relationships lost the most weight. The findings suggest that the application items and the measure of relationship satisfaction may be useful predictors of weight loss. (PAS)",

Psychological, social, and demographic factors have been examined, but correlations with weight loss are disappointing. Actual behaviors or quantifications of specific actions and historical measures were examined for their validity in identifying reliable predictors of weight loss success. Couples (N=23) participating in a 1-year correspondence weight reduction program in which one person in each couple enrolled to lose weight and the other agreed to act as helper completed questionnaires about body weight history and specific prior attempts at weight loss. At the end of 1 year responses were correlated with loss of absolute weight and percent body fat. Results indicated  that there was little correlation between weight history and measures of body change and that the most successful reducers were those who reported the fewest past attempts and the fewest unsuccessful past attempts at weight loss.

        "description":"Previous research in social cognition has established that &quot;top of the head&quot; processing is a robust inferential bias, even in engrossing task situations. Three experiments were conducted to examine the generalizability of perceptual salience effects. In each experiment, salience was manipulated by varying the visual prominence of discussants in a two-person conversation. In two experiments involvement was manipulated, and in a third experiment, involvement was operationalized as a subject variable. Analyses of results showed that, as expected, ratings of highly involved perceivers reflected more systematic procesing of message arguments, regardless of which discussant was visually salient, whereas ratings of less involved perceivers reflected &quot;top of the head&quot; processing. The  findings suggest that the study of personal involvement is a fruitful direction for social cognition researchers. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Assertive training interventions have become increasingly popular for teaching specific life skills to individuals, but spouses are rarely involved. To study the effects of training on marital relations and social skill, assertive training was conducted with married individuals (N= 4 couples) reporting less assertive ability than their spouses. Data indicated that trained subjects reported increased assertive ability and lowered social anxiety. Untrained spouses reported decreased assertiveness, increased social anxiety, decreased frequency of social anxiety, decreased social skill knowledge, and decreased social self-efficacy at followup. Marital relations were not influenced by training. Role play assessments of assertion indicated that all subjects performed more assertively  after training but the effects did not generalize to novel assessment situations. The findings suggest that exposure to assertive training, even in the absence of behavioral change, may have adverse effects on the social skill of the untrained partner and assertive trainers should be alert to the potential risks of unilateral spousal training.

        "description":"The Type A behavior pattern, an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, has been characterized as a response style for coping with perceived threats to control. Recent research suggests that self-attributional biases may play a role in the Type A's sensitivity to loss of control. Attributional mediation of Type A's experience of stress was explored using Type A and B males (N=40) who performed a problem solving task and were led to believe that their correct responses would reduce the number of aversive noise bursts they heard. While all subjects heard the same amount of noise, half received contingent failure performance (Perceived Control, PC), and half received noncontingent failure performance feedback (No Perceived Control, NPC). While there were no differences  in attributions that Type A's and B's made for their performance in the PC condition, in the NPC condition, Type A's made more extreme self-attributions, and perceived the noise bursts as more stressful than PNC B's. The results for performance revealed a possible trend of Type A's to manifest performance decrements on a similar task, whereas Type B's did not. Both Type A's and B's appeared to show facilitated performance in the NPC condition on a different task. The results suggest that attributional differences between Type A's and B's contribute to their differential responses to loss of control. (Author/JAC)",

The contracts between psychologists and psychiatrists and CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services), a health benefit program for retired military personnel and military dependents, are discussed. The review process is followed from the third-party payer request for an evaluation to disposition of the case. Similarities between the review systems implemented for CHAMPUS and the private insurance companies are  reviewed, and the selection of reviewers is discussed. Criticisms of the project are noted, particularly regulations directed against the third-party payer, the mechanics of implementation of the system, accountability issues, and specific review criteria. Responses to these criticisms are cited, including criteria modifications, additional research, and a review of recommendations from the CHAMPUS National Advisory Panel. (JAC)",

Survey data obtained from an extensive questionnaire published in three North American daily newspapers in 1980 from 2,026 adults, aged 18-90, were examined to debunk the myth of loneliness in old age. The data revealed that older people tended to be less lonely than their young or middle-aged counterparts. Older people who lived alone were no less satisfied with the quality of their social lives than those who lived with others. An expressed dissatisfaction with available relationships was a more powerful indicator of loneliness. A social-ecological approach to studying the socially defined problems of aging was supported. Because these problems  have no single or simple cause, the findings suggest that the results should be studied using multiple levels of analysis and multiple perspectives in a lifespan framework, stressing the interplay between personal and environmental factors.

Certain procedures typically used in meta-analytic studies that review and integrate results from individual studies, such as combined tests and measures of effect size, are particularly well suited for program evaluation in certain situations. This paper describes a number of such situations, briefly reviews the literature on combined tests and effect size, and provides several illustrative numerical examples of their application in program evaluation. The three examples illustrate the practical utility of using combined tests and measures of effect size in program evaluations in situations where data are  available either cross-sectionally, or on successive occasions, or on independent components of a larger program. The materials suggest that measures of effect size are clearly valuable in providing potential insight into the differential impact of a given program, information that is more obscured when relying solely on statistical tests.

To learn to what extent such evaluations are actually performed and to obtain information about those evaluations, drug abuse treatment programs receiving federal funds in 1979 were surveyed. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of programs (N=628), with 341 responding (54%). Among the questions asked were the number of actual evaluations conducted, the way data were collected and analyzed, and the sources of the evaluation personnel. Responses were tabulated in terms of three categories of evaluation, i.e., in-treatment, follow-up, and process/cost. Results indicated that substantial numbers of programs receiving National Institute for Drug Abuse funding  at the time of the survey had conducted recent evaluations of their programs. In-treatment evaluation was the most prevalent type of evaluation conducted, with follow-up evaluation conducted by 20% of the programs surveyed. Among the seven major conclusions were that: (1) larger treatment programs with greater resources were more likely to carry out evaluation; (2) program staff involvement in the evaluation process was widespread; and (3) significant changes in program operations resulted from the various program evaluations.

        "description":"The problem of harassment of women in the workplace has received increasing attention from government agencies, Congress, and the courts in recent years. This growing general awareness of the problem of harassment and sex discrimination by both employers and employees is being made more acute by women's growing demands for career opportunities equal to men as well as for egalitarian, non-discriminatory, and harassment-free working conditions. The demand for solutions is therefore increasingly insistent. The alternative remedies open to women employees reflect alternatives for employers as well. The choices are that either ways are found for dealing effectively with the problem within the organization through fair administrative regulations and effective grievance procedures, or  ways will be found outside the organization in the courts and through advocacy efforts. Either way, these choices cannot be made by the perpetrators or victims. Self-policing of harassment and discrimination is not possible in a system which promotes it, and effective complaint is not possible where there is ignorance of alternatives and intimidation. Given these circumstances, if regulations are to come from within the organization, as is generally desired, change must be initiated and implemented from the very top levels of administration.

        "description":"Because new programs are being developed throughout the country to address the needs of midlife and older women, the Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington, DC, conducted a survey of selected programs and prepared a report based on the results. The Center's purpose was to establish a network through which professionals involved in issues and programs for midlife and older women could exchange ideas, information, and support, and to determine the extent to which the programmatic needs of women over 45 were being met and by whom. Section I provides an overview of the status of midlife and older women in the United States and the major issues and policies which affect them. Section II presents a brief history and description of program and policy developments which benefit  midlife and older women. Section III contains descriptions of the 28 programs in the survey, along with a discussion of the survey methodology, an analysis of the survey findings, a conclusion, and recommendations for future program development. In Section IV, a list of selected resources is provided to facilitate further investigation. This report may be useful to program planners, policy-makers, and practitioners engaged in the design, implementation, and evaluation of program models, service delivery systems and policies which affect women in the second half of their lives.

        "description":"The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in parental motivation, but little is known about the psychological factors underlying fertility rates and motivation. To examine the relationship of individual personality factors and expected family size and specific values about having children, 341 college students completed a questionnaire, the Value of Children Scales, and the Personal Values Abstract Scales. No differences were found in fertility expectations by gender, nor were fertility expectations related to the personality variables (femininity, socialization and efficacy). Gender differences were found in the value placed on children. Specific values about children were differentially related to personality factors with efficacy showing the strongest relationship.  Fertility expectations were also related to the specific values about children. The findings confirm that men and women value children differently. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The field of social innovation policy can presently be seen as divided into two opposing camps: pro-fidelity and pro-adaptation. The former conceptualizes innovations as consisting of a number of relatively well specified components, and argue that rigorously developed, evaluated programs should be implemented with close correspondence to validated models. The latter argues that differing organizational contexts and practitioner needs demand on-site modification. To provide empirical evidence about the pro-fidelity position, seven innovative social programs developed and disseminated nationwide by various public sector organizations (schools, city agencies, prisons, courts) using federal funds were studied. Methods for measuring program fidelity and effectiveness across sites  were developed. Results supported the two pro-fidelity assumptions. Four of the seven programs exceeded the acceptable level of fidelity, while the remaining three were in the acceptable range. The second assumption was supported by a significant correlation between fidelity and effectiveness. However, despite the overall support, there was considerable cross-program variation.

However, there are indications that a new movement already labeled in behavioral circles as &quot;affect in the eighties&quot; may be influencing the cognitive behavior therapy of the seventies. Distressed couples (N=58) and couples who responded to a newspaper ad (N=96) participated in a study to assess affect in marriage and its position in the behavior-cognition-affect linkage. The revised Positive Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ) correlated with spouses' ratings of affective responses to hypothetical positive actions by their spouses. Positive feelings toward a spouse were not correlated with age, education, or income. Women  in the distressed group had lower PFQ scores than women in the nondistressed group. The data suggest that behavioral marital therapists should consider how to modify affective responses and that the PFQ can aid such exploration by assessing spouses' feelings. (JAC)",

To investigate individual differences in the processing of self-relevant information, subjects (N=41) rated the self- and other-applicability of 90 traits and completed nine standard personality scales. Several measures were derived from the trait ratings: one represented the degree to which judgments set the subject apart from others in a favorable direction and another served as an index of the favorability of self-applicability judgments. These derived measures yielded significant correlations with several personality scales including Repression-Sensitization and Social Desirability. The findings suggest that those higher in self-esteem spend less  time thinking about themselves, a factor that may represent a cognitive aspect of self-esteem. (Author/JAC)",

Both theoretical background and clinical implications for crisis management, especially in long-term care settings, are discussed. Important differences for the elderly that warrant attention are examined, including the type, perception of, and number of stressful events which can precipitate crises, e.g., nursing home residents who are exposed to an alarming number of these events as a direct result of entry into the nursing home. Three levels and types of crisis intervention are proposed  to help older persons in crisis situations, including preventive, clinical, and problem-solving approaches. (Author/JAC)",

To investigate the relationship between sex-typing and self-reported job satisfaction and performance in the male-dominated field of engineering, 346 male and 346 female engineers completed the instrumental and expressive scales of the Personal Attributes Questionnaire as well as an extensive survey and interest inventory. The androgynous and masculine sex-typed groups reported significantly higher levels of job performance, job satisfaction and self concept of abilities than the feminine sex-typed and undifferentiated groups, regardless of sex. The androgynous group was not significantly different from the masculine group on job  performance or self concept. Females tended to have more favorable attitudes towards women in engineering, regardless of sex-type.

However, increasing doubts have been expressed about the universality and permanence of the relationship between women's work and family lives. To explore how early family experiences and early adult decisions affect women's later career achievement, three cohorts of married female college graduates were compared. Path analysis revealed powerful commonalities in the routes to career achievement. The stability of the importance of the number of years worked and the highest degree attained indicate that to achieve in the traditional terms of the workplace means that women must attain higher degrees and avoid dropping out of the workforce. Results suggest that career  achievement does not depend on making the &quot;right&quot; decisions at specific &quot;right&quot; times, but does depend on accumulating some combinations of credentials, experience, and freedom from childcare responsibilities over time. In addition, credentials seem to decrease in importance over time, while experience seems to increase. (Author/JAC)",

The special implications of language are discussed, and emotion is defined. An argument is posited that language makes humans different in fundamental ways from animals, because it allows behavior to come under the control of principles of logic and reasoning that are mediated by language and that are functionally independent of biology.

A stress management program is presented along with self-report data from the follow-up questionnaire filled out by the group participants and the actual survey instrument. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The decade of the 1970's saw an alarming decline in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores of entering college freshmen, and it was theorized that this might be attributed to a corresponding decline in study attitudes. To test this hypothesis, math and verbal SAT scores, study habits, and attitudes of college freshmen in the classes of 1973 and 1983 were compared. Although a decline in SAT scores was found, there was a slight improvement in work methods, teacher acceptance, and educational approval. The results also showed that differences in verbal aptitude between men and women had narrowed, probably due to cultural influences; however, women maintained superior study habits and attitude scores. The findings suggest that a decrease in student activism may account for  enhanced behavioral and attitudinal scores. (Author/JAC)",

To investigate parental beliefs about the standards used in deciding custody, 12 sets of parents completed a questionnaire and were interviewed. Results showed considerable agreement with the standards reported by judges in a previous study. Parents were generally in agreement with each other about the criteria that should be used and how those criteria should be applied to their particular situation. The parents emphasized avoiding a court battle over custody and listed the other parent as the person with whom they had discussed custody. The preliminary indications also suggest a tendency for educational workshops and mediation to  be rated as more helpful than arbitration and professional evaluation. (Author/JAC)",

A national survey of larger public and private undergraduate psychology programs was conducted to determine the status of non-classroom experiential learning. These data support the conclusion that such learning opportunities were widely accepted as useful, but highly variable and problematical in their implementation. The mission of internships was perceived as a collateral tool for coursework to prepare students for graduate work rather than as a tool for the terminal B.A. student. The findings suggest that faculty should respect student goals and labor market realities and prepare their students to be  like themselves in academic preparation, humanistic orientation, and respect for knowledge, but not necessarily in terms of career role.

To examine the predictive utility of commitment, the relationship between commitment to marriage at the onset of therapy and changes during therapy was examined for a sample of 42 couples. Results showed that, for women, pre-therapy commitment level was able to account for unique variances in marital satisfaction at intake and for changes in marital satisfaction occurring as a result of therapy. Communication ability was also predictive of marital satisfaction at intake. In addition, changes in communication ability from pre- to post-therapy were predictive of changes in marital satisfaction for women. Results for  men were less significant.

The social organizational pressures of the secondary schools and the limited professional preparation of school psychologists to work with adolescents are cited as the two principle reasons why school psychologists have not provided substantial amounts of service to the secondary schools. A data-based screening system is proposed to actively identify students with probable special education needs, as well as those who require specialized services within regular education. Individual diagnostic assessment of handicapped adolescents is discussed in relation to a total intervention plan which addresses four instructional areas--academic, vocational, social, and personal. The  rationale for, and description of, specific assessment procedures are presented for each of the four areas. Implications for future directions in training and the practice of school psychology with adolescents in the secondary schools are discussed. A descriptive, objective referral form that assesses students in terms of academic task areas, academic subject performance, pre-vocational/vocational performance, speech and language, and auditory perception is also included.

Treatment intensity is presented as a dimension of intervention that includes the factors of: (1) the individualization of the assessment and the treatment plan; (2) the amount of time spent engaging in the activities that are intended to produce behavior change; (3) the amount of &quot;stimulus support&quot; (modeling, instruction, self-instruction, verbal and physical prompting) provided to produce effective, appropriate behavior; (4) the extent to which &quot;motivating operations&quot; are used to assure the effectiveness of reinforcers; (5) the magnitude and scheduling of consequences for effective and ineffective, inappropriate behaviors; and (6) the degree  of programming for generalization to the youth's natural environment. The restrictiveness of an intervention is defined in terms of the degree to which available activities deviate from the norm and to which rules limit involvement in such normal activities, the similarity of types and frequency of social contacts to the norm, and the similarity of the physical environment to that encountered by others. The materials describe a program of youth treatment in a family environment to provide highly individualized care. Residential treatment alternatives requiring minimal, moderate, and maximal restrictiveness and treatment intensity are compared. Advantages of the family-based teatment are discussed, including better use of funds, flexibility, incidental learning, and effectiveness as well  as risks and limitations of the program. (JAC)",

Both experiments, with college students as subjects (N=30 and N=30), used a selective listening procedure involving bianural (sounds sent to both ears) presentation of two simultaneous digit series in male and female voices. In the first study, all subjects reported an awareness of the repetitions. In the second study, where only partial recall was required, 25 of the 30 subjects were aware of some repetition.

Results showed that about 5 percent of the workers were interested in reducing their working hours, often citing growing job dissatisfaction and declining health. The vast majority of respondents named loss in future retirement income as a major concern in altering current work and retirement plans. Actual reductions in work hours produced few changes in job satisfaction, job performance, or  supervisors' attitudes.

Thus, a freshman level reading education course offered the opportunity simultaneously to model effective practices for preservice teachers and to conduct a study of the gains in both content knowledge and reading study skills for students who had been taught study skills integrated with course content. Subjects, 121 undergraduates enrolled in 4 sections of a freshman level reading education course, were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. After training, the control groups tutored primary grade children in public schools, while the experimental groups attended a standard lecture-based college class in which reading study skills were taught concurrently with  the course content. Analysis of pretest and posttest data showed that the experimental group reported significantly improved study habits and attitudes as opposed to the control group. Course content scores also proved that if subjects were taught course content, they learned it, and that merging course content with reading study skills instruction did not hinder content learning. Reading comprehension and vocabulary also improved for the experimental group. Students also used what they learned in other classes and in their own teaching. (JL)",

An alternate conceptualization proposes that to learn to read children must obtain experience in three reading contexts: the use of print and its relationship to oral language (function of print), the rules for relating print to speech sounds (form of print), and the procedures for engaging in the act of reading and for discussing with others what one has read (conventions of print and procedures for instruction). This theory predicts that children need opportunities to learn about all three major systems to learn to read. Results from a test of the theory on young children who  had no idea how to spell words, knew no words, and could barely recognize letters indicated that informal or formal instruction using letters, picture cards, printing, and story reading tasks could acquaint children with some of the functional and conventional contexts for reading. Experiences of recognizing words and identifying signs helped children figure out how print was meaningfully related to language, events, and objects. Furthermore, experiences of reading, discussing story information, and rereading stories provided them with a clearer understanding of how one held a book and what to look at when trying to read a story.

In the first experiment, 117 undergraduates, divided into three groups, saw and heard a list of 72 target words. One group was told to write down an associate for each word--one a rhyme, and one just to learn the list for later recall. Rhyming or associate cues were then given on a recall test. Results indicated that encoding depth has an impact on memory performance over and above encoding-retrieval cue compatability. Semantic processing seemed to produce cued recall superior to phonetic  processing even if the cues provided at recall were incompatible with those encountered during encoding. Recall was still maximized by compatible cues. Using 84 subjects and the same 72 target words, the second experiment added the question of subject versus experimenter generation cues to the questions about encoding depth and compatibility. Results of this experiment confirmed the importance of encoding depth while also indicating that subjects perform better when they generate their own cues. (JL)",

Analyses revealed that the average inter-scorer agreement was 90.3%. Average  scores for students in grades 3 through 6 ranged from 27.3 at grade 3 to 58.8 at grade 6, with an increase of about 10 for each successive grade level.

Three different reading measurement tasks were developed. Two of the tasks were curriculum based; the other, which served as a common measure, was not curriculum bound. The two basal reading measurement tasks consisted of a reading passage and a vocabulary list; the common measure was a word list. The testing of the students was conducted within the first month of school. Results indicated that in all grades there appeared to be differences among the  reading series in at least one of the measurement tasks--reading word lists or reading passages. The most consistent finding was that, when differences existed, Scott, Foresman and Houghton Mifflin appeared to be in the low student performance set, while Ginn 720 and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston appeared in the high student performance set. This was especially true when the task utilized a word list rather than a reading passage. Results further indicated that the tasks for all four curricula adequately reflected student growth across grade levels. (HOD)",

        "description":"Since derivatives are more likely to occur in expository or informational prose than in fictional, literary prose, a study was conducted to test the hypothesis that systematic contextual development of vocabulary is more apt to occur in informational selections than in fictional literary ones. The teaching of prefixes and the use of prefixed words in the Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch (HBJ) Bookmark Reading Program (1979) were examined because at grades 4 through 6 HBJ publishes a separate literature reader and a &quot;skills&quot; reader containing only nonfiction informational articles (although grade 2 through grade 3 material was also examined to establish the series' consistency). Results indicated that while many opportunities existed for systematic expansion of children's knowledge of  some prefixes, the skills readers provided few or no opportunities for many others. Surprisingly, while the HBJ series contained more prefixed words than other series at grade 3, after the split, the skills reader contained fewer, not more, derivatives. Most likely the series' heavy use of narrative rather than expository informational selections produced this result. Serious thought must be given to the dominating presence of narrative structure in reading instructional material at the middle grades level; in fact, the dominance of such material may be the cause of some of the problems students have in reading and writing other kinds of prose.

Subjects, 26 college undergraduates, were split into equal control and treatment groups of 13 students each. The treatment group was enrolled in an analytical reading course and the control group was enrolled in a college reading course. Both groups took the Survey of Study-Reading Habits as a pretest and retook it at the end of 6 weeks. Analysis of the data obtained from the tests revealed no  significant differences between the treatment and the control groups.

These studies were then classified according to whether they were explicitly or implicitly related to educational procedures and according to their inherent assumptions about the nature of reading disability and reading or spelling programs. Studies with implicit educational value were again classified according to how they identified characteristics of poor readers or spellers: causal factors, deficits in psychomotor or cognitive domains, characteristic symptoms in reading or spelling (eye movements and errors), and partial deficit processes. Studies with explicit educational value were divided according  to their psychological interventions (cognitive, psychomotor, psychotherapeutic, muscle relaxation, autogenes) and according to their specific program (cognitive, linguistic, comprehensive, prevention, remedial). Studies reviewed revealed some of the following: (1) training effect was independent of the IQ of the children; (2) despite 2 years of remedial education in the elementary school, 20% to 30% of the children still had severe spelling problems; (3) many children were able to overcome their dyslexia through specific instruction and without psychotherapeutic interventions; and (4) programs that were specifically designed to meet individual needs were more effective than comprehensive programs.

        "description":"A 2-year study examined the leisure reading of 60 and other language arts instruction in elementary school classrooms in west Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, led to the conclusion that many school practices were based upon assumptions of the out-of-school lives of students that were of questionable accuracy. Consequently, the researchers were asked to describe in as much detail as possible the regular routines of the families with which they were working. The researchers did not establish a research schedule but negotiated a series of contacts based on the mutual obligations of friendship. The result was a set of portraits that constituted a case study in some aspect of the culture of literacy. Although most of the reports describe inner city Black families, two reports look at  literacy use among relatively recently arrived Southeast Asians. All of the families are poor, and some are on welfare. All of the families are concerned that their children succeed in school, but not at any cost. Two themes that characterize these portraits are (1) the care with which the families organize themselves to make full use of the resources they have to meet the demands of school and the workplace while living lives of dignity and happiness, and (2) the fear that they may not be doing everything they should or could be. The typical posture of a family is, \"we will do everything we can to meet the school's demands: however, we will not sacrifice those things that give meaning and dignity to us. School success isn't the only thing important for our children to experience.\"  (HOD)",

        "description":"A study examined the ability of subjects of varying ages to write summaries of very familiar material. In particular, it explored the subjects' planning activities both prior to and during the summarization task. The subjects, 15 fifth, 16 seventh, and 15 eleventh grade students and 11 college students, were given two stories to study for a week. They were told to concentrate on all the details in each story. At the end of this period, they were given large sheets of blank paper and told to write a summary of one of the stories. They were allowed to consult the story while writing. Results revealed that college and eleventh grade students outperformed the younger students in their propensity to plan ahead by making rough drafts of the summary, in their sensitivity to fine  gradations of importance in the text, and in their ability to translate ideas into words. Planning, not age as such, was the best predictor of efficiency, although the age and propensity to plan were highly correlated. The findings suggest that when a summary is not just a measure of automatic retention, the ability to work recursively on information to render it as succinctly as possible depends on judgment and effort, as well as knowledge and strategies, and is, therefore, late developing.

Reciprocal teaching involves having teacher and students take turns leading dialogues focusing on pertinent text features. Four comprehension-enhancing activities were emphasized: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting. The reciprocal method was compared to a traditional teaching method in the first study, with the reciprocal method producing greater gains and maintaining those gains over a longer period than the traditional method. In the second study, reciprocal teaching resulted in  sizable gains on laboratory comprehension tests; reliable maintenance; generalization to classroom comprehension tests; transfer to novel laboratory tasks that tapped the trained skills of summarizing, questioning, and clarifying; and improvement of scores on standardized comprehension tests. These results were replicated in the third study in which volunteer teachers (rather than experimenters) used the method with their own reading groups. (Extensive tables of data are appended.) (FL)",

        "description":"Three studies were conducted to investigate the development of the ability of individuals of varying ages to use macrorules for paraphrasing expository text. Macrorules were defined as the general rules of deletion, superordination, selection, and invention that underlie comprehension of prose. In the first study, 18 fifth grade, 16 seventh grade, 13 tenth grade, and 20 college students were given expository texts and told to summarize them. They were allowed to do anything that would help them write good summaries, including taking notes, underlining text, writing rough drafts, and keeping their notes and rough drafts at hand while summarizing. The results were marked for use of macrorules by independent raters. In the second study, college rhetoric instructors (&quot;experts&quot;)  completed a similar task. In addition to summarizing the material, they were asked to talk about their methods for completing the task and about how they taught their students to summarize. In the third study, 20 junior college students (&quot;novices&quot;), completed a similar task. Results showed that older high school students, college students, and &quot;experts&quot; wrote better and used rules more efficiently while writing than did younger students and novice writers. There was also a marked tendency on the part of more mature students to rearrange material across paragraphs, combining according to common topic. (FL)",

        "description":"Two experiments were conducted to determine whether a meaning emphasis or a word identification emphasis would give better results in a third grade reading lesson. The results investigated more than 30 factors and their two-way interactions. In the first experiment, 259 children were placed into reading groups arranged either homogeneously or heterogeneously according to teacher judgment and standardized reading test scores. Each small group met individually with a researcher who conducted a reading lesson with either a meaning or a word identification emphasis. The second experiment was a replication of the first, with 86 children participating. Results showed that lessons with an emphasis on meaning produced better results than those with an emphasis on word identification with  both good and poor readers. Other findings include the following: (1) in groups receiving the word identification emphasis, reading performance depended on instructional time; (2) in both groups, the child taking an active turn got more from the lesson than did the children who followed along; and (3) the level of interest of the material was a major factor in reading performance, far more important than readability.

        "description":"Focusing on the social nature of reading instruction provides another direction to research and study that both differs from and adds to cognitive research. H. Mehan's theory of social constructivism emphasizes that the development of cognitive processes occurs within the individual through the internalization of interactions between learners and more capable &quot;teachers.&quot; This approach demonstrates that ability and intelligence are not static, but are dynamic, collaborated responses to specific interactions. Success or failure in schools, therefore, may be due to cultural matches or mismatches between teachers and students or schools and homes. This explanation is especially salient since so many school &quot;failures&quot; are members of minority, culturally different groups. Changing  patterns of failure among minority group children may indicate a need to modify the social and cultural systems at work within classrooms. Children's conceptions, attitudes, and expectations about reading must be studied to discover how they differ from those imparted within the social settings of reading groups, since reading groups tend to emphasize oral reading and subskill tests rather than comprehension of text. The fact that low reading groups are often composed of minority students who have a harder time understanding this emphasis may exemplify cultural mismatch between students and teachers rather then difference in abiltiy. Studying the sources of mismatches may indicate how to alleviate these problems. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"Although sentence combining practice has been shown to be an effective instructional technique for improving students' writing, scant attention has been paid to the appropriate sequence for such instruction. Studies of the natural development of oral and written language point out two general trends that should be considered in sequencing sentence combining instruction. First, language users develop basic sentences before they learn to elaborate on these sentences. Second, there is a general tendency to elaborate with full clauses first, followed by phrases and words that are derived from full clauses. The various syntactic structures that are normally included in sentence combining instruction can be classified into five categories: coordinates, adverbials, restrictive noun  modifiers, noun substitutes, and free modifiers. Within each category, the structures can be further divided into three levels, which serve as guidelines for referencing structures across categories. Sentence combining practice with this sequencing can help students develop the syntactic skills they need to produce clear, lively prose, but should not be considered the only component of a comprehensive writing program. (Appendixes contain the sequences for each of the five syntactic structure categories.) (HTH)",

        "description":"Case studies of six college freshmen enrolled in freshman composition courses that used sequenced assignments addressed to the same topic all term were used to investigate how students define revision, how their teachers define it, and what is important about the differences in these definitions. The students possessed a common theory of revision that was thoughtful, consistent, and systematic. It was derived from imagining their readers' process of interpreting what they had written. Viewing prewriting as the primary source of invention, they tended to see revision &quot;externally,&quot; to restrict it according to criteria already present in the first draft. Unlike these students, experienced writers--including the teachers in the study--saw revision in a second, &quot;internal&quot; way, as a  part of the process of rhetorical invention. Lacking sufficient flexibility, the students had trouble adapting themselves to the teachers' stress on revision as discovery. They tended to misunderstand directions and comments from their teachers intended to suggest internal revision. These results indicated that what the students already knew was blocking what they needed to learn. Their paradigm prevented their teachers' meaning from reaching them. Teachers must recognize the often unpredictable effects of such conflicts, as must composition researchers. (JL)",

        "description":"To avoid \"burn out\" from the general tensions of the times and from the severe demands of the teaching profession, English teachers need to exploit the means of renewal. Having literature at their command, English teachers can reconstruct themselves again and again through the dynamic interplay of human imagination and language artistically wrought. In addition to literature, teachers are blessed in having composition as a major component of the curriculum. Clearly the writing process is a ritual of renewal, of transmuting inchoate and often chaotic thoughts and feelings into an external order that simultaneously reorganizes the inner self. Too, the profession of teaching has built into it cycles of renewal, from planning periods to summer vacations. Beyond finding renewal within  the school calendar, teachers can find renewal in the young people who enter the classroom, being renewed by their vitality and often by their idealism and innocence. Another means of renewal, one outside the classroom, is that furnished by colleagues at conferences. At conferences teachers can learn from and be reassured by others. Outside the pale of the profession, teachers must find their own idiosyncratic means of renewal--whether it be through jogging, buying a new outfit, or collecting antiques. By consciously seeking renewal, teachers can find some joy in the world, some hope for the future, and some reason for persevering. (HOD)",

        "description":"In addition to writing short stories, poems, and plays, seniors enrolled in a creative writing course in a New York high school compose and illustrate children's stories. They first become familiar with published works of children's literature so that they can learn to identify and appreciate story devices used by professional writers. As the students begin writing and illustrating their stories, improving the process rather than correcting the product is emphasized. When the stories are completed, volunteers learn storytelling techniques with which to tell their stoires: they may divide their plots into separate units of action and practice them in sequence; they may identify sections of their stories that should be memorized; they may practice up to twice a day for at least a  week; and they may monitor their storytelling progress with tape recordings, with modification of their presentation based on thoughtful analysis. They then present their stories to preschool children participating in the school district's Child and Family Program. The benefits of meshing the creative writing unit with storytelling activities include the enjoyment of writing and &quot;telling&quot; stories, the positive reading experiences for children, and the development of a warm and loving relationship between the seniors and the children. Future plans for this program include extending the storytelling to the elementary school and to pediatric sections of local hospitals. (HTH)",

The eight scales are stimuli for writing, prewriting, writing, revising/editing, evaluation, language development, varieties of discourse, and publication of written work. The instrument was administered over a 3-year period to 104 English language arts teachers who were participants in various writing project summer workshops. An item analysis of the results was performed to determine (1) the reliability of the total instrument, (2) the reliability of items within each scale, and (3) the intercorrelation among scores on the scales. Results showed that the instrument as a whole had a high reliability coefficient and that each  of its eight scales was internally consistent. Low to moderate intercorrelations among the scales suggested that there was a commonality that cut across the scales; yet the commonality was not so large as to suggest that the scales were not somewhat independent of each other.

Questionnaires were mailed to representatives of industries and businesses in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and to alumni in engineering, management science, and computer science. Questionnaires were also given to students and faculty members in these three fields. Sample results taken from the business and industry respondents indicated that they perceived writing skills as \"important\" or \"critically important\" in their work performance, and important in influencing advancement in their fields. In addition, they valued organization,  clarity, and a clear statement of purpose in writing, and most frequently wrote memoranda, letters, short reports, and instructions. The entire results of the needs assessment will be used to help revise present professional writing courses and formulate objectives for more specialized ones. In addition to spurring curriculum revision, the assessment yielded significant increases in alumni interaction, business and industry participation, faculty development, and university involvement with the community.

The second section reviews several points of agreement and disagreement in writing research and practice and makes recommendations for changes in writing instruction. The third section details a specific agenda for the improvement of mathematics instruction. Section 4 offers three principles accepted by most reading educators and then posits three statements of need that ought to guide reading instructors. Next, recommendations are made that teachers  change their questioning strategies and instruction in vocabulary and comprehension skills and that they become more active in modeling and providing feedback to learners. Discussion is also given to teaching reading to language minority students. The evolution of oral communication as a basic skill is discussed in the fifth section, and recommendations are made for improving oral communication research and instruction. The sixth section outlines the roles that the federal and state governments should assume in the basic skills movement in the 1980's. The final section asserts that teachers can influence publishers and presents criteria for the selection of materials. (HOD)",

        "description":"Although research in the area of communication apprehension (CA) has been extensive, little of it has attempted to identify the regularity and intensity of the nonverbal stress behaviors associated with CA. Additionally, most CA research has concentrated on the problem in North American settings. To extend the boundaries of CA research, a study investigated CA interculturally, focusing on the identification, regularity, and intensity of nonverbal stress behaviors in speaking situations through the analysis of the self-perceptions of Japanese and North American subjects. These subjects, 284 North American and 256 Japanese college students ranging in age from 18 to 60, completed an instrument that asked them to assess their nonverbal behaviors in tense speaking situations. The  results indicated more than 100 different forms of nonverbal behaviors ranging from rapid heart rate to trembling hands. Data concerning the frequency and intensity of the various forms of nonverbal behaviors were highly variable; however, the most frequently cited behaviors were similar for the two cultural groups, indicating the potential of a cross-cultural link in speaker self-perception of nonverbal behaviors.

The paper addresses these two areas by (1) specifying assumptions for a cultural perspective on communication, (2) defining culture as a communicatively constituted analytic construct, (3) explicating a system of cultural structures that function to generate and regulate shared symbolic meaning, and (4) discussing three discernable communicative forms--ritual, myth, and social drama--that structure a sense of shared identity in interactive life. By advancing a cultural perspective on communication, the paper shows the unique and revealing insights that the study of shared meaning  and shared identity offer students of communication theory and research.

Subjects were 75 students enrolled in four sections of an undergraduate speech  communication course. Two sections were randomly assigned to each condition and were asked to complete a semantic differentiation instrument at the end of each lesson. Analysis of the results confirmed both hypotheses. These findings suggest that computer graphics can be a valuable learning tool when used to enhance traditional classroom instruction. (JL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the treatment of intrapersonal communication in basic communication course texts published in the last 10 years. Only 29 of the 77 textbooks surveyed covered the topic at all, and many of those treated it in a superficial manner. After being divided into two categories according to subject matter, public speaking texts and hybrid texts, the books were categorized according to the way they explained intrapersonal communication. Most described the concept as a kind of self-communication, self-monitoring, or thinking. Not surprising was the finding that hybrid texts were more likely to include the concept, but very surprising was the fact that pre-1980 textbooks mention the concept more frequently than post-1980 ones. Six books devoted the most  space to the concept or used unique approaches: W.D. Brook's &quot;Speech Communication,&quot; Zimmerman's, Owen's, and Siebert's &quot;Speech Communication,&quot; Myers's and Myers's &quot;Communicating When We Speak,&quot; Hopper's and Whitehead's &quot;Communication Concepts and Skills,&quot; Loren Reid's &quot;Speaking Well,&quot; and Crable's &quot;Using Communication.&quot; Tables of results and a list of the texts surveyed are included.

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to determine the degree to which various types of power were employed in the classroom and the effects of each type on both cognitive and affective learning. The primary focus of the first study was to determine the degree to which teachers and students shared perceptions of the use of power in the classroom. Power was measured as relative or perceived. A total of 156 teachers and 2,698 of their students provided data. The results indicated that even though statistically significant associations between teacher and student were found, teacher and student perceptions of the use of power were not isomorphic. The results also indicated that both teachers and students viewed the overwhelming proportion of power use to stem from reward, reference, and expert  bases. The second study focused on the degree to which use of power in the classroom was associated with cognitive and affective learning. The results, based on data from 151 teachers and 2,603 of their students, indicated that perceived use of power could account for approximately 30% of the variance in cognitive learning and up to 69% of the variance in affective learning. Coercive and, to a lesser extent, legitimate power were found to be negatively associated with learning while referent and, to a lesser extent, expert power were found to be positively associated with learning. Reward power was found to have no meaningful association with learning. (Author/HOD)",

Employing the metaphor of inoculation, the capsule is intended to immunize and inoculate against the erosion of self-image and self-confidence that results when people who do not understand a host culture's norms feel that their own cultural norms under attack. The program consists of discussion questions to stimulate new  value orientation and uses exercises and simulation games organized around 10 elements: (1) linguistic variables, (2) identity and status, (3) historical and political climates, (4) social values and structures, (5) economic trends, (6) technological language vocabularies, (7) nonverbal communication, (8) family/friends, (9) employment skills, and (10) company policy.

A visit 15 years later reveals that the physical plant has deteriorated somewhat, most classrooms are walled off from each other, and innovative structures are not now used for their original purposes. Current staff members are humorous and stable and interact a great deal, but they are more rural and local than the original staff and are more oriented toward a traditional, back-to-basics educational philosophy. The curriculum too is more concerned with order, structured activities, and basic skills. The present principal is also a traditionalist, unlike the school's first principal. Changes in  Kensington's social environment have contributed to the movement away from nontraditional approaches. Demographic shifts led to an increase in lower-achieving, inner-city children and an increase in disciplinary problems. These problems in turn contributed to the emphasis on order and basic skills. Further district problems over racial bias allegations and declining enrollments also strengthened the traditionalist turn. Educational policy-making results from complex influences, but the complexity of education's environments and problems needs to be addressed directly. (RW)",

They outline the founding of Kensington in the mid-1960s as an innovative school and its switch within 2 years to a more structured arrangement that still retained many innovative aspects. Problems that arose in the 1970s are reviewed, involving enrollment decline, immigration of black families, financial problems, school closings, and conflicts over the nature of \"neighborhood schools.\" The effects of  these problems on Kensington are traced, including moves toward stronger discipline, self-contained classrooms, a traditional curriculum, emphasis on order, and use of corporal punishment. The authors follow Milford's continuing enrollment declines, financial problems, and racial shifts and strains into 1980; discuss the effect of road patterns and social power on the neighborhood school concept; and speculate on future change in Milford. Four maps illustrate demographic and school changes from 1949 to 1980. (RW)",

The interviews covered the former faculty members' perceptions of the Kensington experience, the effects of Kensington on their lives and careers, and changes in their lives and careers in the 15 years since Kensington. Each interview was conducted by two researchers, who shared the roles of interviewer and observer. Besides noting that the former faculty maintained little mutual contact, the researchers identified six themes, only two of which are discussed in this paper. The first theme involved the connection between the strong religious feelings and  backgrounds of many former faculty and the quality of secular \"religion\" and \"true belief\" that educational innovation held for the Kensington faculty. The second theme concerned the former faculty members' return to their earlier origins, not only intellectual but geographical. Five had returned to the city where they grew up, and eight had returned to the same region. (RW)",

The authors describe how a revisit to the district uncovered new historical data--many years of board minutes--and led to the followup study's expansion into a seven-volume study of innovation in American education aimed at finding why Kensington began as well as what happened to it. The 2 key school years, according to the authors, were 1961-62 and 1965-66. In the first key year, the Milford board attempted to oust its long-time superintendent, the National Education Association became involved, and the  result was the hiring of a new superintendent, who was committed to educational innovation. Kensington was created as an innovative school soon thereafter. The second key year, the authors record, included board-superintendent conflict, a new Kensington principal, an electoral change in the board's membership, the superintendent's resignation, and the choice of a new superintendent. The authors' conclusion emphasizes the importance of history in studying educational change. (RW)",

Three decision-making domains are the foci of disagreement in education. The domains include the structure of student work, aiming at the improvement of learning; the structure of teacher work, including instructional practices and the work environment; and administrator work structure, including policy-setting and working conditions. At the same time there are three types of issues: technical issues, meaning instrumental or \"how-to\" problems; cooperative issues, involving human  interaction aspects of educational activities; and assumptive or semantic issues, concerning educational values and cultural constructs and ideology. The three decision domains--student, teacher, and administrator work structures--each have different technical, cooperative, and assumptive issues. For each type of issue within each domain, different research has been done, by CEPM and others, and different research needs exist. (RW)",

WRISE had four components: (1) 10 comprehensive objectives, each with related enabling objectives; (2) a six-step improvement process; (3) printed and audiovisual materials for local school staffs, to learn about the program, and for university education professors, to provide information to students; and (4) a dissemination and utilization plan. For secondary schools, evaluation data were gathered at 10 schools in 6 states, using 3 staff questionnaires and a school leader's report. For universities, data were collected from nine university programs in three states, using three questionnaires and a report from each  professor, as well as two questionnaires and pre- and posttests from students. Brief descriptions of each school and university program involved are provided. The secondary school results indicate that teachers and principals considered WRISE objectives, improvement processes, and materials both usable and effective. The university results show the professors and the students regarded WRISE materials as usable, effective, and of high quality. Lists of WRISE objectives and materials and copies of several questionnaires are appended. (Author/RW)",

Research focused on how much coordination currently exists nationwide; case studies of Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, and Washington examined whether the level of resources has an impact on the amount of coordination taking place, and the local impact of coordination. Across the 50 states very little coordination exists between education and other state agencies providing human services. Intensive interviews with key personnel in the four states revealed coordination efforts to be minimal among programs within education  agencies. In none of the four cases did declining resources spur agency initiatives for coordination, though state legislatures did push agencies in the direction of greater coordination. Finally, formal agreements at the state level do not determine the extent of joint activities at the local level. Only SEAs that use interagency agreements to establish working relationships between local offices of social and health service agencies and local school districts are likely to have an impact on local operations.

They first point out problems in present models relating organizations to their environments and discuss several &quot;forerunners&quot; of their proposed model. They begin their presentation of their own model by defining an &quot;institutional sector&quot; as a domain identified by similarity of service, product, or function. The authors then describe four sets of characteristics of institutional sectors and suggest 23 hypotheses about them. The first set of characteristics involves the distinction between technical (or market-run) sectors and institutional sectors (in which rules and  requirements predominate). Six hypotheses regarding organizations in these two types of sectors are listed. The second characteristic comprises the sector levels--including national, regional, or local levels--on which an organization operates; one hypothesis is presented. Sector decision-making processes, on funding or program matters, constitute the third set of characteristics. Eleven hypotheses are generated regarding decision-making centralization, fragmentation or unification, and substance (whether deciding core or peripheral matters). The fourth set of characteristics and the final five hypotheses involve sector controls, including structural, process, or outcome modes of control. (RW)",

They analyze such commissions' impacts, the criticisms made of them, their role in political legitimation, and some alternative instruments for policy formation. After a brief introduction the paper presents past and present opinions in the U.S. and the U.K. on commissions (chiefly noneducational ones) and their utility. The authors then look in detail at the role of three U.S. and five U.K. educational commissions of the 1960's and 1970's, examining their reports and the results of their recommendations. The U.S. reports are the California Master Plan on Higher Education, the Bundy report on New  York City, and the Kerr report on higher education; the U.K. documents include the Robbins, Plowden, James, Auld, and Taylor reports. The paper's following section places educational commissions within the larger context of political policy-making and discusses the extent to which commissions are legitimated and the extent to which they legitimate particular policies. The final section considers such alternatives to commissions as legislative committees, think tanks, one-person studies, political parties' research groups, and academic studies. (RW)",

Chapter 1 defines adequacy in terms of the provision of learning services sufficient to meet a goal and argues that the question of adequacy cannot be separated from the issue of equity. The second chapter reviews historical literature on U.S. public education to find how past policy makers and scholars have conceptualized educational adequacy and equity. In chapter 3 the authors analyze the changing role of the states in providing educational funding, the dollar amounts the states provide, various measures of educational resource inputs, and state funding  of supplemental programs in special, bilingual, and compensatory education. Chapter 3 also presents brief case studies of approaches to adequacy taken in Georgia, South Carolina, Washington State, and Connecticut. The final chapter proposes a resource-cost-based approach to adequacy and equity issues. Called the &quot;Resource Cost Model,&quot; the suggested framework is a computer simulation model for determining resources needed by districts and expenditures required of states to provide an adequate education (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Intended to help state education agencies answer public criticism of the costs of education, this paper describes the data currently available on increases in educational costs and attempts to reveal the factors responsible. The paper first analyzes the various expenditure categories in school district budgets, determining that while school district salaries did not keep pace with inflation, increases in staff sizes caused overall salary expenditures to increase faster than the cost of living. Maintenance and operations, fixed charges, and other costs (including programs and services other than the standard K-12 educational program) contributed dramatically to educational costs rising faster than the cost of living. The paper concludes with an examination of the effects of grants  from state and federal governments. It is noted that categorical grants usually fund programs or activities supplementing the regular programs, thus requiring increased expenditure. It is also suggested that increases in the proportion of school revenues provided at the state level have resulted only partially in reductions in local taxes, while the remainder of the increases has gone to support increased expenditure. Appendices present the techniques used in determining relative increases in expenditure categories. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"A set of studies done for the Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction (WSPI) constituted a case study testing the conjecture that management consulting is potentially cost effective in some areas of educational evaluation. The case study involved first interviewing 22 respondents from four WSPI constituencies (educators, employers, the legislature, and parents) to identify their major concerns, then deriving analyses of data related to the concerns from a WSPI data bank, and finally producing draft reports on the analyses. The data bank comprises data from the national &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; study augmented by additional Washington information and includes results of surveys of 3,645 10th and 12th graders in 65 Washington high schools. The test resulted in six  draft reports on student plans for work and college, employment-related coursework, special students, extracurricular activities, knowledge of post-high school funding programs, and family influences. The researcher concludes that the case study did not show whether management consulting was more or less cost effective than normal evaluation in WSPI, because of a lack of controls for comparison. A postscript by WSPI's director of testing and evaluation, Dr. Alfred Rasp, is attached. Also provided in appendices are the six draft reports. (RW)",

For each hypothesis, supporting statements are provided from three or more of the reports. The nine hypotheses concern the role in institutionalization of the following incorporation or routinization of a project, a project's base of support and flexibility, location of administration, administrator involvement, contacts with influencial persons and the public, leadership quality and type, relationship to current practices and  values, political environment and funding changes, and training of practitioners in the new function. The document then summarizes each of the nine reports. The reports include a theoretical model of institutionalization, a practitioner handbook, studies of innovations' institutionalization in urban bureaucracies and in a U.S. Marine Corps human relations program, and five studies of federally funded educational projects, involving the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, vocational education, reading, the Research and Development Utilization Program, state education agencies' roles in dissemination, and 250 Massachusetts projects.

Chapter 1 of the report covers the discussions of four classes of issues: (1) working with organizations toward institutionalization of dissemination plans, (2) continuing efforts to institutionalize particular dissemination projects, (3) funding and marketing problems related to institutionalization, and (4) role taking by administrators and agencies in  the institutionalization of dissemination plans. For each class of issue, the report presents related hypotheses from EA 015 290, hypotheses generated by the discussions, and related ideas from a conference talk by Adrianne Banks. Chapter 2 summarizes the statements by NWRx member states on what each will do after the conference. A matrix for planning for institutionalization is given in chapter 3. Three appendices provide the text of Banks' talk, notes from conference discussion groups, and a clarification of the terms &quot;permanent systems&quot; and &quot;temporary systems&quot;.

George B. Trubow's \"The Development and Status of 'Informational Privacy' Law and Policy in the United States\" discusses privacy as it relates to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information. Trubow covers relevant common law and court decisions, fair informational practices, federal and state privacy laws, and eight questions about privacy that need resolution. Alfred R. Louch's \"Morality and Privacy\" ponders the philosophical, social, and moral bases of the concept of privacy. Fred W. Weingarten's \"Information Technology and Privacy Trends in Products and Services\" surveys  likely developments in information technology over the next decade that will probably affect individual privacy. Weingarten identifies more than 14 trends in technological developments and in their effects at the individual level, at home, at work, and in broader social services. Finally, in \"A Taxonomy for Privacy,\" Willis H. Ware proposes a framework within which to consider privacy litigation and legislation. Ware discusses the concepts of physical, visual, aural, and recordkeeping space and suggests defining \"invasions\" of these spaces rather than defining privacy itself. (Author/RW)",

The five findings concern fitting preparation to needs, commitment, training specific to new practices, posttraining followup, and the variety of people who play facilitating roles. Indepth discussion of each finding, based on personal experience, shows that (1) different intentions or needs require different preparations or training, so that facilitators with more to learn will require more extensive training; (2) commitment to a new practice is a  precursor to success; (3) training should be specific to facilitator roles and skills and should include actual facilitating; (4) followup assistance for facilitators is needed, including coaching and resources; and (5) facilitators should be aware of where best they can facilitate, given their official role in the system. The four strategies suggested for facilitator development would apply for different situations and tasks. They include facilitator selection, formal facilitator training, development of support systems (such as principals' centers), and networking to provide assistance. (RW)",

The researchers sought to discover how related services are provided, what strategies are used to manage service-delivery problems, and what the future of  related services is. Interview results are presented in three sections. The first section notes PL 94-142's effects on state programs and related services and lists problems in services delivery, including economic and financial shortages, institutional and political constraints, and lack of interagency coordination and communication. The second section describes seven strategies used to manage these problems, such as interagency agreements and cost-sharing arrangements. The third section discusses factors curtailing or favoring related services in the future. An appendix outlines other types of agencies and federal programs providing related services. (RW)",

The following section discusses the uses and abuses of evaluation checklists and sets forth the three components of narrative evaluation reports: comments on the meeting of objectives, descriptions of performance quality, and recommendations for improvement. The fifth section suggests 17 guidelines for supervision systems, classroom visits, supervisory conferences, and narrative reports. Among the guidelines are evaluating tenured and nontenured teachers differently, taking notes during visits, being sensitive to a supervisory conference's emotional context, and writing simple, direct reports.

This document, outlining the model, is organized according to the 19 objectives grouped under 8 components: leadership training, public relations, Title IX evaluation, policy, increased visibility, professional development, promotion/evaluation, and local planning. For each objective a table presents activities necessary to accomplish the objective, personnel and materials  required, evaluation, and a timeline. In the appendices are a list of participants who developed the model, all timelines folded into a suggested 3-year implementation plan, and an abstract of the evaluation design and a copy of the evaluation instruments.

        "description":"To project school enrollments and the associated need for teachers and other school personnel in Colorado, a research study utilized historical data from 1960-1978 to serve as the basis for the projections. Population, live birth, and school enrollment data were analyzed, using programs from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The study projects that the population of Colorado can be expected to grow, on the average, between 1.4 percent and about 2.0 percent annually and that total school enrollment will generally increase over the period 1980-2000. The tables show the population, live births, live birth rate, and total school enrollment for the years 1960 through 1978 along with the percentage change in each from the previous year. These same categories are  projected through the year 2000 with low and high estimates along with nonteaching certified personnel and classroom teachers needed for the period. Other tables show the grade level enrollment by year and projected grade level enrollment. The accompanying technical report describes the study, lists its limitations, and presents the methodology and the results of the study along with a discussion and a summary. (MLF)",

        "description":"Examined here is the role of the courts as educational policy makers regarding church-state separation in the United States and Australia. The first part examines the relationship of the public schools to religion, both regarding the teaching of religion in the schools and compulsory education. It is noted that in spite of challenges, the courts have upheld &quot;general&quot; (rather than sectarian) religious teaching in Australian schools. The second part of the paper examines litigation concerning private schools in both countries, especially regarding government aid. It was found that in the United States, private school aid is tightly judicially policed, though very limited aid is allowed. In Australia, however, state aid to private schools is mandated by the legislature and  unchallenged by the courts. Policy implications of the laws on church-state relationships are discussed, especially regarding the future of government aid to private schools in both countries. It is concluded that in the United States, legislation benefitting mainly the nonpublic sector is unlikely to withstand judicial challenge, though aid might validly flow to the nonpublic sector when benefitting a broad class of beneficiaries and promoting public welfare. In Australia, private school aid, entrenched in the platforms of all major political parties, is likely to continue to have considerable public support. (Author/JM)",

The introduction to this report describes the conference format; discusses the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act; and offers definitions of personal information, privacy, confidentiality, security, access, and disclosure. Charles W. Joiner's opening remarks on \"Personal Privacy and Information Technology,\" covering the purposes of the symposium, are presented next. The document then reports the conference's discussions on \"Informational Privacy: Concepts, Values, and Technology,\" in which the conferees agreed that expectations and concepts about privacy differ. The document's  recounting of the discussion of \"Current Practices for Information Dissemination and Control\" indicates agreement that informational privacy is relatively unprotected. Under \"Considerations for Future Action,\" the report notes conferees' agreement that long-term mechanisms are needed to develop informational privacy policies, and outlines their discussion of privacy controls by government, personal self-help, or the private sector.

This report describes parental involvement in these programs and identifies some factors contributing to parental involvement, without attempting to evaluate the parental involvement components of the programs or to reveal the values of, or the specific forms taken by, parental involvement. The main conclusion of the report, based on the 1979 Federal Programs Survey of project officers in a nationally representative sample of districts and schools, is that legislation and regulation can provide powerful  motivation for the fostering and support of parental involvement. Secondary conclusions are that funding levels influence the extent of parental involvement activities and that the extent to which districts implement mandated activities should be monitored. The report presents historical background material, study objectives and methodology, survey design, and findings concerning four aspects of each of the four programs: the extent of parental involvement in governance and in provision of educational offerings, and the coordination and financing of parental involvement activities.

It was found, however, that external agents of change were often needed to act as catalysts. Facilitators are identified in each state of the 10 Federal regions. Information on their position, address, education level, experience, handicap (if any) and interests or hobbies is given. Similar information is presented for the  NPCE national training team. Contact persons for career education are listed by state, as are existing career education programs serving hearing impaired students. The final section presents summary data on 35 career education projects. (CL)",

Children who used high rates of private speech performed in a more immature manner on the cognitive tasks, supporting the notion that private speech is related to cognitive development and not just chronological age.

ESL modules are multimedia kits designed to integrate the study of ESL and communication skills in specific subject areas of the curriculum. This module deals with a geographical region, important both to Ontario and to Canada, that has an interesting history and some modern environmental problems. The module is designed primarily for ESL secondary-school students at the intermediate level, and has been successfully test-taught in a number of grade 9 and 10 ESL and ESL geography classes in southern Ontario. It is assumed that all students who use the kit will have completed an introductory course of English. The teacher's guide offers suggestions for  use of module components, a transcription of the audiocassette, answer keys to student worksheets, proposed followup activities, and a list of resources. The module provides exercises to develop reading, writing, and listening skills, graphing techniques, individual research, and other communication skills. One module component covers the major study of physical and economic characteristics of the region using a filmstrip and student booklet, both entitled &quot;The Golden Horseshoe.&quot; In a second component, the settlers who over the years formed the labor force of the region are described in an audiocassette tape entitled &quot;Canadians from Many Lands.&quot; An additional student booklet entitled &quot;The Changing Mosaic&quot; focuses on one important pattern of immigrant settlement in Metropolitan Toronto.

As the United States economy becomes more intertwined with that of the rest of the world, these patterns are changing, and there is now a greater recognition of cultural heterogeneity. This recognition is in large measure bypassing Europe, the influence of whose languages in other parts of the world has also changed profoundly. How can the teacher of languages respond to this change? First, the teacher should show how language functions as a social institution. Second, the teacher must go beyond the high culture of the metropolis and give consideration to the linguistic diaspora--to the use of  European languages also in the Third World. In this curricular reform, the teacher can work with colleagues in other fields individually or in groups, make changes in classroom materials, and learn from the experience of colleagues in other institutions.

Five families in a small academic community in the U.S. Midwest were identified. One parent was a native speaker of English (L1) and the other, a native speaker of French (L2). Open ended interviews were used in an attempt to discover the conditions which seem to be necessary and those which are generally typical of families in which there is a goal of childhood bilingualism. The conditions and their interrelationships are categorized in relation to the initial decision, the source of L2, and changes which affect the implementation of the initial decision. Important conditions regarding the  initial decision seem to be emotional attachment to L2 and the language spoken between the parents before the birth of their child. The presence of monolingual grandparents is an important condition for implementation and one that will change over time. Additional effects on implementation, not present at the time of the initial decision, such as birth of other children and entrance to school, may affect parental implementation of the initial decision. All the conditions can be conscious or accidental; all affect in one way or another children's acquisition of both languages. (AMH)",

        "description":"The natural phonology theory, related to European structuralism, makes two fundamental assumptions: (1) phonemes are mental images of the sounds of language, and (2) phonological processes represent subconscious mental substitutions of one sound or class of sounds for another that are the natural response to the relative difficulties of sound production. The processes are either fortitions, that is, they ensure perceptual clarity in pronouncing different words; or they are lenitions, that is, they represent change toward articulatory simplicity enabling the vocal apparatus to do less work. It is posited that these processes are not learned by speakers in acquiring their language, but are a universal response to difficulties presented by physical and perceptual limitations of  human nature. Evidence is reviewed showing that these processes are found in the description of the development of various languages, and in the pidginization process. Difficulties encountered in first and second language learning seem to bear out the natural phonology theory. Natural phonology predicts that second language learners will substitute \"easier\" sounds for those that do not exist in their native languages, that they will treat similar sounds as if they were the same as those in their native language, and that some errors cannot be attributed to interference because they are due to the operation of universal phonological processes.

        "description":"In July and August of 1980, material writers at the University of California-Los Angeles designed a course that would focus on the various reading and writing skills that science scholars would need for successful graduate study in the United States. The scholars were advanced learners of English from various science fields, and the course was to be taught in the People's Republic of China. Integration of reading and writing was accomplished through the careful selection of a series of articles from professional journals treating several topics so that the result was a number of articles per topic. Reading exercises were then written for these articles and for essays on the philosophy of science. Some of the skills treated included skimming, vocabulary through context, reading  for the main idea and supporting details, and summary through paraphrasing. In addition, the course emphasized the rhetorical functions most common to scientific writing, such as process and physical description, classification, definition, cause-and-effect, listing, and comparison. Treatment of the rhetorical functions involved both recognition in the reading and production in the required writing. Finally, the topics about which the students wrote necessitated the synthesis of the articles read or demonstration of application pertinent to the student's own field. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"A comprehensive bibliography on linguistic input in the home, clinic, and/or classroom is presented. Three general categories of materials are included: language spoken to normal children, cross-cultural studies, and language spoken to special populations. Linguistic input is a term that refers to the special language register that parents use to address infants and young children. Typically, language directed to young children is contrasted with adult-to-adult conversation. Over 100 features of \"baby talk\" have been reported to occur cross culturally, in different socioeconomic groups and when parents address their typical children. Adults who are not parents and older children also adjust their language level when addressing infants and younger children. Bidirectional behaviors  (i.e., adult perceptions and the child's linguistic level) appear to interact to stimulate the use of baby talk. It is suggested there is a need to decipher these interactive behaviors to conclusively establish the relevance of linguistic input for the language-learning child.

        "description":"The knowledge and training of 80 bilingual elementary school teachers in the areas of Spanish language, reading skills, and reading methodology were studied. The teachers met the following criteria: they were bilingual (English and Spanish), they were licensed and currently teaching in New York City, and they had been exposed to the teaching of reading for at least 2 years in public elementary schools. It was found that the teachers had a reasonable understanding of the Spanish language in terms of philosophy, history, phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax, and they showed slightly less knowledge in Spanish reading skills. They appeared to have minimum competencies in Spanish language knowledge and Spanish reading skills and were not well prepared in Spanish reading  methodology. Self-report information generally indicated that training in Spanish reading had been inadequate. Teachers were able to partially identify skills such as word recognition, comprehension, evaluation and analysis, and the use of skills by grades and levels. Recommendations include the following: a teacher competency assessment program with a training component should be conducted, and a list of competencies for bilingual Spanish reading teachers should be developed and field tested.

        "description":"This paper describes social problems that ethnic minorities are likely to experience in the 1980s and presents guidelines for shaping educational policies and programs that will help ethnic minority youths to experience more educational equity during the remainder of the decade. The minority groups discussed are those that are heavily concentrated below the poverty level and that experience enormous social, economic, and educational problems. Educational equity is defined in terms of output variables or the effects of schooling, rather than in terms of input variables such as expenditure per pupil and school facilities. Ethnic communities are likely to continue to be characterized by both a substantial lower class and a significant middle class throughout the 1980s. However, the  rate of growth of the middle class ethnic community is likely to be slowed during much of the decade. The working class will remain a significant segment of ethnic communities. The following issues, which will continue to be important for the education of minorities throughout the 1980s, are discussed and policy issues related to them are presented: (1) teaching minority youths the basic skills; (2) teaching English to children who speak other first languages; (3) standardized testing of minority group populations; (4) minimal competency testing; (5) preschool care and educational programs; (6) private and public schools; and (7) ethnic studies programs in the nation's schools and colleges.

        "description":"This is a report of a conference held to discuss maintaining peace in outer space. Nineteen space specialists participated in the conference. Topics discussed were recent technological developments, international cooperation for peaceful uses of outer space, prevention of weapons in space, and the future role of the United Nations. The report's conclusion states that the space age is moving away from the era of spectaculars. Although manned space flights still occur, the more routine applications of space technology to earth systems have a more direct effect on our lives. Similarly, the space age has moved from an era of seemingly insurmountable technical problems to a time when human, economic, and political issues may pose the greatest impediments to space progress. Chief among  these is the lack of national will to assign high priority to managing space matters. Recommendations of the conference include the following: (1) Governments need to devote more resources to peaceful uses of space; (2) All nations need to assess their national needs and priorities regarding space; (3) Further study needs to be conducted of ways to apply advanced technology to basic needs; (4) United States-Soviet talks on antisatellite and other space weapons should be resumed; (5) Attempts should be made to reduce institutional rivalries, a problem that exists throughout the United Nations; and (6) Funding for the UN Secretariat's Outer Space Affairs Division (OSAD) should be increased.

Two hundred and twenty college and university subjects were tested, using an author written test of melodic interval identification. Melodic intervals were presented in random order by six instruments: clarinet, trumpet, piano, violin, xylophone, and synthesizer (sine waveform). Each instrument played 12 randomly assorted melodic intervals, based on C4 and not exceeding one octave.  Results showed that FETE, PPEM, and MAJOR all affected subjects' scores on intervals presented with different timbres. There was no significant interaction between PPEM and FETE. (Author/RM)",

In the first paper, \"Education against Poverty: Interpreting British and American Policies in the 1960s and the 1970s,\" by Harold Silver, the social consciousness raising period of the 1960s is examined in relation to an historical analysis of educational policy making in the United States and Great Britain. Connections between national educational systems and their historical and social contexts are described. The second paper, \"Ideology  and Educational Research,\" by Michael F. D. Young, addresses educational research as a social institution and concludes with suggested alternatives for conducting and analyzing educational research. The relationships among knowledge, power, and social class are discussed. In the third paper, \"Deference to Authority: Education in Canada and the United States,\" Edgar Z. Friedenberg presents several definitions of authority and assesses the role of schools in shaping children's thought processes.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to gain better understanding of the work of new professors. Because time is a common constraint for all, it served as the standard measuring tool for describing their work. Three questions were investigated: (1) How do new professors spend their time with respect to their job-related work? (2) Are there some kinds of work new professors believe they should spend more time doing? and (3) What insights do new professors have about their jobs and themselves in the professoriate? The sample was selected from professors who graduated from 14 high-ranked colleges of education and who were completing their first, second, or third year of teaching. Of the 475 survey forms completed and returned, 206 were from \"new professors,\" but only 191 were under  full-time contracts. Findings indicated that new professors devoted a high proportion of their job-related work to teaching, advising, and administrative matters. Given the option, they would not take on many more of these tasks. They also engaged in relatively little personal or professional development. New professors recognized this deficit in their experience, and, neither on a peer nor on a mentor level, did they cite scholarly collegiality. New professors engaged in relatively little research and scholarship, though they were keenly aware that they should be committing more time and energy to this work. Though not a direct finding of this study, a realization emerged that institutions of higher education quickly lost contact with even their most recent doctoral graduates. It was  also noted that a large percentage of doctoral graduates in education did not immediately pursue academic careers. (JD)",

The work is divided into five chapters, the first of which focuses on prejudice (racial and sexual), absence of black women as subjects in the research base, work/home/family pressures, black sports competency as &quot;natural,&quot; and other myths and realities of the involvement of women in black sports. Chapter 2 presents biographical sketches of 17 outstanding black sportswomen, detailing athletic achievements, honors and awards, career and educational experiences, affiliations, and personal statements. Chapter 3 presents solutions to the issues of sport participation disparities between blacks and whites, the problem of  prejudice, the need for consciousness raising among blacks, and the necessity for whites to be aware of and resolve their racial prejudice. Chapter 4 presents a cross-cultural study of Nigerian women in sport, an attempt to seek the African roots of black sportswomen. Chapter 5 presents two philosophically based arguments; the first, an examination of characteristics of master/slave relationships and the need to abolish such relationships. The second speculates about the positive and negative aspects of the future of black women in sports. (MJB)",

        "description":"Education research is, or should be, the systematic investigation and solution of critically important problems affecting what and how children learn. This is a complex undertaking, given the size and complexity of American education. Critically important educational problems can be dealt with by supporting a systematic, national effort to examine problems scientifically, develop and test solutions, and see to it that the final results reach those who can make use of them. However, research in education poses problems very different from those in the physical sciences. Often a good research program will develop useful curriculum materials that produce demonstrable results, only to have the socioeconomic population change drastically with the result that materials and techniques  that were designed specifically for one population simply do not work for another. Educators need to revise their expectations of what the educational system can do and admit that families, churches, neighborhoods--in fact, the entire range of factors that form an individual's environment--have a critical role to play in the total development of the young. It is important that educational research and development be linked more directly to the world of practice. There is now a strong acceptance of the proposition that the teacher, the school administrator, and even local citizens must be involved. The National Institute of Education sees such a partnership as a mandate for cooperative effort. State departments of education, local school systems, and professional associations should be  indispensable colleagues in any federal effort to improve education. (JD)",

        "description":"A study of the relationship of parent involvement to teacher education was conducted in response to increasing emphasis upon parent participation in elementary schools. To determine whether training for prospective teachers should be broadened to reflect this increase in parent participation, teacher educators, teachers, and principals were asked to give their opinions about parent involvement. A sample of 980 teacher educators, 1,500 elementary school principals, and 1,983 elementary school teachers participated in the study. Participants responded to a Parent Involvement Questionnaire, designed to ascertain attitudes toward working with parents, parent involvement in education, current practices relevant to parent involvement, opinions about whether teachers should receive  training to work with parents, and experiences which might be helpful in this type of training. A general consensus appeared among the participants regarding the desirability of having parents become more involved in education. Parents were seen as cooperative, concerned, and competent partners in the educational process. However, teachers and principals expressed a clear preference for specific types of desirable parent involvement. They strongly supported parents being more involved with helping children with school work and becoming more active in support roles for school activities. They did not favor parents becoming involved in curriculum and instruction or in administrative decision making. The consensus across all three groups seemed to be that teachers should be trained to work  with parents. There was, however, strong support for making such training elective and also for providing such training as inservice education for teachers. (JD)",

A review of literature on the topic indicated that both non-teacher-controlled factors and teacher-controlled factors were important to teaching success. A survey was conducted to collect data from teachers in 64 elementary and secondary schools that were part of the East Texas School Study Council. This survey questionnaire obtained demographic information and also contained 20 statements, 10 of which were classified as factors of the teaching situation and 10 which were classified as personal factors relating to the teacher. It was found that teachers uniformly regarded the major personal traits of knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and enthusiasm as the most important success  factors. Nine of the ten most highly rated factors were teacher-controlled. The major administrative functions of facilities provided, administrative support, school discipline, and capable administration were uniformly regarded as at least moderately important, with administrative support considered extremely important to teaching success. Situational determinants such as professional activity, luck, school of education attended, socioeconomic community, and academic talent of students were uniformly perceived as being only slightly or very slightly important to teaching success. These findings produced eight recommendations offered for school administrators, staff developers, and teacher education institutions. (JD)",

The difficulty and delta indices detected group differences in relative item difficulty. Biserial and point biserial indices detected group differences in item discrimination. The Scheuneman and three-parameter indices detected differences in relative item difficulty by score level and latent ability level, respectively. The sample group consisted of 800 fifth grade students evenly divided between black and white, male and female students, thus examining racial and sexual bias. The results indicated the item bias indices investigated were unreliable when based on sample sizes of 200 minority and 200 majority examinees. The  instability of the indices may have resulted from the fact that very few, if any, biased items are included in the ITBS. The study suggested that the use of item bias indices to screen achievement test items could not be expected to lead to consistent decisions about which items are biased with small sample sizes.

Each of 360 first and fifth grade children from schools in middle class and working class neighborhoods were interviewed using booklets illustrating classroom behavior. The results indicated that children do differentiate among domains of classroom life; their cognitions of importance and emotional responses concerning behaviors are shaped as much by consideration of consequences and external realities as they are by developmentally based changes in comprehension of reasons for these norms. Age differences in perceptions reflect less extreme judgements of goodness and badness and less intense feelings by fifth graders, even in instances where they  understand intrinsic rationales for expectations. The fact that rankings of importance and feelings did not differ by age suggests that across moral, conventional and academic domains older and younger children, in a relative sense, perceive and react similarly to the norms of classroom life. It is the degree of their evaluation and affect both that declines and becomes more consistent over time. (Author/PN)",

Technical considerations of minimum correlation, score overlap and score distribution for Model A2 and the estimation of population standard deviations on the non-normed test for Models B2 and C2 are discussed. Practical considerations include group size, grade level, type of score used and instrument sensitivity. Problems and proposed solutions are discussed. The preference for non-normed tests is shown to stem from a  perceived discrepancy in the sensitivity of tests to instructional objectives, so the task of comparing alternative implementation strategies for various models is considered. The utility constraints of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 are discussed. In the light of practical alternatives presented and seemingly insurmountable problems in Models A2, B2 and C2, it is recommended they be abandoned. (Author/CM)",

The study tried to determine if educational researchers had different perceptions of proposal writing, based upon the degree of experience in proposal development and peer review activities, as well as the sex of the respondent. The results of the study indicated the proposal development and funding perception scale had reasonable psychometric properties. The scale functioned well to assess perceptions toward the process. Many common statements regarding proposal development and the funding process were consistently identified as myths. However, a large number of statements were identified as truths. Perceptions differed according to sex and who had had  peer review panel experience. Further research into these attitudes and perceptions is recommended. (DWH)",

Five clusters of variables are consistently related to utilization: relevance, credibility, communication, information processing, and user involvement and advocacy. The communication and information processing factors were combined for this study. To relate the four remaining factors to decision-making within the context of Title I programs, Title I decision areas were identified. They include fund allocation, program adoption or change, staffing, student selection, and test selection. The generation of items for the pilot instrument was a multistage process involving Title I Technical Assistance Centers across the  country. From the several hundred items generated, a 65-item pilot instrument was developed and pilot tested. Maximum likelihood factor analysis using a subset of items revealed a set of correlated factors related to Leviton and Hughes' conceptualization. The exploratory factor analysis results were not confirmed on a second sample, but this may have been due to small sample sizes. This research indicates that the possibility of developing a scale to assess utilization potential is very real. (Author/BW)",

Of the models investigated, all but the reduced vector and product term model and the item cluster model were rejected as incapable of reasonably modelling realistic multidimensional data. The item cluster model appears to be a useful model, but its applications may be limited in scope. The reduced vector and product term model was found to  be the most capable of modelling realistic multidimensional data.

The instrument was constructed and refined, and scoring procedures were outlined. The activities comprising the CTD included defining the teaching dilemma, gathering additional facts, identifying and stating the problem, generating solutions, selecting criteria, evaluating alternative solutions, and stating the final solution. The reliability of scoring procedures was measured and one aspect of criterion-related validity was assessed in phase two. A second measure of criterion validity was taken in phase three. The results demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity estimates. After comparing CTD with the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking  Demonstrator Form (TTCTDF), it was concluded that the two instruments measured different aspects of the same abilities. The use of the CTD may provide a broader assessment of teaching performance. The abilities measured by CTD could be enhanced through training in creative problem solving. The instrument was developed to evaluate facets of competency based teacher education programs. (DWH)",

The role of adjusted site means with differences within sponsors and between sponsors and background characteristics is discussed to determine whether adjusted means are the preferred measures of model effectiveness. In a Big City Group, attrition bias in data for non-FT and FT site analysis is considered. Improvements in measurement are shown in the sampling of content and behavior, including the use of computer systems with broad content samples. These procedures can eliminate reliance on multiple choice questions and the use of classroom process data with student reports on opportunity to learn (OTL) data expanding the dimensions of  variability. A comtemporary model which crosses class type with school sites illustrates the multilevel regression analysis. Student scores are the dependent variable; and class type, sex, OTL class mean and individual math ability are the independent variables. The significant role of OTL to the stepwise fitting of the model is shown. (CM)",

Further results are discussed, including the superiority of the &quot;think word&quot;  group over subjects who presumably encountered stimuli in both forms, calling into question the redundancy hypothesis.

The second conception of ability is generally employed by young children and focusses on self-referenced comparisons of performance. High ability is inferred from learning or higher performance than previously displayed. It is proposed that adults use both conceptions of ability. Different situational factors are predicted to promote the adoption of one conception rather than the other leading to different cognitive and affective interpretations of performance. Three  studies were conducted to investigate these hypotheses. The results demonstrate that adults generally employ the more differentiated conception of ability and that competitive conditions may foster the more differentiated conception while an intrinsic task interest tends to promote adoption of the less differentiated conception of ability. Finally, when the more differentiated conception was adopted, students anticipated less satisfaction with learning if performance was not superior to all competitors or if effort was higher than others.

Two days later, all subjects, including an additional control group (n=44) who had neither read nor studied the material, completed a multiple-choice test on the passage. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance indicated that both study procedures were successful, but that the two groups differed on specific types of information learned. A single discriminant function was found to  separate the two study groups. Vocabulary rehearsal led to the learning of greater amounts of subordinate level information, while graphic post-organizer usage led to the learning of more superordinate information.

Two other sources of performance variation are possible: the U-shaped learning curve or phenomenon of apparent regression during new skills acquisition and performance strategies; and the ill-defined nature of the writing task which allows the student writer to determine to a large extent the difficulty level of the writing attempt regardless of the testers' intention. A discourse typology was developed for identifying the kind of task the writer sets himself or herself. Abstract to concrete discourse functions; varied time focuses; and discourse narration,  description, or commentary are all relevant dimensions within the chronology of the acquisition and development of text design strategies. These strategies can be pre-schema, open-schema, or closed-schema. Task construction should be taken into account when assessing growth or development of writing skills. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Techniques for maximizing discrimination between groups in norm referenced measurement to reflect sensitivity to group differences inherent in the evaluation of multilevel educational systems are discussed. Data from the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (BTES) were used to examine relationships between reading and mathematics achievement and instructional variables. Intraclass correlation, correlations of class means on items and on total scale, and correlations of class means on items and on alloted time in instruction were used as item selection techniques to form subscales of the fraction test of the BTES. By constructing the subscales on the basis of the between-class relationship of the items to instruction, the sensitivity of the scale to between-class differences in  instruction was found to increase and the sensitivity to the same two variables within class decreased. These results indicate the usefulness of selecting items on the basis of their relationship to the variable of interest. (Author/CM)",

The interpretations teachers make of students' classroom behavior was the aspect of teacher cognition discussed. One study took place in southern California while the other was done in west central France. The participation of &quot;problem&quot; and &quot;non-problem&quot; students during ordinary lessons was videotaped. In American classrooms, &quot;problem&quot; students were children whom teachers had previously referred to the district as candidates for special education. In French classrooms, &quot;problem&quot; students were those who would be required to repeat a grade, students whom teachers would refer to special education classes, or those who were promoted only with strong reservations. The preliminary results indicated categories  teachers use in judging students are not bound by considerations specific to local classrooms or cultures. Teachers' interpretations of individual students' behaviors are tailored to the child and the specific situation in which the interpretation takes place. There was a discrepancy between the perceptions of teachers viewing videotaped sequences of classroom behavior and those of an independent panel of judges. (DWH)",

        "description":"Effects of student grouping on academic achievement were examined in research among high school students in Israeli kibbutz schools, and in a nationwide sample of middle school students in Israel. Data analysis was based on a model developed from research findings in the United States, Sweden, Great Britain, and Israel. The treatment variable was conceptualized as the quality of the socio-learning environment (SLE) resulting from segregating students with different levels of personal learning resources, scholastic ability, and motivation, in homogeneous classes of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; ability, or in heterogeneous classes. In the kibbutz sample, no learning advantage was found in homogeneous classes. A slight advantage was observed in heterogeneity, concentrated mainly in the lower  half of the class distribution. In the middle school sample, the class intellective composition (measured by class mean achievement on objective tests) emerged as the central factor in SLE quality, while ethnic and socioeconomic factors were weak determinants. A positive effect of SLE on objective academic achievements was indicated. In both samples, the loss of the &quot;lows&quot; under segregation was greater than the gain of the &quot;highs,&quot; while under heterogeneity, the loss of the &quot;highs&quot; was smaller than the gain of the &quot;lows.&quot; Effects of motivation factors on SLE effects were also investigated.

        "description":"Statistics indicate that between 1977 and 1981, the number of graduate degrees in engineering awarded to members of minority groups in the United States constituted only 2.3 percent of the total number of master's and doctorate degrees awarded in the field over that period. A major reason for the relatively small number of minorities with advanced engineering degrees is the widely-held assumption that there are no barriers to minority access to graduate programs. In fact, when minority students assess their chances for success in graduate school, they confront such barriers as 1) the difficulty of locating supportive campus communities; 2) the difficulty of being admitted to the school of one's choice, considering the subjectivity of the admissions process; 3) the paucity of  financial assistance grants for minority graduate students; and 4) problems of strained student-adviser relationships, often due to conflicting cultural backgrounds. Such barriers to access must be removed by intensifying minority recruitment efforts into graduate engineering programs; restructuring the admissions process and reformulating admissions criteria; insuring that minorities are aware of and can compete for the full range of financial resources available; and creating academic milieus conducive to fully developing minority graduate students' academic potentials.

The study sought to provide a qualitative account that would allow identifying what factors make for school success. Positive community perceptions of the school and data on student achievement served as indicators of school effectiveness. The study involved interviews and detailed observations to describe the community, community/parent cooperation, school history, administration, personal interactions, and school/classroom activities. Special focus was directed at observing classes of high and of low achievers handled by Mrs. Gray, a teacher who was considered extremely effective, and whose high achieving pupils had demonstrated  writing test scores that were equivalent to scores of comparable pupils in one of the richest communities in the United States. From the study, some factors believed to influence school success were identified: strong leadership; high expectations; emphasis on reading, writing, phonics, and spelling; careful evaluation; and parent involvement. It was suggested that Mrs. Gray's effectiveness as a teacher was due to her strong leadership; organizational and monitoring skills; ability to make students aware of lesson objectives; use of positive reinforcement; and democratic classroom practices.

In 1981, the project sought to develop, test, and produce a model and set of guidelines for more effective inservice teacher education in desegregated schools. The goal, design, and methodology (including information collection procedures) of the project are described, and a list of implications (in a summarized format) follow each of these major findings: (1) desegregation increases achievement gains and positive self concepts of minority students and positive racial attitudes among all students; (2) desegregation is most effectively accomplished when it is publicly affirmed; (3) student improvement is promoted when children are supported by staff  and accepted by peers; (4) relatively few educators have received cross-cultural training; (5) appropriate racial-relations training positively affects desegregation outcomes; (6) needs assessment is important for the planning and evaluation of inservice training; (7) broadly based collaborative planning and decision making improve inservice education; (8) school districts should have clearly defined budgets that realistically reflect the resources and funds needed for inservice education; and (9) rigorous and ongoing evaluation improves the effectiveness of inservice training. Appended to this report are the results of a pilot evaluation of the WIEDS model and guidelines; a detailed report on the WIEDS project; and an annotated list of resources on desegregation, multicultural education,  and inservice training.

        "description":"In these remarks, William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, Department of Justice, discusses American civil rights in the light of past and present Federal policy. A review of constitutional provisions, legislation, and court litigation reveals how policy has variously provided for equality and perpetuated racial discrimination in different social sectors. Mr. Reynolds emphasizes that twice before, the United States has almost achieved a racially-neutral, discrimination-free society, only to revert to sanctioning race as a criterion for regulating rights and allocating opportunities. In the 1970s, it is suggested, the overwhelming concern with racial balance over racial neutrality and the concomitant emphasis on mandatory busing, quotas,  and other race-conscious affirmative action techniques, have fostered divisiveness and brought the nation to another civil rights crossroads. Within this climate, Mr. Reynolds emphasizes, the Reagan administration commits itself to a policy of race neutrality rather than race-conscious affirmative action, and accordingly supports voluntary desegregation, injunctive relief mandating racially-neutral employment decisions, and enhanced recruitment efforts to attract qualified minorities into the labor force.

Research findings point out the major problems stemming from the inadequacies of each of these social, political, and educational structures in providing the climate necessary for the advancement of black colleges and universities. The problems include an inadequate research base on issues of concern to blacks; black underrepresentation in significant decision-making processes; social and political barriers to black advancement  (such as institutionalized racism, low black economic status, and intellectual conservatism); lack of effective higher education planning; and limited monitoring and evaluation relevant to black higher education.

        "description":"A project was undertaken to develop a continuous, competency-based line of vocational training in business and office education programs at the secondary and postsecondary levels that would prepare students for entry-level employment in business and office occupations. To accomplish this goal representatives from 15 South Carolina high schools--2 secondary level vocational centers, the school district of Greenville County, South Carolina, and secretarial science department instructors from the postsecondary level program of Greenville Technical College--met in task force committee meetings and workshops to coordinate similar secondary and postsecondary programs and to laterally articulate similar programs at the secondary level. After identifying major objectives for job  competency and performances to obtain the objectives, task force members developed criterion-referenced measures of competence as a guide for articulating the various programs. Also developed during the project was an articulated, performance-based instruction objectives guide for business and office education. Included in the guide were learning modules in the following subject areas: typewriting, shorthand, accounting, office procedures, and business English. (MN)",

An introduction gives an overview of the workshop and describes the contents of the report. Section 1 discusses the general need for research in the area and suggests ways to facilitate the research needed and to stimulate interaction between scientists and simulation researchers. Section 2 describes some technical problems in more detail and gives a few examples of applying research strategies to these problems. Five appendix papers provide examples of research strategies. Primary emphasis is given to low-level flight, in which extraction  of visual information from terrain features is crucial but little understood. Values and pitfalls are described of these strategies for exploring which visual features should be used in low-level flight: systematic condensation of opinions, particularly of pilots (appendix A); geometric analysis of terrain information potentially usable (B); and psychophysical analysis of visual processing modalities (C and D). Appendix E examines equipment requirements for display of visual information. Appendix F lists workshop topics and participants. (YLB)",

The training was conducted under three instructional conditions, two of which employed the simulator's &quot;freeze&quot; feature. Additionally, two methods of defining errors for carrier glideslope tracking were examined. These experimental training techniques were compared to a conventional training approach in which no &quot;freezes&quot; were imposed during the training sequence. While pilots who were trained under the &quot;freeze&quot; condition developed control strategies that distinguished them from pilots trained by conventional measures, no differences were found between these groups on rate or extent of learning. In response to a post-experimental  questionnaire, pilots who were trained under &quot;freeze&quot; conditions indicated that the simulator &quot;freeze&quot; was &quot;frustrating&quot; and added to the overall difficulty of the task. These pilots further reported being more motivated to avoid the &quot;freeze&quot; than to perform the task correctly during training. A probe technique was used to examine differential transfer in lieu of the more traditional transfer-of-training technique. Although this experimental use of the probe technique was a preliminary effort, it does appear to hold promise for transfer-of-training experiments of this type. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"In preparation for the scheduled expiration of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) legislation at the end of fiscal year 1982, background information was gathered to analyze the effects of CETA training on participants' post-program earnings. An analysis was made of information gathered on persons over 24-years-old who entered a CETA program between January 1975 and June 1976 (the most recent group for which appropriate data were available) and of a comparison group of low-income persons who were not in a CETA training program. The findings suggest the following conclusions: (1) Training increased the average future earnings of female participants substantially (an average gain of between $800 and $1,300 annually). This was probably because CETA training programs  increased hours worked more than wage rates and because female participants had less past employment experience than male participants; (2) Training did not seem to affect the average future earnings of male participants. This was probably because men had previously been employed more than women and there was little effect on their wage rates; and (3) Both male and female participants with the least past employment experience had the largest earning gains after training. It was suggested that future job-training legislation consider different means for addressing the employment problems of persons with little previous employment experience and of persons with previous employment experience but chronically low earnings.

        "description":"Of the currently unemployed workforce, a portion (100,000 to 2.1 million) can be termed dislocated workers. Even as the economy recovers from the current recession, these involuntarily unemployed workers will face serious problems finding new jobs because of structural changes in the economy. Current unemployment and training programs often do not address the needs of dislocated workers, either because of limits on the scope of their services or because the programs are targeted to disadvantaged persons. In light of these problems, the United States Congress will have to determine whether to provide special aid for dislocated workers. Eligibility for the aid could be defined in terms of one or many of the traits of dislocated workers, including displacement in a declining  industry, displacement in a declining occupation, residence in a declining geographic area, length of previous job tenure, age at the time of severance, and duration of joblessness. Another approach might be to limit assistance to workers dislocated because of plant closings. Approaches to aid for dislocated workers could include job search assistance, skill traininq and other education, relocation assistance, income replacement, or some combination of these options. These issues and problems will have to be considered by Congress in the near future as the end of the recession spotlights the unemployment problems of a changing economy. (KC)",

        "description":"Interest in encouraging linkages between economic development efforts of various federal agencies with the job development and training activities of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) led, in 1979, to the development of an interagency effort, the Employment Initiatives Program, and the signing of six interagency agreements with the Department of Labor. Current legislation permits but does not require such linkages. This paper reviews the statutory authorizations for linking economic development activities with employment and training programs under the CETA Amendments of 1978, together with the federal regulations implementing the Act issued in the Federal Register of May 20, 1980. It also reviews the authorizations for economic development contained in the  Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, the United States Housing and Economic Development Act of 1976, the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1976, the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972, and the Revenue Act of 1978. Some examples of local collaboration between CETA and other federal programs are included to illustrate practical applications, while a review of the bilateral ageements between the Department and other federal agencies is also included. The documents spelling out the agreements are contained in the report's appendixes. (KC)",

        "description":"This project explored influences of the service delivery system on the distribution, especially the rural-urban distribution, of mental health practitioners in public settings. Research was planned as a two-phase pilot study--an ethnographic phase (open-ended interviews and day-long observations at 14 mental health agencies) and a survey phase (two-part questionnaire sent to 90 facilities, one part on staffing patterns and another filled out by staff members). With few exceptions, all retention rates appeared high with no clear differences for rural and urban facilities. Urban facilities fared better at filling position vacancies. Rural and urban centers were found to differ from each other and from state psychiatric hospitals in the ways they organized staff and in patterns of  utilization. Differences between rural and urban hospitals and between hospitals and mental health centers were also investigated. Standards for job performance and success differed across the facilities. Both rural and urban &quot;successful&quot; centers were found to share a well-defined and clear-operating system of organization and strong community support. (Issues and ideas for mental health program administration are discussed. Suggestions are also made for training of mental health professionals for rural versus urban practice. Instruments are appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A wide range of evidence was gathered to determine the interrelationship between participation in secondary vocational education, basic skills (reading, writing, and arithmetic), attainment, and gainful employment. Sources of data included research on basic skills needed in jobs, two national longitudinal data sets, previous studies, and test scores for a wide variety of predominantly white students over several years. Findings were that (1) basic skills are important for a wide range of occupations, but it is impossible to determine the exact level of basic skills that are functionally required for specific occupations; (2) the basic skills attainments of those participating in general and in vocational secondary programs appear to be similar; (3) graduation from secondary  vocational education programs as opposed to general high school programs does appear, in at least some cases, to be associated with employment advantages; and (4) basic skills attainments as reflected in standardized test scores do not appear to be strongly related to employment success, once years of schooling are controlled for as a variable. The study concluded that secondary vocational education can yield employment advantages without giving clearcut advantages to its graduates in terms of basic skills attainment. (KC)",

        "description":"The major vocational education research needs in North Carolina in the 1980s should represent the major research areas in other states. Research issues will fall into four major areas: policy, planning, finance, and citizen participation. If no appropriate state policy on vocational education is in place, an appropriate one must be established and an organizational arrangement to implement it must be developed. A review of the planning process should address three fundamental questions: (1) What is needed to establish a better method for job forecasting? (2) What is required to assure effective teachers and appropriate curriculum guides? and (3) Does planning focus on the student? Finance inquiry should investigate a basic funding formula to sustain programs in the future and a&quot;weighted formula&quot; to service the disadvantaged and the handicapped. Aspects of citizenship participation that need study are citizen views of the effectiveness of vocational education and advisory councils. For any research efforts to have appreciable impact on a state's educational policy, the state must have a commitment to research, and previous research should have been used to improve programs.

Usable returns of the survey questionnaire were received from 148 local units (1,968 twelfth-grade student members and 159 teacher advisors). Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, least square means, and content theme analysis procedures. Student-members and teacher advisors perceived VSOs as  meeting goals judged common to all organizations. Student members did not perceive all VSOs individually as meeting all goals common to every organization. VSO activities were perceived as congruent with interests of a majority of members. Following the 18-page narrative are these appendixes: participants, VSO goals and objectives, project procedures, a reference list, l0 questionnaires (a different one for students, members and teachers and for the five VSOs), and a glossary.

        "description":"A four-phased project developed an impact assessment system for vocational education research and development personnel to indicate whether the resources spent for funded projects improved the programs identified by the research and development system. During Phase I, procedures were identified and developed for complying with the impact requirement of Public Law 94-482. A major activity focused on analyzing two programs of related research and development projects using a case study approach. These case study efforts were continued during Phase II. Other activities included two other case studies, a field study, and development of a model for an impact assessment system. Phase III activities reviewed, further conceptualized and refined the system proposed in Phase II. The impact  assessment system was refined and completed for subsequent operation in Phase IV. Recommendations were made based on the refined impact assessment system, including system implementation and changes in statements of impact. Following an 11-page narrative, a paper, &quot;A Review and Analysis of Fiscal Year 1982 Continuation Proposals' Statements of Impact,&quot; is appended. It describes a study to determine whether changes in guidelines for submitting proposals were effective in helping proposal writers improve statements of impact. (YLB)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to develop and compare two vocational education programs--a bilingual instructional model and an English core language instructional model--for limited English proficient (LEP) students in vocational education at Waubonsee Community College (Illinois). During the project, information and referral services and support services to more than 100 LEP students were provided; inservice workshops concerning the problems of LEP students were presented for Waubonsee personnel and the community; and inservice and preservice training for planning and implementing vocational training for LEP students were offered to administrators and vocational and language instructors in Illinois. The major accomplishments of the LEP project were in the areas of materials  development. Instructional materials for students and instructors in machine shop fundamentals and a secretarial science instructor's manual in vocational English as a second language were developed. A comparison of the bilingual and non-bilingual English core language instructional models were implemented during the project. The project demonstrated that with support services, courses in vocational English as a second language and appropriate English core vocational curricula and materials both helped limited English proficient students succeed. The project concluded that a high priority be placed on English language skills in all vocational courses. The materials developed by the project are expected to be used by more than 150 community colleges. (KC)",

Each project description covers some or all of these areas: context, the educational system, and demonstration project activities, including goals and objectives, project advisory committees, recruitment of volunteers, results, and impact. The final section of the report presents these conclusions based on the demonstration activities: volunteers can be of assistance to vocational education; 12 months was too brief  a time period to achieve all that was expected; development of realistic goals and objectives represented a potential problem area; and none of the demonstration sites were adequately prepared or overly interested in conducting a thorough evaluation of their accomplishments.

To identify and evaluate those career information resources that are currently available to secondary school students, researchers analyzed questionnaires completed by representatives from 1,894 schools and 4,883 students. They found that bound references, school-arranged experiences, and occupational kits and briefs are the most common resources. Much less common are computerized systems. Survey responses indicated that most schools offer a wide variety of career information resources. However, a study of the quality of available resources suggests that most students rely not on formal resources provided in schools  but rather on informal sources such as parents, friends, and television. Also, fewer than one-third of the students surveyed thought that the resources provided by their schools were sufficient. Consequently, recommendations were made for correcting deficiencies, providing linkages, and improving computer-based systems. (MN)",

Twelve schools representing six different types of delivery systems and two levels of poverty comprised the study sample. Evaluated during the study were computer-based, experience-based, materials-based, instruction-based, publications-based, and minimal-resource delivery systems. A special instrument was designed and administered to over 100 students in each school, and interviews were conducted with from 11 to 19 students in each school. The major finding of the study was that there were no clearly discernable effects attributable to the resources available at the schools. There were  also no effects attributable to the poverty level of the schools. Various recommendations were made to encourage students to use appropriate resources more frequently and effectively than they do now. Among these were calls to establish a curriculum for career decision making, to use experiential materials and programs, to improve resources for educational planning, to test materials on samples of students, and to improve computer systems.

An additional 483 men assigned to a ship not scheduled for integration completed the questionnaire for control purposes. Results showed that the majority of men believed integration would improve crew morale, but would have a negative impact on discipline and would increase interpersonal conflict. Lower ranking men favored integration, although they held the most traditional attitudes toward the roles of women and expected women to receive preferential treatment in job assignments, physically demanding work, and disciplinary action. Men  working in departments where women are rarely found held traditional attitudes toward women's roles and were pessimistic about integration. The women were most concerned with profanity, success in their jobs, and resentment from men. (KC)",

It is divided into four sections. Section 1 presents an introduction to the concept of impact, dissemination, and the impact assessment design. In section 2 are presented three designs for assessing impact: one for assessing the short term impact of research and development projects, the second for assessing the long-term impact of research and development projects, and the third for assessing program impact. For each design, these areas are described: purpose, scope, key questions, information sources and methods of collecting, procedure, audience of results, format of result reporting, and  management plan. Section 3 describes roles and responsibilities of the Illinois Research and Development Section staff and the independent impact assessor(s). It also describes alternatives for who might assume the role of the independent impact assessor. Section 4 provides possible uses of short term and long term impact assessment data and is organized by the questions identified in the impact assessment design. Appendixes include alternative approaches to the establishment of research and development programs and a sample program specific impact survey. (YLB)",

Cooperative arrangements are considered at different economic levels, and 65 cases are discussed. The first of 10 chapters sets up a conceptual framework for the review of American experience in cooperation. Chapter 2 deals with national committees and commissions set up during and since World War I, with labor, business, and public representatives, to advise the president and Congress on major policy issues. In chapter 3 the focus is on industry-level joint labor-management committees for five industries--steel, construction, retail food, railroads, and men's clothing. Chapter 4 describes 6 of 28 functioning community-wide labor-management  committees. Chapters 5-8 concern cooperation at the company/intracompany level, including an historical perspective, joint programs aimed at improvement of company performance, programs oriented primarily toward employee welfare, and incentive programs (monetary and monetary supplements). In chapter 9 labor-management cooperation in public agencies (government) is examined. Chapter 10 looks to the future of labor-management cooperation. Appendixes include 28 documents relating to labor-management cooperation and a directory of major organizations assisting labor-management cooperative programs. (YLB)",

        "description":"According to the 1980 census, one in every nine Americans is over the age of 65. The segment of the population made up of individuals over the age of 65 continues to grow faster than that comprised of individuals under the age of 65. While older people continue to have about half the income of their younger counterparts, the elderly tend to have more health problems and health care costs. Among the other problems that affect the elderly more than the remainder of the population are housing, mobility, and transportation problems. Analysis of data pertaining to living arrangements indicates that while 83 percent of older men lived in a family setting, only 57 percent of older women did so. In addition, increasing numbers of older people now live in nonmetropolitan areas. While  older adults comprised 15 percent of the voting age population, they cast 16 percent of all votes. Also revealed by the 1980 census was a sharp decrease in labor force participation rates with increasing age. If Census Bureau projections are accurate, there will be an increasing burden on the middle, more productive-aged population under reasonable economic and labor force assumptions. (MN)",

        "description":"Since the population of 17-to-21-year-old males, the traditional source for military recruitment, will decline sharply during the 1980s, consideration is being given to recruiting males aged 23-29. A national survey was conducted to assess the interest of 23-to-29-year-old men in joining the military under present conditions and with monetary (bonuses, educational incentives, lateral entry pay) and nonmonetary (training, job, location, guarantees, contract length options) incentives. A variation of random digit dialing was used to locate males in the sample age group not currently in the military; telephone numbers were drawn so that listings for each state were proportional to state population; and interviewing was terminated when approximately 4,000 interviews were obtained.  Results of the survey showed that 12.7 percent of the respondents indicated they were definitely or probably planning to join the military, with the Air Force the most preferred service. Persons planning to join the military most commonly listed training, gaining new skills/experience, patriotism, and economic factors as motivating factors. Persons not interested in joining the military noted already having families and jobs as deterrents. The survey also showed that training and locational guarantees, educational benefits, and lateral entry pay were powerful incentives. It was concluded that marketing/advertising strategies need to be developed to recruit men of the 23-29 age group into the military service. (KC)",

Two experimental job development investigations were used, one with large firms and one with small firms, to examine the effect of varying channels or modes of communication and contact persons in the organization on job development outcomes. Large firms (50 or more employees) were selected from an Arkansas mailing list at random and assigned to one of four conditions that varied in the channel or mode of contact (face-to-face versus mail) and receiver (owner/manager versus personnel manager). Small firms were selected at random from a Chamber of Commerce directory  for Northwestern Arkansas and tested on the effects of different channels or modes of contact--the mail approach versus a mail and telephone procedure. The study found that procedures do exist to improve the return rate for job development mail surveys, e.g. send an influential appeal letter stressing agency credibility, agency status, and potential incentives for the employer, along with a one-page survey that is easy to complete with a stamped, self-addressed envelope. For large businesses with personnel managers, a combination of mail and telephone contacts with the owner/manager and personnel manager or mail, phone, and face-to-face contacts with the personnel manager are promising variations.

        "description":"The ICD Research Utilization Laboratory (ICD-RUL) at the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. acted as a facilitator for improving management practices of supervisors of vocationally impaired populations. Over a 10-year span, ICD-RUL developed two National Information Centers for disabled public assistance recipients and program evaluation; innovative service delivery models; and responses to national utilization needs within the areas of its proficiencies. Activities included the collection of manuals and newsletters, monographs, and responses to issues raised by federal and state agency personnel and their support facilities. Training seminars in vocational rehabilitation and on implementation of service delivery models were conducted.  During the latter part of its 10th year, ICD-RUL contributed input on knowledge dissemination for the Long-Range Research Priorities Plan (1980) of the National Institute of Handicapped Research. Recommendations stemming from the project include the following: (1) a viable national utilization network should be established to offer more resources to rehabilitation personnel; (2) change agents in an RUL can quickly fill information or procedural gaps; (3) training seminars should be built into the funding of an RUL to ensure wider use of information; and (4) a utilization unit should offer options to its users, not solutions, with users having the final choice of what best fits their programs.

        "description":"A study projected employment needs created by growth and employee turnover for the nuclear power industry over the next decade. Only employment by electric utilities in the commercial generation of nuclear power was investigated. Employment data for 1981 were collected in a survey of 60 member utilities of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. The data were analyzed statistically to identify factors accounting for variations in power plant staffing and the number of off-site nuclear support personnel employed by a utility. Total employment in the nuclear power industry was predicted to increase from 54,400 in 1981 to 73,600 in 1991. Due to replacements, 36,300 additional employees would also be needed. As more power plants progress from design and engineering, through  construction, and into full operation, more on-site employees will be needed. Megawatt capacity, number of reactor units, operation status, and projected completion dates for units under construction were identified as factors influencing the number of employees at a power plant site. Number of off-site personnel was influenced by total megawatt capacity in operation, total megawatt capacity under construction, projected completion dates for units under construction, and whether or not the utility industry does its own architect-engineering work. (Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include questionnaires, technical notes, and utility-projected 1991 employment.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A follow-up study was conducted to investigate the long-term impact of using nearly $8 million of vocational education special-project funds in California community colleges. The study did not evaluate the projects themselves but assessed what had occurred afterward as a result of the funding. That is, the project identified and described program improvements brought about by changes or modification in college policies, administrative practices, instructional programs, and student outcomes that might be attributed to the special projects. Research activities included a review of project files from the Chancellor's Office and the State Department of Education; telephone and in-person interviews with representatives of the projects; a sample survey of project beneficiaries; and  consultant-assisted site visits to a representative sample of the projects. Findings showed that about half of the money spent by the Chancellor's Office during 1977-79 was claimed by projects that have had a significant long-term impact in California community colleges. These were project services or programs initiated with vocational education project funds that had been continued at the institutions where they were implemented; personnel training activities that had contributed to the improvement of vocational education and related services at participants' colleges; and products and services that had been used by intended beneficiaries statewide. In addition, about one-fourth of the funds were used by projects where the long-term benefits were only marginal. The remaining funds were  claimed by projects for which no evidence of lasting impact was found, although they may have had an impact while they were in operation. Issues were identified and recommendations were made for more efficient use of funds for similar projects in the future. (KC)",

        "description":"This document is a transcript of the eighth hearing of the United States House Committee on Veterans Affairs covering plans for a new GI education program for the all-volunteer military (development of House Resolution 1400). Testimony was given by U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter, Representative Robert W. Edgar (subcommittee chairman), and representatives of the military services, especially recruiters, career counselors, and veterans' affairs specialists. All testimony centered on the desirability of enactment of a new GI bill, both for recruitment of qualified applicants and for retention of current enlistees. Persons testifying noted that although recruiting numbers are presently up, the probable cause for this is the state of the economy, especially high unemployment. When  these conditions are corrected, the witnesses said, the GI Bill would become a very strong recruiting and retention tool for the volunteer military. The witnesses also noted that there is presently some inequity in how bonuses for enlistment are paid, depending on the re-enlistee's possession of critical skills. They stated that educational benefits should be accrued across the board, available for everyone who has served in the military. Witnesses also said there is a necessity to extend the expiration date for the Vietnam Veterans' education bonus bill so that these veterans do not have to choose between leaving the service and losing their educational benefits.

        "description":"This document is a transcript of a Congressional hearing on the economic status of women held by the Joint Economic Committee on February 3, 1982. Witnesses who testified at the hearing included Representatives Reuss, Richmond, Heckler, Wylie and Schroeder, Senators Jepsen and Kassenbaum, and a number of women active in women's equality programs. Witnesses focused their discussions largely on two of the problems that confront women today: the inequities faced by women in the labor market and the inability of low-income women to escape poverty and dependence on welfare. Witnesses testified that women's progress in the labor market has been slow, with more than two-thirds of women earning less than $10,000 per year; even for college graduate women, the median was only about 60  percent of the median wage for men. These gaps cannot be explained by differences in skills or productivity, said the witnesses, but have much more to do with occupational patterns, the concentration of women in clerical service and other low-wage jobs and the inability of women living in poverty to find regular employment, even at low wages. Witnesses at the hearing also protested the Reagan administration's proposals for cuts in government programs, which would hit hardest at women and their children: for example, cuts in welfare benefits for women who cannot find any kind of work, and cuts in day-care funding that would make it impossible for mothers of children to work. Reforms were also proposed in the Internal Revenue code to change the income tax filing requirements relating to  returns of married couples, and a women's bill of rights was introduced. (KC)",

        "author":["Bell, Sharon E."],
        "description":"Employment and professional activities of recent science and engineering graduates who described their work as energy-related were examined. The survey included graduates who received bachelor's or master's degrees between 1972 and 1979 and was conducted in 1976, 1978, 1979, and 1980. Data indicated that the number of graduates who reported working in energy-related activities grew by 70 percent from 33,000 to 56,000 between 1976 and 1980. This growth was concentrated in business and industry, with one-half or more of the engineers citing work activities that were &quot;production-oriented.&quot; Nearly one-third of the scientists cited exploration as their major activity. Almost half of the new scientists and engineers cited petroleum or natural gas as the focus of their professional  work. In 1979 and 1980, coal-related industries employed one-fifth of the energy-related scientists and engineers. A shift from oil and natural gas toward coal and nuclear power could increase employment in this industry. Opportunities for nuclear engineers should continue to grow as new plants are brought on line. In 1979 and 1980, approximately one-sixth of the graduates devoted their time to solar and renewable energy sources. As federal funding is cut, the graduates might move to other projects. Following the 22-page narrative section, appendixes provide the nature and conduct of the survey discussed in the report and detailed results. Following this are 130 pages of tables. (YLB)",

After some follow-up, 42 completed questionnaires were returned. Analysis of data obtained from the survey revealed that, on the whole, DOE contractor tuition-aid programs were quite similar to corresponding private industry programs. Both types of programs had similar requirements, allowed similar expenses, and operated comparable costs.

The first section, \"Adult Education for the Physically Handicapped,\" discusses mobility barriers, attitudinal barriers, and some information sources of ideas for specialized programming. The next section, \"Adult Education for the Blind,\" covers special services required in providing education for this population;  also described are some existing types of programming for the blind that can be incorporated into an educational program. \"Adult Education for the Deaf\" discusses the deaf population, social aspects of deafness, educational problems relating to this population, and exemplary programs currently serving its educational needs. The final section, \"Adult Education for the Mentally Retarded,\" presents a definition and categories of mental retardation, discusses educational characteristics and problems of this group, and cites some program techniques that have been successful and some information resources helpful in this area. The document concludes with an appendix of agencies that provide information and services to the handicapped, and a reference section for gathering more information.  (DTT)",

        "author":["Mocker, Donald W.",

        "description":"A model is presented to help clarify the concept of lifelong learning. Constructed on the idea that an operational definition of lifelong learning should be based on the locus of control for making decisions about the goals and means of learning, the model is a two-by-two matrix of learner and institution that represents four identified situations of learning: formal (learners have little control over the objectives or means of learning); nonformal (learners control the objectives but not the means of learning); informal (learners control the means but not the objectives of learning); and self-directed (learners control both the objectives and means of learning). The model is interpreted as demonstrating how all planned or deliberate learning is located along a continuum; the  concept of control provides the basis for classifying the various types of lifelong learning. From the model the authors also suggest that lifelong learning is neither the domain of a particular age group nor a single program or piece of legislation; it is a composite of many programs, pieces of legislation, and learner-initiated activities. To further clarify the model, expansions (based on research) of formal, nonformal, and informal learning are provided. Then, using the established model, an in-depth examination is made of the ultimate state of learner autonomy: self-directed learning. Included in the discussion is a review of previous research and a look at current research and trends. A list of references concludes the paper. (CT)",

The first paper, by Jennifer Warlick, presents a review of past federal policies on retirement and a discussion of proposed policy changes. Richard Burkhauser, in the second paper, focuses on the effect of retirement policies on labor force participation and labor supply behavior; recommendations of three presidential commissions on work-related issues are discussed. The third paper, by Tabitha Doescher and John Turner, analyzes job choice and the effect of pension policies on occupational mobility. In the last paper Alan Sheppard discusses the need for vocational educators to  design effective programs to support and retrain the elderly during this period of transition. Finally, conclusions drawn from the four papers are presented: (1) federal policies affecting the elderly have never been coordinated and program goals never specified; (2) business and government policies penalize older people who want to work; and (3) policies have generally overlooked vocational education as an important support for the elderly.

In the first section, the emergence and growth of quality circles in Japan and the United States are traced. Next, the theoretical and conceptual bases of quality circles are examined, while section 3 looks at implementation in detail. Discussed are the goals of circles; steps in implementation; the principles of operation, organization, and staffing; the operation of quality circles; and the evaluation of benefits of quality circles. The fourth section describes the extent and types of quality circle training that can be delivered. It is followed by a discussion of quality circles and implications for training, giving an overview of who is trained, what kind  of training is received, what kinds of considerations are made in designing and conducting training, and the outcomes or end results of the training process. A final section considers some unresolved issues relative to the concept and practice of quality circle training. Essentially, basic problems and needs are named in the areas of management/supervision, research, and education. Appended materials include abstracts of circle activities in various companies around the country, a case study, and results of a survey of several companies' involvement with quality circles. (CT)",

Following an introduction, by Juliet V. Miller, that both summarizes each of the papers and synthesizes the information presented, the first paper, by Christopher J.

Discussed are the way changes are affecting the world of work and, subsequently, educational content and delivery. The second paper, \"Recent Developments in Telecommunications Technology,\" by Frank W. Norwood, reviews developments that will lead to the home becoming a telecommunications center with the  capability of delivering a wide variety of knowledge and instruction. Next, Jo Ann Harris-Bowlsbey, in \"Educational Applications of Communications Technology,\" addresses three questions: (1) How can educators be trained to use communications technologies? (2) How can computers assist individuals in career decision making? and (3) How can computers be used to support instruction? The final paper, by Katy Brown Greenwood, focuses on the need for and process of developing a philosophy to guide the use of communications technology in vocational education.

        "description":"Aimed principally at educational professionals--teachers; counselors; administrators; and vocational, career, and adult educators--this monograph provides a framework for considering leisure as an integral part of life planning. The introduction, based largely on a literature review, presents historical perspectives on leisure, discusses its relationship to human development, and provides some theoretical perceptions and definitions; the chapter concludes with &quot;A Proposal for Leisure and Life Planning,&quot; which provides a rationale for discussing leisure in six life stages. Each of these stages is discussed in a chapter of its own, which indicates the most positive features of leisure at that stage and how various institutions can assist a person in taking advantage of the  opportunities of that stage. The stages considered are (1) childhood, the awareness stage; (2) adolescence, the exploration stage; (3) young adulthood, the preparation stage; (4) adulthood, the implementation stage; (5) midlife, the involvement and reassessment stage; and (6) retirement, the reawareness and re-exploration stage. Following the six life-stage chapters, a summary presents 10 needs having educational implications for integrating leisure with life planning. Provided in two appendixes are, respectively, examples demonstrating innovative approaches to leisure and a charter of leisure. A list of references concludes the document. (DTT)",

Following an introduction that briefly discusses the guidebook's purposes, the state of career development programs in the work place, and uses of the guide, the nine tasks are discussed in two main sections. Part 1, Leadership Tasks, covers three initial objectives: determining organizational readiness and commitment and presenting a program proposal effectively; building a team to assist in planning and work once organizational approval has been granted; and staffing the program with qualified personnel in carefully defined positions. Part 2 focuses on six program development tasks: assessing internal and external resources; assessing the career development needs of both the  organization and the employees; defining program goals based on the needs assessment; designing the program from successful models and derived strategies; implementing the program by way of listing resources, personnel, and deadlines for each program goal; and evaluating the program and using the assessment data. Each task section includes a brief list of suggested readings and, where appropriate, example worksheets helpful for completing the task. The guide concludes with a list of general resources (monographs, periodicals, and organizations) on career development and references used in this publication's development. (DTT)",

Four school districts were visited and a directory of in-school alternatives was compiled. The four programs included the Intervention Room, the Student Temporary Opportunity Program, the In-School Suspension Program, and In-School Suspension/Restriction Rooms. In only two sites did in-school suspension replace out-of-school suspension while data from a third program documented a dramatic drop in the use of out-of-school suspension. Other schools also expressed feelings that alternative programs were successful. In-school suspensions were used with truant and tardy students. All districts  displayed flexibility in determining their use of suspension policies as standards changed. Further research is needed in the area of the disciplinary referral process. (JAC)",

It includes the issues of client expectation, accountability and consumerism and counselor credentialing. The effects of a professional disclosure statement on client expectations, behavior, and satisfaction were studied by assigning university counseling center clients to read a professional disclosure statement, general statement, or no statement before counseling. Clients who read the professional disclosure statement tended to: (1) be more likely to change their expectations of counseling; (2) have a better understanding of the counseling process; (3) have more realistic expectations; and (4) report greater satisfaction with the  counseling outcome.

Instruments designed to assess growth on three of Chickering's student development vectors (Developing Purposes, Freeing Interpersonal Relationships, Establishing Identity) were administered to incoming college freshmen and readministered to the same group 4 years later. No substantial changes were found on the Developing Purposes vector. Substantial growth was found on the Freeing Interpersonal Relationships vector. Significantly lower scores were found on the Establishing Identity vector indicating negative growth in this area.

An examination of student personnel literature found that the University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP) ranked first in number of publications. A subsequent examination modified and extended that methodology to examine relative contributions within the faculty and staff at UMCP. Findings indicated that the counseling center was the most productive agency at UMCP for publications in the Student Personnel literature, producing more than three times the publications of any other department. The counseling center contributed more empirical studies, while the Counseling  and Student Personnel Services Department tended to contribute more articles of a theoretical nature. The results suggest that the different service and academic orientations of the Counseling Center and the Counseling and Student Personnel Services Department may contribute to their different emphases in scholarly activity.

Results revealed that empathy was negatively related to countertransference behavior with seductive female clients, but not with hostile or neutral clients. Counselor empathic ability was positively related to counselor reports of openness to countertransference feelings.

Data from Law Enforcement Assistance Administration surveys were used to review the personal victimization of older persons, incorporating the generally neglected category of series victimizations, i.e., a number of similar victimizations during a 6-month period. Analysis showed that while personal series victimizations of the elderly were relatively rare, failure to deal adequately with them resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence of victimization among older persons. A conservative re-estimate increased the frequency by about 10%. Results also showed that the poor were  frequent victims and that attempted assaults were most likely to be classified as series events.

Students were more comfortable having close personal contact with students in a wheelchair than with blind students in academic situations, such as receiving help with  classwork. The findings suggest that prejudice toward and stereotypes of disabled persons can be reduced by recognizing that potential differences in reactions by situation and disability exist. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"In 1979 a program was initiated at the Georges Valley High School in Thomaston, Maine, to identify high risk students who would be likely to drop out of high school and then to design and implement a program for ninth grade students that would motivate them to stay in school. A subsequent review of the impact of the program on its participants showed that the goal of the program was being achieved. A strong correlation between program participation and staying in school was found. However, the grades, attendance, number of suspensions and detentions, and extra curricular involvement of the participating students were not markedly better as a group. The program evalution findings suggest that further research and improved record-keeping may improve the effectiveness of the  program. (JAC)",

        "description":"Substantial evidence is accumulating which emphasizes the significant role of the family for drug abusing adolescents. To investigate the influence of the family on adolescents (N=17) involved in heavy marihuana use, interviews with family members, case studies of each adolescent, and psychological evaluations were conducted to determine the seriousness of the adolescent's drug use. Even for those adolescents who were no longer heavy drug users, the drug use experience led to lower aspirations. Many adolescents, once excellent students, used drugs as a means of withdrawing from the demands and pressures of school and the expectations of their families. Family dynamics clearly contributed to marihuana use. Conflict with non-drug-using siblings preceded drug use and was often a  contributing factor. In all its functions, marihuana served to detach adolescents from the problems of the real world. The findings suggest that family psychodynamics contribute to adolescent marihuana abuse and work to shape the specific meaning such abuse has for each adolescent. (JAC)",

Results of the second study emphasized the importance that parents and administrators place on counseling tasks.

Subjects responded to self-report questionnaires and were evaluated by friends. The socially poised, low private self-conscious subjects had the most positive general self esteem and reported the least amount of imagined embarrassment in situations where they supposedly committed socially clumsy acts. The results indicate that, in general, the  tendency of low private self-conscious individuals to avoid self-awareness helps them maintain self concepts that are discrepant with what significant others think of them.

However, the design of such marketing studies is different from the designs typically used in most psychological research. An experimental approach was used for a study in which 137 college students rated 10 control and 10 \"sexist\" target magazine advertisements for appeal and perceived sexism and completed the Attitudes toward Women Scale (AWS). Females found target ads to be more sexist than males, although both sexes rated target ads as much more sexist than control ads. There were no sex differences in ratings of the appeal of control ads. Females rated target ads as less appealing than control ads. High sexism ratings of the target ads were associated  with low appeal ratings. Additionally, females displayed more liberal attitudes on the AWS than did males. The findings suggest that social desirability factors may have influenced ratings on the AWS and sexism scale, but not the appeal ratings. (Author/JAC)",

On the basis of micro-structural analysis (of syntax, speed of closure, lexical analysis, given and new information structure, and lexically cohesive elements per text) and macro-structural analysis (of narrational and structural analysis and propositional  analysis), a theoretical model of parameters indicating the degree of difficulty of discourse processing was formed and the general hypothesis that macro-structural and micro-structural parameters both influence comprehension (with higher level parameters not necessarily having more impact on comprehension) was confirmed. Application of the model to other languages further confirmed its validity. Among the implications of these findings for teachers is the need to recognize that comprehension is a process and not just a product and that the reader is central to this process. (JL)",

Subjects were 114 tenth grade students who read two versions of an expository passage containing identical information but differing in top level structure. The version organized to show opposing views (comparison/contrast) was considered superior in facilitating recall to the version that simply related ideas to a main topic (description). However, on an immediate free recall task, multiple regression analyses revealed that regardless of students' reading ability level, performance was positively affected only for those in the descriptive text condition who had also been exposed to a graphic organizer prior to reading. The same effect was observed one week later on delayed  free and delayed cued recall measures. Results from this study support R. E. Mayer's assimilation encoding theory stating that organizers may help readers &quot;hold&quot; incoming information from text that is less than optimal in its organization until that information can be pieced together.

The subjects of the first experiment, 164 fifth and sixth graders, read four types of short texts, each of which contained two pieces of target information, one judged congruent with their prior knowledge and one judged incongruent, presented implicitly or explicitly at a different stage of the text. Although the reliability of the scores was low, the results did seem to isolate a group of  children that used a nonaccommodating strategy when confronted with incongruent information. Subjects of the second experiment were 145 fourth and seventh graders from the same school who had answered questions without texts previously as a check on the congruency of the target information in the texts. Although this study's finding--that incongruent information was more difficult for both grade levels--cannot be interpreted with confidence, the data were consistent with the hypothesis that incongruent information is more difficult to process as a result of prior knowledge sources conflicting with sources in the text. This finding has implications for judging the difficulty level of texts presented to children. (JL)",

        "description":"A commonly held belief about reading instruction in the elementary grades is that students must first learn to read so that they will then utilize their reading skill to learn from written language and to acquire new ideas. Consequently most of the instructional time in the primary grades is spent in teaching students how to recognize words and read fluently, whereas in the intermediate grades there is an instructional shift toward more diversified reading texts with an emphasis on learning how to understand, interpret, and evaluate new concepts. To investigate the questions of whether teachers believe there is an instructional shift and whether any direct evidence supports an actual shift toward comprehension instruction at about the fourth grade, a questionnaire was designed  for second through fifth grade teachers that sampled their views about reading instruction. Additional data were obtained through observations of third and fourth grade teachers. Both the questionnaire and the observations focused on how classrooms were managed, how students were grouped for instruction, how reading materials were selected, and how reading tasks varied in quality and quantity. Questionnaire results indicated changes over grade in procedure and method of organization of the classroom. They also show that while teachers believe that word-level instruction should be replaced by text-level comprehension instruction in the upper grades, there is little actual change in emphasis. Observations reveal a small decrease over grade in word recognition instruction but no increase in  text level comprehension. Consequently, reading instruction does not conform to teachers' beliefs or to expectations of teacher educators. (HOD)",

The first of the two schemes was developed by the publisher and presented as a means of classifying errors for the purpose of diagnosing individual learning needs. The second was developed by the researcher through a subjective examination of the 45 subtest items. Data for the study consisted of test results from 242 adult students enrolled in an urban career assessment program. In the first stage of the study, a factor analysis was used to determine whether the subtest was truly multidimensional, since this is a prerequisite for meaningful item classification schemes. The results  showed that the subtest was, in fact, multidimensional. The second stage of the study examined the discriminant validity of the classification schemes by determining the number of items within each subskill category that were more highly correlated with the corrected total score of the subskill category of which they were a part than with the total scores for each of the remaining subskill categories. Results indicated that the researcher-developed classification scheme evidenced a 9% increase in the number of items manifesting discriminant validity. The findings suggested that neither classification scheme offered sufficient evidence of discriminant validity to establish its practical utility. (Author/FL)",

They were then given a cued recall task in which they were to fill in the blank space where the topic of the metaphor had been in the 96 test sentences. The results indicated that the filler sentences were responded to more rapidly, were subjectively easier to understand, and were better recalled than either the related or filler metaphors. There were no significant differences between the filler and related metaphors in speed or difficulty of comprehension.

        "description":"Much of the current work in reading comprehension features the idea that reading for meaning involves metacognitive activity of comprehension monitoring, which entails keeping track of the success with which one's comprehension is proceeding, ensuring that the process continues smoothly, and taking remedial action if necessary. The resurgence of interest in the topic of reasoning or thinking reflects a paradigm shift in the field of learning psychology. Thus, although metacognition is not a new field of study, the new concepts and methods used in current research should eventually have a greater impact on education than earlier work on the same topic did. There is now sufficient evidence from studies of children that less able readers are not particularly adept at monitoring  their understanding of what they listen to or read. Research has shown that approaches teachers can use to improve these children's metacognitive strategies include (1) providing instructions to predict outcomes that require a reader's active involvement and constructive thinking, (2) encouraging children to integrate their prior knowledge with story content, and (3) training students to monitor their understanding by asking themselves questions as they read. Teachers should be cautioned, however, that an overt demonstration of an understanding of metacognitive skills is unnecessary. Rather, the teacher should model good questions, provide examples of strategies students might use, and provide many opportunities to apply the strategies to various types of reading materials.

The fifth article describes a district-wide program evaluation process that evolved from questions originally raised from the community. The final article describes the Consortium's assessment of changes in teacher's level of use of ECRI based on self-reports from more than 350 teachers over 3 years. (HOD)",

        "description":"Four studies used the theoretically based understanding of comprehension developed by W. Kintsch and T. A. van Dijk to look for processes that might undergo development as a child becomes more practiced and skilled in reading so that an understanding of these processes might become the basis for reading remediation programs. The first three studies produced the following four conclusions: (1) third grade students used the same units of meaning to construct a mental representation of the meaning of a text as fifth grade students and adults; (2) beginning readers construct these units just as quickly as more skilled readers; (3) beginning readers connect these units into the same organizational structures as skilled readers; and (4) large developmental differences in working memory  capacity and speed of lexical access do exist between fourth and sixth grade students. Assuming that the paucity of developmental differences found in these studies is the result more of theoretical inadequacy than the nonexistence of such differences, the final study examined the role of perspective in encoding and retrieval and the basis for coherence in texts.

        "description":"Writing development in preschool children has only recently begun to receive attention; however, Russian researchers dealt with the subject in the 1920s and 30s. Arguing that writing was a fundamental assist to cognitive growth as well as a tool for communication, Lev Vygotsky believed that the preschool child was ready to be taught writing. Alexander Luria's view of writing as a culturally mediated function of the individual served as an assumptive base in shaping his methodology for soliciting data from children. Results of his research suggested that the writing development process in young children is a general progression (albeit one with periods of plateau and regression) from a first undifferentiated phase to and through pictography to a final stage of ideography where the  child understands and exploits the symbolic potential of language. According to Luria, such development is analogous to other cultural developments. His evidence that considerable learning potential remains unexploited in preschool children should lead us to reexamine some of our assumptions about when and how to begin writing instruction with children. His findings could also be useful for the work currently being done in metalinguistic awareness studies. (JL)",

        "description":"To describe and analyze the revision processes of a group of college freshmen and a group of experienced adult writers, eight freshman students and seven experienced adult writers were asked to write three compositions, rewrite each composition two times, suggest revisions for a composition written by an anonymous author, and be interviewed three times. The students wrote their compositions in a class as a regular class activity while the adults wrote their compositions in their own homes or in their offices. Writing tasks consisted of expressive, explanatory, and persuasive writing. Findings show that the student writers have operational procedures for revising and reasons to explain their procedures, but that they have not codified or synthesized the procedures into a theory of  the revision process. The experienced writers, on the other hand, have a codified set of principles about how their revision process works. For the experienced writers revision was not a stage but rather a process that occurred throughout their writing. Their first drafts were already the results of an elaborate revision process in which their revision theories operated to reject some ideas and to select others. Thus, the evidence from this study calls for a rejection of the linear stage theory since that theory does not describe the behavior of experienced writers. An alternate theoretical model is the concept of dissonance in which the writers sense dissonance, tolerate dissonance, and resolve dissonance, thereby reflecting the recursive process of revision.

Foremost is that teachers be given greater voice in curricular decisions. Teaching must receive stronger financial support and greater respect from the public if the profession is to attract and hold academically competent teachers. The industrial model of education, which fails to accommodate either individual differences among learners or the continuing revolution in telecommunications, must also be altered. The Back-to-Basics movement and minimum competency testing, which have reduced English from a rich and complex subject to one concerned with promoting low-level skills of reading and editing, must be tempered. Evidence  also suggests that teachers have done little in English classes to help students exert dominion over nonprint media. As computers play an increasing role in education, programs to enlist the aid of national, state, and local governments and private business in coordinating information develop, but it is time to ask about the computer's particular significance to English instruction. The potential for better software programs exists, but even if high quality programs were available, there is no guarantee that schools would have equal access to them. There remains the problem of how best to educate teachers to operate microcomputers and use them effectively in classrooms. Rather than replacing teachers, the computer could liberate them to do the teaching that they alone can do.  (HTH)",

Emphasis is placed on the process of composing, particularly the ways students should write for different audiences and different purposes. The course also stresses the crucial relationships among critical reading, clear thinking, and effective writing. Students are expected to write and review a variety of documents and also to practice related skills, including finding and analyzing audiences outside the classroom and conducting an empirical evaluation of a document. The course material, which can be covered in one semester or in one quarter,  moves the students in a cyclical pattern through the same process at three different levels: first, they move step-by-step through the composing model; then they apply the model to actual documents that they rewrite; and then they create documents, gathering information, determining need, and moving through the process to evaluation and final draft. Chapters in the book follow the steps of the composing process and discuss such topics as the composing process model, planning, organizing, writing clearly, using design well, reviewing/revising/editing, and evaluating documents. Appendixes include a suggested syllabus, an example of a redesigned form, and exercises for writing clearly. (HOD)",

        "description":"The emergence of a modern or &quot;new&quot; rhetoric has been characterized by its attempt both to recover and reexamine the concepts of classical rhetoric and to define itself against that classical tradition. The distinctions that are persistently drawn between classical and modern rhetoric fall under four related heads: images of man and society, logical argument, speaker-audience relationship, and persuasion versus communication. The first two distinctions, which view the classical image of man as a rational being and the logical proofs as supreme, discount classical rhetoric as too rationalistic. The latter two, which present the speaker-audience relationship in classical rhetoric as antagonistic and unidirectional and its goal as persuasion, discount classical rhetoric as being too  dependent upon emotional manipulation and coercion. These distinctions reflect two major problems: (1) a failure to relate Aristotle's &quot;Rhetoric&quot; to the rest of his philosophy, and (2) serious, persistent misunderstandings about the nature and function of the &quot;pisteis&quot; and of the &quot;enthymeme&quot; in Aristotelian rhetoric. A much more accurate way to describe Aristotle's concept of the goal of rhetoric is as an interactive means of discovering meaning through language. Such an approach demands that rhetoric be reinstated at the center of the curriculum, as the art of using language in the creation--and sharing--of knowledge and belief. One way to begin this task is by eschewing the false distinctions that have been drawn between classical and modern rhetoric and by building instead on their  powerful similarities. (HOD)",

Predictable patterns are those spellings that can be readily predicted from pronunciation. Rare and unpredictable spellings are found only in a small set of words--probably 10% or less of the vocabulary in English. However, the boundary between rare and frequent unpredictable patterns is unclear. Since rarity has no absolute values, such distinctions in instruction must be made on other grounds such as the usefulness of the words. A three-way categorization, which parallels a linguistic classification based on sound-to-spelling correspondences and which also includes eight categories relevant to learning to spell, seems most suitable for the  design and development of spelling instruction. These three categories are based on the type of learner behavior appropriate for different words and rules. The first class (predictable spellings) covers words that students should be able to spell simply by listening to the sounds and applying the rules that have been taught. The second class (unpredictable and rare spellings) covers words that must be memorized by sight, and the third class (unpredictable but common spellings) covers words in which the sounds should help students know how the words may be spelled, but students must learn the words by memory or must check in a dictionary in order to determine the exact spelling.

This can be accomplished by a complete editing program that would contain the full set of mechanics rules--capitalization, punctuation, spelling, usage--appropriate for the grade level of the intended user. The specific rules that students would practice could be decided in three ways: (1) the student would choose from a menu those rules that need to be practiced, (2) the teacher would choose those rules the student should practice, and (3) the computer would assign students to the appropriate rules on the basis of pretest scores. After content for practice is assigned or chosen, the student is given the option of reviewing  the rules to be practiced. Following this optional rule review, students receive three kinds of practice: choice, correction, and dictation. The choice section provides basic practice in discriminating the correct application of the rules under study. The correction section begins with instruction on the why and how of editing--with specific text-editor procedures on the computer. For the dictation section of the program, the computer presents sentences orally, and the student types in the sentence. Each section provides the student with feedback and evaluation. If the student does not meet the criterion for the correct responses in each section, instruction is terminated and the student goes back to the teacher for additional help. (HOD)",

To comply with these mandates, schools across the country have developed a variety of assessment procedures.

From those agencies responding to the questionnaire, 10 representing varying assessment philosophies were invited to send participants to a conference on assessment held in New Orleans. The purpose of this conference was to provide both verification and clarification of the questionnaire findings. In addition, the study drew data about assessment  practices from schools throughout the state of Louisiana. These three activities yielded conclusions concerning such problems as (1) the selection of scoring procedures, (2) development of test items, (3) the selection and training of scorers, (4) the value and use of information produced by a writing sample, (5) the scoring of mechanics, and (6) other problems associated with large-scale assessment programs. (Appendixes contain a list of city school systems receiving the questionnaire, a copy of the Louisiana scoring guide for writing samples, and names of participants in the writing conference. Extensive tables of data are included in the paper.) (FL)",

Six students enrolled in a speech communication course who were classified as communication apprehensive by the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA) participated in the project to its conclusion. In the first session of the project, they generated negative self statements. In the next three sessions they analyzed and evaluated these statements and developed their abilities to cognitively evaluate and classify their self statements. Next they began developing coping statements to substitute for their previous negative self statements. After the  final session, each student retook the PRCA and evaluated his or her experiences with the project. The results of the PRCA indicated substantial improvement over all. Students also perceived the project favorably. Although the student who initiated the project did not improve on the PRCA, her presentations after the project did not reflect apprehensive behavior. Although this was not a formal study, its results demonstrate the usefulness of such an inexpensive program for the small rural college. (JL)",

        "description":"Working on the assumption that young people in the midwestern United States do not have many opportunities to witness an extensive representation of a remote culture, a study was designed to describe the social and psycho-sociological characteristics of those youngsters who were likely to be exposed to &quot;Shogun&quot; on television. Specifically, the study explored the possible linkages between exposure to the program and knowledge about Japanese history, language, and customs; attitudes toward interaction with the Japanese; and stereotypes of Japanese. Two days after the termination of the broadcast of &quot;Shogun,&quot; a questionnaire was administered to 676 high school students. The instrument contained several sections corresponding to the following: general television exposure; exposure to&quot;Shogun&quot;; reasons for watching &quot;Shogun&quot;; experience while watching &quot;Shogun&quot;; knowledge of Japanese history, language, and customs; general reasons for watching television; attitudes toward learning about other cultures; stereotypes associated with the Japanese; notion of social distance; ethnocentrism; and demographics. Findings revealed that heavy TV viewers would be among those watching specials like &quot;Shogun.&quot; These same viewers would watch in order to expose themselves to other cultures and to try to understand them. For those who watched TV for stimulation, this exposure would lead to a more negative stereotype of other cultures. The most impressive findings seemed to be the amount of knowledge that was predicted from exposure to &quot;Shogun.&quot; At least on a short-term basis, special TV  broadcasts can be useful in increasing the knowledge of adolescent viewers.

        "description":"A study was conducted to test an hypothesis relating semantic structures to cognitive development, specifically that the mean number of associative complexes used by a group of children will be significantly greater than the mean number of associative complexes used by a group of adolescents. The word game \"Password\" provided a simulation of a speech communication context. Pilot studies helped determine the test words, the reliability of the judges, and the most effective method of playing the game. Subjects were 54 fourth graders, ages 9 and 10, and 52 high school sophomores and juniors, ages 15 and 16. Clues and guesses were sent and received through the judges, who acted as intermediaries. Although results did indicate that the semantic system differed across the two age  groups and that there is a semantic component in speech, associative structures were more prominent when adolescents were engaged in sending behavior and when children were engaged in receiving behavior, a finding opposite of the prediction of the hypothesis. Explanations of this result must be extremely tentative, but perhaps the age range selected for this study was not really representative of a separate semantic state, or perhaps the semantic model is appropriate for decoding but not for encoding. This speculation suggests a fruitful avenue for future research. (JL)",

Television is seen as performing a social function, bringing family members together, providing topics of conversation, acting as a tension release, and serving as a scapegoat, though the nature of the situation thwarts many of these effects. The active environment provided by radio and television affected both the amount and the content (often program related) of conversations held during interactions, with TV's effects being greater and more negative. These results indicate  both possible benefits and potentially harmful effects of media interactions and suggest a substantial mediating effect of interactants on the impact of media messages, facts media researchers should keep in mind.

Having defined characteristic, causal, and result variables, the paper stresses the importance of establishing whether communication behavior is deliberate, intentional, and purposeful, or the much more limited result of coping mechanisms. Next it presents the three dominant approaches to OC--Instrumental, Process, and Functional--and proposes how the predicted effects of each approach could be used to construct variables that will test the approaches' domain claims. The paper then describes the three criteria for the measurement of  variables--utility, validity, and reliability--and reviews the four methods used in OC research: survey questionnaire, interview, experiment, and observation. The paper concludes that the resolution of domain issues will provide an understanding of the genuine significance of OC, or even its lack of significance. (JL)",

The essential conventions were found to be (1) an author- or director-introduced narrative element within the play, (2) minimal theatrical cues that invite an imaginative response from audiences, (3) a general tendency to give prominence to the words or ideas of the play, (4) a performer playing more than one character, and (5) a creative use of offstage/onstage focus. One or more of these five conventions were found to be an integral part of a large number of Broadway  plays, including &quot;Talley's Folly,&quot;&quot;The Elephant Man,&quot;&quot;Equus,&quot;&quot;Strider,&quot;&quot;Evita,&quot; and &quot;Da&quot; among others. The presence and importance of these conventions raises two questions for further study: Should instruction in Interpreters Theatre styles and techniques be increasingly important to a contemporary actor's training? and Where do these conventions originate, in the playwright, the designer, or the director? One thing is certain, the importance of these conventions will not diminish in the near future. (JL)",

The next section identifies basic listening skills for preschool through grade 12 and indicates whether the skill for the grade level should be introduced, focused, reviewed, or maintained. The final  sections provide sample listening activities on becoming informed for preschool, on imagining for grades K-3, on feeling for grades 4-6, on ritualizing for grades 7-9, and on being controlled for grades 10-12.

The second part of the paper discusses the six elements said to constitute the domain of social interaction: content, interpretation, emotions, transference, selection, and relationships. The third part of the paper explicates the major interrelationships among the elements within the domain of social interaction. This perspective is used in the last part of the paper to examine three middle range approaches to  social interaction: relational communication, rules, and sequences. The paper concludes by suggesting that without an organizing paradigm, social interaction research will continue to be a field characterized by much activity, but also by a very halting and erratic development of conceptual understandings of the phenomenon which should be its focus of inquiry.

The students spend the first few weeks of the special section developing more positive attitudes about communicating. In about the third or fourth weeks of the quarter, they deliver a 2 to 3 minute speech defining a term or phrase to a lab group of about 8 or 10 students with whom they have previously engaged in several interpersonal or small group exercises. These speeches are videotaped and later shown to the students to give them a base for measuring improvement in specific speech skills. A  portion of the course grade is based on improvement in specific skills. The course also deals with other aspects of speech preparation including the development of effective supporting material, organization of the speech, and audience analysis. A videotaped speech by the instructor provides a model for the students. At the end of the quarter, students comment on the elements of the class that have or have not been helpful. The most commonly mentioned helpful aspect of the course is the &quot;graduated approach&quot; to giving a speech. Anonymous student evaluations completed at the end of the class indicate a greater positive change toward the special section than toward other sections of the class. (HTH)",

In the area of applied speech ethics, communications theorists attempt to determine whether a speech act is moral or immoral by focusing on the content and effects of specific speech acts. Specific areas of study include falsehood, hurtful statements, exhortations to immorality, and silence. Ethical rules attempt to tell us whether speech acts are moral by looking not at their content but rather at the attitudes and qualities surrounding the act itself.

Four major factors are responsible for the recent deterioration of state budgets: (1) reductions in federal aid to states and localities, (2) changes in the federal corporate and individual tax structure, (3) a severe national recession, and (4) efforts by individual states to curtail the growth of state revenues in response to the tax revolt movement. While some states have fared better than others because of their ability to tax lucrative exports such as gas and oil, most states have been forced to adjust either spending or taxation plans to avoid deficits. Many states have increased their reliance on local taxes  and/or user charges, particularly in the financing of elementary and secondary education services. The anemic condition of state revenue systems, along with the onset of declining enrollment, also suggests that there will be fewer real dollars available to postsecondary education during the 1980s and some of the progress made in equalizing access to postsecondary education will be forfeited.

The intent of this paper is to point out that it is important for principals to work with teachers for the purpose of improving teaching, that the principal has a choice as to what interventions to make in striving toward this goal, and that the effects on teachers are related to the interventions selected. In order to demonstrate these points, several examples are used from the Principal-Teacher Interaction Study being conducted by the Concerns-Based Adoption Model project at the Austin campus of the University of Texas. The examples relate both to what principals do as change facilitators and to the effects of principals' interventions on teachers during the  change process. The examples are followed by a discussion of the effects of these interventions on the teachers involved.
