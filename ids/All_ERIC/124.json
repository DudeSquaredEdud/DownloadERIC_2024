        "description":"Most on-going research on the U.S.-Mexican Border region is in the major content areas of political structure and urbanization, disaster relief, law enforcement, and self-identity studies. Political interaction contrasts the centrally controlled power structures of Mexico with the more complex economic and social structures of the United States. Disaster relief studies reflect the impersonal welfare structure of the U.S. compared with Mexican kinship-oriented assistance. Studies of legal enforcement reveal that coordination between the 2 countries is effective through personal relationships and informal agreements rather than formal legal procedures. The newly-arrived immigrant faces an acculturational conflict between the informal kinship system of Mexico and the formal  bureaucratic structures of the United States. Comparative studies must be translated into concrete programs if opportunities for self-betterment are to be provided to our Mexican neighbors and to Mexican-American citizens. (JH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to generate hypotheses which could feasibly be studied through the use of a data bank on Indian children. The study also produced some findings concerning the educational population (ages 6 through 18) of the Papago, Pima, and Maricopa tribes. An extremely high percentage of Indian children remain in school through the eighth grade. A substantial portion of this population is behind in grade placement as measured by expected grade age, possibly because of late initial entrance into the first grade, and retention in the first three grades due to lack of facility in the English language. The dropout rate is serious with 22.3 percent of Indian students leaving school before graduation. It was concluded that before research in Indian education could be  productive and useful, further identification and description of the Indian population should be made.

School districts were assigned to one of four geographic categories (urban, suburban, rural, or small urban centers). Each category's teaching talent was assessed on six measures of experience and training. The most striking finding was that rural schools possess a disproportionately low number of the State's most highly qualified teachers. It was suggested that the study's findings needed elaboration to determine if differences in teacher quality reflect themselves in differences in pupil performance. It was recommended that rural districts' ability to compete for talented teachers be improved by (1)  instituting a statewide minimum salary schedule, and (2) increasing the attractiveness of rural teaching by offering benefits such as home building loans and added opportunities for professional contacts. Short range improvement efforts should be directed at stimulating rural school recruitment activities and forming a statewide volunteer teacher corps. Statistical data are included. (SW)",

Those districts not consolidated would form county districts. As of the 1967-68 school year, 26 of these county districts remained. The purpose of this study was to provide information drawing attention to the situation existing in these districts. In an effort to initiate improvement of schools in these areas, the study examined the districts in terms of rurality, settlement patterns, spatial accessibility, financial resources and expenditures, quality of school operation, and school performance in terms of the extent to which school-age population enroll in and continue through high school. Comparisons were drawn between the county  districts and existing independent school districts within the same county. Since the county districts were small, many of the problems encountered were similar to those experienced by small independent school districts. It was concluded that although consolidation of county with independent districts would not solve all problems of county districts, advantages of student and community participation would outweigh the disadvantages.

Decreases in rural population have increased the importance of the county as a unit of government and have caused the development of consolidated school districts. The emphasis on religious denominationalization has begun to decline, but the church's essential role of interpreting and developing religious  and social interests is increasing in importance.

McVoy's Wants and Satisfaction scale was administered to 115 family heads to determine the degree to which certain wishes and interests of families residing in the area were satisfied. Four major areas of family living were examined: residence; consumer goods; family welfare; and social participation. It was found that there are aspects of rural life which are very satisfying to rural people, even to those who are severely disadvantaged; there are also certain aspects of rural life which are less satisfying. It was concluded that American society should accept the moral  responsibility for improving the depressed rural areas rather than attempting to cast rural people into the mold of urban society. If rural area redevelopment is concerned with the psychological health of rural inhabitants, it should initially focus upon felt needs of the rural inhabitants. As the weaknesses of depressed rural area life are improved, families will readjust their major goal standards upward. A bibliography concludes this report.

By 1955, California Achievement Tests had been administered to 23,608 pupils (58 percent of whom were Indian) attending Federal, public, and mission schools in 11 States. Results were compared by administrative areas of the BIA, by race-school groups, and by skill achievement. The results indicated that, in general, Indian pupils did not achieve as well as white pupils. The second activity of the program was the development of a battery of 5 tests, which by 1955 had been administered to  2,221 Indian college and business school applicants. Test results and performance data from the validation subjects were used to construct pass-fail expectancy tables for use in predicting college and business school performance. (JAM)",

From data obtained through academic tests and personal questionnaires, it was concluded that although three-fourths of rural youth entering high school were unlikely to attend a college or university, rural high schools were largely oriented to college preparation. Few vocational training opportunities were offered in rural high schools although results indicated that most non-college-prone youth needed more training in mechanical skills. Inadequate high school counseling was indicated by lack of knowledge of occupational training needs on the part of rural  youth. Implications of the study included the need for further consolidation of small rural school systems and for closer integration of rural systems with the total state system.

Between 1950 and 1960, total manufacturing employment expanded in large-, medium-, and small-center population areas, in rates inverse to center size. However, absolute gains in employment were concentrated in areas with large- and medium-size urban centers. The growth of industries among areas in the 1950's was essentially in the nationally fast-growing industries for large- and medium-center areas and in the nationally slow-growing industries in small-center areas. It was concluded that: (1) if the trends of the 1950's continue, the growth prospects of large- and medium-center areas in Appalachia appear brighter than those of  small-center areas; and (2) the manufacturing industry will have to grow at higher rates in small-center areas to offset existing unemployment and low incomes and to counteract further declines in agriculture and mining.

        "description":"In 1958 a project was begun in a small, isolated, rural farm community in Puerto Rico to provide nutrition education and improve other conditions of home and community living. Preliminary meetings, interviews, and examinations revealed the interest and great need of the 100 families. Progress reports were made after 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years. The 90 children were given 3 meals a day at the 2-room elementary school, along with instruction about good foods. The families were given information and demonstrations on home food production and nutrition. Housing, school, and public facilities (such as roads and water supply) were repaired or newly constructed. The community attitude toward self help was raised considerably. Although all problems were not solved, many deficiencies  began to be corrected. Partly because of the on-going improvements at Dona Elena, the Governor of Puerto Rico in 1960 established a Commission for Improvement of Isolated Communities to administer other programs similar to the Dona Elena Project.

In addition, they should fulfill the standards of the International Reading Association. The graduate training should be on a full-time basis for 18 to 24 months. There should also be access to further education and to other forms of professional  stimulation.

The largest differences in achievement observed were differences in classroom means within treatment groups. An addendum supplementing the original report describes a modified continuation of the study which examined the reading achievement of 376 third-grade children relative to different methods of instruction received in grades 1 and 2. The addendum also describes the characteristics of 106 disabled readers among the third-grade population. These disabled  readers could have been identified as potential reading failures at the beginning of first grade on the basis of objective measures. This study confirms the results of the first- and second-grade studies that none of the three approaches is entirely successful in teaching all children to read and that the teacher variable is a most important factor.

In the 18 studies reviewed which relate to the superiority of one modality over another, there was no consensus regarding the relative effectiveness of modalities among adults. The evidence leans toward greater effectiveness of the visual modality among children. The review of eight studies which compared the effectiveness of the simultaneous use of more than one modality with the use of one modality alone revealed a problem in the definitions of modalities as used by different investigators. The results of these studies, however, generally support a combination of visual and auditory modes. Eight studies are reviewed which relate modality to reading  ability. These studies suggest that while modality and perceptual skills are very important as factors in the early stages of reading instruction, cognitive abilities are more significant during the middle elementary grades.

Data gathered through questionnaires and records of books read within a period of 4 weeks showed that reading ranked highest as a leisure time activity among the Amish children and non-Amish girls. Television viewing was a first choice for the non-Amish boys and a second choice for the non-Amish girls. On the average, a greater number of books was read by the Amish children. Hobbies were not mentioned as leisure time interests by the Amish children. Amish boys preferred animal and sport stories; Amish girls chose biographies and family and home stories.  The non-Amish children read in more interest areas and favored mysteries, biographies, and stories of other lands and people. These results point out the strong influence of a strict religious home environment on children's recreational activities and interests. (NS)",

(1) Vagueness, which resulted from indeterminate qualifiers and probability words, lowered comprehension. (2) Explaining links such as prepositions and conjunctions, which indicated that the cause, result, or means of an event or idea was being presented, raised comprehension. (3) The frequent use of examples produced greater  understanding. (4) A rule-example-rule pattern of explanation was more effective than either inductive or deductive explanation.

An analysis of variance of the main idea responses to the pictures showed that in general there were no significant differences between boys and girls or between third and sixth graders. Responses to one picture were better than responses to the other two, but only for sixth-grade subjects. The analysis of variance of ratings of the responses to the paragraphs with/without pictures and directions did not affect the adequacy  of main idea responses. Although both readability and grade effects were significant, post hoc analyses showed that reading basic paragraphs led to significantly better main idea responses only among the sixth graders and that the significantly higher boys' mean accounted for the difference.

The structural class rated significantly superior on the Structural Reading Achievement Test and in the number of words written on the writing sample. At the end of grade 2 significant differences favored the structural class in spelling ability and in the desire to write words and stories instead of to color pictures. Analysis of covariance, with mental ability controlled, showed the structural  class to be equal or superior on most measures of the study. Consistent findings favoring the structural class in reading and writing samples were confirmed by a study of the progress of the lowest five readers in each class.

In the sever\"l cases presented, the hyperlexia re\"ulted in environmental stress. The potentiality of later stress is expected to take the form of anxiety provoked by unrealistic assessment of the child's abilities and by the high-level demands placed on him by teachers and parents. Several of the children described had been referred for testing as gifted children on the basis of word recognition ability alone, and one had been accelerated to a higher grade. One boy had not been detected as dyslexic until the  fourth grade when it was found that although his word recognition was at grade level, his reasoning and comprehension abilities were similar to those of a high-level, educable mentally retarded child. This condition is often not detected earlier because of the emphasis on word recognition skills in the primary grades and because of the assumption of teachers and parents that if readingskills are high, other mental functioning should also be high.

The research suggests that a decline in reading growth, noted at the junior high level, results from the lack of systematic reading instruction beyond grade 6 and from the absence of qualified reading personnel. It points out that a student's emotional, physical, and intellectual competencies, as well as his reading purposes and communication abilities, are directly related to reading growth. The cited studies are predominately programs for the  handicapped reader; these indicate that any remedial approach must be multidimensional to meet multifaceted needs. General program improvement suggestions include close integration of reading and content area material, sequential development that provides for individual needs in all areas of reading growth, and complete staff involvement. The use of a variety of reading materials and methods, both mechanical and textual, is recommended for reading instruction. More better-trained teachers and books with contemporary themes are needed.

The course materials consist of descriptions of about 80 laboratory and demonstration activities which provide the basis for class discussion and approximately 30 instructor information sheets providing directions and suggestions for guiding activities. There are a number of detailed activities for students, a teacher's outline of principles, and problem sheets to be used to direct students beyond the immediate experimental  conclusions. Areas dealt with are (1) measurement and fundamental quantities, (2) graphical analysis, (3) properties of light, (4) matter, and (5) rectilinear kinematics. Because the program is a departure from traditional ninth grade general science, and even though the materials are quite complete, it is strongly recommended that teacher inservice education be provided prior to adoption of the program.

The TIP system provides access to (1) title, (2) author(s), (3) bibliographic references, and (4) literature citations of articles comprising a large part of the body of physics literature. The field of lasers was chosen for study because it is a relatively new field and would thus allow a complete view of the scope of its pertinent literature. Asburn's laser bibliography was used as a reference to which articles located in TIP were compared. There are 25 core journals in the field of physics which are stored by TIP. Programmed instructions are used  to obtain a response from the system by (1) search, defining what literature is to be searched, (2) find, stating item to be found, and (3) output, describing requirements of computer output. Three different strategies were used to retrieve titles of the 1964 literature. Results of the project indicated that TIP was a reliable means of retrieval of laser articles within the TIP library. Similar research will continue in an effort to improve retrieval of scientific literature. (DH)",

The AIP program in the past has been one of studying documents, but now need dictates an expanded program going beyond document analysis and moving toward information retrieval. The present undertaking has as its immediate goal a pilot model of a physics information system, the heart of which is an information store. The AIP system development plan has five stages: (1) classification scheme, (2) computer retrieval capability,  (3) computer composition and input for store, (4) user need studies, and (5) information network studies. These studies are expected to yield the means by which journals and abstract journal indexes can be efficiently produced and a system of information stored.

Among the conclusions are the following. A large number of concepts are implicitly involved in addition to those explicitly considered. Although the explicit concept load is heavy, the implicit concept load is much greater and is almost certainly ascribing to junior high school students a level of  sophistication which extremely few of them possess. There is little evidence that the authors conceived it to be their function to build a more functional, systematic sophisticated conceptual hierarchy. Concepts of physics, mathematics, and astronomy are assumed. In summary, the material i s not particularly well organized, it lacks conceptual continuity, it assumes unrealistic student backgrounds, and it has surprising omissions. (BC)",

        "description":"The Advanced Chemistry Laboratory Program is a project designed to devise experiments to coordinate the use of instruments in the laboratory programs of physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and inorganic chemistry at the advanced undergraduate level. It is intended that such experiments would incorporate an introduction to the instrument employing a descriptive as well as a theoretical point of view and use of the instrument as a physical tool as well as an analytical device. Also of interest in this project was the possibility of including the preparation of inorganic or organo-metallic compounds as the working substances for the instrumental experiments. The results of the laboratory program revealed that (1) an inorganic preparation followed by instrumental experiments  to confirm structure or to provide analytical information can be used as the basis of an integrated experiment for advanced chemistry students, and (2) most of the more rapid preparations require very little variety in the laboratory techniques of preparative chamistry.

From the curriculum materials of &quot;Science - A Process Approach&quot; four strategies of inquiry in science were selected for evaluation: classifying, observing, using number relations, and recognizing and using space/time relations. A sample of 95 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students received five months of instruction in the strategies of inquiry. Analysis indicated that the most efficient strategy of inquiry for bringing about behavioral change was that of using numbers, followed by&quot;classifying,&quot;&quot;space/time relations,&quot; and &quot;observing.&quot; There appeared to be no consistent pattern among grades and no sex differences in the relationship of the strategies of inquiry to behavior change. Apparently no single strategy of inquiry in science can be used to predict behavioral change in all of the behavioral criteria. (BC)",

Thirty volunteer fifth grade science teachers were randomly assigned to a control group or to an experimental group which was given the inservice methods course. All were observed by two of three observers four times before, twice during, and four times after the course. Activity  ratios and laboratory and questioning ratios (the proportion of time the teacher spends with laboratory experiences and asking questions) were calculated, and differences in mean ratio changes were tested by applying the t-test and using a .05 level of significance. Results indicate that the inservice methods course caused change in teaching techniques: experimental teachers made greater use of indirect activities, especially laboratory experiences, after the course.

One is the internship, the other is the provision of college level activities (such as microteaching) that require competency in particular classroom skills. Both provide valuable and necessary experiences; however, these experiences count for nothing if not accompanied by adequate supervision and analysis. Moreover, there is a danger that overemphasis on practical experience activities will push instruction in professional education out of the teacher education curriculum. \"If an attempt is made to hold on to the specialized courses, while at the same time utilizing more laboratory situations, the time will simply not be available for the type of analysis necessary.\" In  conclusion, adequate personnel, time, and money are prerequisites to effective internship programs.

The teacher supervisor who accepts such assignment with unvoiced unwillingness is himself not a free individual. It follows that, excluding those who actively seek the task of supervising student teachers, \"those who accept student teaching supervision are automatically less qualified than are those who reject such assignments.\" To be fully effective, teacher supervisors must possess \"an honest, positive, and unequivocal desire to participate.\" To obtain volunteers of this  quality, the conditions for such work must be enhanced.

        "description":"Despite conflicting strategies for shifts in decision-making power in educating and licensing teachers, various studies of teacher education agree on the need for experimentation in teacher education and uncertainty with respect to what knowledge is most pertinent to the professional preparation of teachers. Newer developments in the systematic study of teaching represent points on a continuum starting with purely descriptive studies of teaching but advancing to controlled investigations which yield broad generalizations. A proposal for utilizing present descriptive studies of teaching for improving teacher education merits attention; it suggests that teacher candidates emulate the mode of inquiry of researchers in a clinical approach to direct study of ongoing teaching.  Examination of the general nature of scientific theory suggests the possible anatomy of a theory of teaching. Controlled investigations of teaching subsequently will yield broad, predictive generalizations which will be fashioned into multiple theories to constitute a corpus of knowledge with demonstrable power to describe, explain, and control various dimensions of teaching. Such knowledge may clarify the points of convergence and relevance of ancillary disciplines like psychology, sociology, and philosophy to the educational process. Such knowledge ultimately will become the principal substantive content of the professional education of teachers. (A 14-item bibliography is appended.) (Author/SG)",

(2) Transferable elements should be emphasized which would, in turn, require a curriculum design specially oriented to persistent life situations. Moreover, it is important to realize (1) that a cognitive-oriented approach to a philosophy of education is too restrictive, (2) that analysis of teaching techniques is too limited an  approach to enable comprehensive assessment of the quality of instruction, and (3) that direct as well as indirect experiences should be provided in the teacher education curriculum.

First, it is necessary to determine the characteristics of effective teachers of the disadvantaged. Teachers of the disadvantaged must have good mental health, want to teach the disadvantaged, and be creative, curious, highly skilled, professional, and unprejudiced. Therefore, teacher education institutions preparing teachers for work in urban slum schools must individualize programs; provide early, varied, and continuing direct experiences with children in community and school situations; encourage able men to teach at the elementary school level; and choose cooperating teachers selectively. Second, it is necessary to determine the role of course work in  curriculum and methodology in the preservice preparation of teachers of the disadvantaged. Such course work should help students to base classroom programs on children's needs, understand the peer culture of the child, establish and maintain a healthy emotional climate in the classroom, function democratically in classrooms and enable children to practice democratic skills, learn ways of arranging an effective classroom environment, be creative in their teaching, become skillful in selecting appropriate learning experiences for individual children, and evaluate old concepts of educational practice in light of recent research.

First, courses would focus on the diagnostic decision-making aspect of teacher behavior. Second, the interactive aspect of teaching would be examined, and students would be exposed to various dimensions of classroom interaction and their relationship to diagnostic behavior. Third, instruction in large teaching systems (like the phonics approach in reading) would be broken down into component elements in order to prepare the teacher to fit instruction to a particular group of individual learners. At least four types or levels of  laboratory experiences, or combinations of them, would be needed to implement such a revised teacher education program, including a training experience to aid students in identifying and gaining proficiency in using basic tools necessary for teaching, an experience focusing upon the diagnosis and analysis of teaching situations, an experience requiring requiring students to implement diagnoses in teaching situations with some control over variables, and an experience similar to student teaching or internship but directly focusing on the basic concept of professional behavior.

Although creativity and self-awareness are voiced as goals for teachers and their students, teachers are all too often educated by means of lectures, a form which holds quiet attentiveness rather than intellectual aggression a chief value. In their own classes, education professors fail to utilize the techniques they advocate: team teaching, programed texts, and group process. Since teachers tend to teach in the form in which they were taught, a dichotomy between actions and words is perpetuated. Consultations with specially trained teachers of disturbed children revealed that teachers found it difficult to make explicit demands on colleagues or children, were unaware of their value as models, feared  to generalize from past experience, saw no relationship between rules governing the behavior of normal children and that of disturbing children, and were fearful of negative criticism. If teachers are to be well-integrated individuals able to foster self-actualization in children, the form of teacher education must be amended to follow its function. Teacher education must encourage creativity and experimentation and provide a model for flexible, dynamic, innovative action so that mistakes may be viewed as opportunities for growth and development.

In general, the teachers surveyed appeared to favor the status quo in certification (four years of preparation for beginning elementary teachers, five years for high school teachers, and continuation or direct applications to the state department of education for issuance of credentials); the one change favored was to credential junior college teachers on the basis of the master's degree only. Most teachers  indicated that preservice courses contributed to professional development. Courses in subject matter related to teaching majors were strongly favored, while courses in subject matter related to teaching minors were less strongly favored. Methods courses received relatively favorable reactions. A low position was accorded to courses in educational philosophy.

When the test results were reviewed with teachers, teachers explained them in terms of broken homes, large families, low family income, poorly educated parents, lack of reading materials in the home, etc. To determine whether the reasons given by the teachers were positively related to achievement, a modification of the McGuire and White Social Status Index was administered to the students in the top and bottom 5 percent in overall achievement. A simple correlation revealed no  significant differences in variables studied for the high and low achievers. Subsequently, hypotheses regarding the problem of student achievement in &quot;inner-city schools&quot; were formulated, and attempts were made to test them. The results have been incorporated into improving the Teacher Preparation Program. Improvements include (1) recruiting students who have demonstrated some degree of scholastic excellence, (2) designing a number of participation and observation activities for prospective teachers, and (3) structuring these activities to correlate with course content.

Every prospective teacher is required to gain a solid foundation in the liberal arts for the first two years in college; major study begins in the junior year. All professional education courses relate to a common objective--&quot;the development of competence to cope with the human and educational problems of the inner city, created by recent changes in the social structure of the urban community.&quot; In addition to courses in curriculum and teaching, general psychology, educational psychology, and educational tests and  measurements, three key courses are required: &quot;American Education: Principles and Practices,&quot; which emphasizes the social structure of the city; &quot;Growing up in the Inner City&quot;; and &quot;Student Teaching,&quot; which usually takes place in the inner city schools of Nashville. Two additional courses are available as electives: &quot;Education in the South&quot; and &quot;Education of the Negro.&quot; At the graduate level, a program to prepare experienced elementary school teachers to understand and cope with educational and social problems of the South has been instituted under the Higher Education Act of 1965.

A 110-statement measuring instrument was developed by means of a series of Q technique ratings by 60 college coordinators of student teachers. To summerize from the Q Sort data, an ideal cooperating teacher is one who is sincere in his efforts to supply intra- and extra-classroom experiences of a professional type for a student teacher; does demonstration teaching before the student teacher instructs the class on his own; strives to improve the working relationship of the student teacher with his class; &quot;gives and takes&quot; in the personal,  private conference in which the student teacher is given opportunities to discuss any actions during the teaching day and to develop his own functional philosophy of education on a constructive, positive basis. When ratings were intercorrelated and correlation matrices were factor analyzed, it was found that the 20 classroom teachers (classified by their directors as outstanding cooperating teachers) and the 20 senior student teachers (selected randomly from those at North Texas State University) strongly agreed with the college coordinators as to the nature of the ideal relationship.

Part 1 describes (1) purposes, methods, and results of projects in the three major &quot;domains&quot; of &quot;variables&quot; studied and (2) facilities and research services that were active during the year. Included are reports on 14 subcategories in the behavioral domain where the emphasis is on various technical skills of teaching, on three subjects in the personological domain (teacher traits and characteristics), and on five elements of the institutional domain (teacher roles in their institutional setting). Part 2 is organized around three subdivisions of the major  educational problem which has become the focus of the Center's program: the fundamental reformulation of the role of the teacher in the decades ahead. The three subproblem areas are heuristic teaching (teaching aimed at self-motivated and sustained inquiry which emphasizes affective as well as cognitive processes and places high premium upon the uniqueness of each pupil, teacher, and learning situation), the environment for teaching (especially school organization and management), and teaching the disadvantaged.

With these considerations in mind, perhaps the most fruitful approach for determining the content of teacher preparation is to describe thoroughly what successful beginning teachers do. From observing the performance of successful teachers in urban schools, six areas of study about teacher behavior may be determined: the nature of subject matter (enthusiasm), the nature of children and youth  (organization), the nature of the educational setting (respect), the nature of the process of learning (standard-setting), the nature of teaching (listening), and the nature of self (introspecting). Based upon this analysis, five courses are proposed as the professional sequence for urban teachers: educational foundations, urban studies, observation and analysis of teaching, educational research, and methods and media of teaching. Suggestions for offering the professional sequence must focus on the nature of the involvement of college and public school personnel in the joint effort of teacher preparation. (Author/SG)",

Attitude was determined by scores earned on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory, while stress was measured by a 14-item inventory. Ninety-seven candidates for the elementary school credential who met U.C.L.A. student teaching admission requirements were randomly assigned to either a poverty school  or an affluent school for student teaching. After the first 10-week assignment (four hours a day, five days a week), student teachers exchanged assignments for a second 10 weeks. It was found that there was no significant difference in mean scores in stress level between those assigned to poverty and affluent schools, assignment in poverty schools depressed attitudes whether the experience was the first or second assignment, and there was little practical difference in numbers of teachers attracted permanently to poverty schools as a result of the kind of school encountered in a first assignment.

A study was designed (1) to estimate the degree to which practice in the microteaching format and feedback from the video tape replay influenced learning in the minicourse model and (2) to determine the effectiveness of the minicourse as a technique for changing the behavior of student teachers. Five groups of 15 to 17 student teachers from three teacher training institutions were subjects of the study. No variables appeared to influence their assignment to groups: three groups  completed the entire minicourse, one was given all but the video tape recordings and replay, and one did no microteaching and received no feedback. Behavior change was measured by trained raters who scored coded 16-minute pre- and postcourse video tapes of each student teaching his entire class. The three research hypotheses were tested using a one-tailed t-test; all three were supported. In general, the groups that completed the entire minicourse made more and larger changes in behavior than the others; and several significant changes occurred in the methods of conducting discussion lessons.

        "description":"It has been demonstrated that interaction analysis is a useful tool for helping teachers not only to hold illustrations of their teaching for future analysis but also to focus on and analyze specific aspects of their verbal instructional behavior. Apparently, four conditions are necessary to enable teachers to analyze and evaluate their instructional behavior: (1) Teachers must want to experiment with and improve their instruction. (2) They must be given a technique or system enabling them to analyze and control their instructional behavior. (3) They must be encouraged to define the types or patterns of instructional behavior with which they wish to experiment. (4) They must have feedback concerning their progress toward instructional goals. Several steps are necessary to make it  possible for teachers to experiment with and to improve their verbal instructional behavior. First, they must be provided with administrative support. Second, a small cadre of teachers and/or supervisors must be trained as reliable observers to serve as a standard of reliability for teachers who will be trained later. Third, development of analyses more complex than the present 10-category interaction analysis could be carried out.

        "description":"Teacher education is a stepchild--unwanted by colleges, permissively accepted by schools, allowed in any and all forms by state departments of education, tolerated by the profession. Attempts to reform teacher education have failed to recognize that the social institutions in which teacher education is embedded (schools, colleges, and state departments of education) were created by society to preserve the status quo rather than to bring about change and innovation. Therefore, a new organizational structure for professional education, the Educational Professions Institute (EPI), is proposed. Leadership for EPIs would be provided by separate units in state departments of education. Nevertheless, EPIs would be separate agencies of higher education with distinct, unique, and  differentiated functions. Drawing their faculty from colleges, schools, and communities in which they were located, they would be largely postgraduate institutions, although they might admit students at any point in their college careers when they were deemed ready to begin a semester of professional education. As prestige agencies, EPIs would pay higher salaries than traditional colleges, universities, and school systems. They would train both teachers and teachers of teachers, and their research activities would focus on the teaching-learning process. (Author/SG)",

A review of the history of laboratory schools in the United States, a review of the functions of the Wisconsin State Universities' laboratory schools, and a report from the Wisconsin Conference on Campus Laboratory Schools (1967) reveal the present status of laboratory schools. It is concluded that while laboratory schools are meeting the roles and functions defined by the Coordinating Committee for Higher Education in Wisconsin in 1959, there is a  need to redefine the roles and functions of laboratory schools, and laboratory schools should continue to deemphasize the student teaching role. Some identifiable emerging and expanding roles and functions include innovation, dissemination, experimentation, demonstration, new designs for teacher education, change, new media development, service, observation, and participation. Finally, laboratory schools may need to modify their administrative organization as emerging and expanding roles dictate.

The Observation Schedule and Record (OScAR), a card which contains a list or taxonomy of behaviors the observer is to look for during a classroom visit and which provides space for recording the frequency of occurrence of each item, may be used to produce profiles to study differences in behavior of effective and ineffective teachers, to measure changes in teachers during training, and to measure the effects of training on teacher behavior. Two research studies have been made using the OScAR technique, one of  New York City first-year elementary teachers (to compare the relative merits of several measures of teacher effectiveness) and one of student teachers in a campus school (to observe changes in their behavior). Both studies illustrate that information about areas where both our ignorance and our need for knowledge are great can be obtained by studies using the OScAR technique. Currently an omnibus instrument, the first part of which deals only with teachers' verbal behaviors, is being constructed for use in a number of projects designed either to do research or to implement educational change.

(5) Community study and  participation and classroom activity run concurrently. (6) Formal university instruction in language arts, social studies, and science is carried out informally in conjunction with student teaching. Personnel needed for the program include a director, a secretary, university lecturers in education, a research assistant, and consultants noted for urban understanding.

Thus, we impart to them a better control and  awareness of their language, enabling them to write and speak in a manner which mirrors, in its cadences and other devices of sound, the \"movement\" of ideas, the shape of an argument, and the activity of the mind.

The program reduces emphasis on credit hours in professional education and replaces them with the 4-year tutorial and clinical program which will, hopefully, acquaint students with the art of teaching and the problems of society and education. Tutorial professors work with small groups in relating academic courses to the student's classroom teaching. Clinical professors, faculty members of both the public school systems  and the university, supervise the student's 2-year practice teaching experience. To prevent it from becoming simply another static formula, this program is being evaluated to determine its effect on the quality of teaching.

        "description":"To determine present trends in junior novels, researchers compared 23 novels written after 1959 with characteristics of junior novels written before that date. The following trends were identified: (1) The action in the majority of novels occurs over a few months. (2) Simple and compound sentences often connected by \"and\" predominate. (3) The unrealistic success of heroes is giving way to success achieved with some difficulty. (4) Characters are fundamentally serious, complex, and dignified. (5) The ages of heroes and heroines vary from nine to middle age. (6) Although the middle-class standards of living are reflected in the majority of the novels, exceptions to this are frequently evident. (7) Profanity or allusions to sexual activity are seldom used. (8) Although the  omniscient point of view predominates, experimentation (e.g., shifts in point of view within a novel) is taking place. (9) Didacticism is evident in most novels. (10) Themes reflect not only the adolescent's problems in growing up, but also some use of satire and the areas of racial tension, science fiction, and the depression years. Many of the recent junior novels are well-written and \"are improving to the point that some of them may well survive as classics.\" (SW)",

Censorship occurs whenever such choices are thwarted by the community. To deal effectively with censorship, the English teacher should know (1) that rational men throughout history have defended censorship on moral, political, and philosophical grounds; (2) that although many censors defend their own judgments emotionally, other censors are philosophical and rational; (3) that censorship is objectionable and the necessity for it unconfirmed; and (4) that goals in teaching literature are enjoyment, understanding, knowledge about contrasting values, and appreciation of art. English departments should establish book  selection committees, demand professionalism from their members, inform the public about policies, devise a procedure for handling censorship cases, and remain calm when the censor appears.

Formal ritual surrounds people and involves all human senses; but printed matter or words separate the senses and reduce reality to a one-dimensional, sequential abstraction, thus interfering with the individual's submersion in the ritualistic experience. Problems with linguistic communication have also occurred in science and art. Because language concentrates on surface qualities and sensory perception, it has proved inadequate to describe recent scientific research, most of which has been devoted to interior structure and to phenomena off the sensorial spectrum, where only mathematics seems capable of  picturing reality. In describing such artistic phenomena as abstract painting and electronic music, in which the senses are directly engaged, language also seems deficient. Because of these difficulties, society has moved away from verbal communication, and literacy consequently appears to be surviving only among the \"drop-outs\" and hippies for whom print has become a medium of dissent.

One method of selection is to rank books in a gradual progression from those requiring little literary and sexual sophistication in the reader to those requiring much sophistication. If books are selected according to this progression, a student's first encounter with love in books will be love without physical description. He will later be prepared for physical description of love placed in easily recognizable moral contexts. In teaching controversial books, the teacher must avoid glossing over \"shocking\" passages in class; arrange for student counselors and the principal to read the books and,  perhaps, listen to discussions; write to parents explaining what is being taught and why; stress to the students that a significant novel says something about man's life; and, most importantly, train the students to maintain an aesthetic distance which is a necessary part of literary discrimination.

Similarly, the critic, in writing a comprehensive study of an author, and usually in examining single works, must refer to details of biography in order to elucidate a work and \"respond to it in its totality.\" While the critic's attention should continue to rest primarily on the work itself, biographical information should be used in introductory, supportive, or  parenthetical positions to help the reader see the unique quality of a particular writer.

Because perception promotes the pleasure that leads to continued reading, the basic step toward improved reading is to increase perception. The \"index-card\" system, which focuses attention on textual explication, invites the student to react to a story and to record on cards his responses, together with the lines or details that prompted them. Then, in class discussion of noted passages, the students can compare their reactions and ideas. Such an approach benefits the teacher because he becomes sensitive to precisely how students respond to particular works and he receives, through their various viewpoints, the raw materials which he can use in a  discussion of the work. More importantly, this method benefits the student by encouraging him to respond to the work, to share ideas with his classmates, and to evaluate his own insights through the class discussion. The pleasure derived from increased perception then leads to additional attempts to understand the story more completely. (LH)",

Charles Schultz's technique in \"Peanuts\" involves understatement and symbolism through which adult personality types act in the guise of children. Walt Kelly's \"Pogo-lingo\"--a purposeful, comic distortion of language employing many puns--becomes part of the cartooning style and, thus, has graphic  value. Like Kelly, Al Capp is a satirist, and his Abner is in the American tradition of the innocent picaro whose responses reveal the shams of society. (JS)",

A profile of the typical North Carolina English teacher reveals a person over 30 years of age who is politically and morally influenced by the values of previous generations; inadequately informed about modern music, books, and movies; and complacent in a segregated school. On the other hand, many of the students with whom the teacher must cope are impatient with the machine-like qualities of adults: their cliches, platitudes, apathy, petty dishonesty, and naivete. Significantly for the schools, these students despise the English teacher who merely follows the curriculum imposed by the state and claims that he  hasn't the time, money, training, or authority to do otherwise. In reality, he possesses untapped power, ranging from public relations to strikes, and has easy access to instructional materials from many sources. Teachers must soon decide that they, not state officials, parents, or students, are the leaders in education. (JS)",

The study revealed no difference in  school achievement between children who were considered to be in need of speech therapy and those who were not; no difference in school achievement whether a child had therapy or not; and no difference in improvement in articulation whether a child had speech therapy or not. A low but statistically significant relationship was found between the perceptual abilities and both articulation and school achievement. (Author/LH)",

Field teams, each consisting of a music education specialist and an orchestra specialist, spent 2 weeks in each city collecting information on the purpose, history, operation, and financing of youth concerts; on the attitudes of teachers, students, orchestra members, supporting organizations, and local citizens toward the concerts; on the preparation of students for both attending concerts and taking part in follow-up activities; on socioeconomic factors governing concerts; and on the need  for concerts as related to their availability. Highlights of the findings included: (1) Youth concerts were generally believed to be vital to a child's education. (2) The success of the concerts depended on the effective leadership of school administrators, teachers, and orchestra members, especially that provided by the conductor in his selection of music and through his personal influence. (3) The symphony orchestras paid about 75% of the youth concert costs and helped raise funds to pay the rest of the costs. (4) Most concerts were given to students in grades 4-9 during school time. (5) Students must be prepared for concerts. (LH)",

The children were asked to make a choice among &quot;professional,&quot; white-collar,&quot; and &quot;other&quot; occupations and were given 18 plates of the Vocational Apperception Test to ascertain their ability to identify an occupation and its locus of performance. Data were analyzed in relation to high and low academic achievement. Girls expressed professional or white-collar goals more readily than boys, but appeared less realistic in their aspirations in terms of their academic achievement. In addition, 59 percent  of academically achieving boys did not express a level of aspiration comparable to the girls, a finding which questions the impact of schooling, even in a Higher Horizons school, on the aspiration of Negro boys.

Within a racist society the schools and its teachers will perforce reflect the dominant pattern in all the components of education. A racist attitude among teachers and school professionals is completely unprofessional, and is predicated on both a falsehood about racial inferiority and a dishonest posture of color blindness or neutrality. Segregation is in fact an abnormal type of relationship, whereas integration is a truly normal one wherein both races would accept each other and work together on an equal footing. The major locus of change must be the white community which has been  responsible for structuring this abnormal relationship. A genuine integration effort should be teacher-initiated and comprehensive, to eradicate segregation throughout the field of education. The emphasis on racial balance in the schools only avoids the need to confront the intangible aspects of racism. (NH)",

The racial balance plan, achieved by busing inner city Negro children to formerly all-white schools, has not had an adverse effect on the academic achievement of white students, nor has it led to a white middle class exodus. The Negro students &quot;tend&quot; to achieve at a higher level. Most parents and teachers are willing to support the racial balance plan and teachers are learning to work out the problems involved in heterogeneous classrooms. School integration was helped by a generally favorable social climate, and especially by the active, positive, stand of the school board and the female opinion and status  leaders in the city. Community acceptance was also gained by the positions of the PTA, the newspaper, the city officials, and consultants. During the summer of 1964, school personnel were prepared for the advent of integration in September. It is felt that the Board erred by failing to actively involve the faculty in the preparation of plans to implement the resolution on racial balance. (See also ED 018 486). (NH)",

This project was designed to identify disadvantaged students with potential for college success who are enrolled in the noncollege preparatory general diploma high school program. Subjects were 148 male students in two New York City schools who were nominated by teachers. The variables of intellectual functioning, personality and social adjustment, and personal goals and motivation were measured by standard tests, school records, a personal data sheet, and a structured interview with a psychologist counselor. The interviewer's recommendation appears to be the major variable differentiating the selected and rejected groups of students. It is felt that a carefully developed  counseling-type inventory for use with teacher-recommended students is probably the best procedure for screening disadvantaged students with college potential. Findings are presented in two tables of statistics. (See also UD 006872.) (NH)",

The Negro students had chosen their school under a freedom-of-choice plan in Kent County, Delaware; i.e., some were going to the local high school but most attended a segregated school. Data were collected primarily to compare differences among the three groups. The tests included measures of ideational fluency, word fluency, problem recognition, judgment, self-other relationships, text anxiety, study habits and attitudes, self-concept of academic ability and socioeconomic status, and other variables. The segregated Negro students showed the lowest performance on the cognitive  tests and the least positive personality characteristics; the scores of the desegregated Negro students were most nearly like those of the whites, who scored highest, although these two groups changed positions on some variables. Several variables demonstrated significant interactions between type of student and sex. It is concluded that freedom-of-choice plans tend to isolate further those Negro students already isolated.

Data were obtained from an experimental group of teachers, instructional leaders, and consultants in the Greater Southwest. The aims of the evaluation were (1) to measure changes in the semantic-differential meaning that the teachers attributed to certain concepts (differences between teachers who had previously received training during the 1965-66 year and those who had not were also compared), (2) to measure their personality characteristics, (3) to determine the actual correlation between changes in meaning (primarily attitudes) and teacher characteristics. The criterion instrument was a semantic-differential device which measured the  evaluative (attitude), potency, and activity dimensions of meaning. One projective test and four nonprojective instruments were additionally used to correlate measures. The results generally showed that ESEA Title I inservice training changed the attitudes of the teachers and leaders toward educationally disadvantaged children, especially migrant children, but had no effect on the attitudes of the consultants.

Criteria specified that an objective should communicate the author's intent, be a statement about the student, specify the criterion of acceptable performan&quot;e, imply the appropriate test or evaluation of learning, and imply appropriate learning conditions. An objective was defined by translating the general goal into a performance statement at the same level of generality. A second set of statements covered all the capabilities to be included for consideration  at that level of generality. This process was continued until the statements produced were descriptions of task performance. To achieve the instructional objectives, each student must be provided with the assistance, guidance, and direction needed for success. The general objective of the guidance program is to assist the student as necessary to insure his progress toward realistic goals of vocational satisfaction, responsible citizenship, and self-fulfillment while encouraging maximum participation in decision making.

        "description":"From October 1 through December 31, 1965, activity was concentrated on the selection of a curriculum and the development of topic objectives within each course of study. The proposed curriculum outlined for grades 9 through 14 is based on meeting the four identified domains of specific vocational, general vocational, citizenship, and self-fulfillment objectives. The specific vocational curriculum is to be prepared for each occupational area of interest to the Quincy Schools and is to specify &quot;key&quot; jobs at each of several levels and competencies required for qualification at each level. The general vocational curriculum areas implied are (1) commerce, industry, and occupations, (2) vocational guidance, and (3) basic technology. The citizenship curriculum phase emphasizes the  family, local group membership, and local, state, and federal issues. The self-fulfillment curriculum contains elements of appreciation of American fiction, American history, and appreciation of the arts. While the broad course objectives describe levels of behavior required for effective use in life, the topic objectives are designed as unambiguous statements of student performance which identify the criteria of success and conditions under which performance is to take place. Curriculum implications, a review of practical problems encountered, and the rationale for topic objectives and procedures for deriving them are included.

Curriculum is being developed in 16 areas including 11 vocational areas, four academic areas, and a new area termed basic technology. In each area, the objectives are stated in terms of the capabilities to be demonstrated by successful students as a result of prescribed learning experiences. A student qualifies for successively higher level jobs or objectives as he progresses through an  individually prescribed learning sequence. Performance tests of the capabilities designated as learning objectives will play important roles in diagnosis, achievement demonstration, occupational certification, retention and generalization, orientation and motivation, evaluation and sequencing of learning units, and evaluation of curriculum effectiveness. Organizational arrangements for developing tests have been made, and consideration of the technicalities of standardization, objectivity, format, and representatives is proceeding.

Its major aims were to provide youth with occupational information and guidance, to help youth see the need for a good education, to provide these youth with financial means to return to school, and to make useful goods for non-profit organizations. Those aims were fulfilled through a simulated industrial setting and an intensive guidance program. Questionnaires and analyses of the Detroit high school population have shown that most youths either have not selected an occupational goal or have selected a goal that is unrealistic for their abilities and potentials. Project PIT's most important aim, the upgrading of the employee's goals and  aspirations and the acquisition of a sound background of the occupations available to them, is an intangible that is difficult to measure in a short-range program; however, results were obtained which indicated a significant shift in educational and occupational aspirations to both a high and more realistic level.

Three kinds of criteria were most often used in research: student gain, rater evaluation, and logical argument. The data from the reviews and interviews were cast into a multi-cell two dimensional model for classification purposes. The second level of the model is a 2 X 2 matrix showing modifiable or non-modifiable attributes which were identifiable from authors' opinions or research data. At the fifth level some cells contain as many as 17 attributes. This system permits a  rational classification of existing information and the storage and retrieval of new information on teachers' attributes.

To try out evaluation procedures, a random sample of 505 students in grades 7, 8, and 9 in six schools provided data for (1) measuring student choices relative to educational and vocational planning, the extent of student ability to make these choices, and the extent to which the student ability to make these choices, and the extent to which the student displayed positive attitudes relative to these choices, and (2) evaluating program activities in each grade. Four instruments were used to gather data: (1) a four-part Educational and Vocational Inventory, (2) Parent Information Questionnaire, (3)  Indices of Choice Quality, and (4) Implementation Record for Guidance Activities. The results suggested that the program had considerable potential and that students would increase their capabilities to make appropriate educational and vocational decisions by completing the program. The appendixes include (1) outlines of the Student Vocational Plans, (2) samples of Activity Forms for student use, material from the &quot;Counselor Handbook,&quot; a job description, a job chart, and occupational analysis chart, and a McBee card for occupational analysis, and (3) the instruments used in this phase of the program.

These proceedings are the result of notes taken by reporters during the sessions and are a synthesis of the main points made. Various sessions summarized in the first part of the proceedings deal with current issues which include such problems as excessive population growth, the crisis in food production, and the slow progress by economic development programs. Substantial attention is also given to guidelines for planning, which establish the framework within which manpower planning is expected to be most  successful, and strategies for human resources planning. The second portion of the Seminar provided participants with an orientation on United States manpower programs. During the third part of the Seminar, participants acted as manpower advisors to a fictitious country. They diagnosed the problems, established strategies for alleviating them, examined the administrative structure for planning, and evolved a final manpower plan. Tables and charts are included. (ET)",

We are about to enter a new phase of history, sometimes called the second industrial revolution, in which work occupies a different role in life. This revolution is predicated upon the fact that the technology of the first industrial revolution can now be controlled at a distance through information systems which rest upon four fundamental technological concepts: (1) Transducers are capable of sensing and transforming experiences into electrical signals, (2) These signals can be communicated over very long distances, (3) The material that is communicated can be captured and stored in electrical  memories, and (4) Logical decision-making machines can transform the recorded information. These four technologies enable man to design systems which can perform control operations both at direct work levels or in the amplification of the human intelligence in a white-collar environment. The design of systems for planning and controlling necessary work, for providing a sense of individual worth, and for making free leisure time a positive goal is among the major responsibilities of any leader in this kind of environment.

Training consisted of a combination of on-the-job training, field trips, and classroom discussion and evaluation. General goals were: (1) identifying tasks that can be performed by semi-professional personnel, (2) developing methods to identify adults who can succeed in this field, (3) developing a training program, and (4) effecting changes in attitudes and degree of involvement on the part of professionals and  institutions. Conclusions included: (1) when first hired, the nonprofessional worker needs a highly structured work situation, (2) the nonprofessional should be responsible to only one person in an agency, and (3) professional schools and associations need to explore the problem of professional supervision of nonprofessionals.

The methodology of the study included empirical observation, interviews, questionnaires, and review of relevant literature. The renewed focus on vocational education at the State and national levels is in response fo socioeconomic problems which have given vocational education a new relevance as a means of reinstating the sense of meaning and purpose to the work life.  Vocational courses in the secondary schools generally lack clarity in objectives and are viewed by key personnel as programs for non-college bound students. The secondary programs are not preparing students for post-secondary programs and the definite lack of articulation and relation makes it necessary for the post-secondary programs to offer remedial work while trying to carry out occupational preparation. Some of the alternatives which offer challenges for curriculum change, including maintenance transformation of vocational education into curriculum aimed at intellectual development, are included.

Previous research concerning withdrawal has been concerned chiefly with factual data about participants. An assumption underlying this study is that the attitudes of students towards certain attitude objects, for example, age, number of children, size o f class, location of school, etc., might be more important than the factual objects themselves. Data were gathered by administering a questionnaire including 39 attitude items and 27 factual data items to 189 dropouts from the Wellesley, Massachusetts Adult Education Program. The primary conclusion of this study was that there are  differences in some initial attitudes of students who complete and of students who drop out of adult education programs, and that these differences are significant. Suggestions for a further research include a need for a study to determine whether it is the attitudes of students or circumstances indicated by factual data that is the more important predictor of withdrawal.

Several tape-recorded personal interviews were used to add to the documentation, and visits were made to towns where the Chautauqua played for the purpose of reading the reviews and talking to persons who attended the Chautauqua between 1912 and 1930. The study found that changes in the social climate of the United States that were brought about by World War I were soon reflected in the fortunes of circuit Chautauqua. It rose to its peak in attendance and profits in the early 1920's and began to decline as a marked influence on American life by 1925. The  availability of other forms of education and entertainment brought about a decline in attendance and ticket sales, and by 1926, the Swarthmore Chautauqua was in decline. One conclusion from this study was that the life cycle of the Swarthmore Chautauqua demonstrates the episodic nature of institutions of adult education. (CH)",

Some major conclusions were: (1) Junior and community colleges had little impact on vocational-technical education, (2) The state staff organization was not conducive to program growth and development, (3) The small high school districts in the state limited the growth of vocational-technical education, (4) The contribution of the vocational advisory council was minimal, (5) The educational effort reflected a degree of confusion, lack of communication, and laggardness, (6) Professional and lay groups showed a high level of interest in vocational-technical education, and (7) High school  programs were not always geared to current needs in business and industry. Some major recommendations were: (1) the development of increased communication between educational leaders and lay leaders, (2) organization of the state's educational system, (3) development of four to six post high vocational-technical centers covering large geographic areas, (4) more effort and financial resources devoted to planned research, (5) development of an expanded vocational-technical education program, and (6) improvement and clarification of certification requirements.

In the United States there have been three stages in the objectification of the concept of a job: (1) the period in which the employer-employee relationship was generally conceived as personal, independent of any other such relationship, and characterized by contractual concepts of mutuality and reciprocity, (2) a period in which access to jobs lay under sole control of the employer, and (3) the present period, in which the employer-employee relationship is not linear but complex, and in  which both employer and employee have an independent relationship to the job and to families of jobs. &quot;Conflict over the Right to Work in Britain,&quot;&quot;France: the Primary Role of Law,&quot; and &quot;Job Security in Mexico&quot; compare similar developments in these respective countries. The evidence from these four countries tends to support the conclusion that the classic liberal contractual approach to the employment relation in a complex industrial society is not a viabl e one.

Some of the conclusions based on the studies are: (1) A sizeable number of the research has been conducted by students as part of a doctoral program, (2) Recent increases in federal funding have not seemed to greatly improve the sophistication of research which has been directed specifically toward trade and industrial teacher education, and (3) The majority of the studies have been concerned with either the teacher education process or the teacher education product. The critique of research serves as a foundation for a model designed to better facilitate the study of trade and industrial teacher education--the model represents the  existing teacher education process which may be viewed as a general teacher education model. However, it provides a unique categorical system of process and effects as well as a series of interdependencies in trade and industrial teacher education. The simplicity of the model permits one to develop as much detail as necessary to study a particular problem and provides a starting point from which research models can be developed. (HC)",

Phase I studied student selection criteria currently in use. Major findings were: (1) Most occupational home economics programs were in large schools, (2) Student interest and teacher encouragement were major selection factors, (3) Only 24.6 percent pre-tested students, (4) About half required parental consent for enrollment, and (5) 72 percent of the enrollees had previous home economics classes. Phase II  investigated organizational criteria, program provisions, problems, and grading. The schools reported use of surveys to determine need, advisory councils, employer interviews, planned observations, and supervised work experience. Seventy-seven percent based grades on both classroom and work experience. Phase III, an investigation of teacher selection, preparation and experience, revealed that most teachers sampled had a baccalaureate degree, at least five years teaching experience, plus other work experience and were trained to teach home economics.

Responses were obtained from 27 administrators in each of four types of schools: technical institutes, comprehensive high schools, vocational high schools, and junior colleges. The most important characteristic of technical institute supervisors was found to be technical knowledge, while vocational education background was most important in the other three types of schools. Characteristics ranked high by all types of schools were vocational education background, general education background, technical knowledge, student-centered approach, and an understanding of basic principles of learning. There was more agreement in what was  unimportant in supervisor characteristics than what was important. Recommendations for future studies of this type included: (1) careful selection of listed characteristics, (2) using an open-end type questionnaire, (3) careful selection of persons supplying the list of characteristics or ranking the list so that they are representative of the types of schools, (4) using an analysis of variance method in analyzing data, and (5) extension of research to identify effective supervisor characteristics.

Thirty-eight percent replied. The study showed that at least 155 family life education programs were listed in Georgia in 1966-67. Most courses were offered to juniors and seniors and were 1-year courses. Family list courses were generally taught by home economics teachers; approximately one-third had master's degrees; nearly one-half had taken graduate courses in family and child development. The major difficulties in providing family life courses were lack of available teachers and scheduling. Recommendations were that: (1) More schools should be encouraged  to offer family life education, not only to juniors and seniors but also to seventh and eighth graders, (2) Research is needed to determine the length of the family life courses, (3) Family and child development units in regular home economics classes should emphasize different concepts in each year, (4) Teachers of family life education courses should be expected to take graduate courses in family and child development, and (5) A survey of available teachers should be made and distributed to school administrators.

A battery of pre-selected standardized tests was administered to approximately 200 entering pupils in Bullard-Havens Technical School. The tests were also administered to about 200 grade 12 pupils who were completing programs in trade machine shop and trade electrical shop in six pilot schools. Achievement tests were developed and administered to these same 12th grade pupils. As a result of this pilot study, the original standardized test battery was reduced  from 30 variables (sub-tests) to 15 variables, thus decreasing the testing time from the original 21 hours to 14 hours on the reduced battery. Subsequen t research indicated that a reduced number of selected variables would yield almost as high a correlation as the original number of variables. A related document is ED 019 437. (CH)",

Questionnaires and interviews revealed that needs ranged from 5 percent per year for dental assistants to 35 percent per year for nursing home personnel. Hospitals estimated increased needs of 62 percent by 1970. Programs selected for immediate implementation were medical laboratory technician, radiologic technologist, medical records technician, medical office assistant, and dental assistant; the associate degree nurs and mental health associate programs were already under development. Other 2-year programs and short-term programs were investigated for future implementation.  Programs were organized within the School of Health Occupations under direct patient service, indirect patient service, administrative service, and health related service, and a curriculum design was worked out for each program by an occupational advisory committee in cooperation with the general education committee. The expanding Medical Center gave promise of adequate clinical facilities. Detailed information about programs to be implemented, those under consideration, and equipment costs are included. (JK)",

The Unit has conducted several research projects either individually or in cooperation with other organizations and agencies. There were 19 projects either completed or in progress at the close of this period. A total of 15 research publications have been issued. A shortage of research manpower was noted as a major and continuing problem.

Data for this study were collected from a longitudinal study of 152 males and females interviewed as high school seniors in 1948 and re-interviewed in 1956. The analysis of data suggests that occupational aspirations are not good predictors of the type of occupation attained. Among the 66 males in the sample, approximately 35 percent were employed in the occupational category which they preferred as high school seniors. Of the 86 females, only 15 percent attained their occupational goals. Data were analyzed to determine the relationship between various social and personal characteristics of the respondents and the degree  of congruency between occupational aspirations and attainments. No differences existed for either males or females between occupational congruency and (1) farm or nonfarm residential background, (2) socioeconomic status of the parents at the time the respondent graduated, (3) educational background of the respondents' fathers and mothers, (4) frequency of discussion of future plans with parents, (5) discussion with persons other than parents concerning future occupations, and (6) being employed at a job while in high school.

Some tentative conclusions pending full analysis of data are: (1) The program has created a vehicle for communication between agencies, (2) The program should be inaugurated in one county with future expansion to surrounding areas, (3) The local coordinator should have approval of area leaders, (4) many trainees have secured employment, (5) No marked increase in available jobs is evident, and (6) both obscurity and excessive publicity can be detrimental to program success.

Returns were received from 92 (46.2 percent) of the firms surveyed by mail and a follow-up telephone survey was made o f a randomly selected 10  percent sample of the 107 non-respondents. Employers reported a scarcity of qualified nursery and landscape workers, golf course workers, and horticulture sales workers. The employers prefer job applicants with training, and sufficient opportunity is available to provide occupational experience with cooperating employers.

The program was proposed under Title I of the Manpower Development and Training Act and included provision for training through the School of Practical Nursing of the New York Board of Education. The innovation in the program was that the trainees could move from the aide to the Licensed Practical Nurse level without disrupting their employment by working half-time and training 25 hours per week while receiving training allowances. Finally in June, 1967 funding was secured and the first training sections of 150 each began the program in September,  1967. Through collective bargaining negotions which were concluded in November, 1966, the union also secured agreement on the establishment of new promotional jobs for aides in nursing, housekeepers, and dietary and the initiation of training for these jobs.

Three comprehensive high schools, three academic high schools, three area vocational technical programs, and three 2-year colleges were supplied with the 200 occupational guides. Of the students who use the guides,  92 percent said they would recommend the guides to other students; 75 percent wanted to keep copies of the guides they had read.

(1) Using the Stufflabeam model as a guide, they were examined to determine what, if any, provisions had been made for each of the four classes of evaluation: context, input, process, and product. (2) They were examined to find out if the evaluation procedures could meet minimal criteria of validity, reliability, timeliness, credibility, pervasiveness, and budgetary adequacy. (3) They were examined to classify the designs, the means of data collection and the populations to be sampled, the criteria that were to be invoked to interpret the data, and the agents that were involved in planning and executing the  evaluation procedures. Three basic lacks were found: (1) the lack of adequate theory, models, and designs to guide evaluative activity, (2) the lack of trained personnel, (3) the lack of appropriate data collection techniques and data processing facilities. It was recommended that Title III take the leadership in mounting three new agencies designed specifically to deal with these three lacks. These three agencies might be tied together by a common board or by an interlocking directorate. (JL)",

There has been some improvement in project quality as a result of the guideline requirements for planning and as a result of several models for planning and evaluation. None of the present models are comprehensive, that is, they do not apply to every conceivably important phase of the project--from its inception to termination. This model is designed to assist all phases of a PACE project.

Various levels of diagnosing the extent of reading probl&quot;ms within the school are discussed, including th&quot; use of tests, informal inventories, and environmental factor assessment. Reading disability treatment is discussed in terms of demonstrating the need for the program, selecting the children, organizing remedial classes, and using special equipment and materials. Model programs operating in 11 school districts throughout the United States are described. They include programed tutoring, use of the coordinator as a teacher consultant, small group remedial work, use of student tutors, use of physical education to  develop reading skills, teacher-parent interaction, use of special equipment and materials, a compensatory program for the disadvantaged, a junior high special class, and preventive programs. Nine steps for remedial reading program organization are listed, and common pitfalls are noted. Sample exercises for diagnostic and correctional procedures are given for perception, word identification, comprehension, reading rate, and oral reading skills. Various procedures for individualizing classroom instruction are recommended. A bibliography is included. (CM)",

Using a case-study approach, a team studied Federally funded public-library projects in 11 states, interviewing State library agency and local public library personnel in each state. The results of the study have two implications for Federal library-services policy: (1) that the formula by which the Library Services and Construction Act funds are allocated to the States should be revised to more realistically reflect State and local attitudes toward public library service, and (2) that the U.S. Office of Education should assume national leadership in the development of research, professional-training, and interlibrary coordination  programs.

Difficulties in class management, supervision, and evaluation have been cited by those opposed to teacher aides. Proponents have cited advantages in meeting crises, recruiting teachers, enriching the curriculum, involving lay citizens in worthwhile activities, increasing student achievement, and creating an atmosphere conducive to wholesome personality development. In general, the use of teacher aides has become an acceptable part of the educational scene. Recent related findings also show that low income, relatively  uneducated nonprofessionals can serve effectively in--and derive benefits from--meaningful teacher aide positions.

There were no great differences in educational philosophy between course-oriented and service-oriented institutions and no clear pattern in the departmental locations of curriculums. Most faculty were professors or part-time professors; their academic backgrounds and degrees were largely in the social sciences, especially anthropology, sociology, and education. Students (largely graduate) reflected various  human service backgrounds, but sociology and anthropology were the leading areas of undergraduate preparation. Degree and course requirements also were centered on the social sciences. Time, money, and staffing were the chief problem areas. Little writing, publishing or innovative planning was noted, however.

The first year three-week training session emphasized the psychology of stages of development, while the second year emphasized discipline and Anna Freud's concept of transitional habits and objects. Trainees, parent groups, and agency administrators completed background, attitude, personality, and rating forms to continuously evaluate program and trainee progress. Various media were used to interest parents in classes. Participating parents felt positively about the class experience, and low income  groups seemed to profit the most. Analysis of trainee testing data suggest that those who had the highest final rating were those who seemed to have changed the least during the training process. The majority of social agencies felt that parent education would remain a permanent part of the agency. (ENABLE, a low income parent education program and outgrowth of this project, is described.)

Goals and effects of the programs overlapped, with participants reporting much satisfaction. General role and behavior changes were toward a greater orientation to people and a liberalization of ideas and feelings. Educational needs pertained mainly to perspective on one's ministry, stronger occupational identity, and the study of rapid social change; regional, age, and program format variations were more significant than denominational differences. It was recommended that such programs should incorporate evaluation research, sponsor  research, and make their goals more specific. The new hypotheses were based on social and emotional effects of residential programs, effects of program structure on morale and vocational commitment, the apparent brevity of program impacts, and the possibility of having many ministers from a given system participate in the same program.

Dairy farming was the major enterprise for 3/4 of the farmers. No Extension recommendations were used by 15% but 20% used seven or more of the nine recommendations. Farmers were most interested in learning about use of fertilizer, dairy herd management, milk marketing, and soil conservation; newsletters, visits from the county agent, weekly newspapers, and farm magazines were the most popular sources of information. High participation in Extension programs correlated with a larger herd, a larger farm, an older farmer, better farm business records, and a wife who participated.  Farmers' wives were most interested in interior decorating and educational opportunities and careers for children. Wives preferred a newsletter and newspapers for information and were almost all very low Extension participators. Work off the farm occupied 24% of the farmers and 35% of the wives. (jf)",

Six types of materials were used for group study: essays, case histories, a retirement checklist, short films, still pictures, and a discussion leader's manual. After 17 measures of change among experimental and control workers, the discussion program did not seem to have changed workers' attitudes toward life in general, retirement, health, or income, but it encouraged participants to take preparatory retirement steps. Wives in the experimental group  completed the program with significantly more favorable scores on health self-appraisal and retirement income, while wives in the control group had a higher score on present income attitudes. Married participants and those with incomes over $7000 achieved higher mean change scores on indexes measuring self satisfaction and retirement attitudes. (Appendixes include tables and 17 indexes.

        "description":"One of the objectives of this paper is to point out that the essential function of Chinese characters for the reader of Japanese is that of mediating, or evoking the sounds of Japanese directly, and the meanings secondarily, as the meanings are derived from the sounds. The author suggests that this is what happens, despite the fact that Chinese characters are known as &quot;ideographs&quot; (graphic representations of objects or thoughts); he prefers to call Chinese characters &quot;morphographs&quot;--they elicit auditory responses, or phoneme sequences, and function as graphic representations of the morphemes of the language. From these phoneme sequences, whether verbalized or silently conceptualized, come the meanings or ideas being communicated. The ultimate step in the evolution of graphic  symbols from representations of objects and thoughts to representations of morphemes is the complete cancellation of any connection that the graphic symbol has with meaning (as in the English alphabet and the syllabary systems of Japanese). Topics dealt with are the Kanji used by Japanese scholars as Chinese words, the use of Chinese characters as phonetic symbols, the introduction of Chinese loan-words, homophony, modern occurrence and function, and recent investigations. In summary, the author states that the occurrence of approximately 2,000 Chinese characters in Japanese writing is excessive and inefficient. (AMM)",

        "description":"Of the approximately 40 languages in Uganda, some are very similar to one another and may be to some extent mutually intelligible. Because no one knows how to measure degrees of mutual intelligibility, the authors are attempting to establish reliable techniques which would be not only of practical value for the study of language problems in Uganda, but also theoretically interesting for sociolinguistics. Discussed in this paper are possible techniques for testing mutual intelligibility--asking a number of informants to assess the extent to which they can understand and follow instructions in the other languages; assessing linguistic similarities. The authors also propose using a system of comparison of lexical items which include common cultural phenomena (avoiding words which  may produce a number of equivalent forms). A new approach to the finding of cognate words in related languages entails eliciting two kinds of word lists from each informant--(1) The informant is asked to give common equivalents for each word. (2) The informant, given the word in the neighboring languages, is asked if there is a similar sounding word with the same or a related meaning in his own language. Also described is a proposal for computing the degree of similarity between each pair of words; the distinctive features will be encoded in binary terms. The authors hope that this data will be processed at the Kampala Computer Centre. (AMM)",

William Moulton described development of the Linguistic Society of America, the Committee on Language Programs of the ACLS, and the Center for Applied Linguistics. He pointed out the contributions and growth of various professional journals, Summer Institutes, institutions giving advanced degrees, and local clubs. Noam Chomsky  discussed recurrent themes in linguistics, relationship with other disciplines, and the synthesis of rational grammar with structural linguistics. Einar Haugen reviewed international developments, the establishment of the Linguistic Society of Europe, the prominence of American linguistics since World War II, the quinquennial congresses and the Linguistic Bibliography guided by UNESCO's Permanent International Committee of Linguists. Charles Ferguson reported on the expansion of Applied Linguistics from second language teaching to include computational linguistics, machine translation, and many other areas. (MK)",

Interrogative sentences share with possible non-interrogative constructions underlying modes characterized as: declarative, positive, interrogative, affirmative, ablative, focussed. (Negative can apply to these and others, but is not relevant to the discussion.) Local  questions correspond only to focussed constructions and are closely related to relative clauses. General questions may correspond to either focussed or unfocussed constructions and are closely related to conditional clauses. (MK)",

The traditional negative correction to standard he calls &quot;eradication,&quot; based on ethnocentric prescription. &quot;Biloquialism&quot; offers the student the option of adjusting phonology, grammar, and lexicon between home dialect and standard. There are dangers in this too, if students and teachers look down on the nonstandard dialect, or consider the standard cynically as merely a means for obtaining jobs or manipulating for power, rather than as a broadened repertoire for social and intellectual communication and a means to understand the system and dynamics of language use. The third approach is to give standard speakers a better understanding of  nonstandard speech, both its forms and its validity. This is sketched rather as training to tolerate diverse language forms than as gaining a useful level of proficiency. The author proposes that English teachers should ask themselves: (1) Is what I am teaching the most important thing for my students? (2) Is my teaching unbigoted? (3) Am I giving my students the most useful alternatives for their self-fulfillment? (4) Am I using the most dynamic and timely principles and data for understanding the system of language? (5) Is my language teaching developing healthy attitudes toward human rights? (MK)",

Since correlational syntax comprises much that is usually considered semantic information, the system demonstrates ways and means of resolving certain types of ambiguity that are frequent obstacles to univocal sentence analysis. Particular emphasis is given to the &quot;significant address&quot; method of programming which was developed to speed up the procedure (processing times, at present, are 0.5-1.5 seconds for sentences up to 16 words). By structuring an area of the central core in such a way that the individual location of bytes becomes  significant, the shifting of information is avoided; the use of binary masks further simplifies the many operations of comparison required by the procedure. Samples of print-out illustrate some salient features of the system. (Author/MK)",

One reader had native fluency in English but heavy interference in Spanish. The other nine readers all had native fluency in Spanish with varying degrees of fluency in English: three had native fluency, three had a slight foreign accent, and three had heavy interference. The taped corpus was first subjected to intensive auditory analysis and description. Stresses, melodic curves, and junctures were marked for each speaker in both  versions. Instrumental processing of the tape recording yielded graphic stripchart displays of pitch and intensity, from which detailed measurements were made for peak pitches and all pause lengths over .3 seconds. Instrumental data were correlated with the descriptions obtained from auditory analysis, and the various versions of the speakers were then compared. Part I of this document presents the theoretical background for intonation analysis and discusses the relationship between interference and intelligibility.

The task was to make up a sentence using each of the noun pairs, with no restrictions placed on the content or syntactic structure of the sentence productions. Since HA and LA pairs of the type used here differ in semantic and contextual featural overlap, it was anticipated that they would also differ in the syntactic relationships within which their members would appear  in the sentence productions.

        "description":"This document comprises two studies. In the first, 108 undergraduates were assigned to nine groups of 12 subjects each in a 3 x 3 factorial design. One factor was prompt word (subject noun, main verb, or object noun) and the other was sentence type (active, passive, or relative. Sentence type was included in the study in order to vary the position of the prompt words. Each subject received two exposures for learning to a list of 12 sentences, homogeneous with respect to type, followed by an unpaced prompted recall task in which they were given either the subject nouns, the main verb, or the object nouns. None of the results of this study was found to be significant. An analysis of the procedure, however, revealed a possible confounding variable. A second experiment attempted to  eliminate this variable by pacing the recall task. Forty eight subjects were assigned to four groups of 12 each in a 2 x 2 factorial design. One factor was prompt word (subject noun versus object noun) and the other was sentence type (active versus passive). Procedures were the same as for the first experiment, except that the prompted recall task was paced. The results indicated no effect of either prompt word or sentence type on sentence recall or ottal word recall. (See related document ED 016 203.) (Author/DO)",

        "description":"The effect of within- and between-phrase normative controlled association and phrase structure upon word integration in sentence recall was studied in two experiments. The two experiments differed only with respect to the type of two-phrase sentence used. In both experiments, one group of subjects was given four study-test trials on a list of four sentences containing associatively related words, while another group received a list containing associatively unrelated words. On the assumption that an integrated unit is one in which adjacent words are recalled together, the probability of a word-to-word transitional error (TE) was used as a measure of the tendency to integrate the words within the sentences into larger units. In both experiments, the results suggested that the words  in low association (LA) sentences are recoded into phrase units, but that the words in high association (HA) sentences are recoded into units that transcend the phrase boundary. The results indicated further that the probability of a TE at the phrase boundary strength across the phrase boundary increases. In addition, the probability of a TE within phrases was higher for LA sentences in Experiment II than for HA sentences. However, in Experiment I, association did not influence TE probability within phrases. (Author/DO)",

The stimuli presented to each group were identical except for a one-step shift on the stimulus continuum. It was found that the response probabilities over the stimuli common to the two stimulus sets were essentially identical for the two groups. Subjects did not evidence a shift in labelling judgments concomitant with a shift on the stimulus continuum. Such a shift would occur if subjects were simply partitioning the continuum psychophysically. It is concluded that categorical perception was observed and that the stimulus-shift  paradigm may be a new technique for isolating the categorical perception effect. (Author/DO)",

To be useful in rhetoric, the procedure must be applicable to widely differing kinds of problematic data. Its range of application, however, has only begun to be explored. Particularly important to its use in the classroom is its ability to aid in the solution of problems of literary analysis. One such problem, the discovery and statement of \"theme,\" can be solved by means of three complementary lines of inquiry which constitute part of the tagmemic procedure. Analyses of the sequential and categorical systems in a literary text provide the basis for discovery of a third system--a network of intersecting categories which constitutes  a statement of theme. Other systemic problems lend themselves to this approach. (Author/DO)",

        "description":"Empathy, or the immediate emotional apprehension of the affective experience of another person, plays an important role in the developmental acquisition of a first language. It is hypothesized that a capacity for empathy contributes to the mastery of the pronunciation of a second language. An operational redefinition of empathic skill as the ability of an individual to perceive and respond to minimal cues in interpersonal interaction has led to the development of an objective measuring instrument. Subjects inspect a human face presented on a film segment that can be projected at varying speeds. Subjects' key-press responses are scored both for overall sensitivity to changes and for accuracy. To illustrate the use of this test, the design of a current research project is  described: empathy test scores are being compared with ratings of pronunciation authenticity and at the same time with scores on the Thematic Apperception Test pictures as well as on tests of intelligence, visual acuity, ability to detect changes in complex patterns, and categorizing style. Incomplete results tend to confirm the hypothesized relation of empathy to second-language pronunciation authenticity. Results strengthen the case for applying clinical concepts to experimental research. (See related document ED 017 898.) (Author/DO)",

Experimental students received both home visits by counselors and group counseling. No statistical difference was found between experimental and control groups in numbers of students receiving  failing grades, being on the honor roll, or dropping from school. Experimental group students were reported for disciplinary action at a significantly higher rate in both the seventh and ninth grades. Experimental group students received higher grades, showed increased interest in educational and vocational planning, and developed more awareness of the need for early economic planning. It was not evident that families increased planning for future educational and vocational goals or consciously created an environment conducive to optimum development. (JM)",

Major reasons for employing welfare recipients lie in the manpower shortage and the need to free professionals for professional responsibilities. It is suggested that agencies consider a system redesign which develops job careers for the preprofessional through the separation of aid and services. Four distinct areas where preprofessionals could serve are as clerical staff, as technicians in the aid delivery system, as various assistants in the services such as homemakers, day care personnel, housing specialist, home-health aides, and employment counselors, and as community workers who provide a bridge between the agency and the community. Selection criteria  should stress life experiences and the willingness to learn with training responsibility undertaken by the agency.

While a minority of these users suffer severe psychiatric problems from drug abuse, there is a decline in admissions to college health services of students with LSD reactions. Marihuana use among students is, on the other hand, on the rise. Of immediate concern is the potential effect of any reality-distorting agent on the future psychological  development of the adolescent user. To understand the problem of drug abuse, it is necessary to look beyond specific agents to the underlying causes of students reliance on drugs.

The first principle of psychedelic drug education may be termed the sympathetic attitude. It involves a thorough understanding of drugs on the part of the college administration, plus the ability to treat drug users, actual and potential, as developing human beings. The second principle for drug education is the provision of complete information on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), pro and con, preferably in a library section where students may find it easily. Information to students should be supplied, if possible, by those persons to whom the students can comfortably give credence. The third principle is the substitution of preferable  alternatives to those students searching for self-insight, since most of them have already rejected the cultural pursuits offered and accepted by other students. LSD is a response to an experienced deficiency. Our institutions are not providing an adequate context for self-exploration, and it is in this area that colleges should think through their curriculum and make changes which would encourage personal growth.

Our society and our colleges sanction and encourage the use of many methods for changing mood, including the use of many legal drugs.

Our society and its colleges are ineffective in preventing and treating problems which arise from abuse of drugs. We seem to be overly vulnerable to the abuse-potential of self-altering drugs. This vulnerability is based, in part, on individual ignorance, prejudice, and emotionalism and on various social, economic, and political pressures and conflicts.

On issues closely tied to campus life, those reacting favorably to the FSM exceeded their peers in sympathy for the promotion of faculty on the basis of teaching, opposition to loyalty oaths, and greater student involvement in university policy. Personality test data concerning independence of judgment suggest that the potential activists had already attained a way of thinking which reflected freedom and emancipation. Environmentally, the potential  activists prefer a situation where they set their own tasks and work independently, and where they have informal access to the staff. Their counterparts prefer traditional classroom organization. The survey conclusion suggests that the student activist is here to stay. It behooves those academicians who will be working with them to learn as much as possible about them so that they can help make the college years fruitful for all concerned. (CJ)",

Examples of the teacher's introduction of the course and projects undertaken by students are given. In class, focus was placed upon communication and coordination within the project groups and upon research methodology as necessary. Transition between the experimental class and the more traditional class was eased by giving explicit instructions about the final report and by using  former students as consultants. A continuing evaluation of the course, both objectively and by student ratings, indicates the goals of enabling students to observe, to find new communication skills, and to transfer learning outside the classroom are met in such a laboratory approach.

This study makes use of a data bank, collected especially for research purposes, which is longitudinal in nature. The base sample for the present study were all of the 1961, fifth-grade students from a Northeastern urban school system, who were tested as part of the Study of Academic Prediction and Growth. The dropouts in this sample were representative of those people in the school system who progressed normally from fifth to seventh grades and who withdrew from school before their fifth-grade  class completed 11th grade. Conclusions indicate that data readily available at the outset of the fifth grade will point out those persons who are potential dropouts. Programs aimed at remediation should be started much sooner than they have been traditionally. Plans are underway to replicate this study in another school system in an attempt to generalize the results. (CJ)",

The four studies summarized here involved the same psychological variable measured by an abbreviated version of the Bass Social Acquiescence Scale. Studies one and two involved a double-blind comparison of diazepam (valium) and a placebo, and involved 20 psychiatrists and 60 anxious outpatients. In a third study, four pairs of women outpatients selected on the basis of extreme acquiescence scores were treated in a double-blind study of chlordiazepoxide (librium) and a placebo. In the fourth study, 28 medical students were selected on the basis of extreme  acquiescence scores and randomly assigned to secobarbital and placebo groups. These experiments indicate a link between over-generalizing and reactions to mild tranquilizers. The findings also raise questions about effective treatment for high acquiescers and about the relationship between acquiescence and both beneficial and adverse drug effects. (KP)",

The concept of externalization is the root of many difficulties. Rational Emotive Therapy, as appropriate for children as it is for adults, attempts to confront the client with his basic irrational assumptions. It seeks to make him understand that it is his evaluations which create his emotional upsets, and seeks to get him to  challenge his internalized thoughts and implement the necessary corrections.

No conclusions were drawn from these studies, because there was little evidence of convergent and discriminant validity in comparing peer-ratings with self-ratings. With a new sample of  acquainted Peace Corps trainees, moderate convergent and discriminant validities were obtained. In a similar sample of unacquainted subjects, the relationships between peer-ratings and self-ratings were lower, and relationships between predicted peer-ratings and both other ratings were lower and less uniform as well.

In general, the program was perceived as fitting in well with the school environment, with the possible exception of some shortage of facilities and time. It was also noted that an overlap of counselors' and school social workers' functions might have led to some  conflict. Contrary to the stipulation in the program definition that the counselors' services are available to students during the school day throughout the academic year, it was found that counselors spend only three-fourths of their time performing counseling activities.

Examples of characteristics that impose limiting conditions on the application of existing learning theories are discussed. Individual differences in children clearly lead to different approaches to learning, and need to be studied further. A  recent experiment in paired-associates learning indicated important differences according to sex. The ways in which incentives influence learning at different levels is another area for research.

Recommendations for further research are made. Administrators at Texas A&amp;M University are considering incorporating some of the findings of this study into the school's academic-vocational counseling program. (CJ)",

The junior-high years are important because 30% of those who drop out of schools drop out during this period. Ohio has taken steps to provide continual updating of the vocational information held by their counselors, under the impetus of the 1963 Vocational Education Act. Workshops and summer guidance seminars are held at approved Ohio counselor education institutions, with additional advanced workshops being held for those counselors who have already attended at least one seminar. Realizing that a good vocational guidance program is dependent on a good attitude toward technical education, Ohio educators are attempting to devise a completely new  program for vocational and technical educational studies, for presentation to the next session of the Ohio General Assembly. The targets of the program are the 30,000 dropouts and 60,000 graduates with so general an education that they have no marketable skills. The aim of the program is to eradicate the stigma which has long been attached to vocational education, and raise the status of technical education, so that parents and students alike will have a healthier outlook toward the work world.

In the school area, there was a high concentration of families receiving aid to dependent children (ADC), a high dropout rate, high teacher turnover, and traditional faculty orientation. Student awareness was stimulated through counselor visitations to the classroom, assemblies, career days, and the distribution of a guidance information booklet. Group meetings with teachers were held to discuss the objective of the program, the interpretation of test results, and special education placements. Contact with parents and community groups was made through newsletter articles, the local newspaper, Parent-Teacher Association meetings, and a radio interview with one of the counselors involved in the program. The guidance committee developed procedures for identifying potential dropouts in the fourth grade so that counselors could give extra assistance to those pupils. Evaluation of the study shows clearly that staff members, pupils, and parents have been receptive to elementary guidance. Recommendations by a consultant were that the counselor-pupil ratio be reduced to 1:500 as the program expanded. Materials for elementary guidance orientation programs and for identifying potential dropouts are appended. (CJ)",

Critical counseling requirements on sub-roles were: (1) creation of an acceptant therapeutic climate, (2) collaboration between counselor and client in a mutually controlled experience, (3) picturing client problems through relation of client ideas and counselor observation to the client's vocational potential, (4) giving information and facts, (5) definition of limits and  responsibilities, (6) gathering information about the client, and (7) arranging appointments and referrals for the client. Trained counselors were significantly more concerned than untrained counselors with (1) ability to establish a counseling relationship, (2) recognition of client readiness for counseling, and (3) effective interpretation of professional opinion and facts. Trained counselors emphasized working together with the client, while untrained counselors emphasized advising or directing the client.

Findings indicate that conflicting views of the principal's role are held both by the principals themselves and by the other populations studied. With the principal identified partly as an administrator and partly as a member of the teaching staff, he tends to be associated in part with each of the roles and not completely with either. This role ambiguity may lead to low morale and to ineffective performance by elementary school principals.

Recent systems models guiding the longrun analysis of school management in terms of efficiency--through cost-benefit studies, systems analysis, and program planning and budgeting systems--are in sharp contrast to the traditional, conservative, shortrun process of school budgeting and accounting designed primarily to safeguard public monies. Cost-benefit analysis offers a systematic method by which benefit maximizing and cost minimizing choices can be made for a particular system and set of objectives. Systems analysis encompases cost-benefit analysis within its larger framework and allows the choice of alternative purposes for the  system under study as well as choices among alternative materials, personnel, and management procedures. Program planning and budgeting systems are the most innovative, comprehensive, and change-inducing of these approaches. They focus attention on the choice of (1) objectives to be achieved, (2) the system by which to achieve these objectives, and (3) the plan which will accomplish the objectives at the lowest cost. Application of these models, which is imperfect at present, has the advantage of requiring a careful and disciplined analysis of school management problems. (TT)",

The National Opinion Research Center interviewed the school superintendent, school board members, civil rights leaders, other political leaders, and members of the business elite in eight large cities. The study found that decisions on civil rights policy made by school board members were not directly influenced by outside civic or political elites but were based on the board members' personal attitudes. However, school board composition was found to be determined by the overall influence of the cities' civic elites and the strength of political parties. Civic elites are described not as hierarchical power structure but as a diffuse \"class\" having  a common set of values. Although conflict between civic elites and political parties exists in each of the cities, civic elites have more influence over the selection of board members in those cities having strong political parties. The most important reason for this paradox is that a strong party serves as a barrier to prevent the leadership from being heavily influenced by public opinion. (JH)",

Conclusions show (1) no significant differences among the administration, NEA affiliate officers, and AFT affiliate officers, regarding areas of importance, (2) significant differences regarding the areas in which teachers should be involved, and (3) a mixed reaction regarding the methods teachers should employ to obtain their goals.

The findings and recommendations are based on (1) a comprehensive review of existing personnel practices in State education agencies; (2) a review of personnel management practices in business, industry, and government; and (3) a review of recent literature dealing with modern concepts of personnel administration. The major findings are that most State education agency personnel programs are severely hampered by (1) lack of professional personnel leadership, (2) the control of their appropriated funds being held by outside agencies, (3) low salaries paid their professional staff, (4) lack of attention given to  motivating employees, and (5) ineffective communications in the agency. Extensive guidelines suggest ways for the agencies to improve their personnel administration, and a scorecard for each guideline can be used by the agency to evaluate its existing personnel program. Selected references and a glossary of terms are appended. (TT)",

The principals and their staffs were observed by trained observed in the fall and again in the spring, following attendance at the six seminars by the principals. The observers used an adaptation of the Crispan System of Interaction Analysis to categorize the indirect-direct behavior of the principals. Paper and pencil tests were used to  examine morale, perceptions of the role of the principal, and satisfaction with the group process and decisions in faculty meetings.

Implications drawn in summarizing the study were that the deaf were not a homogeneous group, but they did have in common varying degrees of difficulty in communication, difficulty which handicapped them in many ways. Although none of the difficulties faced by the deaf was found insuperable, their successful adjustment  demanded planning by both the entire community and the deaf individual, and, if the hearing community were to participate effectively in planning for the welfare of the deaf, its members had to have social contacts with the deaf and a practical knowledge of deafness and the problems of the deaf.

Tests given upon entrance were the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Walking Board Motor Ability Test, the Winter Haven Form Copying, Visuals I, and Ocular Motility. Tests given in May were the Winter Haven, Visuals III, the Gates Primary Word Recognition, and California Low Primary Reading Test and Letter Matching Form. (Tests were also administered in March.) The Winter Haven was the best predictor of reading achievement with a correlation of .45 with composite reading scores, and 32 (67%) of the  bottom 48 scorers on the Winter Haven were among the lowest 65 scorers on reading on the Gates Test. To evaluate modifiability of perceptual skills and their relation to reading abilities, 14 children who scored poorly on the pretests were assigned to two treatment groups. One group received daily 20-minute visual-motor-perceptual training and the other group did not\" The groups were combined for reading instruction for 5 weeks in the spring. Learning improvement from March to May because of visual-motor-perceptual training was significant at the .05 level. (LE)",

Initially, 117 public school programs for the emotionally handicapped were located and surveyed by mail; then 54 programs were selected for site visits. Areas surveyed were the origin and operation of the programs, general characteristics of pupils, and classroom conditions and operations. The following conclusions were drawn: pupils, teachers, and observers found positive change as a result of participation, and program types were shown related to changes; specific pattern and uniformity in approach were lacking; school personnel realized  that their original program plans required extensive modification and that flexibility was needed; program types differed widely; programs maintained a school related focus; and clinical support and understanding were helpful.

        "description":"In investigating patterns of family relationships conducive to creativity, several inventory-type personality tests and a questionnaire about family relationships and childhood interests were sent to 99 Mills College alumnae 5 years after their graduation and to the siblings of 51 of them. All had been tested, while seniors, for personality and some had been selected as creative by the faculty. The 12 of the 51 who had been picked as creative had nine sisters and eight brothers participating while the comparison 39 had 31 sisters and 28 brothers participating. The creatives had higher verbal aptitude scores and made better grades than the other seniors (p .01) and since graduation had shown a higher level of creative activity (p .001). The brothers and sisters of the creatives  consistently made higher scores than siblings of other Mills women on the indices of creative traits; they had a higher educational level (p .01); and the brothers received more honors for intellectual distinction (p .01). For the creative Mills sisters, support was found for the conceptualized pattern of having the following: dissatisfaction with their relationships in the family, symbolic facility and an approach to the world focused on the potential or intuitive rather than the practical, and confidence that they could intervene in symbolic affairs and could by their efforts and initiative gain a more satisfying set of relationships.

The principal causes of blindness were retrolental fibroplasia and congenital cataracts. Almost 63% had two or more additional disabilities (86.8% of those under age 6), such as mental retardation (80.2%), speech problems (38.9%), brain damage (35.1%), emotional problems (16.7%), cerebral palsy (14.4%), epilepsy (14.0%), chronic medical problems (7.0%), crippling (4.9%), hearing impairment (10.6%), cosmetic defect (6.1%), orthodontic defect (4.0%), and cleft palate (1.0%). Although half of the sample was 13 or older, only 4.4% functioned at secondary school level; 130 children were reported who had reading  vision but used braille; the reported mobility performance data were found unreliable. The estimated number of MI blind children in the United States is 15,000 with 300 more diagnosed each year. Suggestions were made for research and services. (LE)",

The children were given 40 selected words to obtain definitions, experience claims, and visually oriented verbalism scores. They then tried to identify items representing these words. The Tuddenham Reputation Test was used for adjustment scores. Significant negative correlations were obtained between chronological age and verablism, between IQ and verbalism, and between experience and verbalism. There were no significant negative correlations between personal adjustment and verbalism nor between chronological age, IQ, experience, or personal adjustment with visually oriented verbalism.

Three groups of cases were identified: the most severe, composed of persons poorly established in the community, most frequently single unskilled males and often diagnosed schizophrenic; the second most severe, composed of persons with personality disorders, often married, whose vocational adjustment was the poorest before illness and still poorer after; and a third group made up of older, better established patients, often depressed, whose subsequent adjustment tended to demonstrate a loss of status. Services for the three groups varied in source and extent. A second study was made of factors influencing the  vocational success of 169 severely disturbed as by the criteria above. Vocational counseling and a workshop were provided, but vocational success was limited: approximately one-third worked one-third of the time, one-third worked half-time, and one-third not at all. Nor were symptoms reduced. However, success was shown to be clearly related to measures of cognitive functioning and little related to personality structure.

Groups included 16 mentally retarded students (IQ range 53 to 88, mean 78; Social Maturity Quotient range 60 to 80; academic retardation of at least 3 years), 38 slow learners (IQ range 83 to 105, mean 96), and a control group of 32 Track 3 low intellectual and achievement level students. All were pre- and posttested with the Occupational Aspiration Scale; the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales and the Socio-Economic Scale were also used. The mentally retarded, who received both on the job training and occupational information, and the slow  learners, who received just the occupational training, reduced their total occupational aspiration and idealistic level significantly (p<.01) when compared to the control group who did not significantly reduce either one. However, the slow learner group, in contrast to the mentally retarded, actually increased their idealistic level, indicating that on the job training was more effective than occupational information alone.

Data analysis consisted of the oblique simple structure criterion and analysis by item packages. Results with 325 clients, whose literacy levels and verbal  sophistication were below the sixth grade level (including 216 who completed both forms), implied that items meeting the above standard were derived.

Of the 304 known institutions in the United States, 292 returned reports. Approximately 51,000 children (79% boys) were living in the facilities, an increase of 16% over 1964 and a rate of 195 per 100,000 of the total child population in the country (aged 10 to 17). Further findings were as follows: in over 50% of the institutions, children stayed 8 months or less; 80% of the institutions were operating under state, and 20% under city and county auspices; 38% had a capacity for over 150 children, the maximum capacity recommended by the Children's Bureau; and four out of 10 were overcrowded. There  were 2.2 children for every full time employee (administrative, treatment, educational, operational, and maintenance). Average per capita operating expenditure was $3,345 and a total of $184 million spent by all institutions, a 37% increase over the 2-year period from 1964 to 1966.

Seven days later, prompting subjects committed fewer errors in relearning (p .001) and were superior in recognition (p .01).  Confirmation was further tested under two new conditions: in one, praise and candy reinforced all correct responses; in the other, they were given only upon correct first choices during practice trials.

Intervals were 3 seconds, 9 seconds, and 18 seconds respectively for the first time order in which one group read the word aloud (vocal condition) and another group thought it silently (silent condition). The two groups in the second time order were divided the same way but the sequence of time intervals was reversed. M&M candy reinforced correct responses. The predicted depressed curves were obtained for the silent condition with both  orders. The main effects of order and vocalization were significant (p .01); the reversed time order groups produced more correct responses and shorter response latencies (p .05); and the vocal condition subjects had the greater number of correct responses (p .05) and a shorter response time (p .01).

Teacher ratings and clinician judgment of figure drawings indicated that the experimental students showed a significantly more positive orientation towards social interest (p .05); however, the social interest was not reflected in behavioral change.

Student age, intelligence, and level of pretest performance were held constant statistically. Analysis of the pre- and posttest data by a statistician indicated no significant difference in achievement between experimental and control  groups. There was, however, a highly significant difference between teachers on the subjects taught: earth science, p=.0008; modern mathematics, p=.00005; algebra, p=.00005; geometry, p=.00005; and world geography, p=.00005. The project identified desirable modifications and some characteristics of high quality overhead transparencies for the deaf, and it was concluded that using a sizeable number of consultants in a cooperative approach to educational research is a successful and efficient method.

Results generally supported the conclusions that homogeneous responding increased in a linear fashion across age with the more frequently occurring form classes leveling off in some instances, and followed a regular sequence of development regardless of intelligence group. Performance level differed for retardates when they were compared with the superior  group and, in some instances, with the normal group while performance level does not differ when normal and superior groups are compared.

Pairs were shown for 15 seconds while the subjects wrote down any associative device or NLM they could generate that would link both items in the pair. The association value (AV) of pairs varied between pairs. The proportion of subjects able to make an association was the associability value (AS). Results indicated that AS and AV were correlated although AS varied among pairs with items about equal in AV. Experiments run after the AS scale was obtained demonstrated that AS was valuable as a predictor of learning rate. In addition, AS values were  highly correlated with the frequency of NLM's in the post-experiment reports. It was concluded that the AS measure represents a valuable addition to our understanding of the complexity of verbal learning. Seven tables provide data. (Author/RP)",

Results with the 36 remaining at the end of the 3rd year indicated that most characteristics central to vocational development were stable by early adolesence; a \"competence cluster\" of variables covaried systematically; high and low employability groups differed on most basic status variables; and the Purdue Pegboard was the best single predictor of employability. However, neither the control and experimental groups nor the attrition group and the remaining 36 differed significantly. Two employability groups were determined by production and ratings: the high group, composed of lower class Negroes, ranked higher than the low group, of middle class whites, on  work behavior ratings and IQ levels. The magnitude of the level of aspiration ratios tended to correlate negatively with the employability index and the competence cluster; self concept variables correlated positively for employability for Negroes and negatively for whites. The followup of 33 subjects in the 5th year indicated that when the relationship between rated employability and actual adjustment was calculated, the resulting prediction was significant (p .03).

        "description":"Structured by a three-dimensional learning theory model, an experimental teacher education project was designed to develop creativity in elementary school children. In this model, the interaction of standard curriculum and 23 project-oriented teaching strategies produced the components of productive-divergent thinking: fluency, flexibility, elaboration, originality, curiosity, risk-taking, and complexity. The National Schools Project conducted inservice training workshops at six project school sites to acquaint teachers and school administrators with methods of eliciting these components of creative thought. Ideas generated, classified, and field-tested by project teachers during training constituted the analytic basis for evaluation of training effectiveness. Experience with the  pilot project indicates that inservice training should be continued in the operational phase to improve the teacher's familiarity with these progressive educational strategies. Appendices to this report consist of illustrative handout materials utilized during the five general workshops; independent evaluation data collected at three project schools; and a sample copy of &quot;Classroom Ideas for Developing Productive-Divergent Thinking,&quot; a collection of teaching ideas. Annotated reference lists classify 93 books and 47 films by grade level, thinking process, teaching strategy, and subject area. (TI)",

Of the 137 operating NAEB radio stations, contributing to the insufficient news communication resources of the nation, 73 responded to a questionnaire on live networking, and 67 expressed degrees of interest in participation. A sample broadcasting schedule was based on the assumptions of an eight hour broadcast day, a general listening audience, and live transmission. Some of the advantages of such a network, programed on a mutual basis with plans for a modified round-robin service, would be improved educational programing, widespread  availability, and reduction of station operating costs. Using 13 NAEB stations as a round-robin basic network, the remaining 39 could be fed on a one-way line at a minimum wireline cost of $8569 per month; the equivalent cost for the complete network would be $17,585. As the national network develops through interconnection of regional networks and addition of long-haul telephone circuits, a national headquarters should be established. The report covers discussion generated by each planning division in addition to regional group reports from educational radio stations. (TI)",

Selected values of the independent variables were investigated within a 3x3x2 factorial design, and the experimental treatments were randomly ordered and assigned to 180 graduate students. Three experimental films were prepared, each containing 24 identical performances of the criterion task, an unfamiliar knotted figure. The films were photographed simultaneously at different speeds: normal speed and two slow motion speeds, with verbal instructions programed on tape cartridges. This method allowed examination of three levels of massed-spaced practice and concurrent-nonconcurrent  practice. A criterion testing period followed the single practice period to evaluate four dependent variables, involving step analysis scores and the number of criterion tasks completed. Using variance analysis and the Duncan New Multiple Range Test, significant F ratios were calculated for the main effect of rate. The slower rates were found to be more effective. The data suggest that further research may reveal significant differences for concurrent-nonconcurrent practice modes and may demonstrate interactions. (TI)",

The data from this survey, based on the questionnaires returned by 135 stations, documents the broad overview of this report. Educational radio's greatest potential service to schools, professional people, commercial stations, the socially disadvantaged, and the community in general has been severely limited by low budgets, small staffs, and a lack of both audience research and program promotion. The National Educational Radio Network (NERN), which distributes tapes of programs to its 150 affiliate stations, offered  1,895 programs (31,371 hours of broadcasting) in 1966, yet the survey determined that the average station operates on an annual budget of less than $25,000. Appendices include statistics gathered in the survey; a sampling of organizations and commercial stations served; a list of educational radio stations; a few in-depth profiles of typical stations; and a report on the third phase of the Educational Communications Systems Study which is being designed to interconnect electronically a group of American colleges and universities.

Questions of ownership of recorded material should be resolved, and institutions should be prepared to trade off some of their rights as inducements to faculty to make better use of the medium. Television courses should be under much the same academic control as conventional courses; that is, while accepting technical and production assistance from the television unit, departments and instructors should have the ultimate responsibility for methodology and for revision and re-use of material. The provision of suitable incentives for faculty has been neglected. Means of providing adequate and  fair rewards in terms of money, released time, or professional advantage will have to be found. University policies should be devised which can overcome the existing, indifferent-to-negative attitudes on the part of most college faculties, as they are more likely to encourage the use of television if they share in its benefits. A council representing the groups concerned should be formed to make necessary policy decisions, to serve as a review board, and to act upon cases of dispute. (PB)",

Interactive uses of computers for instruction include drill strategy, author-controlled tutorial, and &quot;dialogue&quot; tutorial; simulation and gaming; information handling, computation and display (scholarly aids); computer aids for instructional management; and computer-based tools for the author and researcher. The variety of lessons, systems, and languages for computer-based instruction  depends on instructional objectives and on records of student performance. (TI)",

        "description":"An experiment was designed to compare two alternative procedures for revising a preliminary version of an instructional program, one based on a subjective analysis of the program's behavioral goals, the other on an objective analysis of test data obtained from a trial of the unrevised program. Conforming to an experimental model, 20 programer-instructors were randomly assigned to subjective and objective treatment groups to produce 20 videotaped supplements to the basic prerecorded lesson on English money. The effectiveness of the videotaped revisions was then tested in sixth grade classes, using the mean posttest score in each class as the measure of achievement. The scores produced by the revised programs occurred in the expected order of magnitude (significance factor p  .0013), with the original program proving least effective, the subjective revisions more effective, and the objective revisions most effective. No significant correlation occurred between program effectiveness and the amount of either academic training or teaching experience possessed by the programer. The experimental model employed in the study appeared to be a valid guide for assessing the relative effectiveness of programing techniques. A programer's instruction booklet and the script of the basic program are appended to the report. (TI)",

        "description":"Programed instruction may be more efficient and effective when an individualized, fixed pace is chosen for the student. Three studies done in the Pittsburgh city schools to determine the relative merits of instruction at a fixed pace versus a self-adopted pace and several results. In the first experiment, one in which students paced themselves, some chose a rate which produced more errors and a lower posttest score than was expected. Work rate and ability varied independently but showed a consistent pattern for each student from program to program. The second experiment investigated a variety of pacing techniques. The slow tempo, fixed-paced presentation resulted in higher group achievement scores but caused efficiency to suffer since some students apparently were forced to work  more slowly than necessary. In the third experiment, where external pacing was employed to help offset difficulties attendant on increased tempo, the cuing or pacing did lower error frequency but did not improve achievement. Results also provide some indication that multi-track programs with varying tempos, which are prescribed for students based on their characteristic work rate, might result in the most efficient and effective instruction. The studies may be particularly relevant when using a medium (e.g., television) which requires a fixed-paced presentation. (JY)",

Several specific theories of perception are presented in a condensed form. Some guidelines for planning and evaluating a communications program are laid down. The choice and  use of effective design and appropriate medium for visual communication are discussed. Some solutions to problems in obtaining, coordinating, storing, and filing visual materials are offered.

Education's role in economy should be to develop the quality of human resources necessary to keep up with and influence the region's growth.

The study represents a compilation of data collected from 100 individuals directly involved in or affected by SREB's work. Through SREB identification of educational needs and suggestions on how they might be met, the South's first campaign to popularize higher education was initiated. By focusing on content and practice, the campaign helped legislators to recognize the necessity for allocating funds for quality education. Another innovation was to help develop and operate student contract programs, in which students could cross state lines for professional and specialized education and thus prevent costly expansion of existing  institutions in each state for advanced study in specialized areas. Increased population and knowledge, however, made campus growth inevitable. Governors who served on the Board later demanded federal support for the improvement of graduate research programs. SREB conferences, studies, proposals, publications and participation in educational decision making have helped to establish 50 new institutions and expand many others in scope and capacity. These achievements have gained stature for SREB among state government officials, a limited group of university presidents, deans and directors, national private foundations and college and university associations. But prestige drops sharply within the academic community where SREB accomplishments are unknown. (WM)",

Among the recommendations are: the ability of institutions to provide quality educational programs at all levels for students having a wide range of backgrounds and interests should be strengthened. Education should be provided at a cost most students can afford. Basic research should be expanded and its results used in solving human problems through applied research. Through programs such as the Education Professions Development Act and others, the vocational and professional competence of individuals should be improved. University resources should be made  available beyond the campus. The federal government should give greater support to the arts and humanities, help provide genuine access to educational opportunity, and help strengthen the capacity of all educational institutions to assist developing countries and to understand the role and responsibilities of the US in the world. The 2 Associations are strongly opposed to proposals, such as tax credits and required fees, that would throw more of the cost of higher education to the student rather than to society--the main beneficiary. They also oppose proposed programs that would increase discrimination against low-income students, or programs that would reduce the accountability of those receiving public funds for their use. Broad federal support on an institutional basis is urged.  (JS)",

In recent years, all universities have been moving toward a new kind of total role in society. Because their endeavors are costly and pressures for growth are sure to continue, there is concern whether traditional sources of income will be adequate for the future. Data on expenditures per student and faculty salaries indicate public higher education is entering a new phase of expansion with an already strained financial structure. Of the 4 principal sources of  revenue--state and local tax appropriations, student fees, endowment gifts, and federal aid--state revenues and endowment funds are unlikely to keep pace with need. Proposals have been made to pass a greater share of the costs to students. But one must consider that college remains the domain of the middle and upper class, that a tiny proportion of students are Negro, and that a major national goal is to place low-cost higher education within easy reach of all economic groups. Ways must be found to extend the traditional public university into the city and to provide a curriculum there that effectively broadens the outlook of vocation-minded students. To meet the increased challenges, interinstitutional agreements will become more common. (JS)",

In the California state university system, faculty government has developed to an advanced level although the cry of &quot;all power to the faculty&quot; is still heard. But if the faculty is heavily involved (often 10-15 hours a week) in the many facets of an extremely complex state administrative structure, who will teach (except perfunctorily) or do research? The results of overestimating the faculty's capacity for self-government are: waste of precious trained manpower, loss of talent as many faculty members completely abandon administrative responsibilities or become full-time administrators, emergence of the professional &quot;politico,&quot; and, more important, further fragmentation of knowledge and the educational process since there is no general agreement within academic senates on the ends of education. The culture, graduate schools, and desire for professional status all nurture specialization. To preserve the faculty AS faculty, institutions should be jointly operated by faculty, students and administrators. And if administrators demonstrate respect for faculty views and participation, there is hope that faculty members will realize their limitations and concentrate on policy matters while administrators tend to the store.

The program involves full transferability of all general education requirements, and those major requirements approved by the degree-granting college, for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years. Exposure to the different intellectual, moral and social climates at each of the state colleges as well as their varying special academic resources should significantly enhance the students' educational experience and reduce the high drop-out rate during the first 2 years of college. The MSCCM would not require changes in state law or State Board regulations and administrative costs would be minimal.  To aid students who may have a differential in living costs, federal and private funds will be sought. Further steps in the MSCCM call for development of additional newly designed academic programs, faculty interchange, and a common market exchange agreement with all other components of higher education in Minnesota. Publicity materials giving the details of the program are included. (JS)",

        "description":"The associative behavior of 24 male chronic schizophrenics and 24 normal control subjects (male) equated for age and educational level was investigated. Free and restricted associations were obtained to analyze the organizational aspects of associative behavior as well as the number of unique or common responses per task, response repetitions under different task instructions, and agreement in responses among both groups of subjects. The associations of schizophrenics were more variable than those of normal subjects especially on tasks which restricted most the choice of responses. Agreement in responding between normal and schizophrenic subjects was markedly lower when compared with that between high and low creative subjects or with one-year test-retest data of a heterogeneous  group. Repetition of responses given to the same stimuli under different instructions was markedly higher for schizophrenics, and thus, the degree of task/response differentiation was reduced. The restricted associations overlapped with free associations more markedly for schizophrenics, but the general structure of a conceptual semantic space was about the same for both groups. The authors feel that when explicit constraint in tasks of verbal associations in high, schizophrenics (more than normals) impose a low degree of implicit constraint upon their verbal behavior; when the external constraint is low, they increase implicit constraing.

        "description":"The evaluation of 'deviant articulation' (that of young children, speech defective persons, aphasics, second-language learners) has usually consisted of two activities: transcription of the speech being evaluated, and comparison of the transcription against some 'standard' set of 'target' sounds. Any transcription is a description of a speaker's articulation in terms of the auditory and perceptual capacities of a transcriber. This paper presents a method for the transcription and quantitative analysis of deviant articulation. The method is based on (1) analphabetic transcription using binary articulatory categories , and (2) analysis of the transcripion in terms of the perceptual performance of the transcriber as measured by the Theory of Signal Detectability (Tanner and  Birdsall, 1958).

Twenty-two undergraduates (ten female and 12 male) at the University of Michigan served as subjects. It was hypothesized that learning rate should be a function of the amount of cognitive adjustment the subject had to make to the stimulus material measured by changes in semantic differential ratings of the stimuli before and after they were learned. Results showed two groups of fast learners, one of which made significantly less changes than the slow learners, and one significantly more. Systematic directional shift on the evaluative, potency, and activity  dimensions of the semantic differential were also found. The author feels that these findings lend considerable support for the applicability of Piaget's processes of assimilation and accommodation to the learning process and that identification and investigation of internal processes of this type will be necessary before the learning function of the human organism is understood.

Another 355 papers written by white high school students were used as controls. The papers were analyzed following an outline of expected non-standard structures adapted from Turner's &quot;Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect.&quot; Results seemd to indicate that there is a definite African substructure in this Negro dialect which is both masked and reinforced by a survival of certain archaic forms, the simplifications of the pidgin English first used by the slaves, and normal simplifications of language found in any &quot;folk speech.&quot; The study  showed that 95 percent of the Negro students were affected by these factors as compared to 58 percent of the white students. It was also suggested that Negro dialects may have had a perceptible influence on the structure of white southern dialects. In discussing the teaching of standard English to non-standard dialect speakers, it is proposed that: (1) teachers receive training in linguistics, (2) recognition and respect be given to Negro and other dialects, (3) both linguistics and literature courses be used to teach awareness of standard usage, (4) a writing approach to English teaching be investigated.

Ninety-one adults served as subjects for the speech task; 86 of these subjects, 43 Negro and 43 white, provided the listener responses. Subjects were chosen to provide a sample approximately representative of the distribution of socioeconomic status scores in the southeastern United States. Listeners were asked to identify the race of each speaker and make a speech quality rating of recorded samples . The Articulatory Product score developed by Guttman was used as an independent, semi-objective index of speech proficiency. In addition, a spectrographic analysis was carried out using a  sample consisting of ten Negro male and ten white male subjects. All speakers used in this analysis had been correctly identified by listeners as to race 9 5 percent of the time or better. Results were as follows: (1) The number of phonetic distortions by speakers predicts racial identification. (2) Socioeconomic status score and Articulatory Product score predict speech quality rating of speakers by listeners. (3) No significant intergroup differences were found on spectrographic variables.

The description of the phonological systems of these dialects is presented within the framework of generative phonology as developed principally by Chomsky, Halle, and Stanley. Although this study does not attempt to present either a complete grammar or a complete phonology of Akan, a &quot;reasonably complete&quot; treatment of the finite verb is given and deep structures and transformational rules are discussed in relation to certain P-rules. Chapter 1 presents the inventory of systematic phonemes and includes the  set of Morpheme Segment Structure Conditions which are to be applied to the dictionary matrices of morphemes. Chapter 2 presents the set of Morpheme Sequence Structure Conditions which apply generally to all formatives. The first chapters thus present all the general lexical redundancies in the language and cover a major part of the phonological constraints. Chapter 3 discusses all the general Phonological Rules which apply to the surface structures of sentences. P-rules applying specifically to the finite verb are discussed in Chapter 4, which also discusses various other aspects of Akan surface structures dominated by the Verb-Phrase node. (JD)",

Using a definition of the elementary school counselor's role, the institute staff developed a program including statistics, counseling theory and practice, group procedures, mental hygience, personality and child development, learning theories, exceptional children, diagnosis and treatment of learning problems, and a year practicum. Data were collected at the beginning and end of instruction and after at least one semester on the job. The guidance clearly suggests that enrollees mastered new professional knowledge and skills, and came to believe in themselves as professionals. Group counseling touched enrollees' personal lives, seeming to  increase their self-confidence, self-acceptance, understanding, and human relations skills. Enrollees felt that better use could have been made of films and video recordings. More emphasis seems needed in developing competencies in the consulting role. More instruction seems needed in curriculum and guidance, vocational development for children, and the use of referral agencies and community resources. The strongest features were practicum, group counseling, and relationships with the staff and peers. (Author/PH)",

        "description":"The primary objective of the proposed research was to investigate the effects on learning of various stimulus-response (S-R) mapping schemes. It was hypothesized that S-R connections are not simply arbitrary, that the way stimulus and response classes are mapped together may have a profound effect on learning rate. To study this problem, two paradigms based on discrimination learning procedures were constructed. The first paradigm made possible qualitative variations in mapping via the study of one-one, many-one, and one-many S-R connections, while holding constant across conditions the number of requir\"d association. Selected possible outcomes were theoretically related to type of mapping variation and the development of cognitive processes with age. The paradigm used in the  second study made possible the quantitative variation of S-R mapping on an order-disorder dimension. The results indicated that one degree of mapping disorder (one exception) produced about the same number of errors as a completely irregular mapping. The difference between one degree of mapping disorder and zero degrees of mapping disorder was extremely large. The task was trivial when there were no exceptions and it became quite difficult. with only one exception. A theory based on hypothesis sampling and generation was put forth to explain the observed results. (Author)",

Shops with no professionals serve fewer clients than those with professionals, and very little professional time is available per client. An examination of professional job titles, educational levels, and salaries reveals that only one-third of the workshops are headed by professionals. Higher educational levels make it less likely a professional will work full-time. New York has a high percentage of professionals with higher levels of education working greater amounts of time with high average salaries. High professional density was associated with high percentages of clients in  evaluation, personal adjustment, and vocational rather than employment training. High professional density was also associated with: (1) workshop income sources from professional services rather than production activities; (2) lower percentages of total expenses for client wages; (3) client ages under 35, (4) mental illness disabilities, (5) very short client tenure, and (6) relatively high placement rates.

Dormitory restrictions should be only those absolutely necessary for maintaining order. Power to enact rules should rest entirely with those who must live with them. Apprehending violators must be handled by students, removing and freeing counseling staff from disciplinary duties.  Adjudication procedures must guarantee the civil rights of the offender, with the penalty system applied by elected student judicial bodies. Students should also have a major voice in setting other long-range dormitory policies unrelated to student conduct.

At three diverse colleges (identified as intellectual, social, and enterprising), entering freshmen completed the American College Survey in the fall of 1964. The same students filled out a parallel form the following spring (1965). Rated importance of life goals in public affairs, religion, reading, science, and family (on a four-point scale) served as the criteria of change. Despite methodological limitations and differences in percentages of the spring survey completion, appropriate statistical analysis supports the following  conclusions. For most life goal areas, changes in college students were only slightly due to either college press or personality factors. However, when college press and personality orientation are mutually supportive, the students changed in the expected directions. Students development was viewed as a product of personality orientation and concurrent external conditions allowing change and development in a direction congruent with personality orientation.

Pre- and post-treatment videotapes rated by judges indicate that clients exposed to simulated treatments made significantly more progress in characteristics of client growth (owning of discomfort, commitment to change, differentiation of stimuli and different behavior); had more positive change in client behavior and therapeutic process changes (client insight, lessening of defenses, ability to  experience feeling and relate to counselors, and overall therapeutic relationships); and, therefore, made more movement within counseling than did the control subjects. Subjective reports on all clients tentatively indicate that experimental subjects made better adjustments outside counseling situations and, on the basis of vocational placement rates, had a better placement prognosis than control subjects.

The mechanics of scoring and evaluating the results is done by the computer. The computer scores each of the Edwards scales and each of the 135 statement scales. It then evaluates each of the 135 statements scores, printing a brief sentence based upon the actual wording of the  statement in the test if the client responded each time a statement was present.

A sample bibliography suggests sources for future research. Psychological and psysiological theory is shown historically to have separated the two mental functions in principle. Correspondingly, present-day education, mostly devoted to verbal and numerical skills, has not yet integrated art instruction sufficiently in its program. To bridge the gap, visual perception is shown to involve cognitive mechanisms while theoretical thinking relies on imagery. Abstraction operates as the connection between the two functions. Images are abstract representations, which serve as theoretical models in the sciences. Visual material for science education must be  prepared at an appropriate level of abstraction and must conform to the perceptual rules by which the relevant features of the subject matter can be translated into visually comprehensible form. This calls for more explicit use of the psychology of perception and the experience of the artist than is now common in the practice of visual education. Art instruction will come to be considered the prime training ground of visual cognition, one perceptual imagery is recognized as the vehicle of productive thinking in all disciplines. (Author)",

More specifically, a valid and reliable rating scale for use by students in evaluating their residence hall counselor was developed. In developing an instrument for this purpose, some of the weaknesses of the more common and popular type rating scales such as rater leniency, rater bias, and halo effect were avoided. The forced-choice technique was considered th e best technique in overcoming such weaknesses. (Data analysis showed that an instrument composed of items significantly different in their ability to discriminate between effective and ineffective residence hall counselors, yet prossessing comparable degrees of favorableness, could be constructed from student supplied descriptive  behavior statements describing the performance and activities of residence hall counselors.) This instrument had a satisfactory split-half reliability of .74. There was no significant difference in the reliability for men and women. A reliable and valid instrument (forced-choice rating scale), through which student opinion of the residence hall counselor can be successfully measured, has been developed. (Author/PS)",

The subjects were 277 lower division college students selected from a large introductory psychology class. The universal superiority of immediate reinforcement did not appear. The educational implications are: (1) the usual assumption of the efficiency of immediate  reinforcement is not valid with respect to academic instruction; and (2) the apparent superiority of delayed knowledge reinforcement with deductive learning and immediate knowledge reinforcement with inductive learning may be utilized across a wide range of instructional settings.

The physical facilities consist of a large, open and carpeted area with desks, comfortable chairs, tables, and bookshelves filled with material related to counseling. Conference rooms for privacy, group work, or teacher-counselor group meetings were provided. Each counselor was, and is, scheduled out of the office for one-half day a week on a regular basis. The counselors are thus free to work with students elsewhere. Noticeable differences were observed in the frequency of student visits to the center and in the open and spontaneous nature of student-counselor interaction. Students seemed to feel much more free  to congregate in the center to talk, look through materials, and to engage counselors in casual conversation. Teachers also frequented the center. The use of radically different physical facilities and the development of new attitudes toward counselor involvement in the total student life helped to dissolve the idea of the \"problem centered counselor.\" (PS)",

These systems, and those on the first level, are totally controlled by the counselor. The memories of such systems are completely available to the controlling counselor. Computer systems at the third level could be described as substitute counselors. Their significance is that their designers and operators would attribute to them certain characteristics found in human counselors, e.g., privileged communication or privacy. Examples of systems at the first two levels are  mentioned to provide an operational definition. A rationale is given for the tri-level systems classification. Some suggested uses of third-level substitute computer systems include: (1) a catharsis system, (2) a system permitting dialogue, (3) a behavior reinforcement system, and (4) a developmental monitor system.

In an effort to meet this challenge, Holy Cross College initiated a three year study to develop such a measuring instrument that would identify the best student leaders. The method of investigation was descriptive and the tools of measurement were standarized personality tests, an interest inventory, and a sociometric type leadership questionnaire. The sample consisted of 300 sophomores and juniors currently enrolled at the College, who were trying for 60 R.A. positions. It was found that the higher the student rates on the sociometric  questionnaire, the more self-assertive and friendly he rates, and if his preferences evolve around extraversion, sensing, and feeling, and if he focuses his judgment upon people and things rather than upon concepts and ideas, the more likely he will be capable of facilitating positive growth within others.

An analysis of the parent post-series reaction sheet showed a highly positive attitude in parents participating in group counseling. This attitude was strengthened after a second year of counseling in the same district. An analysis of the written \"counselor reactions to specific groups\" (CRSG) showed that counselor responses became more positive the longer parents remained in their respective groups.

The population consisted of all California school districts with elementary school programs which were within Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of the State of 1960. A grouping variable was used to distribute the 245 school districts by type of district. Ten measures were used as independent variables, eigh&quot; of which represented socioeconomic measures believed to be descriptive of the students and of the community (student input),  one which measured financial resources available to the school district (financial input), and one which was a manipulatable characteristic of the system (ADA). Multiple correlation coefficients were run on the variables. The results revealed that neither the financial input variable nor the district size variable showed any significant linear relationship to any of the student output measures. It was concluded that given the equivalent financial resources and comparable socioeconomic characteristics, there is no evidence that greater educational benefits are produced in larger school districts with elementary school programs.

        "description":"Experience of the Liverpool Middle School, Liverpool, New York, provides a rationale for organizing school systems to include ungraded middle schools. If, as evidence indicates, today's youth are maturing earlier, are more sophisticated, and are capable of greater accomplishment, then the traditional grade 7-8-9 arrangement does not meet the needs of ninth grade students while elementary schools can not meet the needs of sixth grade students. It is felt that grouping students by grades 6, 7, and 8 in the middle school aided solution of this problem. By introducing a multi-age grouping of students for each subject, each student's unique qualities and individual capabilities were recognized and given full educational advantage. This ungraded system required curriculum reform and  flexible scheduling which were implemented along with a system of team teaching. Problems of team isolation, friction within teams, curriculum oriented outlooks, unwillingness to regroup students, and lack of evaluation of innovations were being solved. Progress made with the middle school concept indicates its viability. (TT)",

First, the consistency of the criteria used to distribute funds is studied to see if people of similar financial positions are treated &quot;qually. Results show that when compared with an alternative--the Orshansky index--the present official need index provides a satisfactory measure of the disadvantaged school population. The second part of the analysis looks at how people in different financial positions are treated. Consideration of both net transfers and gross aid leads to the conclusion that the degree of redistribution under the present program is very small. This suggests that the first major act of Federal aid to education is conservative  when judged by distributional standards. If future Federal aid legislation is to make a marked contribution to the equalization of States' ability to provide education, fiscal capacity must be introduced as a criterion for distributing Federal funds.

The maintenance and operation expenditures are divided into three categories (custodial salaries, operation expenditures above and beyond custodial salaries, and plant maintenance expenses) and are compared with national norms. The allocation of workloads for custodial staff members is analyzed in terms of efficiency, management's demand for custodians' time, and equalization of duties among custodians. A mathematical model is also constructed to facilitate administrative decision making in the areas of capital expenditures for and manpower utilization of maintenance  equipment. It investigates the trade-off between men and machines in the floor scrubbing and water pickup processes. Four recommendations to SPSD resulted from the study: (1) Reevaluate the work assignments and task efficiencies of the custodians, (2) maintain present custodial staff size, (3) reassign individual custodial workloads to promote equalization of assigned duties, and (4) purchase the optimal mix of cleaning machines.

The selection process must place more emphasis on change orientation, specialization and cooperation, learning-teaching strategy, experimentation, and professional preparation. Partnerships should be developed between school districts and training institutions so that programs can be instituted to improve marginal and less experienced teachers. In this way beginning teachers can be judged on the basis of their potential. Teacher participation in this broader selection process should be encouraged along reasonable and beneficial lines.

Findings demonstrated considerable overlap as well as some independence among measures. High degrees of reliability and intercorrelation were found within the group of psychological tests. More independence of items was found within the series of work sample measures. Rating scale items were highly intercorrelated, suggestive of a halo effect. All the evaluation techniques had some potency for prediction of adjustment and performance and were stronger at the end of each of the five stages. The program variations of a special work group and group counseling were moderately  successful in favorably modifying behavior. A reading-free test was able to differentiate vocational interests. Job supervisors' ratings were best to predict performance in the half day on campus. No measure predicted performance for full-day work off campus with residence on campus. In 11 psychological tests, highest reliability was noted for motor skills tests; psychological test correlation with vocational performance varied. Factor analysis indicated the vocational interest test discriminated subjects' interests. Group counseling results were not conclusive. (DE)",

All 20 had their case histories taken, were given pediatric and open electroencephalograph examinations, and were evaluated by psychological tests. One team of physicians found no clearly defined neurological abnormalities; another team rated 10 of the 20 records as evidencing neurological impairment. Two pairs of psychologists also differed in their diagnoses. The ratings of the medical and psychological diagnoses were found to differ significantly (p=.01). The educational program included the following: a special class, with individualized instruction for eight to 12 children, taught by a regular teacher assisted by a mental  health specialist and the school guidance and curriculum staff; a learning disabilities group, providing a specialist's instruction in remedial work for two to eight children; an activity group, structured as a club with craft and play sessions, conducted after school for six to eight children; and group counseling for the junior and senior high school students in groups of 10. Reading and achievement scores taken over a 2-year period indicated an average gain for the group as a whole exceeding what would be expected from pupils in regular classes. (JW)",

Two item analysis strategies were used: responses of achieving subjects (S's) and general samples of nonachieving S's were compared; responses of achieving and nonachieving S's who had previously indicated desire to achieve were compared. The two strategies did not yield essentially different scales. Validity coefficients ranged from .15 to .38 with 300 cross-validation S's; similar correlations resulted from applying the scales to 681 females S's. More items about past accomplishment, activities, and competence entered the scales than did  other item types, relative to the size of the item pools. The content of the scales and the correlations among variables support some unfavorable interpretations of high grade achievement. Results suggest the hypothesis that the grade scales should be a negative predictor of nonacademic achievement, and the nonacademic scales should predit grades negatively. (Author/JD)",

Specific methods of producing braille discussed include the following: use of plates from a stereograph, computer line printer, braille embossers or braille writers, continuous strip embossed tape from a teletype machine, MIT high speed electric embosser, dot print-out on an electric typewriter connected to a computer, optical to magnetic conversion of print, and domestic and foreign combination print and braille writers. Problems of distribution treated are the size of the braille reading population; costs of braille reading material; methods of providing newspapers, periodicals, and reference material; and the lack of communication between  inventors of braille equipment and the potential user. Listings of seven projects in planning or in process, conference participants, and two references are provided. Appendixes describe a new braille teleprinter system and discuss design analysis for a braille production system. (KH)",

The variables of anxiety, achievement in reading and arithmetic, deportment, and attendance were also examined. Once a week for 12 weeks, the experimental group received group counseling while the control group received a library study situation. Both groups were administered two self concept scales and one anxiety scale and were rated by teachers on reading, deportment, and arithmetic. Results indicated that the experimental group scored significantly higher (p=.05) on The Children's Self Concept Scale, exhibited greater anxiety reduction as measured by The  Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (p=.05), received higher teacher ratings for reading and arithmetic (p=.05) and for deportment (p>.05). There were no significant differences between the groups on The Way I Feel About Myself Scale or in attendance, nor were any significant differences found for any of the three tests comparing the upper and lower 50% of the experimental group by age and IQ.

The checklist had a split-half reliability of .98 and discriminated between disturbed and non-disturbed children (p=.001). The rating scale reflected treatment differences which were known to exist (p=.01), and had an average inter-rater reliability of .935 for three judges on the behavior of six subjects. Agreement measures between independent observers using the observation form were .90  and above. A treatment model based upon learning theory was developed to modify the behavior of disturbed children in an educational setting. Various response-reinforcement contingencies and reinforcers were used with 11 disturbed boys in grades 4, 5, and 6 and produced measurable change by reducing deviant behavior and increasing time spent engaged in task-orientated behavior. It was not possible to determine which treatment variables produced a given amount of behavior change. The checklist, rating scale, and a classification form are appended. (Author/SN)",

Volunteers assisted with transportation, followup, consultation, and direct teaching of mobility. Over a 3-year period, the number of lessons per client varied from one to 86, and the number of hours spent by the instructor in direct teaching of mobility declined. Only 25 of 420 new cases were referred for training. Evaluation of the project suggested that a master's degree was not necessary for an adequately trained mobility instructor, and that part-time people in general areas of service to the blind would be of more help than new specialists. Since of the clientele only 6% became candidates for travel with the sliding cane and only 1 to 2% for guide dogs,  mobility answers for the majority of the blind must be found. Transportation of blind persons also remains a problem. Construction of the sliding cane is described and illustrated. The bulk of the report outlines the children's lesson plans (mobility instruction for protection and orientation, sensory training--cutaneous, and orientation to travel), mobility instruction lesson plans (inside and outside work, trips in the local residential area, and the city), lesson plans for partially sighted, and hearing training.

The personality tests showed more anxiety in younger patients, with females exhibiting more anxiety and depression than males. No significant relationship between intellectual function and the other diagnostic measures was found. However, patients with the least psychopathology were functioning at the highest  intellectual level.

Detection of maintenance needs requires routine inspections and periodic reports by building personnel. Three broad categories of maintenance needs are exterior maintenance, interior maintenance, and mechanical systems. Exterior maintenance is concerned with the preservation of the exposed surfaces of roofs, walls, windows and doors. The functions of conserving heat, protecting occupants and equipment from the elements,  and insuring comfortable living and working conditions must be maintained. Interior maintenance involves all the services required to keep the inside of the building in safe, pleasing, and usable condition. This includes surface and finishes, doors and windows, fixed equipment, and fire protection and safety. Mechanical systems include heating, ventilation, electrical, and sanitary.

Guidelines are oriented to provide the designer with--(1) an understanding of basic acoustical principles, (2) the ability to perform basic analytic measurements, and (3) an insight to identify acoustical problems which demand a  greater degree of technical skill. Chapters include--(1) basic principles, (2) acoustics and architectural programing, (3) acoustics in school planning, (4) acoustics and facilities design, and (5) acoustics and noise control. The information is thoroughly illustrated, supported by a bibliography, and followed by a checklist for planners and administrators. (RH)",

It was found that on dry and grazing land, cash rentals on school lands compare favorably with the rentals on private land. The greatest differences in rental rates appear in the area of irrigated farming, where the private land rental rate was considerably higher than the public school land rate. On the basis of information obtained in this study, the State Board of Land Commissioners has been  exercising prudent judgement when resolving the conflict bid. The policies concerning subleasing practices have been defined and delineated much more clearly since 1965, although the current subleasing is difficult to control. (NI)",

        "description":"Although educational television is associated with the classroom, data comparing the production techniques of ETV to those employed in commercial television does not support the stereotyped image of ETV as a televised lecture. Late in 1961, five students knowledgeable in television production and specially trained as observers for this study watched 18 programs, randomly selected from 13 previously established categories of program type. Thirteen of the programs were from four commercial stations, and five were from the local educational station. For purposes of rating, the technical aspects of production were divided into seven categories: camera factors, lighting, background, graphic devices, audio factors, performers, and opening and closing formats. In general the educational  and commercial programs used the same techniques, but commercial TV used them more frequently. For example, educational programs had fewer cuts, fades, and camera moves per minute than commercial programs, even in matching categories. Hence it was concluded that commercial TV is more &quot;dynamic&quot; in production. The data recording sheets are appended. (PM)",

First, a systematic approach to the achievement of educational goals is required. Second, the development of models is useful for the synthesis, presentation, and testing of new systems. Third, the computer has vast potential as an administrative aid to education. And finally, the panel agreed that the introduction of computers into the schools to deal with clerical and administrative problems will lead to their use in an instructional capacity. The main area of  disagreement was over the nature and specific objectives of the optimal CAI system. In addition, the panel expressed a general concern over the effect of the computer on human values. Topics covered in the panelists' papers are learner needs and systems requirements, the hardware-software disparity, decision making in education, social change, urban education, public policy, school architecture, economics of education, teacher education, educational administration, computer languages and applications of the computers in the classroom, in the library, in research, and in counseling.

        "description":"Single-score measures of intelligence are inadequate to predict performance on a programed instruction format. Guilford's model of the intellect accounts for three dimensions relevant to learner abilities. The content dimension refers to the kind of material involved, the product dimension to the kind of output required, and the process dimension to the operation involved in learning. Four studies were conducted to investigate the usefulness of Guilford's model in predicting types of stimulus-materials most consistent with learner characteristics. Eighth graders worked with two versions of a self-instructional program for teaching logic. A total of 160 subjects were randomly assigned to a semantic or a symbolic version. A regression analysis was carried out to determine the  relationship between achievement in each program variation and intellectual abilities as assessed by Guilford's measures. Based on regression results, 180 eighth graders were assigned to the program versions according to predicted success. There was no evidence that the stimulus-content dimension is critical from an instructional point of view. Efforts at determining the instructional utility of Guilford's model would be better aimed at analyses in terms of the products demanded and the operations involved. (LS)",

Ninety-seven 10th and 11th grade mathematics students were individually given the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale which was used to determine Personality Assessment System (PAS) variables. Before and after the experimental procedure, a programed mathematics course, semantic differential scales were administered to assess attitudes about school, learning, classes, teachers, programed instruction, programed texts, basic math course, programed math, and regular math. Factor analysis showed few relationships between attitudes and grades or attitudes and PAS  variables. Multiple correlation analysis showed that attitudes were the best predictors of final grades, with attitudes toward teachers being the single most important predictor variable. In general, analyses showed the differences between the variables which contribute to the two different criteria, the lack of correlation between the criteria, and the overriding effects of attitudes. Further studies should control such variables as the level of the students in the course, as well as the nature and level of the subject matter, and should provide more adequate numbers of the personality patterns.

        "description":"When assessing the influence of computer assisted instruction, attention should be given not only to rate and error of performance in the acquisition of content, but also to non-performance aspects of children's behavior. To this purpose,, computer assisted instruction (CAI) was given to 45 first grade students for 35 minutes during each day of the school year, and their academic and social behaviors, as measured by 66 categories of a Behavior Survey Instrument, were compared to the behaviors of 27 other students who were teacher-taught (non-CAI). Data gathering was by point sampling; reliability of observation was achieved by two-man teams, independently judging the same behavior. Percents of agreement ranged from 60% to 98%. Between the beginning and the end of the school year,  the social behavior scores for the CAI students decreased significantly while the corresponding scores for the non-CAI group significantly increased. This suggests that the individualized computer instruction made students less socially oriented while the unvarying group setting of the non-CAI students tended to increase their social skills. However, uncontrolled variance (e.g., the seven different classroom teachers involved) is an alternative hypothesis for the differences. The findings are interpreted as suggesting that CAI may reduce the expected positive relations among academic behavior, IQ, and achievement. (MJ)",

Terms used in four different learning theories--motivation, (Neal Miller); stimulus control (Skinner); distinctive conditions and cumulative learning (Gagne); and subsumption (Ausubel)--suggest specific principles of learning. A general principle emerging from modern learning studies is that learning is an individual matter, in which essential idiosyncratic elements must be supplied by the learner himself. In applying these principles to the choice and use of media, an analysis of the events of instruction is required. These involve gaining and controlling  attention; stimulating recall; guiding or cueing the learning; providing feedback; arranging for remembering; and assessing the final outcomes. No single medium is likely to be best fitted to perform all of these various functions. An arrangement involving combinations of media may hold the key to effective instruction and efficient media use, particularly where the individual establishes a large part of the learning conditions for himself.

The equipment, two recorders of each type tested, was submitted by the manufacturers. The test was designed to produce quality evaluations for three generations of a single tape, thereby encompassing all levels of probable use in the school situation. The experiment tested four conditions: making a recording and playing it back; playing the recording back on a second machine; making a copy of the recording and playing it back; and making a recording of the copy and playing it back. This representation in the study appears in two forms: on the standard waveform monitor, which has meaning for the engineer; and on a picture monitor, which has  meaning to the media specialist. For each of the four experimental conditions, still photographs of the waveform oscilloscope image and the picture monitor image were made to analyze performance and for reproduction in the report. Various design elements in the recorders studied determine their value for various uses. The conclusion is that there are three groupings of recorders based on picture quality and price range. When the intended use has been determined, the appropriate grade of machine may then be selected from one of the groups. (MT)",

        "description":"An experimental program was undertaken to find a means of facilitating the teaching of art to large numbers of students in a Humanities course at the University of Miami. Original paintings were available for study in the University art gallery, but there was insufficient room for large classes in the gallery and a specialist teacher was not available. A specialist helped to prepare a programed booklet containing a branching program on a unit in Renaissance Art. This booklet was related to numbered paintings in the gallery. The objectives were limited to allow completion of the program in 30 minutes, and were identified as 1) determining which of any two paintings was painted later in time, and 2) identifying the shape of a painting. Pre- and post-testing of 31 freshmen students  in an experimental group showed that the objectives were met. Questionnaires administered to the experimental group and to a larger group of students, who later completed the program, demonstrated that students were motivated by the program. It was concluded that use of programed instruction in conjunction with an art gallery provided a highly desirable instructional tool when used with television or film demonstrations of technique, and with small discussion seminars. Test and questionnaire results, and samples of students' comments are included in the text. Appendices give program samples, and the pre- and post-test. (PM)",

        "description":"Instructional media have been studied for many years in the Department of Applied Electronics of the Royal Institute of Technology to determine their value for teaching purposes. They have been studied particularly as an aid to instruction on semiconductors. The choice of teaching format and of media has been determined by the basic philosophy that the emphasis should lie on studying the literature in the field. Media use has been restricted, for many pedagogical and economic reasons, to a supplementary role in teaching. Several methods have been tried (slide projectors, film, and television), and some, such as computers and various combinations of computers and other media, have yet to be evaluated. The most successful and economical device has proven to be a system with four  projectors for still pictures, in which the pictures are triggered by impulses from the second channel of a tape recorder, and the accompanying sound is recorded on the first channel of the tape. This instructor-directed system is used for about 20 minutes during a two-hour lecture. A simple electronic feedback mechanism with push buttons permits the students to inform the teacher if they cannot keep up. (OH)",

The value of any image depends on its content of information, and essential for clear comprehension of any picture are the principles of causality, parallelism, and contrast or negative comparison. Both artist and teacher must avoid visual ambiguity, unnatural visualization, distortion of meaning, and must stress meaningful interpolation. A line drawing is more valuable than a photograph because of its amplified potential as an abstraction and its low cost, but it is useless as an effective classroom audiovisual aid if it needs detailed explanations. Coordinated pictorial devices for language instruction could best be developed by a team of audiovisual  researchers, including artists, methodologists, graphic experts, and psychologists.

The variables affecting student achievement in high school language courses can serve as a guide for the student's placement in college classes. Some of these variables include a continuously changing faculty, a lack of carefully thought-out goals, a lapse of time for language study between high school and college, and a lack of uniform instruction and technique from year to year within the high school. If good language students are to be produced, the institutions of higher learning must recognize their responsibility to work closely together with  the high schools toward improved program articulation.

Verified by carefully drawn samples from three separate entering classes, it was found that the program increases by over 50 percent a student's chances of remaining enrolled in engineering at the beginning of his sophomore year, doubles his chances of receiving an engineering degree in ten semesters, and increases by almost 50 percent his chances of obtaining some degree. Judging from indirect evidence, the program is effective because it causes the student to re-evaluate his role and responsibility in future academic life. Further  experimental work to measure such attitudinal changes is needed. The number of students participating in the program does not seem to affect its outcome. It is felt that to meet its own objectives, the program can be no shorter than two weeks. (Author/JS).",

(2) The coordinating mechanism will function more effectively if its  professional staff is both independent of the staffs of the institutions and of the state administrative agencies. (3) The authority structure inherent in a scheme of statutory coordination can serve as a protector, rather than an adversary, of the substantive autonomy of institutions.

Innovative techniques include the use of television and other audiovisual media, flexible class scheduling, new grading methods, interdisciplinary courses, independent study, and cooperative work programs. In order to introduce new techniques successfully, it is essential to convince the faculty of the need for change. This can be done through faculty workshops and orientation sessions, manipulation of the traditional systems of rewards,  prerogatives, and perquisites, and by involving the most respected and influential faculty members in the process of change. Strong administrative leadership and interest are critical for successfully engineering change in the instructional process. (AM)",

The strength of these operative factors was determined by the application of reason analysis to three groups: Israeli students and alumni population in the US, Israelis who have studied in the US but returned to Israel, and Israelis who have received all their higher education in Israel. To measure the extent of brain drain, basic demographic and educational characteristics of students were examined. Population lists were compiled, and Israelis who had returned from study abroad, as well as Israeli potential employees and persons occupying key positions in the educational system were interviewed. Based on these interviews, a  systematic questionaire was designed and administered to the entire known Israeli student and alumni population in the US. A 67 percent response justified a rigorous analysis of its findings. A comparison of Israeli economic development with that of Japan and India indicates that a nation bent on social and economic growth must amplify its human capital, partly through foreign influence. But it must simultaneously build an institutional framework that maximizes its investment in human talent. If the level of individual skill matches that of economic development, the cost of non-return becomes directly related to a nation's commitment to and ability to effect social change. (JS).",

Other data used in analyzing the scales were self-reported grade averages and life goals. It was found that generally seniors have accomplished more than sophomores, sophomores more than freshmen and there is an internal consistency for all scales and groups.

The total concept developed from proven methods established at the National Music Camp. Based on the belief that composers, conductors, and music teachers should know how to play all major symphonic instruments, 33 superior students were selected for this intensive 40 week program. By 32 weeks, each student demonstrated his success in tape recorded sessions requiring the playing of each instrument in  succession. All facilities of the Interlochen Arts Academy were made available so students could accomodate individual interests with participation in the basic program. Films were made, instructional books written, and methods and materials that were developed at Interlochen have been disseminated. Students were reportedly well satisfied with their experience. The staff strongly recommends widespread adoption of the Maddy class routine for effective music instruction. (JS)",

To test the relationship of each of these factors to occupational goals, questionnaires were filled out in which the student estimated the job he expected to have 5 years after completing his education (his \"real\" aspiration), and the job he would most like to have (his \"ideal\" aspiration). Motivation was measured by analysis of a projective  test. The subjects were 140 Negro male college students from 3 colleges, 2 of which were designated working class and 1 of which was deemed middle class. College social class was based on the predominance of students from middle class or working class family backgrounds. A white middle class control sample of 70 students was used. It was found that social class, strong achievement and power motivations dispose Negroes at working class colleges to seek jobs in traditionally closed fields, whereas middle class students tended to aspire to traditionally open occupations .",

The components measured were: grade point average (GPA), achievement level, self concept, environment, motivation, attitude, and faculty-student relations. Data were computer analyzed. High achievers (those having a GPA of 4.0 or higher; 5.0=A) were found to be self confident, independent, purposive, had rapport with faculty, and seemed to possess broad socio-cultural awareness. The average group (those having a GPA of 3.3 through 3.8) focused mainly on the social dimensions and pleasures found  in the non-intellectual aspects of university life. Environmental factors appear to have the greatest influence on academic achievement. If the college climate is viewed as intellectually stimulating and congruent with personal goals, then it is more likely that effort will be expended to achieve academic success. To create a more supportive academic environment, the university needs to have more background information on its students than it now does. (Author/JS).",

Slightly more than half (50.4%) of the presidents come from the junior college field, and of this number all but 1% come from the public junior college. Others are drawn from 4-year colleges and universities (15.9%). Increasingly, junior college presidents are being drawn from fields other than higher education. At the  level of their highest degrees, most presidents specialized in some area of professional education other than higher education while 8.4% majored in higher education (including junior college administration). Today's junior college president, in addition to being somewhat older than was his predecessor of previous decades, has attained a higher degree of education, has acquired more administrative experience in higher education, and has had more junior college experience.

Data were collected from statistical records of the 45 graduates and 41 dropouts and from questionnaires completed by 16 of 21 selected graduates. Prior to the study, general criteria for admission to the program were (1) a high school diploma and a minimum grade point average of 2.0, (2) a minimum composite ACT score of 15, (3)  a minimum grade of &quot;C&quot; in high school chemistry (or equivalent subject), and (4) a personal interview. Results of the study indicated that students with a high school grade point average of below 2.0 and those with ACT composite scores of below 15 are poor risks. Therefore no change was made in the first two entrance requirements. It was decided that the chemistry prerequisite should be restated without specific reference to minimum grade. Characteristically, the 1966 dropouts left the program because of academic failure while the 1967 dropouts left because of dissatisfaction or alienation. (DG)",

        "description":"In a study of Negro students at City College of San Francisco (CCSF) designed to ascertain their academic characteristics, ways in which they differ significantly from the general student population of the college, and types of programs that might be developed to meet their special needs, records of 285 Negro students (selected at random and representing approximately 20% of the Negro student population attending CCSF) were examined. Although there was some overlap, the mean performance of Negro students on entrance tests was lower than that of the general student population. Greater proportions of Negro students were subject to enrollment in required courses in English and arithmetic than was true of the college as a whole. Of the Negro students 60% were not achieving the  expected C average, although their overall grade average was C-minus. The need for special attention to the improvement of basic academic skills was greater for Negro students than for other students at the institution. For each student in the sample were obtained data concerning his sex, high school origin, scores on SCAT and reading and English expression tests, English and arithmetic status, units attempted, units earned, grade points and grade point average.

        "description":"In an attempt to help college students who needed remedial work in English composition and reading, a combination of four courses (two in English and two in psychology) by means of team teaching and block scheduling was designed at Foothill College. During the spring of 1968, 30 selected students met during a 2-hour block of time five days a week. They were instructed by four teachers. The students were tested at the outset by each of the following tools: (1) the ACT test, (2) the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey, (3) the Lorge-Thorndike Non-Verbal I.Q. Test, (4) the Nelson-Denny Test, and (5) the California Phonics Survey. The objective of the course was to improve each student's ability to communicate clearly in English and to participate effectively in a college class.  The courses dealt with fundamentals of English, basic reading skills, an introduction to college, and methods of effective study. The basic rationale for the course design was that increased intraclass communication would help students and teachers in their respective performances. The major recommendation growing out of the study was that the four instructors involved in the project be recalled to the campus at least three weeks before the beginning of the Fall term of 1968 to develop a program which would (1) test and diagnose students, (2) meet individual needs, (3) maximize the effectiveness of each instructor, and (4) provide for continuous counseling and evaluation of students.

The survey included questions about the academic and socio-economic backgrounds of seniors, their post-secondary plans, and their plans concerning community colleges in particular. Of the state's 57 public and private high schools, 39 were represented in the study. An 82% (8,201 students) return was obtained. Of this total, 69% indicated that they planned to continue their education in the next year, 24% were uncertain, and 7% definitely were not going to school in the next year. Of the seniors who planned to continue their education, 41% were interested in attending 4-year institutions in Hawaii, while 23% intended to enroll in 4-year  institutions on the mainland, and 17% planned to attend community colleges in Hawaii. Choices of a field of study revealed that 71% were going into a baccalaureate degree program, 17% into business and commerce programs, and 12% into trade or technical programs. The two major types of programs indicated for enrollment were business education (35%) and college transfer (23%). (DG)",

Elements of the design are (1) output (needs of local personnel), (2) input (content, location, and organization of data), (3) process (existing developments and services), and (4) roles of national, regional, state, and local districts in the system. Areas analyzed were (1) the problem, (2) existing conditions, (3) a model system, (4) feasibility, and (5) the components most urgently needed. Much of the R & D done by universities, foundations, and even other school districts must be translated to a different form for others' use. The proposed system would (1) collect data, (2) prepare, index, and maintain files, (3)  provide interface with users, (4) apply data to classroom users, and (5) manage the system. Present constraints on its ideal use include (1) lack of (a) standardization, (b) sophisticated users, and (c) criteria for system evaluation, (2) existing services and interests, (3) present hard- and software, (4) development and operation costs, and (5) legal limits on reproduction of material. Techniques are now adequate for processing and storing, but not for indexing and reformulation. The greatest flaw is at the system/user interface. The laboratory could profitably train information specialists in each district, prepare summaries on major subject areas, and issue annual reviews on R & D in education. (HH)",

The junior college must therefore know how well he does after transfer, if it is to evaluate and improve its teaching methods. The senior college should also know the characteristics of its incoming transfers if it is to provide the best possible guidance. This study investigated the characteristics of 154 transfers and their academic performance in the senior colleges, and compared them with transfers from private junior colleges and other senior institutions. They had enrolled in the fall of 1966 and remained for the year. Twenty-four students were from community junior colleges, 44 were from private junior colleges, and 86 were from other senior colleges. It was  expected that the grade point average for the community college students would rise for each successive quarter, as it did for the other two groups. It was found, however, that it remained basically the same. Tables show other data which were recorded in the course of the study, such as age, sex, and number of hours transferred. (HH)",

This model program shows a technique demanding continuing faculty education and greater participation by the student in the educative process. Being comprehensive, the model also emphasizes intellectual and professional development of the biology major through a sequence of courses leading to completely independent work. Although it is designed for small colleges, the model may be adapted to larger and more complex schools. The main feature of the plan is that the upper division students help their younger classmates, thus giving the faculty added study time. Both students and teachers benefit from this  arrangement--the students by the added responsibility and the teachers by having time to update their knowledge and to pursue their specialties. Some biologists have felt that the undergraduates need more supervision than this program provides, but College of Wooster has not found this to be so. Since the teacher is not involved in preparing and giving lectures, his time can be spent in preparing suitable materials in the new techniques of instruction. These materials can then be used by the teaching students. (HH)",

Opinionnaires may be open-ended scales devised by teachers or specially prepared teacher-rating scales such as the Tau Beta Pi Instructor Rating Questionnaire.  Factors involved in good teaching include, among others, (1) classroom atmosphere conducive to student ease, (2) a tolerant and approachable instructor who is competent and energetic, and (3) a course which has clearly defined objectives. In devising appraisal forms, allowances should be made for suggestions toward improvement rather than merely the recording of opinions.

It is maintained that the strengths and weaknesses of a tested population cannot be determined by a single composite test--yet, many institutions place students in beginning courses on the basis of such limited information. To assess basic capabilities assumed to be acquired in the lower level course, a test must be devised after the course objectives are known. National standardized tests are not always sufficient. By employing multiple correlations or multiple regressions (which are explained in more detail in section two of the report), the proper placement of a student can be enhanced. Data can be computer processed for the selection of the best predictors in rank order. It is  suggested that regression equations developed from data collected in one testing session be applied to the data collected during the testing one calendar year later. Problems such as the contamination of input data (e.g., different grading standards used by various teachers) are discussed with suggestions being given for developing more accurate regression equations. Section three describes English placement at El Camino College (Calif.). Test scores from the Purdue Test, the Cooperative English Test, and SCAT were submitted to a computer which ranked the test scores in order of their effectiveness as predictors.

Interviews were conducted with 25 former students (on the quality and utility of the courses they had taken) and with selected employers and subsequent educators of the graduates. The extension students and evening graduates were all asked how many classes they were taking, why they were attending, and where they heard of the program; the extension students were also asked what other courses they would like to see offered and the evening graduates were asked what subjects were most helpful, how they rated course  quality, what comments or criticisms they had, and whether they planned to continue at LBCC. The general conclusions were that the programs were comprehensive, well structured, well taught, well organized, and pertinent to community needs. Among the recommendations were (1) wider public distribution of information on college opportunities and class schedules, especially through the newspapers, (2) more contact between college personnel and key members of the community, (3) establishment of follow-up procedures for continuing evaluation, and (4) more institutional research with help from the student personnel and registrar's offices.

This system is expected to  stimulate motor skills, cognitive learning, and the concomitant attitudes of appreciation, responsibility, etc., appropriate to the student's maturity. This individualized instruction and traditional teaching are compared in detail by objective, technique, work method, evaluation, and the role of advisory committees, supervisors, or administrators. Ideally the multi-media method is so organized and used that the program is systematically evaluated and revised to meet realistic student performance goals efficiently. Details of the system, examples of its use, methods of preparing the materials, evaluation of its results, and its future possibilities are presented. (HH)",

A major conclusion is that the nation's research libraries need greater assistance from both government and private sectors to respond effectively to increasing demands. A national library system is proposed that will  require major federal leadership and support and will involve the creation of a national commission on libraries to be concerned with establishing the library system, advising the government on library needs, and planning and coordinating in the areas of acquisitions, bibliography, and technology. Other areas covered by specific recommendations are: the Library of Congress, the Center for Research Libraries, durable paper, and all types of financial support.

        "description":"The effects upon libraries of the major social changes of the past two decades and the probably future effects of such changes are analyzed in this report, based upon a search of the professional literature, a field survey, and opinion sampling from leaders in the library profession and civic leaders belonging to the National Book Committee. Five principal future responsibilities of libraries include: (1) supporting formal education at all levels, (2) sustaining the increasingly complex operations of the government and the national economy, (3) providing opportunities for continuing self-education and retraining, (4) playing a role in the reintegration of the disadvantaged into society, and (5) providing resources for an informed public opinion and for personal growth. The impact  of rapid social change will be to render the library's role more central, requiring vastly increased public support. From an institution with rather general aims which functions somewhat on the margins of our central concerns, the library will increasingly become a part of our essential machinery for dealing with these concerns, especially in core cities. The appendix includes the questionnaires used for the surveys, a summary of the survey results, and a bibliography of 157 items. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"Objectives of this study were to assess public library history, current status, trends, and problems and to suggest approaches to improvement. Trends indicate a new era of library and information services, making it necessary for librarians to decide whether the public library will be an active or passive institution for public enlightenment and social change. Public librarians are most concerned about improving ways of measuring a library's effectiveness as a social institution, studying the user and non-user, utilizing manpower, financing library service, and organizing and administrating a library. The long range issue is seen as determining and providing the kind of library service needed. The major recommendation is the creation of a national commission to guide research and  development for improved library services and to devise a comprehensive national plan for library service. More immediate recommendations involve the areas of: federal appropriations for public libraries, metropolitan libraries, regional reference centers, Library of Congress, federal standards for libraries, service to the disadvantaged, an advisory commission for state libraries, and matching funds. Appended is a chapter on the development of the public library from Elmer Johnson's \"A History of Libraries in the Western World\" (Scarecrow Press, 1965) and a bibliography of 124 items. (JB)",

A literature review, interviews, and field visits revealed that school library service is undergoing rapid development because of school library professional leadership, improved methods of instruction and instructional materials, higher library standards, and improved financial support. State education departments are also taking a more active role in library development. Major problems are: the absence of libraries in many schools, the gap between national standards and existing resources, the need to rapidly implement the use of new materials and techniques, difficulties in establishing  adequate school library programs in the inner city and small school systems. , high capital cost of library facilities, critical manpower needs, inadequately supported state school library supervisory programs, no provision for staff or equipment in ESEA Title II, the copyright problem, inadequate statistics, the need for research, and the need for centralized technical processing and district materials centers. Some of the suggested solutions to these problems involve action through public policy while others require action within the school library profession. A bibliography of 30 items is appended. (JB)",

It was found that state libraries play a key role in partnership between local communities, states, and the federal government for library improvement and coordination of services. However, the state libraries cannot adequately meet their responsibilities, none meet minimum A.L.A. standards, and they are held in low esteem by state governments. Limitations include: inadequate service to state governments, insufficient state support, unclear statutory authorization, rural orientation,  little research, and a critical need for professional manpower. Recommendations, with many alternative approaches suggested, involve direct categorical aid to state libraries through titles added to the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), funds for research and development specialists and service to state government, addition of a title to LSCA for service to the disadvantaged, appropriations for library research and improved coordination, re-examination of state library responsibility, and strengthening the federal government library effort.

Major trends are seen as: resources not increasing as rapidly as the college population, increased demands on libraries due to changes within colleges, new technology, changing characteristics of library materials, increased pressure for inter-library cooperation and service to the non-college public, greater participation by the federal government, more selective acquisition, library experimentation and changing staff needs. Problem areas include: increased demand for college library facilities, inadequate collections, staffing, unique problems of junior college libraries, the need for national leaders in technical areas, copyright restrictions, a need for research  and planning, existing federal legislation and governmental programs affecting college libraries, and lack of focus in college educational programs. A major recommendation is the establishment of a national commission to plan and coordinate programs and determine which college library projects should be approached at the federal, regional, and state levels.

Only 11 pertinent published studies were found. Of these nearly half are limited to use of academic libraries, there is very little on reasons for non-use, and Berelson's 1949 study is still the most comprehensive. The national social survey of adult attitudes towards libraries, administered by the Gallup Organization, found that the adult public library clientele is primarily upper middle class, and the actual current adult clientele is only half the number of potential adult users. Library experts felt that personnel is the most critical problem, that  automation and better utilization can contribute most to improvement of library operations, and libraries do better with traditional functions than with meeting new opportunities and the needs of the modern urban community. It is recommended that libraries undertake an intensive self-examination of objectives and target publics and that a national library usage research body be created. Appended is an 11 item bibliography, the opinion poll responses, and the survey questionnaire.

FACTS was in operation from January 20, 1967 to March 31, 1968 and included 15 library stations, 7 capable of sending and receiving and 8 capable of receiving facsimile transmission. This document summarizes data and material in two earlier reports, both of which recommended that FACTS be discontinued because of the poor quality in facsimile copy, low volume of requests, indication that the present staff could not handle higher volumes of requests, lack of demand for the service, varying efficiency in the network's stages and inadequacy of  local collections. It is concluded that, although facsimile transmission may be used in the future when technological and system difficulties have been eliminated, the New York State Library should experiment with special delivery service for &quot;urgent requests.&quot; (CC)",

Two major phases of the research have been completed: (1) development of the automatic indexing method and its implementation on the test documents and (2) creation of a machine searchable file for the storage of the index records generated through automatic indexing. Indexing is based partly on a stored dictionary and partly on the identification of text characteristics which can be used to signal to the computer the presence of information to be indexed. The characteristics of the machine file were established with the desired search capabilities in mind. The file  stores document references with their associated index terms. In addition to assigning index terms to documents the computer program also automatically assigns weights to the index terms to indicate their relative importance in the document description. The next two major phases of the work will involve the design and implementation of the search program and the evaluation of the automatic indexing method.

The research reported here is designed to provide evidence of the relative memorability of various descriptive characteristics of books. Characteristics investigated include several now utilized in descriptive and subject cataloging as well as various characteristics not commonly thought to be significant either for catalog records or for retrieval strategies. The primary objective of this phase of research is to identify those characteristics of books which are often enough remembered to be of potential use as retrieval clues. Such knowledge could then play an important role in design studies of future catalogs.  The relative usefulness of various types of nonstandard book information for retrieving a specific work was determined and is presented in tabular form. The other significant research finding was that providing the average specific work requestor with an appropriate retrieval system to exploit his nonstandard information could reduce his expected search effort by a ratio on the order of 500 to one.

Using the reserve collection of the University of Lancaster Library as a basis, a mathematical relationship was established between the number of requests, the length of the loan period, the number of copies, and a standard of service (defined as &quot;immediate availability&quot;). It was found that the Poisson distribution could justifiably be used to relate the average request rate to the number of copies and the degree of availability likely to be achieved. A table was produced which can be used in a predictive  manner insofar as the request rate itself can be predicted. A method of estimating the average request rate from incomplete data was also devised. It was concluded that a mathematical relationship between the factors concerned can be established. The chief difficulty lies in predicting the level of demand for library services and, more generally, in understanding the factors which determine it. (JB)",

The utility of automated catalogs is also studied, based on data from a random sample of the shelf list of a medium-sized university library. An investigation of several large university and public libraries shows that the collections of mature libraries grow at a rate close to the rate of growth of the Gross National Product, and the significance of this relationship as a library management tool is discussed. Numerical methods for determining useful ratios of the size of library files and the number of entry  fields in the structure of the record are given and applied to the use of machine-readable catalog data in the production of bibliographies. It is concluded that mechanization of the cataloging function is necessary and inevitable, and it is recommended that the machine-readable catalog data be used to produce printed book catalogs and special purpose bibliographies.

Issues investigated are those particularly relating to current and prospective policies: considerations relating to automation, the prospects for funding from various sources, the compensation of librarians, the role of economics of size, and the nature of library costs. As libraries are presently operated, cumulatively rising relative costs per unit of service are an unavoidable consequence. Although this can be offset to some extent by automation, it also means that as the economy's wealth grows,  the financial needs of the library will also increase.

The pilot study was conducted to compare the ability of the two tests to assess the intelligence level of English speaking and non-English speaking children. The Ontario test had been developed originally to decide the eligibility of candidates for admission to the Ontario School for Deaf. Both groups scored higher on the OSA than on WISC. Results showed that the two tests do not tap the same areas of intelligence; therefore, scores on these tests should not be used interchangeably. The age and background of each child should be  taken into consideration along with test results. Because results of this pilot study were inconclusive, additional research with a larger group of children is recommended. (MS)",

The four programs were compared in terms of (1) community socioeconomic characteristics, (2) administrative organization, (3) pupil recruitment, (4) staff, (5) parent involvement, and, (6) follow through. Data were collected during field trip interviews and from examinations of proposals and office files at the centers. All Head Start programs were nursery-school, rather than academically, oriented. Results indicated that urban bureaucracy caused depersonalization of the staff and required more written reports than small rural administrative units. However, urban centers  had better facilities, a wider range of personnel from which to choose teachers and aides, and a more heterogeneous population from which to recruit children than rural counterparts. Rural centers suffered from transportation problems and from unavailability of social, health, and psychological services. The advantages and disadvantages of Head Start centers being attached to a public school system are also discussed in the report. Appendix A is an interview guide used in the study. A bibliography is included. (MS)",

A sample of first graders and a sample of second graders were each subdivided into four groups. Group one was exposed to oral-aural teaching methods in English for the presentation of science materials. Group two was taught the same content in oral-aural Spanish. Group three received the science content without oral-aural methods, and the control group, representing a cross section of socioeconomic levels in contrast to the three disadvantaged groups, had neither the experimental science materials nor the oral-aural instruction. Pretest and posttest scores on reading achievement and intelligence for all groups provided  data treated by analysis of covariance. Findings indicated no significant difference in the oral-aural method in the second grade. Results from the first grade rated the oral-aural English treatment as the most successful of all. A possible explanation of the difference in sample results may be that the first grade teachers had had a year's experience with the experimental methods and materials. The development of more appropriate evaluation instruments and additional study of the teacher variable are needed. Fourteen tables and a bibliography are included.

In the parent group-work program, two experimental groups met in three sessions studying behavior modification, inner control, and cognitive development. A control group went to P.T.A. meetings only.

Teachers involved in the study were judged comparable in efficiency and attitudes towards the children. The California Test of Mental Maturity Pre-primary Kindergarten 1 was administered to half of the children and the Lee Clark Reading Readiness Test was given to the other half. High IQ, low IQ, high readiness, and low readiness groups emerged. Children were randomly assigned to formal reading or readiness programs. At the end of the school year the children were given the California Reading Test and the School Attitude Inventory. The teachers filled out rating scales on each child's attitude towards school. Results of analysis of  variance of the data imply that the two types of instruction operated uniformly on all four categories of subjects. Children in the formal reading program surpassed children in the readiness instruction program in reading skills. According to teachers' ratings, attitudes towards school and reading were a function of intelligence and reading readiness. However, on the pupil self-reporting scale, children in the readiness group had more favorable attitudes towards school. (MS)",

        "description":"A discussion of the assumptions about the composition of intelligence which underlie preschool intervention efforts today offers theoretical evidence of a hierarchical arrangement of learning processes. International studies on cognitive development have concluded that the emergence of symbolic or conceptual thought occurs at a transitional age between 5 and 7 years, when the child normatively shows \"readiness\" to learn reading by the usual school methods. Cognitive and psychoanalytical theorists appear to agree that a more mature level of cognitive and emotional organization is superimposed upon a more juvenile level, the latter being inhibited at this time. A concise review of the behavioral development literature supports this general theory. In addition, the range and  diversity of behavioral changes between 5 and 7 seem to reflect the impact of schooling. The following question needs investigation: If the necessary maturation can be advanced or retarded by environmental stimulation, should a preschool goal be to advance the time of transition? The implications for educational programs are apparent. One example is the need for some measurement other than IQ changes in evaluating preschool program outcomes. (MS)",

        "description":"Studies of the effect of environmental stimulation on an individual's development in either general or specific ability conclude that some specific stimulation should be introduced at an early age while a child is still malleable. An intense, persistent, and regular tutorial approach within the family encourages the development of a special talent or ability and develops learning sets useful in the future. A child must learn the specialized symbolic language of the area in which he is being trained, such as in music or mathematics. Studies have shown that persons who excel in one field may show very little competence in others. General ability is present but concentration in the symbolic language and work production in one specific area is reflected in less learning in other  areas. Similarly, if a family or school environment encourages young children to respond to certain stimulation which directs their energies and time in a particular way, these same children may do less well on IQ tests measuring general ability but very well on tests of specific abilities. How much training in certain symbolic languages and concepts is transferred to general cognitive functioning is as yet unknown. Environmental stimulation is a means of developing the greatest potential abilities in any individual. (MS)",

A review of the Berkeley Growth Studies and related studies showed that (1) early mental growth rates are uneven but not chaotic; (2) genetic factors are important in determining intellectual capacity, and around age 2 the nature of mental functions become more complex; (3) maternal attitudes affect  mental scores differently, before and after age 2; and (4) with retarded children, lack of language (and, therefore, communication) and a nonstimulating environment can retard mental growth. It was concluded that many factors which affect mental growth converge at age 2. Further research, however, is needed to identify and specify the nature of the processes of these factors.

Scores were compared, and an analysis of profile similarities showed that groups were most similar on subtests requiring sequential habits. The greatest performance discrepancies among the groups occurred on the analogs, vocabulary, and grammar subtests. Results indicate that strong syntactic habits are characteristic of higher-level functioning and that sequential language habits are characteristic of more primitive levels of language  ability. Two hypotheses are proposed in explanation of the study results: (1) performance on sequential tests is dependent on the relatively fixed capacity of a subject's short-term memory, while other subtests require the ability to &quot;structure&quot; learning which is relatively more dependent upon experience; and (2) since the educationally-deprived children have not developed the higher-level facility with their language, they are relatively free from hypotheses about learning tasks.

The two dependent variables were a nonlanguage test of general intellectual ability, the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test, and the vocabulary subtest of Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children. Data was treated by a three way  analysis of variance. Results indicated that the deprivation index acted as a factor independent of SES and race in contributing to variation in test performance. Older children scored lower than younger ones, indicating that deficit is progressive. Environment, however, can offset deficits. Negro status and lower SES are associated , so the Negro child is twice disadvantaged. Preschool intervention may be able to prevent accumulation of deficits early in the child's life. (MS)",

In the preschool study (100 children), subjects in both experimental groups made greater gains in verbal ability (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) than the control group. On the CPI, children in one program gained in areas of personal social responsiveness and sensory concept activation, while children in the  second program gained in both areas of concept activation, sensory and numerical. Preschool children in both programs made greater achievement gains than did control children. It is possible that greater motivation to learn was fostered by the enrichment program. About 2/3 of this report is made up of appendixes of tables and of forms used in the study. (MS)",

Suggestions are made to help children sense motion and develop their self-concepts and motor coordination skills through rhythmic songs and activities. The construction and use of rhythm instruments are suggested as a means of involving mothers in Head Start programs. Certain types of songs are described as aids in teaching language development. Listening to music is suggested as a stimulus to develop auditory discrimination. A few positive and negative suggestions are given to teachers, and a short section emphasizes that a teacher's lack of applied music training does not prevent successful teaching. Along with an extensive bibliography of recordings, background reading, and resource and song books, a list of  music publishers and suppliers and their addresses is appended. (JS)",

Thirty-two boys and thirty-two girls were put in separate rooms with several toys, several nontoys (door knobs, taped sockets, etc.) and their mothers. The infant's mother was to observe the child in play and respond as she desired. Observation was conducted from another room. Earlier in the study, the mother's touching behavior of the 6-month-old infant was observed. The results showed that at 1 year, boys were more independent of their mothers than were the girls, who touched their mothers and vocalized more frequently. Boys demonstrated more exploratory play and banging of toys than the sedate and quiet playing  girls. It was shown that the boys' dependence was directly proportionate to the amount of touching at 6 month's old given by the mother. For girls, a curvilinear scale resulted. Girls who were touched moderately were more independent than those touched greatly or very little. It was concluded that the child's independence was influenced by the mother's behavior toward the child at an earlier age. From the results of toy play behavior, it was concluded that parents reinforced sex role behavior in the 1-year-old and later the child internalized such roles. (JS)",

The data of this project was obtained by presenting to the child tests measuring cognitive abilities, impulsivity, and reading readiness; and, to the mother, tests measuring her attitudes about school,  her intelligence level, and her flexibility of thought. Because of the longitudinal nature of the followup project, the data analysis is not yet complete. Available results indicate that some of the tests, like Kagan's measure of reflectiveness, discriminate between mothers according to social class, while some of the other tests do not.

The emphasis of this research is on the cognitive interchange between teacher and pupil. The coding categories allow tabulation of the different types of communication used in the classroom. During the initial development of the teacher behavior coding scheme, teacher observation was conducted at two  nursery schools, one for low income children and one for high income children. A second observation phase was conducted in three different types of classrooms: (1) a settlement house class, (2) a Montessori class, and (3) two Head Start classes. Each observation session was taped and coded by an observer. The teacher involved wore a cordless microphone and the observer received the broadcast, for purposes of consistent pick up, by earphones. The 17 transcripts taken are being coded and analyzed. Two appendixes at the end of the report enumerate the coding categories. (WD)",

Children were tested during a summer Head Start program and retested in the fall in a followup study. Of the tests of ability used with the children, the two best predictors of success in the academic tasks in kindergarten was the Preschool Inventory and the Stanford-Binet. The best predictor of socially conforming behavior was the Probable Adaptation rating made by teachers. The behavior and possibilities for future progress of the children were rated at  the end of the summer session and during the followup. An initial hypothesis, that differences in behavior level would affect success criteria scores in low IQ children more than it would in high IQ children, was generally not supported. In addition, no striking curvilinear interaction was found between behavior level and intelligence, but the majority of success criteria appear to interact in a linear fashion across behavior areas.

The matrix game, a set of pictures in columns and rows, which functions on the principles and methods of programed instruction, requires the child to discriminate symbols, pictures, and colors and to verbalize his answer. The telephone interview is used to induce the individual child to structure conversations as the teacher gives him thematic prompts over the telephone. A third method uses the Language Master (a tape recorder and a moving card holder) to make the child verbalize after he has been aurally and visually stimulated. Also, it provides the child with immediate feedback. The alphabet board is a board grooved with the  shape of the letters of the alphabet into which the letters are placed, much as in a puzzle. This device helps disadvantaged children, especially, to learn to discriminate the shapes and names of letters and to realize that letters are a code for the spoken language. All of these methods are designed for supplementary tools for teachers. (JS)",

Two means of assessing teacher ability are quantification of teacher behavior by the use of rating scales, behavioral categories, etc., and participant observation (PO). The first, assessment by instrument, confounds the effects of too many interacting variables for the instrument to reliably represent the effects of teacher behavior. In the PO method, very well qualified and trained people are the assessing instrument. Observer judgment and observer influence upon the classroom situation are present, but if the observer is well qualified and well trained, as he must be  for the success of the method, the data obtained should be more reliable and more relevant. Filming the classroom situation can also be used and adds much to the assessment process. The PO approach was tested on selected Head Start and elementary school classes. The data analysis from this testing is incomplete. It has been found, however, from a combined PO and filming of suburban and inner-city (Hartford, Connecticut) elementary classes, that suburban classes are uniformly superior to inner-city classes.

The interdisciplinary team included master teachers, child psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and a speech-hearing specialist. Graduate students recorded the behavior of the children. The 27 children attended the diagnostic sessions 3 days a week and were observed, by means of one-way mirrors, by the interdisciplinary team. Staff meetings  were held after the sessions to discuss what had been observed and what assistance could be rendered to emotionally disturbed children and their teachers. The project raised more questions than it answered, but among its findings were (1) that social class differences in pathology were not striking, (2) that the data gathering process was not extensive enough, (3) that project communication with the lower class community was insufficient, and (4) that the use of an interdisciplinary team did provide a welcome depth to the informational analysis.

Seven emotions were chosen for this investigation. Each emotion was acted out by actors, whose performance was filmed. From the films, stills were selected which best represented the emotion being expressed. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of race and sex on perception of emotion. Therefore, both expressors and perceivers were divided between Negro and white, male and female. Although the test was designed for children, the perceivers for this study were 80 undergraduate students. Each subject viewed 21 photographs of three expressors and chose from a list the emotion he thought the expressor was demonstrating.  The results indicated that (1) overall accuracy of perception of emotions was not influenced by sex or race of the perciever or sex of the expressor; (2) race of expressor did affect the accuracy of perception of emotion, white expressors leading to greater accuracy of perception; and (3) some patterns of erroneously perceived emotions were related to sex of expressor and race of perceiver.

A third measure was obtained from teacher rankings of behavior based on classroom conduct. For the projective measures, each child was asked to respond to three social situations as depicted by dolls and drawings. The child was to comment upon what he would do if placed into each situation. The situations could elicit an aggressive or nonaggressive response. The three social situations were (1) block play and swinging for boys, (2) doll play and painting for girls, and (3) a book situation for both sexes. Each response by a child in one of the situations was coded as aggressive or nonaggressive. The results showed that the girls in one Head Start school  manifested the most aggressive behavior, with little difference between the sexes in the second school. It was also found that children who express more aggression on projective tests are more verbal and more cooperative. The correlations between the ratings of aggression on the projective tests and the rankings by the classroom teacher were low. (WD)",

The children ranged in age from four to nine. The children were trained and tested under two experimental treatments for each of two conditions. In each age group, the children were categorized, on the basis of pretesting, as (1) conservers (who would receive no training), (2) nonconservers and transitional conservers (who would receive training), and (3) untestable. Incomplete data analysis indicated that middle class 7-  and 8-year-olds were much better conservers, before training, than their Head Start peers. Both groups of children, however, at all ages, appeared to benefit greatly from the training sessions and were facilitated thereby in learning number conservation. (WD)",

A demonstration of preference under these circumstances would suggest the ability to control or maintain behavior without explicit administration of a reinforcing agent. Head Start children were used as subjects. They were provided, in the experimental situation, with a two-button console. The right button, when pushed, resulted in the illumination of a yellow light and the dispensing of a penny for every second illumination (a consistent reward schedule). The pushing of the left button would result in a 50 percent chance of the illumination of a red light, which was never followed by reward, and a 50 percent chance of the  illumination of a green light, which was always rewarded. Thus, whichever button was pushed, there followed a net 50 percent chance of reward. However, only the right button provided a consistent 50 percent reward. The results indicate that children prefer a consistent reward situation to a reward uncertainty situation. (WD)",

The purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to obtain parents' attitudes toward the Head Start program attended by their children, and (2) to involve some of the parents in a meaningful and productive role within the Head Start evaluation and research design. It was necessary, for the success of this project, to sustain close cooperation and joint planning between the professional staff and the nonprofessional interviewers. Hiring  of the interviewers was based on recommendations of New England Head Start directors who had prior experience working in some phase of the overall research program. Twelve interviewers sampled the New England region, and 12 interviewed Mississippi parents. The resulting interviews have been judged to be , on the whole, very satisfactory. (WD)",

The study dealt with a substantial body of 16, 17, and 18 year olds who were still in high school, as well as an almost equal number of people who had graduated from high school and were actually experiencing many of the life problems which the younger group was only  wondering about and preparing for.

Factors found to be associated with the adjustment of low-income families and individuals were anomia, level-of-living, joint decision making, job mobility aspiration, social participation, migration, and communication. These factors affected adjustment differently when people were categorized as homemakers, non-whites, or retirees. It was concluded that rural poverty cannot be attributed to a lack of ambition, and that a good educational program and job opportunities would alleviate many problems of rural people. (ES)",

Unemployment rates decreased slightly, but not in keeping with the nationwide drop in unemployment. Although median family income increased slightly in both areas, purchasing power fell significantly at a time when real income in both the nation and the west  increased.

While containing varied suggestions and recommendations of methods and processes for districts to use in attaining their proposals, the literature for the most part encourages lay group participation, in order to involve as many people as possible in the activity. This paper presents a study of role perceptions by 195 Iowa superintendents of the various groups and individuals (superintendent, superintendent-board, board, lay committee, and consultants) involved in bond elections. The results do not support the contention that involvement of large numbers of individuals increases the probability of bond passage. As  perceived by the superintendents, a cooperative effort between the superintendent and the board of education was the most effective method of ensuring school bond passage. (DK)",

The folk tale is unique in eliciting fanciful interpretation from children and adults because it is read at the level appropriate for the reader or listener. It permits self-discovery by allowing the reader or listener to look inside himself and allows the child to raise questions about himself and his own future.

After six 2-hour sessions, they brought their classes to the Developmental Reading Laboratory four times during the school year for a week's instruction in vocabulary, comprehension, and study skills. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated by the teachers and students alike. Results showed that students and teachers gained from the use of informal reading inventories. An inservice training program focused on the construction and use of these inventories effected  changes in teacher behavior in terms of knowledge of the nature of reading processes, the meaning of reading difficulties, and the use of new reading instructional techniques. Results also revealed that future inservice training programs should emphasize organizational procedures of grouping and individualized instruction. (NS)",

These factors are the developmental status of the learner, the demands of the curriculum, and the structure of the reading process. The differences in the developmental status of an elementary school child and a high school student are brought about by physiological, intellectual, and emotional changes. These account for differences in interest and activities, increased social participation, greater insight and perceptiveness, richer vocabulary, and increased capacity for higher-level thinking as the learner matures. Well-defined subject areas at the elementary level require the development of concepts,  vocabulary, and competencies in word perception and comprehension. At the secondary level, reading becomes more specialized and requires even greater proficiency. This does not imply that a reading skill is unique to a grade level. Reading growth is developmental. Reading skills, abilities, and understandings have their beginnings at the readiness level and are refined, mastered, and enriched at the secondary level. (NS)",

The student's behavior, not the etiology, is the key to change. Suggestions that disadvantaged children have initial reading problems because of auditory, vocabulary, and visual discrimination deficits or articulatory problems are questionable because early reading vocabulary is quite limited, and existing discrimination problems are quickly alleviated by thorough sequential instructions. Also, research evidence indicates that slow learners are often concrete, motoric learners. Apparently average and above average disadvantaged children do not display this type of learning. Teachers have a major influence on the student's success in reading. Therefore,  in addition to pedagogical treatments, the specific operants that discriminate good from mediocre and poor teachers must be isolated. Specific student behavioral deficits and strengths in reading when matched to teacher characteristics can produce a new concept in pedagogy. (BS)",

The text-lecture approach may be adequate for imparting information about diagnostic procedures, but it is not adequate for developing skill in the application of this information. Audio and video tapes, transparencies, and films can be used to simulate actual classroom behavior. Audio tapes develop skills of auditory perception and memory, while video tapes and films develop skills in the observation and interpretation of behavior. Simulation materials which require teacher response can substitute for children in the early part of a training program. Later the teachers assume  responsibility for the analysis of reading behavior while working with children under the supervision of the college instructor. Such training facilitates the use of the new skills in the classroom. (Author/KJ)",

Suggestions for incorporating diagnostic findings into the classroom teaching of reading are presented. The first-grade studies demonstrate that the reading achievement of first- and second-grade children is more closely related to the situation in which they are taught than it is to the general method by which they are taught. Greater variation in reading is found among the classes within any method than is found between the methods or the projects, even when the effects of differences in pupil abilities or projects in the 1,000 classrooms were controlled. Much of this difference should be attributed to differences in teacher effectiveness.  It was concluded (1) that the whole area of differences in specific teaching techniques, rather than differences in general method, needs further exploration, (2) that more research is needed to isolate the types of problems children develop while growing in reading, (3) that there is need for the development of programed self-corrective exercises designed to overcome the more common types of learning problems children develop, and (4) that most of the adjustment to individual differences is made by the sensitive, effective teacher.

A sample of 178 average-achieving pupils in grades 1 to 6 was drawn. The highest reading level with a comprehension score nearest the 70 percent cutoff level was determined for each subject. The lowest percent of word recognition accuracy within the limits set by the comprehension score (70 percent) was recorded. Mean scores  were computed for each grade level and in various combinations. The data indicated that pupils in grades 1 and 2 could tolerate on the average an 85 percent word recognition score and still maintain 70 percent comprehension. Pupils in grades 3 through 6 could tolerate on the average 91 to 94 percent word recognition score.

        "description":"The relationships between reading interest and reading comprehension were studied through the performances of 578 sixth-grade students divided into seven ability groups. Each group was required to read material with readability scores two grades higher than the group's mean reading ability. They rated the selections according to degrees of interest and answered questions designed to measure comprehension. It was concluded that high interest produced greater comprehension which often enabled a child to read beyond his measured reading ability. High ability students were less affected by reading interest than low ability students. Low content interest allowed more accurate discrimination between good and poor readers than high content interest. A reassessment of current methods of  evaluating reading ability might be necessary in order to determine if subject responses reflect low ability or low interest. Implications for educational practice in the areas of testing and teaching are discussed. Possible curriculum changes are suggested. References are listed. (BS)",

A basic tenet of the program was the belief that continuous growth in reading ability is necessary for good academic progress. Besides furnishing plentiful reading materials, the centers offered remedial services to slow readers and attempted to develop in them confidence in their ability to read and enjoy books. Fifteen schools, located in highly populated, culturally disadvantaged areas and 1,005 slow reading pupils participated. Two distinct research designs were used in the evaluation. The first consisted of a test-retest approach to note changes in reading skills and pupil attitudes. The second, based on  a random sampling of children from all the city's reading centers, measured long term gains. The results indicated reading achievement gains among the experimental subjects which exceeded those of the test norm group. Student attitudes toward school changed very little. A positive change was found in the specific area of reading, and the data suggest that the centers were of real value to retarded readers. (WL)",

Teacher evaluations of lay aides' services were analyzed by response frequency distributions. Test results indicated that, with few exceptions, the reading achievement means for all treatment groups were below grade level in terms of national norms.  With primary two pupils, i/t/a followed by the basal approach to reading instruction produced the highest mean achievement scores. Teachers' responses indicated that lay aides provided valuable classroom assistance.

Participating teachers were assisted by preschool conferences, biweekly meetings, supervision, and consultant services. Data on pupil achievement in reading and related language development were gathered from standardized test scores, reading records, oral and written compositions, and scores on a test of creative thinking. Results showed that the academic  achievement of the i/t/a and LE groups equalled that of the BR group. The i/t/a group scored highest on spelling and word study. The LE group was superior to the BR group on word recognition, spelling, and paragraph comprehension. The LE and i/t/a groups read more books than the BR group, but the BR group had better knowledge of the mechanics of English usage. Differences between the i/t/a and LE groups were negligible. Differences in vocabulary development were inconclusive, and differences in creativity were negigible for the three groups. Appendixes and a bibliography are included. (NS)",

Among these are the teacher, the home environment, the school atmosphere, and opportunities to read and freedom to choose one's books.

At the close of the first semester each of the criterion measures showed a significant difference in favor of those groups taking the course. Significant interaction effects between the special course and the reduced load treatment were also shown. The group with only the reduced load treatment achieved at a level below the other three groups and had the highest rate of withdrawals. A bibliography and appendixes are included. (Author/WB)",

A theoretical model of reading ability development was systematically tested by investigating the importance of muscular and auditory feedback in the initial stages, by investigating the relationship of vocalization and subvocalization to the difficulty level of reading material, and by evaluating an effective technique for the elimination of subvocalization in adults. Two experiments allowing specific testing of theoretical predictions were performed on college students. Following these, a study was undertaken on high school students. It was found that subvocalization was more prevalent when difficult materials were read and that it could be eliminated  when nondemanding material was read. High school students did not respond to treatment as did college students, nor was the treatment as lasting. Non-reverters scored higher on IQ and reading tests and required fewer treatments.

Data were analyzed by total treatment, ability score level, and sex. When the two treatment groups were considered as a whole and when performance on all of the criterion measures was considered, neither of the two approaches proved more effective at the end of grades 2 and 3. Although significant differences were found for some of the subskills in  reading or related areas, neither of the approaches demonstrated superior performance in all aspects of the reading process. At the end of grade 2, students in the basal reader treatment showed significantly superior achievement in word study skills, spelling, and oral reading accuracy. At the end of grade 3, students in the linguistic group showed superior performance in the rate of oral reading and number of words used in written compositions. (Author/WB)",

It attempts to eliminate the barriers separating the several branches of mathematics and to unify the subject through such fundamental concepts as sets, operations, mappings, and relations. Included is an outline and brief description of the materials for the first two courses in the sequence. Behavioral objectives of the materials include (1) recall definitions, notations, operations, and concepts, (2) manipulate and calculate efficiently, (3) interpret symbolic data or  processes, (4) communicate mathematical ideas, (5) apply concepts to a purely mathematical situation--solve problems, (6) apply concepts to problems in other situations--solve work problems, (7) transfer learning to a new situation in mathematics, and (8) construct or follow a mathematical argument. At present the program is designed for the more capable students (roughly those in the top 20 per cent of their class with respect to mathematical ability). (RP)",

The first problem in this investigation was to ascertain which, if either, of two unlike programs of instruction was more effective in developing skill in computation. The second was to determine the value of an unusual design for this kind of evaluative research. The programs in question are the Cuisenaire (Cui.) system of instruction and the Traditional (Tra.) system, both systems defined as they were taught in the school year 1963-65. The subjects for this study were l,l09 Scottish children ranging in age from 91 to 119 months, with a mean age of approximately 100 months. One group of subjects consisted of 539 children who had studied  arithmetic according to the Cui. program for three years, in Primary I, II, and III. The second group of 570 children had been taught arithmetic in the same grades according to the Tra. program. From the evidence obtained, it is reasonable to suggest that children identified as low in intelligence and exposed to a relatively long period of instruction in arithmetic will gain more through involvement in the Cui. program. No claims for the superiority of either program can be made with respect to other sub-samples or the total samples selected for this investigation. (RP)",

The four stated goals for effective articulation between institutions are (1) transfer students should not be forced to take additional courses at the higher institution, (2) a junior college transfer student should require the same number of credit hours to graduate as a student who completed bachelor's requirements in the senior institution, (3) junior  college courses must fit the course requirements of the state college or university, and (4) colleges and campuses within an area should agree on lower division prerequisites for a major.

        "description":"The main objective of this project was to develop effective multi-sensory aids for individual use by high school students who have not achieved a functional mastery of mathematics. Nineteen audiovisual devices directed specifically at the low achiever were developed from three specific devices--audio tape, audio tape with slides, and video tape. Two types of exercises were developed using audio tape. One type is an exercise designed to increase the low achiever's speed with basic facts and skills, and the other is a story problem exercise. Thirteen audio tape and slide programs were developed from materials utilizing fundamental concepts in mathematics. Finally, four video tape programs were developed for fractions, story problems, area, and volume. Responses to follow-up sheets  administered to participating students have shown that these audiovisual materials represent an advance in the individualizing of instruction for low achievers among high school students.

It presents evidence and conclusions drawn from visits to a 50-institution cross section of colleges and universities where teachers are prepared and from conferences with educators, government officials, students, United Nations personnel, and members of private organizations and public agencies. The &quot;Introduction&quot; reviews the methodology of the study and places it in the context of current activity in the field. Chapter 1 is a background analysis of the dimensions of the problem of educating teachers in the American system and its cultural and social setting. The role of &quot;Colleges for Teachers&quot; is dicsussed  in Chapter 2, particularly with reference to programs of such groups as the Peace Corps. Chapter 3 reviews programs of &quot;International Experience Abroad and at Home&quot; which are possible through existing organizations and international connections. Chapter 4, &quot;The Certification Question,&quot; deals with the role of federal, state, and local agencies along with educational associations and private organizations in teacher education. &quot;The Cultural Element in Foreign Policy,&quot; examines the relationship between the education of American teachers and the conduct of foreign policy. A final chapter summarizes 72 recommencations for improving the quality of education in a world dimension. (JS)",

Procedures included: (1) Teachers rated aides' performances. (2) Activity sheets and questionnaires were used to obtain participants' judgements of the values to the schools and pupils of the aides' work. (3) Daily lesson plans, evaluations of the plans, and observers' reports furnished role definition and training data. (4) Achievement tests and attitude and interest inventories provided data for future selection of aides. Content and statistical  analyses of data obtained revealed aides to be effective in the instructional process: 39 of the 40 aides were rated satisfactory by the teachers. Both teachers and aides gained greater understanding of their roles, although aides indicated a desire for more training time in classrooms. It was also found that aides most frequently performed tasks instructional in nature, as well as clerical, monitorial, tutorial, and housekeeping tasks. Eight recommendations for training aides evolved. (Evaluation materials and questionnaires are appended.) (Author/SG)",

A conclusion of the original study was that the experimental group showed at least 25% higher scores on teaching performances than the control group; the followup study was designed to determine if the relative differences in teaching behavior persisted. Subjects were 10 randomly selected members from each of the original 4 experimental groups. Four observers, 2 of which participated in the original study, were trained by Harry L. Garrison, who had trained the original observers in the use of the same instrument. Each team of 2 observers appraised half of the 40 subjects, and the  reliability of observers' ratings was assessed statistically. There were no significant differences when analysis of variance was computed among the 4 groups for each of 10 variables . Results indicated that differences among the 4 groups tended to become smaller after a year; however, most of the variability was accounted for by the atypical scores of 5 subjects. Judging by means of observer ratings, the total group of 40 tended to show small positive gains in teaching performance standards. Included are 3 statistical tables and the reactions of Garrison who designed the observation instruments used. (JS)",

A 2 x 2 factorial design was used, classifying 132 sophomore education students into 4 groups depending on their placement in the upper or lower half of the distribution of the MTAI and F scale scores. Analysis of MTAI posttest scores adjusted for MTAI pretest and College Qualification Test verbal scores supported the major hypothesis: that students who have relatively high F scores will show less positive change in attitudes on the MTAI than students who have relatively low F scores. But minor hypotheses were not  supported: there were no differences in MTAI gains between students in the upper and lower half of the distribution of MTAI scores, and there was no interaction between the two factors, pre-MTAI and F score. It may be concluded that greater improvement in attitudes toward teacher and pupil relations may be expected of more critical and independent students (the naysayers expressing democratic attitudes) than may be expected of students characterized as yeasayers and/or as holding authoritarian attitudes.

Goals were (1) improving the competencies of staff in their dealings with underprivileged children and (2) facilitating development of materials designed to be applicable to the instruction of underprivileged children. Data were gathered by means of a locally developed Workshop Evaluation Form and the observations of evaluators from the Detroit Public Schools Research and Development Department who observed 36 workshop sessions. Limitations of the evaluation are that (1) only participator comment and  observer report were used, (2) effects of the workshops upon children's attitudes, attainments, and interests were not studies, (3) in such a large project it is difficult to establish criteria applicable to all the types of workshops. It was found that participants strongly approved the project and believed its objectives were achieved. Also, Research Department observers reported favorably on all workshops, although they preferred participant oriented to lecture oriented workshops and multiple meeting to single meeting workshops.

Many phases of the study are related to the program that permits students to obtain a master's degree in 4 full years of study, including summer sessions. Some students have now completed each of 3 major innovations: (1) the &quot;acroclinical semester&quot; which integrates methods instruction with practice teaching, (2) the resident teaching experience during which the student receives college credit and a beginning teacher's full salary as an intern in an outstanding school system in the Midwest or Hawaii, and (3) the graduate program which includes 6 hours in the graduate study  of teaching plus 9 to 15 in the academic major with 6 hours of electives. Other innovations are a 5-hour Creative Arts Workshop for elementary teachers and 3 freshman and sophomore year seminars which cut across the typical subject matter lines in the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Experimentation with such techniques as video taping has produced a series of films for the study of child behavior; the use of simulation techniques will result in production of a package program of problem-solving materials.

(2) Will such teachers come to behave more or less in accordance with their professed beliefs? (3) Can measures of a teacher's beliefs be used to predict changes in behavior that occur when he is exposed to empirical evidence of his personal inconsistency? The Teacher Practices Inventory, the Personal Beliefs Inventory, and the Teacher Practices Observation Record were used to measure beliefs and behavior in terms of agreement or disagreement with John Dewey's philosophy of  experimentalism; Rokeach's Dogmatism Scale was used to measure openness to change. Fifty-three teachers were tested and observed teaching both before and after an extended inservice program. Statistical analysis of the data provided negative answers to all three questions. A particular difficulty encountered in this research was the existence of white and Negro subgroups in the group of teachers tested. The Negro teachers in this rural area of South Florida, apparently anxious to avoid contact with white authority whenever possible, seemed particularly threatened by the white observers. (SG)",

Thirty teaching tasks designed to include a variety of curricular dimensions were developed by 6 observers with considerable experience as preschool teachers and observers; each task listed materials, procedures, instructions, rationale, and method outcomes. Eighteen 20-minute filmed tasks resulted, 3 each for 6 Head Start teachers and their classes. Observers in the classroom took additional notes at the time of filming. Teaching style was inferred from the behaviors of teachers and children in classroom activities; a number of behavioral scales were developed to distinguish particular constellations of individual and  interactive behaviors. It was found that the use of tasks provides the standardization necessary for observers to accurately predict subsequent task teaching behaviors and that the use of films is essential for careful study of stylistic differences between teachers. Of the components of the teaching situation, teaching style appears to be the most critical and the most difficult to study. (Included are an 8-item bibliography and a description of teaching tasks.)

Factor analysis of the data yielded 5 bipolar dimensions which accounted for 27.6% of total variance among all items. Beta-weighted mean scores of teachers on each factor were subjected to David R. Saunders' method of pattern or profile analysis. The results of this analysis plus an examination of written responses by teachers to questions about their achievements and aspirations resulted in identification of 5 types of teachers: (1) subject oriented, (2) staff oriented, (3) system oriented, (4) supervision oriented, and (5) socially oriented. Nearly half of  the total sample of teachers fell into a marginal or &quot;mixed&quot; orientation category, perhaps due to (1) the extent of professionalization of school teaching, (2) the extent of bureaucratization of schools as an institution, and (3) the interpenetration of bureaucratic and professional principles in the formal organizational structure of schools. Since nearly half of the sample group was not classifiable, it seems that a satisfactory conceptualization and measurement of work values associated with school teaching has yet to be accomplished.

The experimental program coordinated laboratory experiences of observation and participation with selected readings and seminars in the foundation areas of psychology, philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Data derived from the Classroom Observation Record, a system of interaction analysis, the National Teachers EXAMINATION (NTE), and student teaching grades was analyzed using t-test and analysis of variance. Results showed significant differences in the teaching behavior of the two  groups: the experimental group received more desirable behavioral ratings, but the control group made significantly higher scores on the Professional Education Section of the NTE. The implications are that programs stressing possession of factual information about professional content are less likely to produce desirable teacher behavior than are those stressing laboratory experiences which are made relevant to content and theory.

Chapter 4 is excerpts from working papers written by each participant and read by the others as springboards for discussion of such seminar topics as the use of techniques and resources, selection of objectives, maintenance of professional competence, evaluation procedures, and relations with students. In Chapter 5 the editor summarizes the results of participant questionnaire evaluations, and in Chapter 6 presents a distillation of \"Suggestions for the Improvement of College Teaching.\" A 53-item list of \"Suggested References on College Teaching\" is also included.

Most of the 34 contributors are university-based administrators of teacher education programs. Section 1 provides brief reflections on the workshop-symposium, and Section 2 presents much of the conference content: a chapter on promises and pitfalls in the trend toward  collaboration; descriptions and analyses of emerging partnerships in teacher education; a review of group discussions at the conference; and elaborations on 7 issues and problems in cooperative venturing. Section 3 focuses on emerging administrative and regulatory developments in collaborative enterprises. Section 4 deals with the foundations for partnership in the philosophical bases of teacher education. Various innovative procedures and practices in supervision, such as microteaching, simulation training, and pre-student teaching laboratories, are discussed in the 12 parts of Section 5. A final section offers \"A Look at the Future.\" (JS)",

His central role remains that of the stimulator of learning for individuals and groups. Teacher educators and school administrators must work even more closely together in preparing him for work with the disadvantaged, and schools must free him to teach by having auxiliary personnel and equipment to assume the nonteaching duties. But a teacher's role is more than that of stimulator of learning. He is also (1) a member of the teaching profession who shares his thinking and experience with others to promote the interests of education and of  teachers, (2) a contributor to the formulation of educational policy who recognizes that the ultimate control of education is justly and legally a public function, and (3) a citizen of a community who exercises his right to influence public policies, thus setting an example for pupils. Teacher educators, leaders of teacher organizations, school administrators, and legislators must all recognize these diverse roles of the teacher, must better prepare him for all 4 of the roles, and must facilitate his functions, particularly in the newly emerging roles.

Planning such training programs involves identifying change \"targets\" (persons or relations the change efforts will focus on) and choosing appropriate \"strategies\" or training methods. Targets include characteristic attitudes and behaviors of students; teachers' personal feelings and values about racially potent matters; new teaching practices needed to bridge the gap between intentions and behavior; teacher-peer relationships; administrative policies which can facilitate and support teacher change; and school-community relations relative to teacher and student change. Potential strategies include (1) identification of useful  books, films, photographs, and recordings on interracial classroom relations; (2) laboratory training devices, particularly sensitivity training groups, role playing, skill practice exercises, and T-groups of peers in which members attempt to give and receive feedback through interpersonal analysis; (3) formation of professional responsibility teams; and (4) use of various simulation-type problem-solving exercises. School systems and educators in collaboration with community members need to consider what more positive stimuli or rewards can be offered to encourage participation in such professional growth opportunities.

An experimental group of 20 experienced elementary teachers who had participated in the summer workshop and a control group of 49 who had enrolled too late for admission were invited to participate in a clinical teaching experiment. Hypothesis 1, that a higher proportion of the experimental group would agree to participate in a project requiring a clinical report, was not supported. Hypothesis 2 was accepted: A greater percentage of the experimental group (58% vs. 29%) did complete the required case  study. Hypothesis 3, that school administrators would indicate a general acceptance of clinical teaching by giving higher ratings to the (coded) clinical teaching strategies of the experimental group, was supported; however, less than half of the 24 administrators invited to participate did so. A 1-way analysis of variance design was used to ascertain the significance of differences between groups. Indications are that much remains to be done before clinical teaching becomes a classroom reality. (Included is a 12-item bibliography.) (JS)",

First, a series of observations were made under normal class conditions to determine the usual percentages of teacher use of student ideas and student initiation. Then, during a 20- to 25-minute time period, each teacher attempted to elicit student initiation on 2 topics selected by the experimenter. Finally, each teacher again attempted to elicit student initiation on 2 more topics. Each teacher and her class was observed using Flanders' Interaction Analysis categories to code teacher and student behavior, and a statistical analysis was made of the results. It was concluded that those teachers who  increased their use of student ideas increased student initiation, whereas teachers who did not increase their use of student ideas did not obtain more student initiation.

English scholarship focuses upon the literary or linguistic analysis of complexities which have no immediate practical application, whereas English education must promote the essentials of language learning for an educated citizenry. However noble and democratic the ideal of educating all, it has created an acute shortage of quality teacher-power as college enrollments soar alarmingly and as increasing demands are made upon educators to serve outside agencies in their free time. Thus, \"radical\" choices and new alignments within departments must be made  to protect educators and teacher-preparation programs from suffering intellectual extinction in the interests of fraternity and equality. English educators must somehow find the time and dedication for scholarship, imposing upon themselves and their discipline the rigorous and competitive intellectual standards upon which other disciplines thrive.

For advanced secondary or first-year college students, teachers should avoid approaches and tests that are concerned with (1) extraneous biographical, historical, and scholarly knowledge, (2) psychological, political, or religious implications, and (3) impressionism. Such elimination leaves only formalistic criticism to evaluate student responses. This objective approach may be a discussion in which the student analyzes how poetic and linguistic techniques contribute to the &quot;whole meaning,&quot; or it may take the form of structured questions on the poem. The best solution--a compromise  between these two objective analyses--tests the student's knowledge of the devices a poet may use without encouraging him to read material into the poem. Ideally, the test leads the student to analyze the poem as precisely as possible without destroying his interest in it. (LH)",

To help students understand this film as art, such questions can be discussed as--(1) how natural background-effects, camera angles, and film sequences establish the sense of Doinel's environment, (2) how images and symbols  heighten the effect of the boy's complete isolation, and (3) how the boy's world is brought into sharp conflict with the adult world.

While exploring the incident, however, Lee discovers that the 12 &quot;heroes&quot; aren't good and that the &quot;cowards,&quot; who saved their own lives by confessing readily to lies and cowardice, are perversely heroic. Lee, at first, angrily denies the sentimental myths surrounding the 12 &quot;good&quot; men, but he eventually bends and &quot;with a  wondrous lightness of heart&quot; joins the refugees in singing a song of homage to their homeland and the 12 &quot;invincible&quot; martyrs. Because the novel does not answer clearly whether Lee's decision is praiseworthy or damnable, it can be used successfully in the classroom to investigate ethical complexities and to test hypothetically the students' moral fiber.

Of the four objectives of the STEP test which appeared congruent with four of the essay-grading criteria, a comparison of scores showed a small significant correlation between STEP and the &quot;Punctuation&quot; score, a moderate significant correlation between STEP and the &quot;Usage&quot; and &quot;Effective Organization of the Paragraph&quot; scores, and no significant correlation with the &quot;Sense of Audience and Purpose&quot; score.

The results must be qualified, however, since no measures of parallel form or score reliability were available. (LH)",

A semester's \"exploration of soul,\" the  reading of Negro literature, or the writing of a term paper on racial problems can all contribute to a better understanding of the Negro's, and conversely the white man's, history and role in America. (Many books involving Negroes are cited throughout the article.) (LH)",

        "description":"A method of studying the responses of adolescents to literature was devised and utilized in analyzing the reactions of 52 ninth- and 10th-grade students to four short stories. Each story was divided into six sections and the students' verbal responses were recorded after reading each section. The resulting data indicated that, of the seven response categories, students gave more interpretational reactions than summaries or responses involving literary judgment, self-involvement, personal associations, or prescriptive judgments. Although individual interpretations were generally unrelated to intelligence or reading ability and response patterns were highly individualized, a correspondence was noted between socioeconomic status and response patterns, and a strong positive  relationship was found between responses of literary judgment and those of self-involvement. Six sources of difficulty in literary interpretation were identified: failure to grasp the meaning, irrelevant associations, reliance on stock responses, \"happiness binding,\" critical predispositions, and a search for certainty. The information and techniques of this project can be applied to further research and to methods of teaching to correct revealed weaknesses. (The stories selected were \"All the Years of Her Life\" by Morley Callaghan, \"Prelude\" by Lucile Vaughan Payne, \"Reverdy\" by Jessamyn West, and \"The Man in the Shadow\" by Richard Washburn Child.)

To determine the effect of familiarity with telephones, one group of 12 children was provided with telephones in the classroom immediately following an initial interview; another group of 13 was given telephones following a second interview 3 months later; and a third group of eight children was interviewed once but given no additional exposure to the telephone. Finally, all three groups were interviewed at the end of an 8-month period. Results indicated that the telephone interview is a reliable technique for recording representative speech samples  from young children and has application to longitudinal studies in which changes in verbal behavior can be analyzed in terms of vocabulary level, language structure, and articulation. No significant differences were found in a comparison of the three groups, suggesting that exposure to telephones in the classroom did not strongly influence the child's performance in the telephone interview. That this \"exposure\" to the telephone was essentially unstructured and that the children in the study were similar to each other should be considered. (DL)",

Since linguists have discouraged the idea of a &quot;good&quot; English, teachers now favor language, oral as well as written, which is appropriate to the objective situation and adequate to render the speaker's subjective intention.  Emphasis in composition is placed on topics, audience, and preliminary discussions involving creator and audience. Although such teaching approaches are both difficult and challenging, they stress the unity of development between the child's personality and his language; for by developing in pupils the control of oral and written language necessary for personal expression, the teacher contributes to the development of the individual's ability to hold to his own purposes and values.

The stressing of form, techniques, and literary merit before such considerations matter to the student may also remove his delight in literature. To counteract these tendencies, study should not be restricted to great literature; instead, it should include books which speak to the child and, while offering him  stimulation, do not force him beyond his present capabilities: most children, like adults, read to satisfy fantasy needs. Because the arts seem one of the chances for overcoming the universal boredom and violence which menace Western society, literature must be made a more natural part of more people's lives, and any distortion of the natural growth of artistic perception through misguided literature teaching should be avoided.

The linguists of today can begin to utilize the methods developed by structural linguists to scientifically investigate the problems which concerned the universal  grammarians.

These rules require that the writer be able to speak sentences at a normal pace with intonation appropriate to the meaning. Thus, simple sentences normally have only one stress-terminal pattern and one mark of punctuation, and compound and complex sentences have two. However, in certain sentences (e.g., those with compound verbs) two primary stresses will occur without a terminal juncture falling between them and, thus, will require no punctuation. Three stress-terminal patterns occur, for instance, in sentences with restrictive or nonrestrictive  constructions for which intonation gives the best clue to punctuation. The intonation clue can also be used for items in a series between which \"fade rise terminals,\" rather than \"level terminals,\" occur.

Because the transformational method allows for generalizations about the process of embedding, it can make more economical statements about syntax. Furthermore, since the transformational theory holds that a finite set of phrase structure rules plus a finite set of transformational rules can explain  any sentence, it is linguistically more complete and consistent and, thus, more practical in the classroom than the taxonomic theory which assumes that an infinite set of phrase structure rules is necessary to describe all sentences.

        "description":"Linguistic criticism not only shows students the usefulness of grammar but also improves their comprehension of literature. For instance, a study of stress, pitch, and juncture in E. E. Cummings'\"anyone lived in a pretty how town\" adds meaning to the poem. Also helpful is an analysis of Cummings' tagmemic method of substitution slot-filling--use of verbs in noun slots and use of parallelism with the morpheme \"by.\" An examination of D. H. Lawrence's short story, \"The Blind Man,\" shows a contrast of grammatical patterns and literary moods between the second and fourth paragraphs. The conjunction \"and\" is used 10 times in the second paragraph to create a sense of the continuousness of joy. In contrast, \"and\" is used only twice in the fourth paragraph, but much embedding of kernel  sentences that doubles back to emphasize, redefine, or modify reveals a sense of depression and regression. An analysis of the dialog in this story shows that Isabel's speech--replete with questions, negative morphemes, and the conjunction \"but\"--indicates her hesitation, indecision, and insecurity. Similarly, the speeches of Maurice and Bertie, showing constant use of the question transform, reveal their insecurity. This linguistic analysis, therefore, makes students more aware of the fusion of form and meaning, and points out the integral part that language plays in their lives. (JS)",

They selected themes of interest to students in grades 6-8 and then prepared a list of books of varying degrees of reading difficulty which related to these themes. The student could, therefore, read a book commensurate with his ability and at his own rate of speed. One successful technique for individualizing instruction and encouraging intellectual inquiry was the preparation of a set of questions about a book to which the student could respond on his own. He was encouraged to experience the work itself, relating it to his own experiences and to other literary works. Questions and discussion on E. B. White's \"Charlotte's Web,\" for example, first concentrated on the  student's personal reactions; then emphasized plot, character, and theme; and finally tried to guide the student to relate his discoveries about animals in this book to other animal stories he had read. Such a literature program places the burden of learning upon the student and should develop to the fullest possible degree his reading power. (LH)",

Between the spring before kindergarten entrance and the 4th grade, 436 subjects were tested 11 times at 6-month intervals. On the basis of kindergarten measures, boys and girls were selected: One shift sample with scores on imitation and picture articulation tests differing substantially; 5 percentile samples with articulation scores clustered around the 7th, 15th, 30th, 50th, and 98th percentiles on total distributions; and 3 phoneme samples, each with one phoneme as the primary mis-articulation. Articulation was assessed at each session. At selected sessions, tests were  administered in the speech, reading, spelling, language, auditory stimuli, visual stimuli, personality, intelligence, and motor areas. Articulation scores of the percentile samples maintained the same relative positions through the study. Adequate articulation was attained by the 98th percentile samples before kindergarten, and had not been attained by the 7th percentile samples in 4th grade. Among the percentile samples, mean non-articulation scores were lowest for the 7th and highest for the 98th percentiles. No pattern of non-articulation scores was identified for the phoneme samples.

True linguists suggest theories about the structure of language and the way in which grammar is acquired, internalized, and used, but have as yet shown little interest in educational matters. Although there is opportunity, on the other hand, for educational research to be built on the insights of transformational grammar, educators have neglected research and precipitately become concerned with linguistics in the curriculum. &quot;The Roberts English Series&quot; specifically fails, except in trivial ways, to  relate reading and writing with grammar study, to suggest stimulating assignments, and to recognize the worth of the teacher. Rather than using such textbooks which set out new and inaccurate rules to replace the old rules, teachers in secondary schools should lead classes in the collection of language data and the formation of tentative generalizations.

Another approach, the group planning of a story to illustrate a fable, not only increases the students' appreciation for this type of literature, but also requires an abstract level of thinking. In correcting papers, the teacher should avoid close grading and requiring the story to be recopied; for the evaluation of a paper should depend on content and communication of  thought rather than on \"correct\" mechanics.

The analysis begins with a discussion of the background and sources of the selections in the &quot;Readers,&quot; proceeds to a discussion of moral and patriotic education in Communist China since 1949, and to an outline of more recent work in educational psychology. Following this, a review is presented of techniques of teaching reading as advocated by Chinese educational theorists. In addition, a number of teaching outlines for selections in the &quot;Readers&quot; are also included. In the actual analysis of the &quot;Readers,&quot; each selection is analyzed on the basis of its topic and its manifest themes, which are  classified in three categories: informational, political, and behavioral. The dominant emphases of the &quot;Readers&quot; were determined from the total scores for these categories. From this information, a profile was drawn of the &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;model&quot; child, that is, the child who would have adopted the political attitudes and behavioral norms of the &quot;Readers&quot; as his own. The study concludes with a discussion of conflicting values in the &quot;Readers&quot; and their implications. (Author)",

The particular weaknesses found in elementary materials were that (1) instructional materials varied widely in type and quality; and (2) textbooks emphasized physical geography rather than cultural or social background, gave little in-depth knowledge of any one area, emphasized nontypical countries, indiscriminately included names and dates, were overly general about contemporary problems, emphasized recall of facts rather than reasoning, and made little attempt to relate new material to the student's known world. On the positive side, the survey discovered many books and pamphlets available for  the elementary grades, as well as some teaching units and visual aids. At the secondary level, the project found that textbooks tended either to lose sight of Latin America in a world picture or to consider only the area's relationship with the United States from 1890 to the 1930's. Bibliographies of supplementary books and pamphlets, some satisfactory teaching units, and film strips were found to be available for use at this level.

Wherever the educational process permits a differentiation which places Negro children at a disadvantage, the public school as failed to meet its constitutional responsibilities in eliminating inequalities. Negro children are denied equal opportunities through school attendance and assignment procedures, placement or grouping, and through a differential allocation of resources. The existence of these disparities is confirmed both in the Coleman report and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report on racial isolation. Although every state has the  obligation and the authority to make the necessary reforms and adjustments, individual school systems, in cooperation with one another, should take the initiative before statewide action is required.

For example, practitioners should be aware that there is a greater incidence of brain damage among children from impoverished families, and that lower-class deviancy is more aggressive and blatant than middle-class deviancy. Much of the hostility of disadvantaged youth stems from their subordinate, marginal role in society. Since these youths tend to function best in groups, therapy or counseling might be most effective in a group situation. Moreover, in the remediation process a preconceived notion of how children \"should\" act serves a self-fulfilling prophecy and hinders successful  treatment. Educators and social practitioners should have a specific understanding of the disadvantaged child and actively realize that poverty contributes heavily to the deviancy which exists among members of the lower class.

First, it is felt that from a historical as well as a contemporary perspective, it is clear that the public schools are designed to meet the needs of the middle class. Thus, even if the same educational program is offered to all students regardless of class, educational inequalities might persist. This middle-class bias also results in rejection of disadvantaged children by personnel who perceive themselves as members of this class. Secondly, school activities and attitudes are more suitable for girls than boys. This disregard for inter-sex difference among students operates to the disadvantage of boys from the lower socioeconomic class,  especially since they in particular lack contact with any consistent and desirable male models or male behavioral patterns. The disadvantaged child must be considered an \"exceptional\" child who requires the services of a highly trained teacher to carry out a specifically relevant educational program.

The traditional stress on the cognitive functions of education has resulted in a curriculum which is irrelevant for many children, especially disadvantaged youngsters. Needed is a curriculum in which the affective dimensions direct the cognitive dimensions and are intrinsically linked. In order to be meaningful and relevant, curriculum content must be germane to the learner's knowledge of his own experience; and the student's feelings should be used as a basis from which to teach subject matter. Also, an instructional strategy which will enable teachers to work  with the affective from which they may generate relevant content and procedures should be developed to legitimize the learner's explorations of his own feelings and concerns.

Described are the crisis in New Haven, and the organization, process, and nature of the co-professional meetings. Specific problems faced by urban principals are presented in a case study of the principalship: the administrative problems, decentralization and isolation, power and autonomy, professionalism, and professional role.

From this vantage point the paper describes the educational and structural changes which would make the schools consonant with a dynamic contemporary society and which would provide a system of universal education from preschool through college. Discussed are such issues as (1) the organizational and bureaucratic rigidity of the most school systems, (2) the  irrelevant curriculum which does not consider the concerns of the students nor their career development, (3) the educational manpower needs which can be partially met by nonprofessional aides, (4) the improvement of urban teacher preparation, and (5) the problem of segregation, desegregation, and integration.

In particular, perceptual dysfunction is pointed to as a major causal factor in the reading problems of the disadvantaged. In one urban slum school, 40 percent of first graders showed serious dysfunction when evaluated on the Frostig visual perception test, with Puerto Ricans and Negroes scoring significantly lower than whites and Chinese. Based on clinical impressions from 50 cases, the information and vocabulary subtests of the WISC appear to differentiate the disadvantaged from the advantaged. In addition, the Diagnostic Test of Word Attack Skills shows a pattern of inability to distinguish between grapheme and phoneme and to  discriminate blends. Although class differences are found in articulation and dialect patterns, problems in these areas do not affect reading achievement. Emotional disturbance among retarded readers is not related to class or ethnic status. It is felt that environmental influences are the likely determinants of perceptual dysfunction, in which the differentiating variable is quantitative. Remediation need not involve devices, but corrective teaching must be specifically appropriate to lower-class rather than middle-class pupils. (NH)",

This model focuses the teacher's attention on the learning situation and suggests the kind of action which is needed to deal with the school performance of the disadvantaged student. Within this pedagogically oriented model, the teacher would seek to ascertain why the child is not learning well. Diagnosis would help in providing information on the factors impeding learning and would pinpoint the handicap which is most disabling to the learning process. After categorizing the child in terms of his shortcoming, the next step would be to determine the  appropriate remedial effort. Among disadvantaged children, language inadequacy is the most common learning deficiency, with \"pure\" cultural disadvantage being a residual factor to be approached as a separate issue.

In the past the capitalist factory system demanded a cheap labor supply and therefore education was viewed only as a necessary vocational preparation. The contemporary issues of poverty and education are intimately interwoven with the problem of color discrimination and economic improvement. Today's concern with education for disadvantaged groups is actually derived less from a stronger social conscience now than from factors which make poverty \"economically disastrous, militarily dangerous, and politically inexpedient.\" Nevertheless, the chances for success are greater now because of a constellation of new forces. The  impetus for the education of the disadvantaged may come from inspired amateurs but an army of competent professionals is essential. To maximize the productive potentiality of all people 12 years of general education in the sciences and humanities are recommended. Moreover, the toughness and resourcefulness of the lower-class child are qualities which should not only be preserved but are ones which the middle-class child might well emulate. (NH)",

        "description":"A social psychological analysis of the school life of disadvantaged children indicates that conflicts result from the lower-class youngster's need to adjust to the expectations of middle-class society. A review of social psychological theory points to the implication that the cultural conflict is a fundamental one going to the very heart of basic social and personality organization. Moreover, the school as socializer of the disadvantaged child approaches him as a secondary system with expectations of behavior which are incongruent to him. The formulation of a primary-secondary group dichotomy suggests that the academic functioning of the disadvantaged child reflects an inability to become involved in schooling rather than a lack of will. Teachers should be aware of the patterns  of social structure discussed here and research might determine the importance of this formulation for academic success. In addition, the school must choose whether to concentrate on the strengths of the primary system of the poor or whether to educate these youngsters toward middle class membership. If the choice is the latter, then in the early grades such techniques as role playing and role taking, and, in the later grades, the study of society would be effective. (NH)",

A CDC, and especially one serving the disadvantaged, must therefore offer a comprehensive, interrelated program of health and social services, family involvement and education, nutrition, early childhood education, and assessment and evaluation. An inexperienced or a secondary school teacher might be a better choice for a CDC because the experienced elementary level teacher may be more resistant to the needed innovations and change. An early childhood classroom is different from  other types because it is more like a laboratory which encourages guided self-learning and, with a lower adult-child ratio, provides more opportunities for greater adult support.

The use of indigenous nonprofessionals in the schools may benefit the older disadvantaged student by providing him with a role model and a sympathetic adult from his own social class. Work-study programs can also be effective with these students. Amother important strategy is specialized training for teachers and administrators in disadvantaged schools. School personnel should learn to recognize and respect the positive, adaptive qualities of the poor, and to utilize these qualities in the planning and execution of lessons. In the classroom teachers might use  readers which warmly portray Negro children in urban settings.

Also, a huge body of research on learning processes is presently being ignored. Moreover, educators should accept the personal worth of each student, regardless of his race or ethnic group.

The original materials were tried in 13 project schools and revised before publication. Thirty lessons were organized under the following headings: (1) Architecture and Construction, (2) Ceramics, (3) Graphic Arts, (4) Industrial Design, (5) Leather, (6) Metalworking, (7) Photography, (8) Textiles, and (9) Woodworking. Each of the lessons provides (1) the titles of instructional materials such as films, pamphlets, or photographs, (2) lesson  objectives, (3) a lesson synopsis based on the instructional material, (4) suggested teacher preparation, (5) key terminology, (6) suggested student activities during and following the lesson, and (7) suggested optional intellectual and creative student activities. The designated instructional materials serve as the focus for each lesson and each was selected for a particular cultural purpose which is expressed in the objectives.

Objectives of the program focused on the role and function of research in shaping vocational-technical education programs in the nation's big cities. An effort was made to up-grade the trainees' research competence and to familiarize them with available resources. The 5-day instructional phase of the program ran in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Vocational Association, giving trainees an opportunity to participate in selected aspects of the convention  program and providing a source of professional resource persons. The agenda included lecture-discussion presentations, panel discussions, individual and team discussion sessions with project staff, and small group meetings wherein 10 teams of four people identified a priority problem in vocational education, then designed and developed a proposal outline for researching the problem. Appended are publicity materials, a list of participants, and the 40-page proposal outlines for 10 priority-problem studies. (MM)",

        "description":"A sample of 240 vocational agriculture students enrolled in 21 Illinois high schools and their teachers participated in a study to determine whether different groups of students placed different connotative meanings on certain words and phrases important to vocational agriculture. The students, in four grade levels, were classified into three socioeconomic groups. Teachers and students indicated on a semantic differential instrument the connotative meaning of 11 words and phrases--learning by doing, leadership, cooperation, Future Farmers of America, farming, vocational agriculture, agricultural mechanics instruction, supervised farming programs, nonfarm agricultural occupations, on-farm instruction, and teacher of agriculture. Comparisons of results were made between student  groups by grade and socioeconomic stratification and between student and teacher groups. Some findings were (1) A different connotative meaning was placed on the words &quot;leadership&quot; and &quot;cooperation&quot; by groups classified by socioeconomic level, (2) Students not residing on farms felt that &quot;agricultural mechanics instruction&quot; was more important than did farm resident students, (3) Teachers were more in agreement with junior and senior students concerning meanings than with freshmen and sophomores, and (4) All pupil groups agreed with the teacher group on the meaning of &quot;cooperation&quot; and &quot;Future Farmers of America.&quot; The complete report is available as ED 010 181.

In 61 Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) programs, analyzed separately, wide variations were found. Some recommendations were for (1) utilization of effective screening tests, (2) faculty selection on the basis of teaching preparation and knowledge of practical nursing education as well as a degree, (3) budgetary provision for adequate libraries, (4) discouragement of programs with small enrollments, and (5) studies of available educational and clinical resources and faculty before initiation of new programs.

The basic business-economics sequence is totally general education in nature. The college preparatory sequences should be helpful to students, counselors, and business teachers in planning high school programs for individuals who plan to enter college curriculums in secretarial (or office) administration, business administration, or business teacher education. The sequences are discussed in relation  to suggested courses, student population, objectives, occupational opportunities, and evaluation procedures. Specially designed programs such as cooperative business, vocational office, and programs such as cooperative business, vocational office, and distribution education, and diversified cooperative training provide culminating office education and work experience for melding skills and knowledge developed in the suggested sequences.

It is a system which furnishes training through employment and one which is affected by the employment level of a given period. This is particularly important as the apprenticeship typically lasts 4 years, and the apprentice need at the termination of the training period may not be the apprentice intake based on the employment level 4 years earlier. The declining trend in apprenticeship since World War II cannot be attributed to any single cause, but the increased number of persons who continue their formal education seems to be the major one. Major factors which affec of apprentices are (1) irregula\"y of employment rate,  (2) the completion rate, (3) unemployment, (4) college and apprentice enrollment, and (5)the ratio between craftsmen and professional-technical personnel. Statistical analysis indicates no significant relationship between the number of apprentices and the number of journeymen. Although apprentice numbers appear to have been small due to employer reluctance to train skilled workers rather than to union policy, relatively little consideration has been given to the system itself, the factors affecting the employer's decision to hire apprentices, nor the factors affecting the apprentice's decision to enter or complete such a training program.

This group was expected to increase to 3.7 million by 1970. A study of 2,500 young men rejected from military service for mental reasons found only two-thirds of these in the labor force as compared to 95 percent of all young men aged 18 to 24. It was estimated that over 85 percent of all retarded persons could become capable of some self support if given adequate training and employment opportunities. Service occupations constitute the fastest growing occupational area in which the retarded are likely to qualify for training and employment. The U.S. Vocational Rehabilitation Administration has had considerable success in placing retarded  individuals as kitchen workers. Opportunities have been increasing in other likely occupations such as busboy, busgirl, dishwasher, hospital attendant, nurses aide, janitor, charwoman, yardsman, groundskeeper, and landscaping laborer. Several training projects developed by the Manpower Development and Training Act, the federal-state employment services to handicapped applicants, new policies by the Civil Service Commission, and federal legislation offer new training and employment possibilities for the mentally retarded.

During 1963, more than three of every five persons enrolled in training and retraining classes under the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962 were family breadwinners. A fairly high proportion of workers with family responsibilities consisted of older persons who had difficulty in securing jobs. A considerable number of adults lacked basic education in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Under the 1963  amendments to the MDTA, trainees who need both basic education and occupational training could receive training allowances for a period up to 72 weeks. The large number of women breadwinners with preschool-age children indicated a need for more low-cost day care services.

The programs ranged from a large operation in Detroit to smaller individualized programs initiated by Kalamazoo, Michigan, and North Richmond, California. They were designed primarily to help youth prepare for work with the will to work and more emphasis was placed on teaching youth how to work than on the specific skills involved in a particular job. Common elements found in most programs were a job preparation course that included guidance, instruction, and work experience subsidized by the sponsoring agency, and a student followup to assure satisfactory employment. Some guidelines for the local community were: (1)  Determine individual needs of the community, (2) Collect the information, (3) Decide what action should be taken, (4) Select staff for the program, (5) Prepare program guidelines, (6) Provide educational and guidance services, (7) Provide work-experience, (8) Offer placement services, (9) Conduct program followup services, and (10) Engage in research and program evaluation. The basic problems responsible for youth unemployment include automation, overall unemployment, discrimination, and inadequate educational preparation. Job preparation programs can assist many communities in solving some of their unemployment problems. (WB)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to experimentally test the theory that programed instruction can satisfactorily teach psychomotor tasks which primarily require the learning of cognitive knowledge in order to properly utilize motor skills already possessed. A programed unit on regrinding drills was selected, and a dexterity test and self-instructional materials were developed. A cluster sample of 146 ninth, 10th, and 11th grade vocational agriculture students, selected from 21 New York schools, was tested on reading ability and dexterity, assigned to arbitrary levels based on scores, paired according to skill levels, and randomly assigned to experimental and control treatment groups. The control group had only programed instruction and the experimental group had both programed  instruction and self-instructional practice. Both groups were given a performance test, and the control group was given a performance retest. Analysis of covariance procedures were used to analyze the data. The data failed to support the theory. Self-instructional practice used to supplement the programed materials did not produce significant benefit over use of the program alone. Findings clearly indicated a significant relationship between student dexterity and ability to learn psychomotor skills effectively through use of programed materials. A bibliography is included. This Ph.D. thesis was submitted to Cornell University. (JM)",

The criteria in each area is listed with a 3-point rating scale and a space for explanatory notes. The self-evaluation process should be directed by a steering committee and  involve the entire staff of the vocational-technical school. Each staff member should serve on a sub-committee in addition to completing a self-evaluation form in his own area. The steering committee should be responsible for developing a final report from sub-committee reports. As a result of the evaluation, in-service programs should be instituted to bring about the indicated needed improvements.

Critical issues which emerged centered around how to develop training capability, the problems related to established institutional procedures, and resistances and barriers put forth by unions and professional groups. The experiences of Howard University, Lincoln Hospital, and Mobilization for Youth indicated that salaries and upward job mobility were among the major operational issues. At the administrative and policy levels the issues discerned were largely relevant to civil service and its potential contribution to nonprofessional careers. Success in the California  State Civil Service experience with nonprofessional careers was presented. The final phase of the workshop related to planning, implementation, and coordination of existing nonprofessional careers programs at all governmental levels. (ET)",

In the first phase, data were collected by questionnaire from 64.8 percent of 962 potential Ohio employers which was a 50 percent random sample of 1900 employers. In the second phase, a selected sample of programs was analyzed by a jury of 12 industry experts to determine curriculum content. Job titles were identified in landscaping, arboriculture and park management, greenhouse and nursery production, wholesale and retail sales, turf production or management, and floriculture. Age requirements ranged from 19 to 60 with an average minimum of 23 and maximum of 50. Salary averages ranged from a $467 starting to  a $696 maximum. Ohio had an estimated need for an average of 262 technicians per year. In eight institutions in seven states selected by seven experts, a study of 21 programs revealed the following common characteristics--(1) length of 18 to 24 months, (2) award of associate degrees, (3) high school graduation admission requirement, (4) supervised work experience of 5 to 12 months, (5) emphasis upon technical subjects, and (6) a minimum if 60 semester hours.

Reasons for not hiring  women based on assumptions of comparative employment characteristics of women in general, assumptions of sex prejudice of clients, or stereotype characterizations are not bona fide occupational exceptions.

About one-fourth of the students attend non-government schools. Technical education is a state responsibility with little organizational uniformity between states. Technical institutions conduct a variety of courses grouped into courses for training for technologists (degree and diploma courses), technicians (certificate), and craftsmen  (trade), courses in general education, and courses for recreational purposes. In 1963 enrollments were 27,500 in universities, 34,000 in technical training institutions, and 275,300 in trade courses. Work experience is considered a fundamental training procedure. Technical education by correspondence is available. Technical teachers are recruited from industry or commerce and given inservice teacher education courses. Apprenticeship is the most common means of entry into trades, and 95,000 were being trained in 1965.

Junior secondary students may enter  vocational schools. Primary and secondary enrollment was 2,325,000 in 1962. Vocational and technical education is conducted at the university, a technical institute, a trade school, seven junior technical schools, and a basic technical training institute at various levels. Teachers are educated primarily by study abroad, for which scholarships are provided. No regular scheme of apprenticeships exists, though large firms provide systematic training with released time.

        "description":"Findings are presented from a questionnaire survey of selected statistics of pupil enrollment, number of high school graduates in 1963, percent of students graduating based on grade 10 enrollment, and certain characteristics, such as organization, compulsory school age, pupil mobility, free textbooks, and free kindergartens of large city school systems. The major emphasis of the report is on school holding power. Returns were received from 128 cities, representing 96 per&quot;ent of the total population of cities over 90,000 and 27 percent of the national population according to the 1960 Census data. Findings included: (1) Four-fifths of the school systems were organized on a 6-3-3 basis, (2) The median number of years of compulsory school attendance was 9 years, (3) Forty of the  school systems had separate vocational high schools, and half indicated a gain in holding power for vocational schools in the period 1960-63, (4) The holding power rate in 1963 of the combined public school systems in the 128 cities was 70.8 percent based on grade 10 enrollment, (5) 51 percent of the pupils who were enrolled in grade 10 in vocational high schools in 1960 graduated in 1963, (6) The greatest pupil loss in both vocational schools and all systems occurred at grade 10, and (7) Holding power rates were inversely proportional to city size--the larger the city, the lower the holding power.

A sample research report and analysis was included so as to lead the reader through the design steps. The sample study was designed to determine the extent of attitudinal changes in industrial education and home economics student-teachers due to the effects of the attitudes of their supervising teachers. The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory was administered in a pre-and post-test design. Scores from the post test and the difference between pre-and post-test scores were utilized in the analysis. Attitude scores were collapsed into four levels and the students' fields were considered as two levels of an  educational factor in a 2 by 4 design. (EM)",

The improvements are in line with the recommendations of the Gordon Committee in its 1962 report. Some changes are expanding the sample to 52,500 households, raising the lower age limit from 14 to 16 years, sharpening and clarifying the definition of unemployment, improving the reporting on other items such as hours of work and self employment, and developing a body of new information for persons not in the labor force. On the whole, the new MLS shows a slightly lower unemployment rate than the CPS. Fourteen tables comparing MLS and  CPS data include (1) Employment Status by Color, Age, and Sex, Annual Average 1966, (2 ) Major Unemployment Rates, (3) Unemployment by Age and Sex, (4) Unemployed Persons by Full- or Part-Time Status, Age, and Sex, and (5) Employed Persons by Class of Worker and Occupational Group.

An attempt has been made to comprehensively survey the literature concerning manpower forecasting, and a selected bibliography of 153 items is included. The bibliography is classified on the basis of the 7 methods of forecasting with short  explanatory notes regarding some of the materials. A separate chapter is devoted to the data requirements in manpower forecasting in general, and to survey of the sources of data in Ontario. Another chapter, &quot;Coordinating Educational Planning with Manpower Forecasting,&quot; discusses the problem of translating &quot;crude&quot; labor requirements, as derived through some appropriate forecasting technique, into qualified labor requirements, and then deriving the appropriate educational requirements.

        "description":"National needs for 1975 have been projected at 450 nurses per 100,000 population. For the South to reach a goal of 300 would require that graduations be increased by 1975 to nearly four times the number graduated in 1966. Practical nurse programs have nearly doubled since 1960; in the last six years, the number of associate degree programs has increased from 15 to 69 and the number of baccalaureate programs from 48 to 57, while the number of hospital diploma programs has decreased from 218 to 179. In the South, however, student enrollments are lower, with little increase in Negro admissions, and there are proportionately fewer nationally accredited programs. Schools in the South have proportionately more vacancies in nurse faculty positions and faculty members tend to have less  educational preparation for teaching; however, since 1960, there have been increases in the numbers of master's degree programs which prepare for teaching and administrative positions. Matters which warrant further consideration are relationship between national and regional goals and the specific needs of communities and states, conditions which increase withdrawal of nurses from active practice, adequacy of educational preparation for job responsibilities, utilization of nurses, barriers to recruitment, desirable balance of types of nursing education programs, and the preparation of nurses for teaching, administration and other top positions.

Comparisons were made between advantaged and disadvantaged students, advantaged students and office employees, and disadvantaged students and office employees. Additional comparisons were made within and between cultural groups on the basis of interest in office work, typewriting experience, grade averages, and grade level. Highly significant differences on almost all items were noted when the students and office employees  were compared; however, the advantaged students did not differ significantly in any of the categories with the disadvantaged students. Few significant differences were detected between cultural groups on the basis of interest, typewriting experience, grade averages and grade level; neither the advantaged nor the disadvantaged student appeared to understand office work. Recommendations were that resource people be brought to the rural classroom that teachers return to the office for work experience, that field trips be made, and that a library of office occupational information be available to students and teachers.

        "description":"Differences between educational aspirations, expectations, and abilities of rural male seniors based upon their participation or non-participation in high school vocational agriculture programs were analyzed. Data were gathered from classroom questionnaires administered to 517 seniors, of whom 400 had had one or more years of vocational agriculture instruction and 117 had received no vocational agriculture instruction. Levels of significance were obtained by employing the chi-square statistical technique. Findings indicated: (1) A highly significant negative relationship was found between participants in vocational agriculture programs and educational aspirations, (2) Students participating in vocational agriculture were lower in educational abilities at a highly significant  level, (3) More seniors in the vocational agriculture group than in the non-vocational agriculture group were older, resided on farms, and came from larger families with low or middle income, (4) More parents of vocational agriculture seniors exhibited low levels of formal education, (5) Seniors in both groups were influenced most in their educational aspirations by immediate members of their families, and (6) Students with relatively low educational aspirations and expectations were receiving little or no encouragement from the school atmosphere or their families to continue their formal education beyond high school.

The General Leadership Development Institutes held at Mississippi State University and Utah State University were designed to meet the needs of technical education personnel in relatively new positions. The State Staff Development Institutes held at the University of California at Los Angeles and The University of Connecticut were designed specifically to help experienced technical education personnel to better understand and fulfill their  state leadership roles. Instructional materials for the institutes included the original Compilation of Technical Education Materials (VT 002 936) and the supplements (VT 002 930, VT 002 928) prepared for the 1966 institutes, and additional commissioned papers and materials. Recommendations indicate that the institutes planned and conducted on the consortium approach should be continued in 1968, the leadership and program development training in technical education supported by the federal funds and national advisory services should be continued, and that institutes should be planned and organized around fewer topics of most critical need.

Responses to mailed survey instruments were received from 159 of 500 veterinarians listed by the Kansas Veterinary Medical Association. Findings were: (1) 42 percent expressed an interest in employing veterinary aides from a proved training program, (2) Extrapolation from the above data revealed a need for 304 veterinary aides in 278 practices, (3) 43 percent would use the veterinary aide in a clinic situation and 48 percent in a combination field and clinic, (4) 63 percent would use aides in large animal and  25 in small animal practices, and (5) The estimated average starting wage would be $78.56 per week. Some recommendations were: (1) that plans be initiated to establish a pilot veterinary aide training program, (2) that the agricultural education division work with a special advisory committee in curriculum development and on-the-job training programs, (3) that considerable on-the-job experience be provided with cooperating veterinarians, and (4) that the program be a certificate program based upon satisfactory completion of training requirements.

A polysensory, self-pacing instructional system was developed which included (1) pretests and post tests, (2) a general instruction book, (3) equipment to practice arc welding, (4) programed instruction books, (5) loop films for demonstrating arc welding procedure, and (6) self-evaluation devices. Subjects were administered pretests to determine facts and skills possessed before using the system. General directions were given about the use of the system and the subjects proceeded at their own pace and repeated phases of work as often as necessary to produce a weld of quality predetermined as satisfactory by a jury of experts. Analysis of  variance was used to test the significance of the differences between the performance of the groups. All subjects acquired levels of knowledge and performance which were predetermined as satisfactory. The average time required to reach this level was 5 hours and 10 minutes, with the high school students using more time than the other groups. Results indicate the practicability of utilizing polysensory instructional systems for learning high level perceptual-motor skills and knowledge. The system should be tested with controlled groups to ascertain the strength of this approach of instruction. (HC)",

Respondents representing occupational therapy were the only ones who indicated no need of chemistry, while respondents from all occupations indicated need for some knowledge of physics. Only respondents in the laboratory field indicated that knowledge of psychology and sociology would not be useful. Respondents representing the field of medical records indicated a slight need for chemistry, physics, and microbiology knowledges and a greater need for familiarity with terminology associated with human anatomy and physiology.

Interviews were conducted with 88 Caucasian and Negro Job Corps enrollees and 91 Caucasian and Negro ninth grade pupils using 10 drawings representing work typical of the occupations. Results indicated the nature of subjects' occupational preferences and ways these are influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status and self concepts. Practically all subjects aspired to occupational levels higher than the occupations of their parents. Perceptions of parental feelings only slightly affected the occupational interests of the  subjects. Most subjects seemed to view work largely from a basic need level--food, shelter, clothing, etc.--with relatively little concern for satisfying higher needs. Few subjects expressed concern about abilities and aptitudes necessary for various jobs. This suggests that more knowledge of occupations and one's abilities and aptitudes are necessary for adequateoccupational choice making decisions. Further research might focus on modifying this technique for use with groups. (CH)",

Major findings were: (1) There appeared to be a consistent, positive relationship between low cultural, economic, and social levels and low achievement, low intelligence, high alienation, negative attitudes toward school, and low vocational maturity, (2) Integrated  Indian pupils appeared to accept the values of the majority non-Indian society to a greater extent than did segregated Indians, and (3) Within each classroom, a segregated situation generally existed. Some educational implications were: (1) Transfer of pupils to integrated schools in Grade 9 may be potentially more harmful than helpful, (2) Grouping classes by achievement, resulting in racial segregation, requires re-examination, and (3) Extensive and inviting adult education programs geared to the needs and problems peculiar to the Indian adult would assist in the transfer of favorable attitudes to the next generation.

Phase III of research with the program was the evaluation of the first year of experimentation with the programs for the 11th grade. A pretest-post test research design with four control and four experimental construction cluster groups, four control and three experimental metal fabrication cluster groups, and three control and three experimental electromechanical cluster groups was used to estimate the program effectiveness. Newly developed measurement instruments and standardized tests were used to estimate changes in selected cognitive, affective, and  psychomotor behaviors. Objectives were attained in varying degrees with significant gains in cognitive abilities in eight experimental groups and modest gains in two groups. Increased flexibility of occupational preferences and broadened interests were found in the experimental groups.

The seminar consisted of three major presentations by Felix Robb, Curtis Aller, and Roy Dugger, generally dealing with the current status and trends in vocational education. The remainder of the seminar was conducted on a small group discussion basis. A paper on the problem-solving process and three background papers from State Directors are also included. Specific plans emerged for: (1) a four-state study, involving members, on how to  more effectively utilize staff of state departments, (2) a task force group to continue to study the scope of vocational education, and (3) a change in the structure of national meetings held by State Directors of Vocational Education to &quot;problem-solving&quot; as opposed to the traditional &quot;speech making.&quot; (MM)",

        "description":"This book is designed as a text primarily for college students preparing to teach sex education or \"education in the nature of human sexuality and the relations between the sexes\" in elementary and secondary schools. An attempt is made by the 13 writers, most of them sociologists or psychologists, to distinguish between the knowledge which the teacher transmits to his students and the knowledge which he himself needs in order to do it. The first 5 chapters concentrate on some of the pedagogical peculiarities which characterize teaching in the area of sex. \"Trends in Sex Education\" reviews the movement to introduce it into the school curriculum and surveys the current scene. The \"how\" and \"what\" of sex education are dealt with in \"One Approach to the Age Placement of Concepts and  Materials.\" The students' own stages of lifelong human growth are the focus of \"Normal Sociosexual Development.\"\"Some Social and Psychological Aspects of Sex\" distinguishes between the roles of teacher and counselor, and \"Sex Education in the Community\" discusses the role of agencies other than schools. Chapter 6 on masturbation and 7, 8, and 9 on premarital sex standards and interpersonal relationships attempt to provide both information and guidance. Broader sociological aspects are covered in the last 3 chapters--\"Sex in the Culture of Poverty,\"\"Changing Concepts of Masculinity and Feminity,\" and the \"Impact of Culture and Values.\" Lists of references and suggested readings follow most of the chapters. The book will be published in May 1969 by John Hopkins Press, Baltimore, Md.  21218, in paperback and hard cover. (JS)",

A questionnaire elicited information from superintendents on the allocation of their time among various functions and among various classes of recipients of their services.

Data were collected on pupil performance and exposure to CE in 11 school districts (132 schools); in addition to achievement test scores for 1965-66 and 1966-67, information was gathered on the characteristics of the pupils, their schools, and their communities. Results indicated: (1) a slight decline in average pupil achievement level in the sample schools; (2) a slight improvement in achievement of pupils at the lowest achievement levels in their respective grades; and (3)  considerable variation in changes in achievement among school districts. Preliminary results suggested that the amount of improvement was related to level of Title I expenditures. The overall study provided evidence that more specific studies were needed to properly evaluate the effects of Title I.

Tables show both similarities and differences in their general characteristics, permitting tentative comparisons. Americans viewed retirement more positively, found their jobs more difficult or unpleasant, expected better retirement income, had more encouragement from employers and unions to retire early, and were more likely to receive preretirement education. (The question remains whether such education produces a positive attitude or the reverse.) Programs in the two countries were compared using a recent United States survey and by means of visits and questionnaires in Great Britain. It was concluded that  American programs would benefit from broader public support to provide a variety of participants and community groups, that enrollments in both countries are small and tend to come shortly before retirement, and that more experimentation with course content and methodology is needed.

Fifteen women were randomly assigned to three groups and each given a list of six symbols. Their task was to discover which symbol they all had in common. Participants were organized in a circle (conference) or straight line (panel). A total of 15 trials was used in each task. After each set of five trials, persons were asked to identify a group leader. In the second session the recognized leader from the panel sat with the same group in the conference, and the conference group moved to the panel situation. In the third session, the recognized leader  from the panel operated in a conference group with different members. After each session right and wrong answers were recorded and leader identification ascertained. Findings indicated that group structure was a more important variable in task performance than leadership recognition; the relationship between past experience in a particular group and performance in a new group was shown to be significant. Leader recognition as a factor in the efficiency of task performance could not be substantiated with this study. (aj)",

        "description":"Because the bulk of professional attention to middle-age change has concentrated on women, and because there is a need for data on differences in career options and alternatives between men and women, a study focused on the process of adult development, men-in-transition and adults experiencing discontinuity. Data were collected by means of (1) a questionnaire returned by 322 of the 420 male students 35 and over enrolled as undergraduates at Wayne State University in 1967, (2) semistructured group interviews with eight men which explored the reasons for change and stresses involved, and (3) a discussion between two panels of eight men of the role of counselors and educators in working with adults. The adult male returning to college is about 40, a part-time student working for a  degree, probably in liberal arts or, if not that, in education or business administration. There is a need for further study of the adult as a learner and for more comprehensive models of adult development which include provisions for self-exploration taking place all through life. Reassessment of academic requirements and bureaucratic processes to encourage rather than discourage college attendance by adults is needed. Separate adult counseling centers should be established. (The document includes 33 references, 12 tables, the questionnaire, and an occupation code.) (aj)",

        "description":"In 1967, several two-day institutes were held in Indiana for counselors of adult basic education students, and, in addition, a one-week residential institute for selected counselors who had attended a spring institute. Primary emphasis was on awareness of responsibility and understanding of the under-educated adult. Situational and Q-Sort tests were used to determine participant's perception of the role of counselors of educationally disadvantaged adults. Participants entered with a high degree of skill and knowledge about adult counseling which was maintained, but not significantly increased, by the programs. Counselors' perceptions of the undereducated adult as an educable entity increased after the institute, but there was a slight decrease in the perceptions of the adult as  an economic unit and as a human being. The selected group who attended the residential institute did not differ from the total group.

Twelve teacher hours of instruction were divided either into six two-hour or four three-hour segments. The reading method &quot;Formula Phonics,&quot; is a learning theory approach to teaching, and uses an integrated word-attack system taught in a manner and setting which help remove a pupil's anxiety through his making correct responses. Comments from participants and principals indicated that (1) the project was highly effective in teaching adults the techniques of reading instruction, (2) the instructor's personality and the clear, interesting presentation of meaningful well organized  materials contributed greatly to program effectiveness, (3) the brevity of the courses did not permit some participants to practice and review their findings, and (4) home instruction was the major use of course learnings.

        "description":"Since its founding in 1862, Vaughan College of the University of Leicester has moved from a working men's institute offering elementary education to adults through a period of domination by the Workers' Education Association (WEA) to become a lively institution offering to adults university level courses in several locations. During 1946-1966, the University's extra-mural courses increased from 72 to 255 and its enrollment from 1,484 to 5,657. Students now attend voluntarily courses which have been established by the university, based on its own market research. At the same time, the concept of university extra-mural programs has narrowed to provision of part-time university education, given outside the walls of the university, by full-time university teachers to adults capable  of studying at the undergraduate level or above. The present courses can be grouped in four classifications: reparative (classes provided in cooperation with WEA to introduce adults to university level education), renovative (courses to help persons keep abreast of new knowledge in their professional fields), redintegrative (classes to round out one's education, and recreative (courses providing exercise for students' intellectual powers).

The first part dealt with the relationship of adult education to other disciplines. This part establishes a framework for classifying areas of needed research in the field of adult education. The framework used here is based on application--learning, teaching, social change, guidance, and other activities. Some of the areas of need identified are tied almost wholly to a specific discipline or an applied field, while others are associated with certain program areas. Three interrelated categories of application are used: (1) the adult as an individual and as a learner, (2) the adult's response to sociocultural phenomena, and (3) the adult education  enterprise. A background is provided for each area of need; series of questions are asked in order to demonstrate the scope of these needs; and each need is given focus by a short statement or a few summarizing questions.

It is concluded that the financial and other problems of British university extension, especially its frequent failure (as compared to the Workers' Educational Association) to reach the working classes, have generally stemmed from universality rather than specificity of purpose.

To assess the effectiveness of this program, a study of continuing education needs and interests was made during 1966-67. Data were obtained on age, sex, education and training, experience, hierarchical position, type of employing agency, and other relevant characteristics of 1,355 professional public health workers in the western states, as well as on preferences for 78 course types and for newly proposed methods and techniques of instruction. Nineteen topics were selected by 20% or  more of the respondents; eleven of these were already available or being developed. General problem areas, and skills in community and organizational problem-solving, were the major concerns; multidisciplinary courses were widely favored over single discipline courses; and television and videotapes were widely supported, but not teaching machines. Typically, participants were older, had more experience and higher positions, more often had advanced degrees, and were more likely to belong to the APHA or a state association, than nonparticipants. However, 66% of full-time professionals lacked a degree in public health. (ly)",

There was time for psychological testing, individual counseling, application of classroom principles to the job and homework, and evaluation of progress at various stages. The project held the attention of the police executives while not keeping them away from their jobs unduly. Behavioral changes in the participants resulted in improvements in their departments. Problems arose  from supervisory municipal officials who did not cooperate as much as desired, and from a failure to use the psychological testing, class time, and outside projects to best advantage.

As a result of the ABE Program from 1965-68, some students left welfare rolls, obtained jobs, and received raises and promotions; many enrolled in vocational training and high school programs, while others passed high school equivalency tests.  Changes in attitudes and behavior of these people show efforts to break out of poverty. Efforts at training people to meet the shortage of ABE teaching manpower include use of institutes, state agencies, and local education facilities. A major problem of the ABE program is the dropout rate (19% in 1966). A list of 10 Federal agencies having ABE programs, a summary of nationwide data on ABE students, a table of state funds and enrollments, and various other presentations of pertinent information are included.

Some education is run by local unions, the national AFL-CIO, and its state and local affiliates. Twenty-seven university centers, mostly located at state universities, conduct programs; but most labor education is at least union sponsored; programs provide training in union skills or education about unionism. It is usually in short, self-contained units, conferences, short courses, and brief  residential schools but there are some longer residential programs and some continuing education courses, especially in the social sciences. Recent changes include more continuing study, more broad social issues, more sophistication in methods, more staff training, and more university centers and unions supporting education.

The changing linguistic situation does not give to any writer freedom to write in Swahili without regard to established standards. There is such a thing as style in Swahili. Knowledge of Swahili vocabulary is not by itself evidence that an African can write with good style in Swahili. Some Africans, even today when there is a turning-away from Arabic borrowings, like to employ Arabic words in order to convince their readers of their knowledge of Swahili. Such words of Arabic origin are sometimes employed where the Swahilis themselves would prefer the Bantu equivalent, if there is one. Some African writers have a good  understanding of Swahili grammar, but very little idea as to how in fact the Swahili people express themselves. A sentence may be grammatically correct, but still be unacceptable, because the phrasing or syntax is not according to Swahili practice.

Results indicate that: (1) Items that have been often experienced and are repeatedly represented in the storage system of a subject are recognized faster than items that have been experienced less often.

Keeping all other factors constant, their recognition thresholds for such  new items are higher than for young subjects. (3) There seem to be age differences in long term need states as measured by the need for achievement test. Old subjects seem to rearrange items at a lower speed than young subjects and consequently have lower achievement test scores. (4) Need-arousing instructions hinder the performance of old subjects, but improve the performance of young ones. Because of their large storage, old subjects seem to become confused rather than being supported by this influence.

The subjects were 80 children in each of the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades.

A post-test questionnaire revealed that older subjects were characterized by more efficient encoding and rehearsal strategies which were postulated as the basis for the older subjects'  relatively better ability to selectively process information.

The second class of tests, used in the control of a person's career, may be concerned with what the subject can do, or what he should be able to do in the future. The temporal distinction is less important than the major functional one; exactly the same test can serve as a diagnostic test before some material i s taught, and as an achievement test after. Similarly, proficiency tests are generally used as predictors of future performance. The author suggests using a functional definition of levels which would test ability to operate easily and effectively in specified sociolinguistic situations (rather than  attempting to characterize levels of knowing a language in terms of grammatical and lexical mastery). As in all testing, the central problem of foreign language testing is validity. With tests of the first class, this problem is not serious, for the textbook or syllabus writer has already specified what should be tested. With tests of the second class, it remains a serious difficulty, for no way has yet been found to characterize knowledge of a language with sufficient precision to guarantee the validity of the items included or the type of tests used.

During the \"linguistic\" period, the study of language became more \"objective\" because the prevailing scientific viewpoint valued dispassionate observation of data.

Examples of similar surface structures and dissimilar underlying structures often presented to students of English for pattern drill are pointed out (e.g., the \"it\" in \"It's easy to speak English,\"\"It's difficult for us,\" and \"It's hot outside,\" reflects respectively, extraposition, pronominalization, and association with the weather). English as a second language materials are oriented almost invariably toward imparting as a final goal the ability of the student to give phonological shape to surface structures. The author considers mastery of deep structure principles as important, if not more so, since it is these which govern semantic interpretation. Because control by  the student over deep structure differences will not take place unless he is aware of them, one of the aims of language pedagogy must be to bring about that awareness. Drills designed to strengthen this unconscious perception will serve also to measure the extent to which English grammar has been internalized. The author suggests that \"restatement\" and \"transformation\" type drills provide the most obvious framework for such practice, and that contrasts of this or any other kind must not be attempted unless the paired structures have already been separately taught.

        "description":"According to the author, most grammarians have been writing stratificational grammars without knowing it because they have dealt with units that are related to one another, but not simply as a whole to its parts, or as a class to its members. The question, then, is not whether a grammar is stratified but whether it is explicitly stratified. This paper discusses the model o f language that is being developed by Sydney Lamb and H. A. Gleason, Jr. It is explicitly stratified and recognizes six strata (hypersememic, sememic, lexemic, morphemic, phonemic, and hypophonemic) grouped into three major structural components of two strata each: semology, grammar, and phonology respectively. Collectively, the strata are a system or code for relating communicative content at the &quot;top&quot; to  vocal expression at the &quot;bottom.&quot; Each stratum consists of an inventory of its characteristic units or &quot;emes,&quot; and a set of tactic rules that specify how the emes combine with one another on that stratum. Finally, strata are connected to one another by realization rules, which describe how the emes of one stratum are linked to those of another. Any text, for example a sentence, exists on all the strata simultaneously. On each stratum the text will be a structure of emes ordered by the appropriate tactic rules, but on each stratum it will differ in structure. In effect, the strata furnish alternate ways o f looking at texts of a language. (DO)",

        "description":"Many Western scholars consider Hindi and Urdu as a single linguistic entity. The author concedes that &quot;in an important sense this is correct.&quot; Hindu and Muslim inhabitants of the same village behave like members of a single speech community. However, minor differences in the phonology, grammar, and lexicon are underscored by the differences in the writing systems, by which prose or poetry is identified. Hindi, which uses Devanagari script, is taught only at the college level in the United States. (Exceptions are the Peace Corps programs, no t included within the scope of this paper, and the Neglected Languages Program conducted by Boyd-Bowman from S.U.N.Y. at Buffalo.) Because Hindi has no history of traditional teaching practices, universities offering courses in Hindi utilize  oral-aural approaches and emphasize competence in speaking. However, beyond elementary level, available materials are very scarce, and not well suited to students of social sciences. These situations apply also to Urdu, which uses Perso-Arabic script, and for which there is even less widely available regular instruction. Also discussed in this paper are needs of students in both of these language areas, overseas centers, summer and undergraduate programs, the writing systems, recommended teaching materials, research priorities, and the role of these two languages in South Asia.

In terms of academic success, as reflected by this study, it appears that the students from low socio-economic backgrounds perform better than other students. Their grade point average was higher, the percentage on academic probation was lower and the rate of withdrawals was less.

Of 60 students in 1964, 24 accepted and 34 rejected the group counseling invitation. Their OPI scores revealed that the accepters were significantly more nonconforming than  the rejecters. Of 56 students in 1967, 22 accepted and 34 rejected the invitation. Their OPI scores revealed that the rejecters were significantly more nonconforming than the accepters.

Judgment analysis (JAN) uses a criterion of success, derived from the judgments of a group of experts, for graduate student selection. In considering a number of applicants for a position, a judge examines each applicant's scores for various profile variables or predictors relevant to a particular job. The judge studies the qualifications of each applicant and ranks each by means of an overall score or judgment. Each judgment thus becomes the applicant's criterion score for the set of profile items or dimensions used as predictors. The procedure results in a series of zero-order validity coefficients relating each individual predictor variable to the criterion. A computer analysis  procedure reduces the number of judges, until all judges are grouped in a single cluster. Normative JAN and ipsative JAN, two variations of the JAN technique were studied. Normative JAN sought to determine the extent to which a policy regarding graduate admission standards existed among twenty representative faculty members. Each judge ranked the student on the basis of his profile variables. Ipsative JAN used for its criterion variable the judges' rankings or judgments based on personal knowledge as opposed to profile data information. (PS)",

The experiences in the pilot programs of elementary guidance in Louisiana have demonstrated that effective guidance services in the elementary school are contingent upon an understanding, willing, and ready staff. To bring about this readiness, an in-service training program has been found useful in determining what the elementary program is about, how it can help teachers perform their responsibilities more effectively, and how it can assist students in their development. One of the most effective in-service training programs has been found to be the child-study approach. This involves, primarily, a case study concerned with the  gathering of significant data about the child. The roles of various staff members and the kinds of significant information need ed in child study are delineated. The elementary counselor serves as a catalyst to the entire faculty in fostering the physical, social, educational, and total personality development of the child. (PS)",

Significant differences in achievement and school behavior between children of participants and nonparticipants were found. The children of participants had higher achievement tests scores, fewer school absences, and fewer behavior referrals. Correlations between parent and counselor perceptions of the  experience and child behavior presented a complex picture. Not all favorable perceptions correlated with high achievement as expected.

Basic data consisted of biographical inventory responses and academic aptitude test scores for approximately 20,500 high school boys. Scoring keys were formed for each of 12 ability level subgroups and various combinations of these subgroups. The keying procedures developed as the  primary objective of the project work well when applied to actual data. Although a statistically significant difference in favor of the moderated keys was obtained, academic ability was not found to be an effective moderator variable. However, a hit rate of 77% was achieved by biographical data as a predictor of college attendance versus nonattendance. This rate and the equivalent point biserial correlation coefficient of .60 were substantially higher than the corresponding figures for academic aptitude used alone. (AUTHOR)",

All people have in the fundamental emotions the capacity for a common set of subjective experiences and expressions. These have a special communication value. The communication function facilitates the interpersonal and inter-cultural understanding of the underlying subjective experience. They may serve as a base for interpersonal and cross-cultural understanding. The emotions tend to generate a set of cognitive labels that translate to a corresponding common set of meanings. These theses seem to be corroborated by Thurstone's concept of the role of affect in race attitude scaling and by Osgood's  finding that the affective dimension of meaning shows the greatest cross-cultural constancy. These conclusions support an expanded definition of phenomenal field. It was proposed that the subjective culture is determined by innate and socio-cultural factors and by unique person-environment interactions. Since the emotions were considered to be man's principal motivation system and to be motivating experiences, they were viewed as the most fundamental and culture -common aspects of subjective culture and phenomenal field.

Itinerant services were available to districts on a pro-rate time schedule. Weekly staffings with consultant aid provided for review of activities, re-evaluation, and the establishment of new priorities as necessary. The program attempted to maintain orientation toward every child in the program and recognized the importance of the central role of the classroom teacher. In-service contacts for teachers were  facilitated through pre-school workshops, institute days, staff bulletins, and released time for professional meetings. Group counseling was another method which was used to spread the services and maximize the counselor's ability to reach more students. Groups of parents also became the object of the counselor's practices. The first major hurdle encountered was the articulation of the counselor and his contribution into the on-going stream of events where the services had not before been present. Administrators and classroom teachers felt the program was beneficial. (AUTHOR)",

Data were gathered in six vocational maturity component areas. School achievement, as measured by grade point averages at two grade levels, emerged as the best predictor of a rating of vocational maturity. More promising for future vocational maturity researchers is the finding that the vocational planning and job knowledge sections of the research instrument emerged as vocational maturity rating predictors almost as powerful as school achievement.  This finding provides a basis for direction in the development of other vocational maturity rating instruments. The finding indicates that an assessment of students' vocational-educational plans or lack thereof, and steps taken toward plan implementation, together with an assessment of general job knowledge, would provide a vocational guidance worker with a relatively valid rating of an individual's vocational maturity.

The chief innovations of the project were its  comprehensive interdisciplinary-team nature. , the emphasis on vocational adjustment as a primary means to total life adjustment, the sophistication of the vocational evaluation process, the commitment to seeking education and training for high-risk clients, the provision of immediate comprehensive post-release services, the release period, and the use of an experimental design to compare outcomes of treated parolees with those of offenders receiving normal parole supervision. In terms of recidivism at one year, the experimental had a better record than controls. (AUTHOR)",

        "description":"Despite considerable interest in the study of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction, our understanding of these phenomena has not increased substantially in the past 30 years. It is argued that a major reason for this lack of progress is the implicit conception of casuality accepted by most psychologists. It is called the policy of \"correlation without explanation.\" The present approach to the topic of job attitudes emphasized a more conceptual approach to the problem. Using Branden's theory of emotions as a starting point, the concepts of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, value, emotion, and appraisal and their interrelationships are discussed. The present theory of job satisfaction is contrasted with previous theories. Data illustrating an approach to satisfaction based on the  present theory are given. Other issues discussed are: value hierachies; the dynamic character of values; overall job satisfaction; the Herzberg two-factor theory; the measurement of satisfaction and values; and rational versus irrational values.

        "description":"The essential question to which this research and demonstration project was directed was whether disabled trainees who received a vocational rehabilitation service with a substantial workshop component, and who were helped thereby to enter the labor market, would profit from a subsequent counseling service. It was originally hypothesized that such a post-program service would help the client maintain his employment once he had been assisted to enter or re-enter the labor market. The findings support a conclusion that the introduction of an experimental variable of post-program counseling results in modest but statistically significant differences on three maintenance of employment indices between the experimental and control groups. In general, it might be said that the trainees  increased their employability by about one-fifth of the amount which might be expected without the extended counseling service. In terms of persons, given an experimental sample of 307 individuals, it can be argued that 40 or 50 of these clients might not have obtained any substantial vocational success without the experimental program.

        "description":"The major purpose was to begin the search for evidence, almost nonexistent now, of the total impact of guidance programs on the students they serve. The method was to investigate relationships (through intercorrelation) between guidance programs and personal and social variables that are commonly thought to be influenced by guidance efforts, on the assumption that students who have been exposed to varying amounts and levels of guidance should have achieved guidance objectives in varying degrees or numbers. Some 200 indices were used, in 84 schools, with 1,116 seniors plus school staff, graduates, and dropouts. Factor analysis produced a small number of less redundant scales, and regression analysis indicated the best combination of predictors for such outcomes. Relationships were  generally very modest, prompting concern as to the impact of formalized guidance. Counselor personality was by far the most related to outcomes. Student and staff satisfaction as outcome was most related to guidance effort. Most other outcomes were more related to environmental factors than guidance. Guidance does help some students in some ways. Counselors should consider more active roles, help change environment to enhance healthy development, develop greater interpersonal sensitivity and skills. Counselor educators, school administrators should support and encourage such roles. (AUTHOR)",

However, it was demonstrated that education and training per se are not enough to effect the broad changes in inmates required for successful social adjustment. The project also demonstrated that a regular free-world manpower program should not be simply transplanted. Prisoners are a special group of disadvantaged persons; prisons are unique social institutions. Experiences in the Draper project show that successful implementation of a Manpower Development and Training (MDT) program in a state institution is contingent upon: (a) institutional attitude; (b) strong support of correctional management; (c)  effective agency coordination; (d) staff training, development, and flexibility; and (e) effective public relations. This volume of the final report on the Draper E&D Project is written from an historical viewpoint in an attempt to synthesize the experiences which have shaped our thinking.

A game thus constitutes a short-term parallel to life in general. As such, it acts, for children, as a device through which they explore social organization, comparable to their explorations of the physical environment at an earlier period of life. The use of games by the sociologist constitutes a formalization of this means for learning about social organization. An extended example of the use of a game involving collective decisions is presented to show this role of games in the development of social theory. (AUTHOR)",

The 300 Guilford items comprise 78 marker clusters for 15 Guilford factors; the 300 Cattell items represent marker items for 17 Cattell factors. The study involved two major analyses. In the first, the 600 x 600 matrix was factor analyzed by the Principal Factor Method, extracting 18 factors for one rotation, and 15 factors for a second. The second analysis involved two steps. Step one consisted of separate factor analyses and rotations of the 300 x 300 item Guilford and Cattell matrices, in each case including factor loadings for the \"other\" 300 items. Step two was designed to determine the factors in each matrix after removing the effects of the factor loadings of the \"other\" set of items in that matrix.  All rotations were made by both Varimax and Promax computer programs. Coefficients of congruance were computed between all rotated factors in all analyses. The correlations among items and the factored and rotated results demonstrated, beyond question, that analysis at the item level is highly destructive to the factors previously assembled with inadequate concern for their loadings in large matrices in which a wide range of factors is known to exist. If the results are accepted, the indications for reclassification of at least 400 of the 600 items included in the study are obvious. (IM)",

The redistributive effect can be increased markedly by elimination of the flat grant and by distributing all funds on the basis of the ability of each district to support education. It is suggested that consideration of both the school district's ability to pay for its educational needs and the contribution it makes to the State's fund for aid to education  would result in an equalizing formula that could more widely distribute the burden of financing a State aid-to-education program.

A model, developed by Professor Goodson and his staff, deals with the design of a change-agent team and the work that such a team might perform. The model requires four functions to be performed: Diagnosing problems, planning action, transforming strategy into action, and evaluating action results. A team is expected to plan for and manage specific changes and to facilitate and perpetuate an innovative climate in a school system. The application of the model to three Wisconsin school systems is outlined as an illustration of the early operation of change-agent teams. Plans for evaluating the effectiveness of the team approach and results from the activities  of a change-agent team are reported. (AUTHOR/HW)",

The test battery consisted of six tests given to 143 chemical engineer seniors at the North Carolina State University between 1947 and 1951. Statistics are employed to relate the tests and inventory (independent variables) to the developed Supervisor Creativity Rating Form and Biographical Information Form (dependent variables). The major hypothesis is that there is a significant relationship between creative performance and personality characteristics, personal background, and specific abilities. It is found that only three of 12 characteristics in the Supervisor Rating Form were predicted  significantly from the predictor variables--persistence, enthusiasm, and initiative. The biographical inventory did better in predicting than did the test battery, suggesting that creativity is best predicted from specific facts about a person, whether they be biographical facts, subjective ratings, or work history.

One section of 30 students was used as a control group while the other 20 students served as the experimental group. The students were pre-tested and then received class instruction. During the course of the semester, unit exams were administered. Exams for the control group were prepared by the course instructor. The experimental group's exams were compiled of random questions selected by the computer from the item bank. The analysis of scores  from a post-test confirmed the hypothesis there would be no detrimental effect upon test scores for students tested with the CATC system.

        "description":"This preliminary study attempted to determine the most effective search strategies for the topic &quot;health effects&quot; in relation to specific chemicals and/or pollutants--in this case, asbestos--for each of five selected Lockheed DIALOG data bases: BIOSIS Previews, Chemical Abstracts Condensates (Chemcon), NTIS, Enviroline, and Pollution Abstracts. Strategies were developed, searches run, results calculated, and strategies synthesized for the larger data bases--BIOSIS, Chemcon, and NTIS. Strategies were developed for Enviroline and Pollution Abstracts by selecting possible search terms/codes from relevant citations, testing hypothetical search strategies for recall and precision, and then synthesizing these strategies. All citations from each data base search were evaluated for  relevance and precision was calculated. Following data analysis, the study recommended basic health effects strategies for each data base. Trends ascertained in searching these data bases by testing with asbestos showed that codes work well in BIOSIS; Chemcon and NTIS require a combination of codes and words; words alone or codes and words together could be used in Enviroline, and Pollution Abstracts require all words whose identities can be pinpointed. A list of user aids, bibliography, tables, and illustrations are included. (Author/KP)",

Covering ERIC accessions from the period 1968 through June 1977, the abstracts reflect the expansion of state interests and activity in postsecondary planning and coordination. The period of rapid growth in the number of two-year colleges in the mid-60's is reflected by feasibility studies for state junior college systems and standards for facilities and operations. Programs for the disadvantaged, open access, and the management and evaluation of vocational programs are concerns also evident among the early documents. Transition to the current period of stationary enrollments and reduced resources, and the concurrent expansion of state regulatory powers, are reflected in renewed  discussions of college role, state-local relationships, and studies of unit costs, alternative funding formulas, program duplication and other measures of cost effectiveness. Between the earliest and latest reports are basic statistical compilations, studies of transfer success, guidelines for program development, and institutional surveys of many types. The abstracts are arranged by state, with 46 of the 50 states represented. Because the abstracts are reproduced exactly as originally published, variable typography may effect the legibility of some entries. (Author)",

Subjects for the study were 32 preschool children (16 boys, 16 girls) ranging in age from 3.1 to 6.2 years. The children were divided into two non-overlapping age groups with mean ages of 3.6 and 5.2 years respectively. Each child participated in three experimental sessions during the same day: once alone, once with one same-sex peer and once with three same-sex peers. During each session, the children were given a set of three-dimensional objects (containing, for example, a fishing reel, desk sorter, lantern bottom, preserved frog in a bottle and a miniature metal chair and were invited to &quot;take them out, play with them, and ask any questions about them if you  like.&quot; The number of questions asked was obtained from videotapes of the sessions made in an adjoining screened observation booth. Results indicated that the frequency of questions asked per child was negatively related to group size, although two children as a group generated more questions than did children tested in groups of four or alone. Despite variations in group size and materials, the frequency of questions was correlated across sessions. No significant correlations were found between the number of questions asked and age or sex.

The study focuses on the relation between subjects' verbally expressed reasoning about social issues in two situations: during interview sessions and in natural life settings. Subjects for the study are 7- and 15-year-old children enrolled in an educational and psychological treatment program for learning and emotionally disabled children. One aspect of the research involves the identification and structuring of situations in which interpersonal reasoning can be studied. Another aspect involves the development of charts which identify developmental stages in reasoning about specific interpersonal issues. Final analyses are expected to  provide data on developmental aspects of interpersonal reasoning, on longitudinal stability or changes in the reasoning of individuals and groups, on situational and personality factors which influence reasoning levels, and on the differences in reasoning levels during interview sessions as opposed to real life situations. Examples of preliminary findings in these areas are reported. Tables are included which present definitions of the interpersonal issues studied (e.g., self-reflection, jealousy, decision-making) and outline the sequence of stages identified for interpersonal and impersonal (Piagetian physical-cognitive) devlopment.

Observations of the Gusii people of Western Kenya suggest that the direct expression of intense affect is de-emphasized through an avoidance of direct face to face interactions. The present study investigated (1) how and to what extent cultural goals would affect face-to-face mother-child interaction and (2) whether there would be universal or species specific aspects of this interaction. During videotaped sessions with 10 Gusii infants and their mothers the infant was placed in an infant seat and the mother was instructed to talk with or play with the baby and to get the baby's attention. Data were analyzed according to a system developed previously for  similar American research studies. In the American research, seven clusters of interactive behaviors (termed monadic phases) had been defined and scaled according to degree of attention and positive to negative affect. Results indicated that these monadic phases were structurally similar across these two cultures. At another level, however, typical Gusii patterns emerged. These patterns appear to encourage a steady positive state of infant arousal. American mothers appear to encourage more variability in infant behavior. Results suggest that while the structure of the interactions is similar, the sequencing and timing varies, reflecting cultural differences in the mothers' shaping of infant behavior. (BD)",

The children were grouped as high or low in initial interest on the basis of observation of time spent drawing, and half the children in each group were given an expected reward for drawing, while the other half received no reward. Time spent drawing and \"quality\" of drawing were measured one week and seven weeks later. The high initial interest children who received a reward lost interest when observed a week later, while the low interest rewarded children gained interest. By seven weeks both groups returned to their original  levels. At the time of the reward, high interest rewarded subjects drew more drawings but of poorer quality than did the unrewarded high interest children. Low interest children who were rewarded also drew more than their unrewarded counterparts, but quality was not affected. (Author/BD)",

Six Resistance to Temptation (RTT) tasks were administered to 106 sixth grade students. One year later, four Kohlberg Moral Judgment (MJ) tasks were administered to 100 of the same subjects. IQ scores were available for all subjects. Two measures of temptation behavior were derived from the six RTT tasks: Total RTT, a summary score based upon extent of RTT in the six situations, and Consistency (C), based upon the variance of an individual's RTT scores across the six situations. Results indicated that MJ and RTT did not correlate significantly. MJ and C were positively correlated, although examination of the data by sex revealed  a significant correlation for boys only. IQ was correlated significantly with total RTT and with C. The relationships were also examined according to levels of IQ, indicating different relationships between most variables when high IQ subjects were compared with low IQ subjects. The results provided support for the view that intelligence is generally related to the extent and consistency of resistance to temptation. Moral judgment may account more for consistency of behavior among males. (Author/BD)",

Sixteen middle-class couples and their first-born children between the ages of 2 and 5 years participated in the study. The Parent Awareness Measure (PAM), developed for this study and given to parents individually, required parents to predict how their children would perform on the 92 linguistic, cognitive, and affective items. The children were subsequently given the PAM and their responses were compared with those predicted by their parents. Results showed that agreement between parents and children on the PAM was 51.3% for linguistic questions, 48.1%  for cognitive items, and 47.8% for affective questions. There were no statistically significant differences between mothers and fathers in any of the sections, although in most comparisons mothers' scores were somewhat higher. Parents of older children were found to be significantly better at predicting their children's responses on the PAM than were parents of younger children. There was a high degree of similarity on the responses produced by the father and mother in any given family and the parents' responses correlated more with one another than either parent's did with the children in the family. It was concluded that parents have a general rather than a particular knowledge of their children's linguistic, cognitive, and affective abilities. (JMB)",

The characteristics of each type of play are presented and examples of play at each stage are given. The relationship between each stage of play and the individual's cognitive development is then discussed in detail. Also discussed are three factors that influence the quality, quantity and nature of children's play: (1) materials/environments, (2) peer interaction and (3) adult guidance. The match of the child's present developmental abilities to the activities in the environment is identified as the most important aspect of  planning for children's play. Finally, the Piagetian interview technique is discussed as a means of evaluating play outcomes. Guidelines for employing this technique are presented. (JMB)",

Subjects were 24 iron deficient and anemic infants, 9 to 26 months old. The subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered before the institution of treatment with intramuscular iron or placebo, and the test was readministered in 5 to 8 days. Children treated with iron showed a significant increase, compared to the controls, in their scores on the Mental Development Index. The treated group also became more alert and responsive and demonstrated improvement in tests of gross and fine motor coordination. These findings support  the hypothesis that iron deficiency in infants produces developmental alterations and that these changes are rapidly reversible with iron therapy. (Author/SB)",

Subjects included all 5-year-old boys (18) and all 6-year-olds (14 boys and 15 girls) in a nursery school. Assessments of subjects had been accumulated as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of ego and cognitive development.  Mothers were interviewed concerning their child's health, development, illness, and accident histories, and interest and experience with fire. Methods used by parents to teach children about fire were explored. The Q-sort method was used to quantify teaching behaviors observed. Children responded to pictures of fire viewed among a series of other pictures; were asked to list \"all the things that children sometimes do that are bad\"; and took part in a marble guessing game that assessed the tendency to make premature judgments or take risks. Finally, subjects and their mothers were observed as the mother taught her child three fire related tasks. Results for mothers and children are analyzed separately, and generalizations suggested by the results are listed in a discussion section.  (Author/SB)",

Criteria of time-cost effectiveness, policy effectiveness for rural development, and contribution to sociology must be balanced by rural social scientists in their research design decisions. When five generally recognized types of research are examined by these criteria, only one stands up--systems analysis. Procedures built around description of conditions, public opinion polling, evaluations of programs, and basic academic research fail to meet some of the criteria. Systems research, however, corrects for many of the weaknesses in other types, and a policy research paradigm originating from systems analysis can be developed with  specific reference to rural development. The paradigm is applied to Federal, state, and local levels of jurisdiction affecting rural development; it allows continuous monitoring of key variables so that each jurisdictional level can simulate alternative futures, thereby aiding policy makers in their decisions. Because of more precise focus, the paradigm can also produce greater cost effectiveness with research monies, facilities, and talents; its emphasis on trend analysis on a wide range of interacting variables can make a major contribution to social science.

Comparisons were made between adults and adolescents in general, parents and their offspring, and the general school population with a student matched sample. During the summer of 1976, interviews were conducted with 216 household heads or their spouses and 192 junior high school and high school students from 2 rural non-farm communities in Southern Louisiana, characterized by their tri-racial composition (Indian, white, Black). Those interviewed were paid $2.00  as compensation for their time and information; interviewers were selected from the communities. Data analysis was concerned with the main effects of age and race on community and family evaluations. T-tests were used to explore the differences in mean scores of the dependent variables. Findings included: adolescent evaluative responses to their community situation were much more positive than adult responses; white respondents were much more optimistic about their past and present family situations and their houses than non-white respondents; and 89% of the adolescents indicated that they had no intentions of moving from their immediate locale.

Data relating to landmark legislation, development of employment programs for Indians, establishment of reservation-located industry, and tribal and individual income and ownership were derived from BIA reports, tribal and Federal government records, periodicals, books, unpublished governmental documents, other unpublished studies and reports, and two questionnaires administered to tribal officials upon whose reservations industries were located and the employees  working in reservation-located firms. Research methods included historical, comparative, empirical, analytical, and statistical treatment. Results indicated: income opportunities for reservation Indians had vastly improved in the years studied and ICDP income had substantially increased; the BIA/ICDP had been a strong factor in promoting the establishment of industrial/commercial entities on reservations; many of the reservation firms were labor intensive and until recently were non-Indian owned; lack of investment capital had been a major deterrent in developing individually and tribally owned firms; Indian employee work acculturation was improving; the rate of ICDP closures had been higher than the national average; there were still some intratribal conflicts impeding progress.

Based on site visit interviews and responses to a standardized questionnaire, the evaluation of the Prime Sponsors (Dallas, Wichita, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle, Bismark, Buffalo, Minneapolis, and Boston) reflects the need for management training procedures and techniques among the staff of Prime Sponsors. Results of a literature search of two computerized data bases for the period 1972-76 are analyzed in terms of the development of the 4 CETA models (an  annotated bibliography of the 67 documents found to be of value is appended). The four models are identified as: (1) Outreach and Recruitment; (2) Training, Employment, and Support Services; (3) Job Development and Placement; and (4) Follow-Up.

        "description":"Despite pervasive and far-reaching changes in the institution of the family in this century, demographic data suggest not a breakdown of the American family; rather, significant change has occurred in its structure and function. Timing of family formation and childbearing, household size and living arrangements, marital stability (including racial differences), and labor force status of married women are sociodemographic indicators that describe changes both in rural and urban areas. Comparing profiles of family characteristics from 1950 to 1970 indicates that urban-rural differences in family structure persist. Rural people still marry earlier than urban counterparts, have more children, and live in larger households. Fewer rural women participate in the labor force, and fewer  rural marriages end in divorce. However, changes affecting urban families also affect rural ones and the recent turnaround between population growth in urban and rural areas holds important implications. For urban and rural areas, marriage age has increased, current fertility and household size are down, divorce rate is up, and women's participation in the labor force has grown. In general, the proportion of life spent outside a family unit is growing, child care increasingly falls to third parties, and the husband-wife relationship is more egalitarian. Yet, most people eventually marry, and most children are raised in husband-wife families. (RS)",

Data were derived from a larger data-set on mobility and achievement orientations of a random sample of 1970 senior students stratified according to residence of school (urban-rural), size of senior class, race, and school type. This study was limited to information on white males (N=1,221) and females (N=1,241). Regression models were used to test a series of research hypotheses developed from sex-role socialization literature. Covariance analysis assessed both main and interaction effects of sex. The empirical findings supported the general theme of sex-role socialization, showing that males  received more college encouragement and achievement training from parents and had more materialistic orientations than female counterparts. Though low status achievements characterized females who received minimum amounts of parental and peer encouragement to go to college and who had low academic performance and parental achievement training, no similar male trend was observed. While personal competitiveness positively influenced male status orientation, it played no role for the female. However, females with a strong materialistic orientation tended to have higher status education orientations than males. (RS)",

(2) To what extent do the recent migrants from metropolitan counties differ from migrants from other nonmetropolitan counties? (3) Does the origin of migrants influence the character of their location in 1970? The populations represented were 985,000 residents of the region in 1970 who were 5 years or older and had reported U.S. residence in 1965 and a sub-population of 322,000 white heads of households in 1970. Migrants and non-migrants were compared in terms of sex differences, location of residence  (urban, rural, rural nonfarm, and group quarters), age differences, and selected characteristics of white household heads. Results indicated that: inmigrants were considerably younger than the non-migrant residents (due to a higher propensity to migrate among the young in general and due to substantial outmigration among the young of this region); the majority of inmigrants had metropolitan origins and urban destinations, although they were attracted disproportionately to rural nonfarm locations (especially the older migrants seeking retirement); a substantial proportion of the inmigrants were enumerated in group quarters in 1970, having changed residence to attend an academic institution.

The goal of this paper is to collect information on the objectives of science education and to relate this information to the role of the classroom teacher. Educators and researchers suggest that science objectives should be associated with learning the processes and concepts of science. The body of factual scientific information is too great to make educational objectives hinge on the acquisition of knowledge alone. Many educators recommend objectives that emphasize activity-oriented, problem-solving kinds of skills. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) recognizes scientific literacy as a major goal. The effects of these  kinds of objectives on the classroom teacher are great. Emphasis on learning skills, individualizing instruction, and identifying values are important components of teaching science today. Regardless of the specific branch of science, teachers need to keep in mind those skills, such as problem-solving, which are common to all education. Included is a selective bibliography. (MA)",

Thirty-eight first graders were classified as ready or not ready according to scores on a readiness test. Students were paired, with 11 pairs of not-ready and 8 pairs of ready students; one member of each pair was assigned to an immediate symbolization group and the other to a delayed symbolization group. All students received 12 weeks of instruction on addition and subtraction, with either simultaneous or 5-week-delayed symbolization for ready students, or delayed-until-ready symbolization for not-ready students. The posttest measured ability to interpret, produce, and state answers to number sentences. Scores of not-ready  students in the delayed symbolization group were significantly higher on interpretation (a=.05) and production (a=.10) sections than scores of not-ready students in the immediate symbolization group. No significant differences were found on the answer section, nor were significant differences found between any scores of ready students. (MS)",

Five small groups from one second-grade classroom were stratified by achievement and taught using (1) counting sticks; (2) Dienes blocks; (3) abacus; (4) all three materials; or (5) counting sticks and unifix cubes, Dienes blocks and graph paper, and the abacus and colored chips. Two- and three-digit numeration and addition and subtraction with and without regrouping were presented in 22 lessons involving manipulative, picture, and symbolic phases. Lesson plans and reactions of pupils are included, in addition to data from evaluation interviews recorded on videotape and scored later. The abacus appeared to be less effective  for teaching two-digit numeration than were blocks or sticks, but the three single embodiments appeared equally effective for teaching the other topics. Multiple embodiments were &quot;superior&quot; for developing two-digit numeration, but &quot;not superior&quot; for the other topics. Use of materials was more effective than non-use of materials (by a control group). Levels of behavior were listed with an interpretation of the findings. (MS)",

Each alternative is  composed of an overview containing background information on the topic, the basic concept to be learned, student learning objectives, and teaching/learning strategies. Contained within this book are a multitude of ideas about how elementary and secondary grade teachers may present the modular topics of Man and Environment in an interdisciplinary framework.

On the basis of the synthesis, it was concluded that lessons using manipulative materials have a higher probability of producing greater mathematical achievement than do non-manipulative lessons. Use of both manipulative materials and pictorial representations is highly effective; symbolic treatments alone are less effective. The use of materials appears to be effective with children at all achievement levels, ability levels, and socioeconomic levels. Activity-oriented programs and the use of mathematic laboratories can be expected to result in achievement at least as high as when activities are not emphasized.  Other conclusions are also presented, plus implications for further research. Implications for classroom practice and five guidelines for those planning projects or selecting programs are presented.

The major purpose is to inform interested economic educators of the studies that have been done, to summarize the results, and to identify various research designs and statistical techniques that others might want to use. Forty studies are described. Most were done in the 1970s. The introductory 15 pages give an overview of the research. Most studies indicate that personalized or individualized instruction is as effective as the traditional lecture discussion approach. Many suggest that programmed materials save time for both student and instructor and can be less expensive than the traditional approaches.  The use of television, computer assisted instruction, tutors, and case studies is tested in several studies, and some deal with various combinations of approaches. Some researchers believe that no single method is best, but that certain combinations such as programmed instruction with games and simulations or with an audio visual tutorial system yield superior results.

Increasingly, land is being sapped of its ability to sustain agriculture and human habitation north and south of the Sahara, in Iraq, India, the Argentine, Chile, Australia, and the southwestern United States. This is due to overgrazing, soil erosion caused by improper cultivation, and farming without proper soil renewal. Soil cannot hold rainwater in devegetated areas and natural droughts create disasters because water stores become depleted. Underdeveloped countries with large nomadic populations living on arid land have not acquired attitudes of food production  for the benefit of the society in general. In these countries, production for individual survival has created problems of unnecessarily large herds and overcultivation. Although technology exists to develop better farming and animal husbandry techniques, people must first accept the resultant change in lifestyle. Solutions include establishment of herding cooperatives, tree planting programs, agricultural modernization, and improvement of grain reserve facilities. (Author/AV)",

Intended as a means of expanding multicultural understandings of elementary and secondary teachers, the conferences encouraged exchange of ideas between parents, community members, curriculum specialists, administrators, educators, and policy planners. The narrative presentation is organized into four sections. Section I challenges widespread assumptions about ethnic studies, including the conceptualization that it refers only to non-white groups and should only be included in the curriculum of students who are members of that group. Section II stresses the need for conscious decisions about content and process in multicultural education to avoid fragmented programs  which do little more than glorify ethnic heroes. Section III presents interdisciplinary suggestions for improvement of teacher education with a multicultural emphasis, evaluation of curriculum, and development of new models. Case studies of successful multicultural programs are presented. Section IV predicts that the future of multicultural education depends upon the commitment of the educational system to make multicultural learnings a valid, integral part of the education of every student.

Affective objectives include development of a better attitude toward social studies, the American way of life, the dignity and worth of one's fellow man, and civic responsibility. An example of a non-affective social studies goal is student achievement of 36 out of 40 possible correct answers on an American history test. Reasons why stated objectives are or are not in the affective domain are given. Readers are directed to write an affective goal statement and discuss it with another person. The  second part of the paper follows the same format as part I, with the exception that more specific affective objectives are described and tested. Part III describes development and testing of behavioral indicators to determine whether a student has achieved a stated affective objective.

        "description":"Previous research has established the existence of a differential in self-esteem between males and females. This difference is explained in terms of socialization experiences which favor the masculine role. On this basis, it was predicted that male subjects would display higher self-esteem than females in a simulated society game in which subjective evaluations were made of perceived worth. The results provided support for this prediction, which remained in effect when controls were introduced for age, health, race, religiosity, and marital status. However, skill attainment proved to be an important intervening variable; females possessing certain instrumental skills were as likely as males to display high self-esteem. The discussion suggests that skill attainment may be an  important aspect of socialization accounting for gender differences in self-esteem. References and tables are included. (Author)",

No attempt is made to provide exhaustive theoretical background, but, rather, concentration is upon practical suggestions that can be used by the teacher in managing disruptive behavior. Theory that is discussed is based upon the premise that disruptive behavior is a form of communicative behavior--i.e., the basis for most disruptive behavior is a state of pupil distress manifested by the child as a result of conditions prevailing in the home, at school, or both. Each chapter is divided into three parts, discussing (1)  background information concerning the topic under investigation, (2) objectives relating to the role of the teacher in managment of disruptive behavior, and (3) recommended techniques for the management of such behavior. Topics discussed are: (1) the nature of disruptive behavior; (2) the disruptive child; (3) general management techniques; (4) the disruptive classroom; (5) when to call for help; (6) the emotionally disrupted child; (7) the disrupted teacher; and (8) research findings relating to disruptive behavior in the classroom.

        "description":"This study, conducted with second grade pupils of an inner city public elementary school, sought to investigate the extent to which an instructional-learning system can be effective in reducing time needed for learning while increasing the time spent on learning by the student. For this study, the individualized instruction program in a developmental school for the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC) of the University of Pittsburgh was altered from a prescribed time-block instructional system to a pupil self-schedule system, with no specific time block designated for tasks in any given subject area. It was hypothesized that, given the responsibility for scheduling their own activities, pupils would complete more tasks in less time and would exhibit more on-task  behaviors while completing the task. Analysis of data collected from (1) observation of student and teacher classroom behavior, (2) measures of student task performance, (3) measures of self responsibility, and (4) measures of time, supported the hypotheses in that pupils under the self-schedule system completed more tasks in less time, and exhibited more on-task behavior. They also had fewer management and more instructional interaction with teachers. Other independent variables, falling under &quot;time spent&quot; and &quot;time needed&quot; categories were also investigated. Appendices include a discussion of the LRDC Individualized Instructional Program, and the format of a pupil schedule sheet for aiding the student in planning and tracking learning tasks to be completed.

The first design involves a ten week instructional period in which students are required to spend two hours per week in a field site classroom for each professional education course in which they are enrolled. The other hours of the week are spent in formal instruction on campus. In the second design, the students meet on campus with a course instructor and then carry out assignments on an individual basis under the coordination and supervision of their course instructor at a field site. The author outlines in detail the methods of implementing each program and discusses  the strengths and weakness of each. In an overall conclusion the author states that both designs described seem to offer a measure of promise. The interaction of teacher trainees and instructors with public school personnel appears to make the clinical based component of teacher education successful and rewarding. (JD)",

Significant issues surrounding autonomy and strategies for dealing with them are considered in order to help in developing an approach for examining autonomy in an educational setting. The investigation involves three phases: the first focuses on the environment and results in the generation of a list of behavioral opportunities for student autonomy to exist. The second focuses on the student and results in an estimation of individual differences with respect to the utilization of these opportunities. The final phase  utilizes both environmental and student information and results in the development of situation-related measures of student autonomy. These measurement techniques are examined critically in order to delineate the constraints that instrumentation places on the subject. Finally, a schema for clarifying and limiting investigation is presented. An extensive bibliography is included. (Author/MJB)",

Problems associated with standardized testing in the schools include the tendency to evaluate educational programs according to their effect upon test scores, the discontinuation of worthwhile programs that do not contribute to improved test scores, and the amount of time required to administer test batteries. Problems associated with incorrect interpretation of intelligence tests, and comments on Jensen's article regarding the relative impact of genetic and environmental factors on  intelligence are also discussed. The growth of the testing industry is described, and alternatives to present methods of testing are suggested.

Teachers receiving test results showed greater shifts in their ratings of students than teachers not receiving test results. However, these shifts tended to be in the positive direction and for only a small number of students. Results indicated that standardized test results did alter second grade teachers' expectations for their students in a small percentage of cases (10% or less). This study also indicated that teachers tended to raise, but not lower, their ratings of students' performance as a result of receiving test results. For at least 90% of the cases, however, the information provided by standardized test results seemed to  either corroborate the teachers' existing expectations or to be too weak to alter their existing expectations. Since this study took place in Ireland, the relevance of these findings for the United States was also discussed. The authors cited reports indicating that Irish teachers have more favorable attitudes toward testing than American teachers. Therefore, they concluded that the influence of test results in American teachers' expectations would be even less than the influence on Irish teachers described in this study. (GDC)",

Consequently, the testing program was suspended in 1971 to provide funds for an evaluation to determine the most appropriate type of testing program to meet the needs of the Overseas Dependents Schools. A four step needs assessment evaluation provided the necessary information. First, 211 areas for testing in the elementary and secondary schools were identified. Second, the relative importance to teachers and administrators of having information in each of the areas was determined. Third, problems  associated with the old testing program and characteristics of the Overseas Dependents Schools that warranted consideration in developing a testing program were identified. Fourth, the information was analyzed to determine the most appropriate purposes for testing at each administrative level of the system, and the most appropriate tests, sampling and administrative procedures for a testing program to provide the required information.

In an early project designed to ascertain the types of strategies used by learners in an academic or training environment, participants received several learning tasks to perform. They were then asked to identify and explain the kinds of strategies used to learn these materials and to suggest other useful methods. Learning tasks included paired associates, serial lists, free recall lists, and reading comprehension. Data collected from this study were analyzed and combined with previous research results to produce the Learning Activities Questionnaire (LAQ), which  has been extensively field tested and revised. Current results indicate that more successful learners, and those with more years of schooling, use meaningful elaboration strategies in preference to the more rote, or superficial, strategies.

(2) Competency standards should be developed using good management procedures. (3) Standards must be set at realistic levels. (4) Standards should be administered with an adequate student advisory and guidance system providing preparation and feedback. (5) Standards should be applied consistently within programs, across programs, and over time. (6) Standards should be backed fully by the home institution to increase the likelihood that the resulting diploma will be acceptable to other  institutions. (7) Standards should be administered so that the students involved feel they have been well served. Three factors which are believed to influence a school district's actions are the external requirements of other institutions and agencies, the basic educational objectives of the school district, and the personal development goals of individual students. Seven possible assessment procedures are outlined. They are: development of competence scales, use of the traditional methods, review of test questions, identification of prerequisite skills, use of normative data, comparison of test scores to course performance, and use of preselected groups.

High- and low-ability groups responded to test items by choosing the correct alternative and then rating each item's difficulty relative to their levels of ability. Least-squares estimates of item difficulty correlated highly with proportion-correct and latent trait estimates of item difficulty based on a norming sample. Least-squares estimates of testee ability, which were based solely on the difficulty perceptions of the testees, correlated significantly with number-correct and maximum-likelihood ability scores based on the testees' responses to the items. These results show that item-difficulty often used in test  construction, and that as testee ability level increased, the items were perceived as being relatively less difficult. The relationship between a testee's ability and his/her perception of an individual item's relative difficulty appeared to be weak. Of major importance was the finding that items which were appropriate in difficulty levels from a psychometric standpoint were perceived by the testees as being too difficult for their ability levels.

The results are presented first as they relate to the major tasks of Title I; participant selection, treatment delivery, and evaluation reporting. Then the results concerning program effectiveness are reviewed: overall effectiveness, variation in effectiveness as a function of treatment method, and variation in effectiveness across types of participants. Finally, a series of eight major problems in the implementation of compensatory education are identified and discussed. The information on overall program  effectiveness, as measured in terms of increased achievement gains by program participants, has been less than adequate to determine the effectiveness of the program. Concerning variation in effectiveness among treatment methods, the data also leave room for methodological improvement. Concerning variation in effectiveness across population groups, little information is reported. The major problems listed for Title I include misuse of funds, lack of consistent federal regulations and guidelines, invalid evaluations, lack of parental involvement, lack of effective treatment methods, lack of knowledge about individual differences in the processes by which children acquire cognitive skills, and the exclusion of disadvantaged children in low income areas.

Furthermore, there is a need for concern with the changes needed in the roles of researchers and state policy level policy makers in order for research to play a significant part in helping shape reform in education. Given the present political conditions there are unusual dangers for researchers trying to serve state policy makers. The initiative for educational changes has shifted from the local district to the national government and subsequently to state leadership. The legislative patterns of recent years have increased further the separation between responsibility and operation. Increased centralization at the state level is combined with the creation of multiple new points of  access in educational governments ranging from teacher negotiations to site level parent advisory committees. This is the context within which the state policy maker is asking the educational researcher to provide data for his predetermined solutions. The researcher is asked to make antithetical policies work despite their inconsistencies. The central question for the educational research community concerns the nature of the research community's role in educational policy making. (Author/AM)",

During the 1975-76 school year, principals of U.S. public elementary schools were asked to provide brief descriptive information about their schools: geographic location, student enrollment, student poverty and ethnic background, proportion of poor readers, availability and nature of summer programs, and receipt of compensatory funds from different sources. A survey form was sent to each of 5,035 principals and responses were obtained  for 5,010 of the schools (99.5% response rate). The results show that compensatory funds in general, and Title I funds in particular, are targeted to a pronounced extent on schools that can be judged the most needy by different criteria. Further, because of the high degree of relationship that exists among schools between their concentration of students from poverty families and their concentration of poor readers, the results suggest that to allocate funds on the basis of high poverty tends also to allocate on the basis of low achievement. Finally, because so many schools with low concentrations of poverty students receive Title I funds, some concern should be given to what should be an adequate level of concentration of funds per pupil in making intra-district allocations.

        "description":"This is the sixth annual report of the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition. Its purpose is to provide a continuing study of the child nutrition programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The Council reports that implementation of the Five State Nutrition Education Project is underway. This project focuses on teaming the food service manager and the elementary teacher for effective classroom lunchroom nutrition education activities. The Council also reports on the development of various training programs for school food service personnel. Studies and surveys being conducted are also reported. For example, the Food and Nutrition Service is currently conducting a nutritional assessment of lunches served in the schools.  FNS has also completed a pilot study to assess and compare the nutritional and microbiological aspects of food preparation and delivery systems used in school food service. The Council also makes recommendations. Among them: (1) it recommends increased emphasis in the areas of nutrition and nutrition education, (2) it recommends that funds be given for conducting experimental or demonstration projects to teach school children the nutritional value of foods and the relationship of nutrition to health, (3) it went on record as opposing the mandated free milk provisions of the Special Milk Program in schools which have either the School Lunch or School Breakfast Program.

        "description":"This paper identifies individual and institutional factors which have facilitated or inhibited the achievement of successful black farmers. The information derived from the case studies is used to develop a model which can be used in working effectively with black farmers. The thirteen case studies discussed focus on the following: (1) reasons for choosing farming as an occupation, (2) past farming experiences, (3) acquisition and retention of land, (4) sources for obtaining agricultural credit, (5) present farming operations, (6) participation in farm programs, (7) social and political participation, (8) socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers, and (9) perceptions of the future for blacks in American agriculture. In analyzing the cases of the selected farmers, several  common factors emerged. These serve as the framework for the discussion. These factors are: (1) desire to farm, (2) strong work orientation, (3) land as a basis for economic security, (4) managerial skills and commitment to learn, (5) linkages with nonfarm organizations and activities, and (6) family goals and supports. Results indicate that the selected farmers had practical agricultural experience and personal capacity but few material resources when they started out. Their present level of success is in some measure related to their ability to convert assets of one type into assets of another. At least two liabilities stand out, namely generally low levels of formal education and racial discriminatory practices among agricultural agencies and related institutions.  (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This study explores differences among black adults in their attitudes and behavior towards television and the social processes which determine these differences. A recursive structural equation model was employed to interpret patterns of direct and indirect effects among a set of variables representing demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, general and race-related attitudes, television exposure, preference, and evaluation. Results indicate that variation in attitudes and behaviors toward television (especially those related to perceived bias and perceived bad points of black-oriented situation comedies) is systematically related to differences among black adults in their exposure to the medium, subjective orientations, and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.  One of the most powerful predictors in the model was education. A relationship was detected between education and every television attitude and behavior, save choice of black-oriented shows as favorite. The effects of education on viewing selectively, public affairs viewing, perception of bias in television, and evaluation of one kind of black-oriented programming suggest that differences among blacks in the intellectual climate surrounding television attitudes and behavior may contribute substantially to differences among blacks in attitudes and behaviors.

The relationships of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, subjective orientations, and media attitudes and behaviors are empirically examined. Consistent with past research, but with more precise measurement and within a multivariate specification, it was found that those of a higher socioeconomic status tended to read more magazines and print media in general, save black entertainment magazines. Overall, the relationships between all of the media variables pointed to the utility of making certain distinctions within the black press, and to the adequacy of simultaneously incorporating  subjective orientations and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as predictor variables.

        "description":"A survey was conducted to explore the potential of weekly newspapers for information dissemination in rural Saskatchewan. Articles about engineering research of relevance to the community had been mailed to eighty weekly Canadian newspapers on a free-choice basis over a ten month period. A random sample of 1,020 subscribers selected from the subscribers to three of the newspapers were sent a questionnaire asking them to indicate which of twelve articles they recalled seeing and, if so, read. The data obtained from 328 useable returns indicated that 53.2% of the sample reported either seeing the articles or reading some or most of them, while 42.8% of the sample reported not having seen the articles. After analyzing the popularity of the articles with the editors and readers and  making some cost estimates, it was concluded that, assuming the current readership could be maintained, the weekly newspaper is a viable and efficient means of disseminating extension information of the type and for the purpose used in the engineering articles.

Data indicate that despite the gains in the number of employed women, job segregation patterns that confine women to the traditional female occupations persist and worsen along with the resultant low wages. Vocational segregation by sex in the labor force is mirrored in vocational education enrollments of women in the traditionally female programs. What can vocational educators do? Our primary responsibility is putting our own house in order by implementing fully the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976, changing recruitment and admission practices and policies, improving guidance and counseling efforts, revising curricular  materials and teaching practices, increasing the number of female vocational administrators and qualified women teachers in male-dominated courses and vice versa, and continuing important research and development efforts on women in vocational education. Second, vocational educators, as change agents, must recognize and change socialization patterns that limit the occupational choices of men and women. And third, as leaders, they can encourage positive legislative actions, including the establishment of a national commission on women and work having the nonprofessional worker as its primary focus.

Content is presented in six chapters. Chapter l, Overview, is a general discussion of the meaning of competency-based administrator education (CBAE), including how it differs from a traditional program and the need for CBAE materials. Chapters 2 through 4 discuss the modules in terms of the development process, format, and objectives (for each module). A noted feature of the modules' format is the opportunity  provided for exemption testing, which allows the learner to make decisions and to self-pace, and also serves as a learner diagnostic tool. Chapter 5 discusses five curricular arrangements that are appropriate settings for using the CBAE materials: preservice (on-campus), preservice (on-campus) internship, inservice (off-campus) combined with internship or externship, externship, and competency-based arrangement. The final chapter discusses student orientation to CBAE. A rank order of administrator competencies and examples of how CBAE modules might be selected for an inservice program are appended. (SH)",

        "description":"The five major societal changes in the past twenty-five years which have had a major impact on education services are (1) our transition from a rural, agrarian society to an urban, technological society; (2) changes in occupational and employment structures; (3) education services have become a major enterprise; (4) expansion of Federal and State government roles in education; and (5) groups comprising the education community have become more specialized and organized around selected vested interests. Largely due to Federal programs, a new profession, education researcher and developer (R and D), has emerged. While the R and D profession has been expanding, many of the same societal forces have led to a renewal within the teaching profession. The primary implication of this  renewal is that the education R and D community needs to develop a direct linkage system with classroom teachers and a collaborative relationship with teacher groups in articulating educational needs and lobbying for programs. Much of the discord between education R and D and teachers begins because they view each other's roles and responsibilities negatively. Education R and D can increase the communication and collaboration with teachers by involving them in institutional governance, program design, development and field testing of materials, and diffusion and adoption of educational products. (The author's answers to nine questions from the audience of vocational education R and D personnel are appended.) (EM)",

Four on-site locations were inner city and one program served disadvantaged rural districts. The evaluation of the project revealed the major strengths as positive attitudinal changes toward the populations  being served; increased understanding of personal traits needed to work with disadvantaged adults as well as needed communication skills, human relations skills, and knowledge of subject matter; increased awareness of potential problems to be encountered when developing a family life program; and increased knowledge of the adult learner and of adult education methods and instructional resources. In addition, the interns were able to establish a favorable working relationship with the adult learners and program personnel and were able to see the inner-city situation in more realistic terms.

The following pre- and posttest instruments were administered to 210 California students randomly selected from three regional occupational programs: the Sociability, Achievement via Independence, and Tolerance scales of the California Psychological Inventory and a semantic differential test and criterion referenced test, both constructed by the experimenter. The data collected were statistically analyzed according to the fourteen hypotheses concerning the effects of the treatment. The major findings were these: The  film produced both affective and cognitive growth in interpersonal relationship skills in most students, especially the high achievement via independent students; the amount of growth was directly related to the amount of additional instructional material used; and low tolerance students may need alternate, presently undetermined methods of instruction in interpersonal relationship skills in order to show significant affective gains. The appendixes include the film script, the print-based materials, copies of the pre- and posttest instruments, and the raw data. (Author/BM)",

The preservice model was campus-based and designed for undergraduate vocational students. The inservice model was field-based and designed for vocational teachers presently teaching in classrooms and laboratories. A special vocational needs attitude scale was developed and used to assess the attitudinal changes that occurred as a result of the inservice workshop treatment. Four two-day workshops for inservice vocational teachers were conducted throughout the state of Nebraska, involving a total of 120 teachers. The following conclusions are based upon the analysis of data and the nonstatistical observations: The  workshop training assisted the participants in achieving a greater understanding and sensitivity to learners who are handicapped, members of minorities, or disadvantaged; the special vocational needs attitude scale served as a measure of treatment effectiveness as well as a focusing agent; the workshop model served well throughout the project and was transportable throughout the state; and the components of the preservice model were integrated into teacher preparation programs for vocational teachers.

        "description":"A program to test the feasibility of vouchering vocational training for clients of the Work Incentive Program (WIN) was conducted in Portland, Oregon. (Vouchering places the buying power for institutional training into the hands of the clients, thus allowing them greater autonomy in deciding their own occupational destiny.) One hundred and fifty-four voucher recipients were interviewed on three occasions: at the time of committing vouchers to schools, at the end of training, and one year following training. A comparison group of 163 regular trainees was interviewed once. Data on the training experiences and early labor force behavior was collected. The data suggested that voucher participants were as likely as regular participants to be satisfied with their training, to complete  their training, and to express satisfaction with their jobs. Voucher participants were more likely than regular WIN recipients to earn at a high rate ($411 or more per month) on their first job after vocational training. (Author/BM)",

        "description":"Designed to eliminate sex bias in occupational education, a strategic model for change in the educational system and an inservice program to implement the model were developed by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. Over 1700 teachers, representing 74 of North Carolina's 148 local education agencies, participated in the inservice training which prepared them to be trainers in their own school systems. An eight-point philosophical approach guided the activities of the project. A variety of print and media products were developed for inservice instructional needs and resources for the teachers. The results indicated that it is possible for two people, with a modest budget and with strong administrative backing, to use the leverage of the state education agency to  effect institutional change. After one year's effort, the following changes in enrollment were evidenced: nearly 1,000 more girls in agriculture; 1,300 more boys in home economics; 700 more girls in trade and industrial education, and substantial increases in industrial arts and occupational awareness. In the second year, female enrollment in agriculture rose to over 1,700 and male enrollment in home economics to over 2,100. There were no significant changes in health occupations, education, business and office education, or distributive education. (Focus throughout the report is on why various approaches did or did not work.) (BM)",

The evaluation paradigm and design are outlined in section 1. It is indicated that the evaluation was post-facto and summative, based on information derived through logical analysis and empirical data (questionnaire and interview  responses) developed during the evaluation. Findings are presented in section 2 under the following headings: Analysis of Stated Needs, Analysis of Program Objectives, Evaluation of Program Content and Method, and Evaluation of Program Outcome. Section 3, a brief summary and interpretation of findings, notes that the project was probably most unique in its efforts to help the paraprofessional liaisons, showing that those with training at less than the professional level can be made an integral part of an educational career guidance program. Conclusions listed are that stated objectives were accomplished with high quality and that the investment was well placed and subsequent additional development and dissemination justified. (JT)",

The major accomplishments of the project were the development of competency-based materials for the undergraduate vocational teacher education program and the elimination of repetitive content in the undergraduate program.

The course covers eight major community service occupational groups: educational services, social and economic services, government agency management, transportation management, regulatory services and records, public safety and corrections and judicial services, urban and rural community development, and resources management. The guide is designed for use with (1) nine student manuals with accompanying teacher's manuals (CE 013 655-672) for each of the eight occupational groups introduced in the  orientation quarter and (2) a student and a teacher's manual (CE 013 654 and CE 013 805) for the second quarter common core course. Section 1 of the guide presents instructional objectives and an activities performance schedule for each of the three quarters. Section 2 outlines the system of operational procedures for the program including suggested chronology, methods of labor market assessment, organization of the program, and various administrative record forms. Section 3 covers the guidance function, including testing, for each phase of the curriculum. Section 4 describes the community component (overview, organization, and manpower needs), and Section 5 is the APPS Index of Occupational Titles and corresponding entry level public service job descriptions. Appendixes include suggested  library and audio visual resources and sources of further public service vocational information. (JT)",

The purpose of this paper is to present a validation study of a self report inventory of giving care and receiving care. The reliability of the former was .799, the latter, .832. Both instruments consisted of 50 items which were scored on a five-point score from most like me to least like me. The two inventories were presented to 117 persons. There were 61 carers and 56 non-carers which included 60 males and 57 females. Role theory was used to categorize carers and non-carers. Two 2 x 2 ANOVAs were used to analyze the results. On the caring inventory, carers differed significantly from non-carers,  and six interacted with caring. No significant differences were found on the receiving care inventory. (Author)",

Young women who scored well on the Mathematics Section of the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test could be assumed to have this potential, and a group of about 500 from a number of high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area were to be selected for in-depth inquiry. In the process of selection every effort was made to give representation to a broad variety of such factors as ethnic, socio-economic and cultural background as well as to differing school and community settings. The nature of these influencing factors and the relative importance ascribed to them  by the young women and the high school faculties and administrators was to be looked at. In the focus of the study were the influencing factors that encourage young women of high scholastic aptitude to choose careers in the physical, biological and health sciences and in engineering, as well as those factors that discourage career choices in the area of the sciences. Relevant variables are current school policies and practices, prevalent community, parental and peer value systems; and socio-economic, ethnic, cultural, personality and personal background factors.

Booklet 1 contains a history of the Education Commission of the States (ECS) and the formation of the ECS Task Force on Responsible Decisions About Alcohol. The goals and objectives of the task force are defined as they relate to approaches designed to prevent alcohol-related problems. Booklet 2 describes the need for a national policy on responsible alcohol use and nonuse and defines task force recommendations for its development and implementation. Normative (laws and regulations) and educational approaches for preventing alcohol misuse are discussed, as well as potential roles for society's total educational system in helping to equip people with skills for making  responsible decisions about alcohol. Booklet 3 describes the changes needed to reduce alcohol-related problems--changes in the way services are delivered, in people's attitudes toward the use and nonuse of alcohol and, ultimately, in their behaviors. It identifies many of the issues that must be addressed to implement an effective system for the delivery of primary preventive educational services. Elements to be included in any comprehensive integrated delivery system are described. Some administrative structures that might be appropriate for state and local prevention efforts are also presented. (Author/SPT)",

Classifications were based on both the Berzins and Welling (Welling, 1975) and Spence, Helmreich, and Stapp (1974) sex role scales. Examined were four hypotheses suggesting that androgynous persons of both sexes, more than the traditionally sex typed (masculine men and feminine women), would express greater feelings of political efficacy, be more politically active, less conservative, and less dogmatic. Mixed support was found for the first two hypotheses and the second two were not supported. Feminine persons of both sexes  were the most conservative and most dogmatic. This study found that androgynous persons have greater feelings of efficacy and are more politically active, while feminine persons are the most traditional and most isolated from political affairs. The study also offers support for the use of sex role scales that distinguish four sex role types. (Author)",

All three treatment groups showed significant lower latency to sleep onset times than a waiting-list control group at the end of the three-week treatment period. A three-week followup revealed that all three treatment groups maintained their improvement. The success of the progressive relaxation and the systematic desensitization procedures corroborates earlier evidence while the success of the thought control procedure suggests that there may be a cognitive element contributing to pre-dormitional insomnia (e.g., mind-racing, ruminations).

Emphasis was placed upon grades K-6, although subjects extended into Grade 8. Approximately 450 boys and girls in each grade responded to questionnaires. In grades K-3, subjects responded to happy, neutral, or sad faces. In Grades 4-6, students circled a &quot;Snoopy&quot; dog depicting the three emotional states. Responses were collected and tabulated for each grade level. Findings show that all shifts were from happy feelings in kindergarten to sad feelings by Grade 6. In Kindergarten, 65.4% expressed happy feelings for school work, but by Grade 6 this had changed to 12.8 %. It appears that by Grades 7 and 8, the peer influence replaces a child's desire to be around  grownups. Only 5% of eighth graders are happy to be in school, and 25% are sad. By Grade 8, the school has turned-off 95% of all students. There are no attitudinal shifts from sad or neutral to happy. Children seem to express a pattern of learned dislike for school. Programs for improving attitudes of teachers, administrators, parents, and children are necessary. (Author/JLL)",

        "description":"Higher order need strength (HONS) has been shown to moderate the relationship between work role characteristics and some traditional dependent variables in organizations. It was hypothesized that employees with strong HONS might be more sensitive to variability in their work environments than people with weaker HONS. This would happen because these employees expect that their needs can be statisfied at work. Second, it was hypothesized that employees with strong HONS would be more likely than employees with weaker HONS to notice more variability especially in two aspects of work (intrinsically motivating job characteristics and performance-contingent rewards) that are most relative to these needs. Employees with strong HONS would be less sensitive, however, to supervisory style  and coordination, the other two variables measured. The sample was 957 (response rate = 79%) employees of all levels and all units of a heavy manufacturing company located in the Midwest. The results supported the hypotheses that employees' HONS is related to the variances in their perceptions of their work environments and that the sensitivity to environmental variation is more pronounced for aspects of the work environment that may be instrumental in satisfying HONS (job characteristics) and that may serve as feedback on job performance (contingent rewards).

        "description":"This research investigates how androgynous men and women are evaluated relative to those who are sex-typed or sex reversed, and also investigates the joint effects of attractiveness and sex-role upon such evaluation. Two studies with replicable results were conducted. In each, approximately 185 male and 185 female undergraduates were asked to rate one stimulus person on a series of bi-polar trait adjectives after reading a fictitious supervisory report about that person. The results indicate that the androgynous sex-role has advantages over traditionally sex-typed or sex-reversed roles, the androgynous person being rated as more physically attractive, popular and interesting. The results further suggest that androgyny might be a more positive alternative for women than for men,  since androgynous women were rated higher on all evaluative dimensions, while androgynous men were rated as less assertive and less masculine than the sex-typed male. A possible explanation may be that a moderate degree of assertiveness and a high degree of affiliativeness represent the most positive evaluation of a person; alternatively, it may be that androgyny is perceived to be more similar to the feminine sex-role than to the masculine.

The subjects (120 men and 120 women) received information about the nutritional neediness and school performance of four children, and then donated money to them. Many subjects paid no attention to the children's school performance, but simply gave more reward to those with greater need. However, when a policy statement emphasized the importance of developing useful citizens who could benefit their country, the subjects changed their pattern of reward distribution and gave higher reward to better performers as well as to children with greater need. The subjects' donation responses were also influenced by  whether the funds they dispensed were earmarked for purchase of food or purchase of school supplies. Thus the findings indicate that an allocator's perception of fairness may change in accord with the demands of authority and organizational policy. (Author)",

Both men and women demonstrated best task learning when they believed that most members of their sex did well on the task, and when no evaluative judgments were made on their learning progress. Women enjoyed the tasks more when they were told the activities were ones which men did well rather than those in which women did well. When the tasks were described as jobs women could do well, both men and women saw them as more dependent on luck. Unexpected in this study was the fact that black men and women described themselves as more masculine on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory than did the whites.

Sex differences in interaction with the above behavioral dimensions were also investigated. High-anxiety children expressed more negative affect and liked others less in the high-density condition compared to the low-density condition, while no density effect was found for the low-anxiety children for these variables. The high density condition intensified the distress and anger of high-anxiety children but not low-anxiety children. High-anxiety children tended to respond to a high density condition with emotional helplessness  whereas low-anxiety children responded with motoric coping behaviors such as reduced walking and increased facing out. In addition, low-behaviorally disturbed children were more physically inactive in the high density condition than in the low, while the high-behaviorally disturbed children showed no such effect. Density did not differentially affect low- from high-hostile-aggressive children. In general, normal children motorically adjusted to a high-density condition to a greater degree than children with behavior problems. (Author/PFS)",

The first section of this paper describes the highly structured instructional program that is employed.

The paper then discusses the training program for the tutors, who are college students or college graduates. This training program which also is highly structured, makes use of tutor-training packets and requires the use of on-site supervisors, both for initial instruction and for monitoring and consultation during tutoring. The final section of the paper considers the economic and logistic  feasibility of extending the program for use with large numbers of public school students. Present plans are to structure the program even further, so that secondary students can serve as tutors and so that large amounts of teachers' time will not be required. (GW)",

College students, under various intentional learning instructions, displayed a repetitive diagnostic pattern. Following extended study they improved recall of important, but not unimportant, elements of texts. Eleventh and twelfth graders conformed to the adult pattern, but fifth through eighth graders were not as efficient. Older students benefited from increased study time because they possessed the necessary knowledge concerning the importance of text segments to enable them to concentrate on the essential. Younger students, not so prescient, did not concentrate exclusively on the important units, for they did not know what they were. Age was not the sole determinant of performance,  for some students at each age spontaneously adopted the strategies of underlining or notetaking. Those who did concentrated on the important elements and subsequently approached the adult-like pattern in recall; those who did not displayed the immature pattern, even if induced to adopt one of the strategies. The interplay of knowledge concerning texts, study strategies, and effective recall was described. (Author)",

The review found that the nature of the syllable remains controversial; there are at least four different definitions in the contemporary literature. The sharpest disagreements seem to be between linguists concerned with phonetics, who view the syllable as complex, and educationists concerned with phonics, who in general accept the dictionary rules of syllabication. The research evidence reviewed suggests that the teaching of dictionary syllabication does not result in consistently greater gains in reading and spelling. Programs incorporating alternative approaches to syllabication are described, and recommendations  to teachers are formulated on the basis of the literature reviewed. (AA)",

To validate these rules, two sets of one thousand words each were selected, one set containing &quot;easy&quot; words taken from the Word Frequency Book, the second set containing &quot;hard&quot; words taken randomly from the Thorndike Barnhart Advanced Dictionary. Syllabication of all the words was determined by graphic and phonetic divisions, and a set of criteria (Clymer, 1963) was used to evaluate the Fry generalizations as they applied to syllabication in the word lists. Based on comparisons between easy and hard word divisions, phonetic and graphic divisions, and findings from other studies, this study concludes that all the Fry syllabication generalizations can be used in instructional strategies,  though two generalizations might be more useful as subsidiaries to other generalizations, and seven generalizations achieved marginal utility levels.

Among the findings were that instructional programs emphasizing eclectic reading resulted in more miscues that were syntactically acceptable, that were semantically acceptable, that caused no change of meaning, and that were self-corrected, while programs emphasizing phonics produced more miscues that had high graphic or phonic proximity and that were nonwords. Phonics programs also produced students with higher  word-recognition grade scores than comprehension grade scores and with higher instructional word-recognition levels; programs emphasizing an eclectic approach produced significantly higher instructional comprehension grade levels and students with higher comprehension grade scores than word-recognition grade scores.

The following conclusions were drawn: Teacher effect on pupils' reading achievement is stable over a two-year period. Elementary school teachers who are effective teachers of reading place greater emphasis on ongoing diagnosis, comprehension following reading, structured reading activities, and reading application. Elementary teachers who became more effective during the two-year  period placed greater emphasis on these instructional elements than did those teachers who became less effective. (Author/RL)",

Middle-class children were tested to determine what they knew about print, they were given word learning and word recognition tasks, and their parents returned questionnaires which assessed their perceptions of their children's developing understanding of print. The results indicate that an appreciable knowledge of printed words and letters and ways to recognize words exists before children receive formal reading instruction. Additionally, because the children showed a uniformly similar order of acquisition of this knowledge, it was concluded that a hierarchy for reading readiness exists and can serve as a basis  for definition, testing, and instruction.

Children's reading tasks are examined in five strands of investigation: ability to read for meaning, ability to read for doing, ability to read for remembering, comprehension difficulties in skilled readers, and classroom observations. The text analyses consider six types of variables: orthographic-level variables, lexical-level variables, sentence-level variables, discourse-level variables, content-level variables, and other, extralinguistic variables. Overall, the report assumes that reading is a process of imposing an interpretation on a piece of textual material and that comprehension problems arise whenever an author's assumptions about the knowledge,  skills, processing capacity, and expectations of the reader are unfulfilled.

Students completed a set of reading tests in early and late fall and teachers maintained records of instructional time allocated, setting, and content covered. Ceiling effects in the reading tests precluded an analysis of the relationship of time to achievement. The time data were analyzed to identify variations across classes and differences between students within a class in terms of time allocated to instructional settings and content areas. It was found that opportunity to learn varied greatly from one class to another and from student to student within any given class.

Results are presented with regard to the sex of the voice-over announcer, the sex of the persons pictured in the commercial, and the types of products advertised by men and by women. Among the findings are that, although female voice-over announcers are in the minority, there has been an increase in the percentage of female voice-over announcers since the earlier two studies were conducted; women appear as product representatives as often as do men, but women in television commercials are most often portrayed in the roles  of wife and mother, are frequently presented as rather stupid, and are limited with regard to their occupations and the physical areas they inhabit.

What are the costs of YRS compared to the costs of alternative scheduling systems? These four questions serve as a framework for organizing the evaluation report. Among the findings are that roughly two-thirds of the parents prefer the YRS to the traditional schedule; when pupils in YRS are matched on intelligence quotient and sex with pupils in traditional schools in the district and achievement test scores are  compared, no important differences between YRS and traditional school pupils are observed at grades 3-6 in vocabulary, language skills, work study skills, or arithmetic; YRS and traditional schools have essentially equal operating costs; and converting traditional schools to YRS is cheaper than building new schools or adding to existing buildings.

        "description":"Despite an evaluation study that showed no differences in student achievement between students in traditionally scheduled schools and in year round schools (YRSs), school personnel continued to provide anecdotal evidence of educational benefits in YRSs. In this oral testimony, the continuity of the learning process was stressed. Because the student is on vacation for only 15 days, he fails to build up nonschool behaviors that teachers find so disruptive among students who have lived outside the school for three months. This more refined examination of learning opportunity and student achievement included surveys of students and teachers and a comparison of student performance on locally made tests designed to measure the achievement of sixth-grade mathematics students as measured  against district goals. Interviews with teachers provided evidence that less post-vacation time was spent reviewing pre-vacation material in the YRSs. Student attitudes about going back to school, disruptions, and retention were better for students at YRSs than for the control group. There was, however, no significant difference in the achievement between the two groups. Appendixes include the teacher interview schedule, the student questionnaire, and the test given the students.

The remedies include noise prevention techniques and selection of quiet alternatives to existing noise sources. General principles for selecting quiet appliances are given. Ways of searching for the sources of noise and for determining the paths over which they travel to the listener are described. A detailed index is given for individual noise sources describing specific solutions to the problems they present.  General ways of looking for inherently quiet homes and travel accommodations are described. In a final chapter, there are suggestions for enlisting community help where large external sources of noise must be quieted, such as those arising from public utilities and public transportation.

A methodology for assessing the economic feasibility of solar heating and cooling is presented in the second chapter with the results of a study of material, labor, marketing, and engineering costs of solar equipment. The third chapter applies the methodology to a study of the economic feasibility of residential solar heating in 20 cities. The potential for reductions in the cost of solar  equipment through mass production and technology improvements, and the effects of increases in conventional fuel prices are included in the feasibility assessments. Finally, national security, environmental, and institutional considerations are discussed to place the economic assessment in its proper perspective. (Author)",

The multi-modal system of indexing describes materials systematically from different viewpoints, handling separately the aspects of documents that come into focus when viewed from each standpoint. Documents are organized according to relatively mutually exclusive categories, described and placed in the dimensions of: (1) theoretical orientation; (2) research method; (3) empirical  situation--descriptive or prescriptive; (4) data collection, and (5) form--e.g., bibliography, reader. The system enables users to analyse the search problem by successively partitioning the materials according to dimension and subject headings within the dimension. A feasible application would provide subject specialists with a single tool, more appropriate to their needs, for accessing materials covered by small scale area-specific services. The development of the process is outlined, and an example of indexing provided. (Author/KP)",

        "description":"A frame of reference is needed in educating information professionals to grow and be effective in the future. Information professionals need sensitivity to information, its organization, and technological impacts on society, as well as the abilities to diffuse information and perceive analogy across the information field. Six subject areas to guide in curriculum design are suggested, based on the assumptions that librarianship is part of the whole information structure, not tied to an institution, and that more attention to users and their needs should be encouraged: (1) information organization and retrieval; (2) the information environment; (3) information media; (4) systems and technologies; (5) research methods; and (6) management. Information organization and sources must  relate more to information seeking processes and utilization. Typologies and taxonomies of information transfer, agencies, users, and needs must be developed. The organization of visual, aural, and linguistic messages must be studied. Information professionals need the abilities to analyze, design, and evaluate operating and potential systems; to critically evaluate research results; and to effectively develop and conduct research. Management-- concerned with human behavior and organizations--links these areas. An attitude change is needed by information educators and professionals to break from the library as an institution and seek alliances with other fields. (KP)",

The study seeks to determine fluctuations of reference service workloads over time, department staffing and training needs, and to provide supervisors with a quantifiable understanding of reference activities. Over 500,000 transactions occurred in 1975-1976, suggesting successful marketing of services. Volumes of directional and circulation questions indicate a need for directional signs and for examination of circulation procedures in some departments. The success of user education programs is reflected in a high volume of instructional and research questions. Students and support staff  handle large numbers of questions with students answering all types, indicating a need to examine staffing patterns. Public service librarians recommend: (l) establishing a training program for students and a higher job level for students working weekends and evenings; (2) creating half time graduate assistantships with subject expertise for reference services on weekends and evenings; and (3) converting several student positions to a full-time staff position.

Four objectives are specified to attain the goal of encouraging and exposing preschoolers of all races to free educational opportunities at the library. Success in meeting these objectives is evaluated, using circulation and attendance statistics and observations. A survey of the day care center, church school, and parents shows that 100 percent of the participating adults wish the program to continue. The program has met with  success in reaching out to preschoolers via the media mobile, in giving parents of different social, economic, educational, and religious backgrounds opportunity to better understand the library's value to parent and child, and in developing a basic preschool collection with media and equipment.

The Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) is an emerging national, nonprofit network, undergoing continual evolution in its data bases, hardware, membership, and development of new subsystems. Its potential services and data base size make libraries eager to join. OCLC serves as an abbreviated National Union Catalog, and most members use the data base for ILL. An ILL subsystem is being developed to solve problems in communications, recordkeeping, bibliographic  control, and cost, with six basic capabilities and three files. In the long range it can bridge the gap between network promotion and library education. The role of OCLC could be as chief overseer in planning as part of a larger network, or OCLC could become the major ILL facility in North America, thereby determining the future of librarianship.

Graduates, supervising librarians, and 164 of 250 randomly selected libraries in Mercer and adjacent counties responded to three questionnaires. Eighty-five percent of the supervising librarians supported the need for formally trained LTAs and noted the excellent performance of MCCC graduates. Fewer libraries wanted to hire additional LTAs, decreasing from 57 in 1969 to 15 in 1976. Librarians and graduates  highly rated the present curricula. The study concluded that although the LTA status is accepted locally, the job market is uncertain. Recommendations included: (1) establishing job placement services; (2) increasing enrollment by encouraging all students to take a portion of the program as an elective or minor; (3) encouraging LTA students to take audiovisual equipment and computer courses as electives; and (4) a statewide campaign for an LTA job classification in the New Jersey Civil Service.

Sixty-seven percent of SEA representatives surveyed indicated they are currently or are considering building a data base, most using ERIC as a standard. A significant number were developing computer retrieval resource bases and indicated they would like their efforts to be computer compatible. Based on these results, the study recommended: (1) that the National Institute of Education (NIE) acknowledge the need for and fund additional SEA data base development efforts; (2) that efforts be coordinated; and (3) that NIE collect report formats and more detailed information.

That federal statute allows individuals such as students and teachers to recover money damages from those state officials who have violated their federal rights. Addressed to the non-legal-scholar, this paper was designed to inform community college officials of their potential liabilities as public officials and to provide useful background information through a review of pertinent cases. Topics covered include: (1) why sue the official in his individual capacity? (2) the immunity standard prior to 1974; (3) the new standard of official immunity as set forth in Wood v. Strickland; (4) some related issues (what about  private junior college officials? who pays the attorneys? what about insurance?). This paper is recommended to all community college officials concerned about the constitutional validity of their actions and/or personal financial loss. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the student-centered cluster college concept of organization employed at Oakton Community College (Illinois) and compares this approach to traditional organization by academic department or division. The advantages offered by the division structure include intradisciplinary interchange among teachers, coordinated budget building, student counseling for majors, specialized facilities, curriculum coordination, and &quot;peer&quot; faculty evaluation. But such a structure has major disadvantages, including uneven size, pressure groups, insularity, hindrance of interdisciplinary teaching strategies, and higher costs. The cluster concept results in lowered administrative costs, achievement of new levels of interpersonal relations by removal of artificial barriers, effective  coping with rapid institutional change, student benefits derived from competing cluster offerings, and the positioning of important student services near students, rather than in remote centralized facilities. The cluster concept at Oakton, while unquestionably presenting many challenges, has proven to be efficacious and consistent with the philosophy of the college, which holds that the student is the prime factor in the educational mission of the college.

Unlike the usual procedure, these proposals were considered together to allow the Commission to assume its larger role of commenting on major issues in postsecondary education within the context of statewide planning. The report analyzes post World War II patterns of growth in Orange County, reliable population projections, the Orange County planning process, and previous educational planning studies for the area. The four community college districts are described, and their proposals for new campuses are analyzed. A number of alternatives for providing facilities of community college enrollment growth  are considered. It is concluded that new campuses, of which three are approved, should be located to serve the needs of County growth areas even if these areas cross district boundaries, and that interdistrict attendance agreements provide the most practical alternative for sharing of responsibility in the near future. However, it is recommended that consolidation or restructuring of district boundaries be seriously considered as a permanent arrangement. Among the appendices is a paper entitled &quot;The Commission's Role in the Review of Proposals for New Campuses and Off-Campus Centers--Guidelines and Procedures.&quot; (JDS)",

Fifty-seven percent of the institutions surveyed responded. Findings of the study revealed: (1) 93% of the colleges had a staff member with primary responsibility for the institution's PR; (2) 59% of the PR directors reported to the president; (3) for the majority of PR personnel, PR was not a full-time job; (4) colleges with small enrollments spent less time on PR than did larger institutions; (5)  long-range PR goals had been adopted by only 27% of the institutions, while 65% had adopted specific short-term goals; (6) key audiences toward which major PR efforts were directed included community residents, potential students in local/area high schools, and currently enrolled students; and (7) the most frequently used method of evaluating the PR effort was analysis of enrollment. Overall, it was noted that two-year colleges have made considerable progress in recent years in the development of PR programs, although considerable room for improvement still exists. (JDS)",

Three major components of the distant learning program are audio, video, and print materials which are used in conjunction with a two-way, computer-based communication system. This system permits faculty/student dialogues in a written mode. A distant learning student responds to a faculty-designed questionnaire which assesses the student's progress at strategic points along a course of study, in both the cognitive and affective domains. Based on the responses obtained, a letter is returned to the student which contains an individualized &quot;prescription for  learning&quot;. The prescription, formulated by the instructor and transmitted to the student via computer, is based on the student's unique educational strengths and needs. As a result of this process, impersonal materials are utilized to deliver personalized instruction. Additionally, the student is able to act as the principal initiator of learning. A graphic model of the distant learning program is included as is a flow chart depicting the operation of the computer-based instructional program. (JDS)",

Arguing that more and better research needs to be done on the outcomes of community college education, this document utilizes two follow-up studies of students who graduated from career programs to illustrate how outcomes data may be organized to relate to career programs and their characteristics, and to the information needs of external agencies. A two-dimensional outcomes model is developed, with the first dimension comprised of three categories--career preparation, transfer preparation, and public service--and the second comprised of three time  dimension categories--before, during, and after college. This taxonomy permits simultaneous classification of each program outcome by type of function involved and its temporal sequence in the college environment. The resulting organization of information provides necessary answers to questions asked in the resource-allocation/decision-making process. (JDS)",

The resultant &quot;student development&quot; model reflects a recognition of the fact that the community colleges are community-based, opportunity and goal oriented, and emphasize the integration of learning and living. Consequently, student personnel services must be an integral part of the educational process and active in facilitating the total human development of its clientele, rather than simply focusing on the &quot;student part&quot; of the individual. Professional counseling is the key element in student  development. It must be integrated with other campus activities, must maximize a student's chances to reach his potential, focusing on educational, personal, social and vocational development, and, being student centered, must take into account the interests, aptitudes, needs, values and potential of the student. Comprehensive counseling should include goal setting, personal assessment, development of change strategies, strategy implementation, evaluation, and recycling of the whole process for each student.

Admission requirements were found to vary, with the Test of English as a Foreign Language primarily used as a screening device. Some financial aid, albeit limited, was available to international students, and most schools provided developmental programs in English and mathematics. Among the recommendations offered to improve the effectiveness of international programs were establishment of an international student advisor organization, requirement of automobile and hospitalization insurance for internationals, and budgetary and staff support for international student offices at schools enrolling 75 or more internationals.

        "description":"This paper contains an overview of current activities and potential opportunities for two-year colleges in the area of international education. While involvement of two-year colleges in international education is generally limited and fragmented, there are four major areas of activity: foreign language and area studies, technical assistance and consultancies, foreign student enrollment, and direct exchanges and study abroad. Most institutions already have some type of program in area studies and foreign languages. Consultancies and assistance opportunities are becoming more widely available, particularly as more developing countries seek aid in establishing two-year and technical colleges. Foreign student enrollment, while limited, has a beneficial effect and should be promoted,  but specialized services must be provided to insure that the foreign student has a positive experience. Direct exchange/study abroad programs are accessible to all institutions, although few have taken advantage of them; a specific program at the University of Minnesota Technical College at Crookston is described to illustrate this functioning. A listing of resources available to institutions interested in developing international components of their programs is included in this paper. (JDS)",

The notion that the community college needs to be a \"full partner in higher education\" is detracting from acceptance of the community college's unique role. Student-centeredness seems to be giving way to faculty- and staff-centeredness. Fiscal exigencies are causing the community college to glory in its past rather than to forge ahead with imagination. Coordination, regionalizing, the meeting of state standards, and raises in tuition are debunking the myth that the community college is a low-cost, near-at-home people's college. Yet, despite these and other problems, there are exemplary activities occurring on every community college campus which prove that the  community college is still healthy and moving, and that, in an evolving way, it will adjust to current difficulties.

The concepts of comprehensiveness and accessibility laid out in the original state plans are now being questioned on financial grounds, the increased proportion of state financial support has not offset inflation, and state functions in coordination and establishing standards have expanded to the regulation of almost every facet of college operation. Financial constraints have caused some colleges to restrict enrollments, to raise tuition equal to that of public universities, and to halt growth in technical and semi-professional programs. Under the  guise of &quot;improving academic standards&quot; the open door is slamming shut across the nation; services to aid the under-educated are being curtailed or discontinued. Although community colleges are represented in state higher education councils, they are viewed unsympathetically as consumers of scarce resources rightly belonging to traditional institutions serving &quot;regular&quot; students. Local authority and control are eroding. The commitment of the community colleges to the ideals that brought them into being is tending to fade; unless they can sustain their own sense of direction they will lose their integrity in a morass of statewide planning and institutional homogeneity.

These expectations and assumptions, as commonly held by community college educators, students, and critics, include both positive and negative myths and realities. The assumptions that community college programs are inexpensive, that its students are only those who could not go elsewhere, that it brings success to students of all academic backgrounds, and that it was created to provide vocational-technical education, are myths. Lack of cohesion, orientation toward students, and active recruiting of the \"new student\" only in recent times, are realities. Community colleges will remain a force in society only to the degree that they (l) address the needs of a wide  range of students, not just the successes; (2) find out why they lose students and how much of it is institutional fault; (3) actively seek the \"new student\"; (4) manage to maintain comprehensive offerings in the face of dollar shortage; (5) develop activities around which the student need to identify with the college can coalesce; (6) analyze formally whether the student orientation of the community college remains real; and (7) do not allow costs to rise to the point that students look elsewhere. By being less defensive and by sharing the results of institutional efforts, community colleges can cause some of the positive near-myths to become realities. (JDS)",

Critics who charge that the colleges serve to maintain the class structure in America fail to recognize that progress toward equality of educational opportunity cannot lessen inequality of condition or of effect. Community colleges cannot break down class distinctions or move entire groups from one social stratum to another; but, as the main point of entry and reentry into higher education, they can assist the upward mobility of individuals. The idea of community education or community building as the new mandate for the community college also confuses concept and purpose. Proponents, seeking community  support through community services, fail to understand the difference between a sequenced, measured curriculum and the diffuse, unsequenced presentations typically offered in community education--between learning and the awarding of credits. The college leader should point out the distinctions between social equalization and equal access, between curriculum and presentations, to help his colleagues and constituents realize that the college that teaches best uplifts its community most.

A student development model is delineated whose essential components include student goal setting in collaboration with institutional professionals, assessment of position relative to goals, use of change strategies (instruction, consultation, milieu management) to bring about development toward goals, and evaluation to determine the extent to which goals are met and whether new goals are necessary. A taxonomy of behaviors of the well-developed student is outlined, based on three categories of student development needs: the  development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, of self-determination, and of the ability to control one's environment. The specific professional role responsibilities of administrators, instructors, and counselors in relation to each behavior are illustrated, and the implications and applications of the student development concept for each of these professionals are reviewed. Implementation of student development education requires review and possible revision of course objectives, program objectives, and professional objectives, as well as competency development of professionals. Possible strategies to be used in initiating these changes are suggested. (JDS)",

The curriculum is intended for incorporation in regular course curricula in any subject matter. Anticipated outcomes from employment of this curriculum include enhancement of student  self concept and the fostering of more meaningful relationships between students and teachers.

The two-semester program emphasized development of the student as a total person: first semester courses utilized the concept of &quot;self&quot; as an interdisciplinary focus; second semester courses centered on the natural and social environments and the student's ability to function effectively in a group. A humane learning environment was facilitated by organizing students into small primary groups known as &quot;families&quot; which met weekly with an instructor. An experimental group (n=60) and a control group (n=60) were randomly selected from students participating in the program for 32 weeks and 16 weeks,  respectively, and were pre- and post-tested on level of self-actualization by means of the Personal Orientation Inventory. No significant differences were found, although positive mean gains did occur for both groups and the experimental group showed consistently greater change in a positive direction. It was concluded that the program appeared to be viable in contributing to positive change in student self-actualization but that length of time spent in the program did not significantly affect change in the level of self-actualization.

Resultant data were analyzed in aggregate and by respondents' curriculum; mean responses of students were rank-ordered by curriculum for each of the subscales and are presented in tabular form. Overall, students in certificate and diploma programs had the most positive attitudes toward the total learning environment while students in college parallel curricula had the most negative  attitudes. The most positive attitudes were those relating to the curriculum subscale. The most negative attitudes were those relating to counseling, the ratings for which were substantially lower than those for any other subscale.

The literature concerned with the controversy over the photocopying of copyrighted works, the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine, and the history and regulations of the new copyright law were reviewed. The procedures of the five photocopying services presently offered for faculty by the Miami-Dade Community College South Campus Library were examined; these services included copies for instructional use, interlibrary loan, missing page requests from cooperating libraries, library reserve, and a &quot;Table of Contents Service&quot; providing faculty with contents pages of current  periodicals. Analysis of library photocopying statistics and procedures indicated the need for the library to revise its photocopying procedures in order to be in compliance with the new law. Necessary changes included: (1) revision and posting of copyright warning signs on all library copying machines; (2) revision of photocopying request forms to provide a record of the types of material copied, the approximate number of words per request and the name of the author of the work being copied; and (3) maintenance of a monthly record of the total number of times that photocopies are made from the same periodical title and issue.

        "description":"This paper reports on the current status of institutional research (IR) in community colleges. Studies indicate increased IR involvement in the last ten years, with the most recent research suggesting that 39% of the community colleges have IR programs; yet the typical institutional researcher still exists at the lowest level of staff administration and generally possesses few research skills. Types of studies which are most frequently conducted by institutional researchers, in rank order, include studies of students, curriculum and programs, institutional operations, faculty, and student personnel services. Sixteen representative studies are reviewed in this paper in order to provide models for beginning offices of IR. Criteria by which the studies are reviewed include purpose,  results, prime sponsor, skills required in preparation, awareness of relevant literature, and examination of evidence that the study was successful in making institutional changes. In addition, the essential components of three successful institutional research programs are reviewed and compared, serving to illustrate coherent IR efforts. It is noted that the quality of community college IR depends not only on the individual institutional researcher, but also on the development of national standards of excellence. An extensive bibliography is included. (JDS)",

The area office survey includes opinion data collected from area administrators, area office staff, and social service workers concerning employment for welfare recipients, training, training resources, transportation, center-based and noncenter-based care, and programmatic weaknesses. In the center-based  evaluation, a stratified random sample of 15 of the 75 licensed centers was chosen for evaluation. Results report on the program for children, administration, physical setting, nutrition and health care, licensing standards and requirements, and fire standards. In the noncenter-based evaluation, a representative sample of 34 vendors was selected from 933 in-home and out-of-home vendors. Results report on program objectives, observations of the caretaker, supplies and materials, food service practices, physical setting, and parent interaction. Based on data from the surveys, the final chapter -- &quot;A Portrait of Day Care in West Virginia&quot; -- reports on conditions and makes recommendations for improvement. Appendices, comprising approximately one-third of the document, include questionnaires  and manuals used in the studies. (SB)",

        "description":"This paper reviews some of the observations made by Vygotsky about the structure and content of inner speech and its precursor egocentric speech, also called private speech. Recent advances in certain areas of linguistics are used to clarify and develop these observations. In particular, the paper focuses on Vygotsky's ideas about the predicative structure of private and inner speech. It is observed that Vygotsky consistently analyzed predicativity in private and inner speech by using notions similar to those used in functional linguistics, and that he recognized the difference between grammatical subject and predicate and psychological subject and predicate. A further distinction was made by Vygotsky between pscyhological subject and psychological predicate. This distinction is  compared at length with the distinction made by Chafe between given and new information in social speech. A new version of Chafe's definitions of given and new information is proposed to be applicable to private speech rather than social speech. The developmental hierarchy of private speech suggested by Kohlberg and others is discussed. An analysis is made of the surface form of the private speech of two 2-year-olds who were assembling a puzzle. It is concluded that: (1) private speech has a given-new information organization based on what is already present and what is introduced into the child's consciousness, and (2) this organization is based on the child's action.

The early contact treatment consisted of placing the mother and neonate together for 10 to 45 minutes within the first 3 postpartum hours. The extended contact treatment provided mother-neonate contact in a roomin-in situation for approximately 10 hours per day of the lying-in period. Utilizing a 2 (early contact) x 2 (extended contact) x 2 (sex of the infant) unequal cells factorial design, 104 lower class primiparas and their health, full-term neonates were assigned to one of eight possible cells in a manner as unbiased as hospital contraints would permit. Because sex effects were slight and  insignificant to the data reported here, the design was collapsed into a 2 (early contact) x 2 (extended contact) and analyzed as othogonal contrasts. Dependent variables included observations of mothers and infants during the fourth and fifth lying-in feedings. In addition, was evaluated using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale and mothers were given a multiple-choice questionnaire on their infant's temperament. Results for infant, maternal and interactional variables supported the importance of immediate postpartum contact between mother and infant in facilitating mother-infant adaptation. Some support was also provided for extended postpartum mother-infant contact. (Author/JMB)",

A total of 64 middle class subjects (half 8- to 9-years-olds, half 14- to 15-year-olds) were observed individually in a 6-minute waiting room situation with an unfamiliar 6- to 10-month-old baby and mother (confederate). While the subject was unoccupied, his/her interest in the baby was observed. Each subject later filled out a sex-role self-concept questionnaire, operated a slide projector which controlled the length of time each of 30 pictures was exposed and reported the five pictures liked best. Results indicated that middle childhood girls and boys were similar in the degree and nature of interest they exhibited in babies and that sex differences began to emerge in  adolescence when the girls showed a trend to greater responsiveness to babies, chose more pictures of infants among their favorites, and spent a larger percentage of their time looking at baby pictures than adolescent males. Adolescent girls also reported more enjoyment in caring for infants and felt more comfortable with the responsibility for infants than did adolescent males. Findings by age group indicated differences between middle childhood and adolescence in the mode of responsivity. Children in middle childhood were as interested in the infant as adolescents, but did more looking and less approaching in the presence of an unfamiliar baby; adolescents were less inhibited and displayed their interest more overtly. It was concluded that by adolescence, girls have adopted  sex-stereotypic values such as baby interest into their behavioral repertoire. (JMB)",

Measures were obtained on five scales: quality of available support system, anxiety, depression, reciprocity (infant's ability to communicate and seek social interaction with mother as well as her ability to understand and respond), and maternal stereotypes, or responses reflecting perceived social desirability. Individual items on all scales correlated highly with their respective totals; however, there were more significant inter-item correlations on the support system scale than the other scales.  Differences were found between multiparous and primaparous mothers in harmony of home life, depression, anxiety and attitudes reflecting reciprocity.

A total of 279 third-grade children were tested on I-E control and academic achievement in September and again in May. The I-E control measure used was the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility (IAR) questionnaire which yields one subscore for belief in internal responsibility for success (I+) and one subscore for internal responsibility for failure (I-). The achievement measures used in this study consisted of the reading and arithmetic batteries of  the California Tests of Basic Skills. The data were analyzed using two sets of canonical correlations: the first set testing the ability of the observed I-E scores to predict later achievement, and the second set testing the ability of these I-E scores statistically corrected for measurement error to predict the same achievement scores. The comparison of these two analyses revealed that improvements in measures of the I-E trait could result in an important predictor of academic performance for boys. (JMB)",

A total of 28 mothers and their 3-year-old children participated in the study. All of the families were black with average income below the poverty line, and the average maternal educational level was 10th grade. Behaviors of each mother and child pair interacting in a playroom were scored from videotapes by two observers using an electronic, digital recorder. The state of activity of mothers and children was assigned to one of four categories (mutual play, passive interaction, play alone, or no clear activity) and two types of direct attempts to influence the other's behaviors were also scored (suggestion of an entirely new activity or suggestion of a modification of an ongoing  activity). Results showed that mothers were almost continually involved in attempting to structure their children's play through both major and minor suggestions. Their directive attempts far exceeded those of their children, although mothers were quite responsive to requests by their children. Findings also showed that children exercised a great deal of indirect effect on their mother's behavior. In making suggestions, mothers were sensitive to what their children were doing and altered their responses accordingly. Children were indirectly affected by the mother's behavior only in their alterations of showing and giving toys; children were not as sensitive to contextual cues in attempting to directly modify their mother's behaviors.

        "description":"This paper presents a theoretical model of empathy in which empathy is defined as a largely involuntary vicarious response to affective cues from another person or from his situation. The model has three components: affective, cognitive, and motivational. In the presentation of the affective component, five distinct models of empathic affect arousal are discussed in their approximate order of appearance developmentally. The discussion of the cognitive component includes a review of the development of the sense of other. In the presentation of the motivation component, the research on empathy and prosocial behavior is summarized. (JMB)",

        "description":"This paper reports two experiments investigating the effect of schooling and urbanization on short term recall and recognition memory. Subjects were 384 male children and young adults living in Morocco representing urban and rural and schooled and nonschooled backgrounds. Additional subject groups--including Koranic school students, Moroccan rug sellers and University of Michigan students--were also tested to study possible culture-specific influences on memory. In the first experiment, subjects were required to recall the position of a familiar animal in a series of seven briefly presented items. Results indicated that recency recall, or echoic store, was present in all populations studied regardless of age, whereas primacy recall, considered to be a function of verbally  mediated rehearsal strategies or control processes, developed with age only for schooled subjects and to a lesser extent for urban nonschooled subjects. In the second experiment, the same subjects were shown 30 pictures of rug patterns (15 original patterns and 15 duplicates) and asked to identify duplicates. Duplicates appeared in lags of 1, 5, 10, and 25 intervening items. Schooled subjects performed better than nonschooled, and rural subjects (schooled and nonschooled) scored better than urban subjects. Results support previous research indicating little age-related change in forgetting rates and, with minor exceptions, no variation in forgetting rate with respect to schooling and environment. Results are discussed in relation to other cross-cultural and memory research. Nine pages of  tables and illustrations are included. (SB)",

Twenty-four infants in three age cohorts (10, 15, and 20 months old) were studied for 9 months. Mothers reported the child's reactions to naturally occurring events in which emotions were expressed; in addition, each week mothers simulated one specified affect (e.g., crying, anger, laughter), and an investigator portrayed affect incidents. Mother-child interactions were rated. The youngest children showed evidence of discrimination between others' positive and negative emotions. Responses to affect were examined as a function of the person expressing affect and the kind of affect. Sympathetic behaviors were directed toward the distressed mother but not the distressed  investigator. In the natural setting, crying most frequently evoked sympathetic behavior; angry interactions turned the child away. In the oldest cohort there was individual consistency in sympathy over time. Mothers showing more positive contact in nondistress situations had children who were more sympathetic in distress situations. Socially out-going children were also more likely to comfort others in distress. Reparation behaviors (reactions to distress created by the child) appeared and increased with age. Theories of early altruism are discussed. (Author/JMB)",

        "author":["Forman, George E."],
        "description":"This paper discusses Piaget's constructivist theory of logico-mathematical knowledge, the development of knowledge in children, and implications for preschool activities. The theory that a child cannot understand anything she or he has not constructed is advanced. Contrasts between Piaget's theory and the theories of Gibson and Luria are described briefly. It is proposed that although language plays a role in logical thought, it is itself insufficient to account for the development of cognizance (conscious knowledge). The development of knowledge is discussed in terms of the concept of object permanence, the ability to understand how things can be transformed and the ability to construct relatedness through inference. Piaget terms this inferential process logico-mathematical  knowledge. The role of action in the development of logico-mathematical knowledge has implications for preschool program content. Three problems with which young children characteristically have difficulty are discussed: (1) the problem of gaps (inferring continuity in the face of discontinuity); (2) the problem of representation (reflecting on the form of movement); and (3) the problem of procedures (relating static states to the transformation that produced them). Ways of encouraging development in these areas are presented in examples from the School for Constructive Play at the University of Massachusetts. Also discussed are new teaching techniques defined by Inhelder, Sinclair and Bovet that are based on a predict-observe-predict paradigm consistent with constructivism.  (SB)",

Subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. In one condition the subject and experimenter rehearsed together; in a second condition only the experimenter rehearsed; in the third the subject rehearsed alone. A control group received no assistance. All subjects (including the control group) received the same baseline and generalization instructions to remember pictures in the correct order. Subjects were given a practice trial followed by nine experimental trials. The pictures to be recalled were labeled on all trials for all subjects. Serial recall was facilitated only when the experimenter rehearsed and the  child remained silent. In addition, rehearsal by the subject tended to interfere with recall. It was suggested tentatively that requiring young children to overtly produce the labels of pictures may cause an interference in memory for order. (Author/MS)",

The Metropolitan Readiness Test, the Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were used to assess the academic achievement and intellectual development of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children with the Montessori or Responsive Environment experiences and those with no preschool experience at the end of the regular kindergarten program. The SRA Achievement Series, Grade 1, was used to assess the achievement of children, with and without the Montessori experience, at the end of first grade. Results indicated that children in the regular 5-year-old kindergarten  program with prior Montessori experience scored significantly higher on the Caldwell measure than did children without this experience upon entrance into the program. When all of the children with either type of preschool experience were categorized as one treatment group, results showed that these children scored higher on the Caldwell measure at the beginning and end of the 5-year-old program than those without the experience. Significant differences in favor of the preschool treatment group were also noted on the pretest of the Caldwell subtests: Personal-Social, Associative, Vocabulary, and Concept Activation-Numerical. It was concluded that early educational preschool experiences can be effective in fostering the academic achievement and maintaining the intellectual development of  children. (Author/JMB)",

Subjects were 49 mothers and infants (26 preterms and 23 fullterms) from a low income black population. Perinatal optimality was assessed with a scale developed by Parmelee and his associates. Indices which characterize the structure of mother-infant interaction were derived from two observation sessions, one just before hospital discharge and one a month later. Development was defined as the change in Bayley Mental Development Indices  (Corrected for conceptional age) from 3 to 12 months after hospital discharge. Results were interpreted as supporting the notion that preterms are generally more sensitive to environmental influences than fullterms. Data suggest that: (1) instead of being more critical for infants with a history of perinatal complications, mother-infant interaction may actually be less critical; and (2) intervention programs which would improve developmental outcome should focus on those factors which underlie perinatal complications.

Other resources such as a toy lending library, collections of  reading materials for parents, baby-sitting services, quality day and/or home care would be located or developed. Strategies for implementation of this model would include making a survey of available community resources, preparing a statement of program objectives, and developing a delivery system, using resources already available in the community.

A total of 60 boys and girls between the ages of 2 1/2 and 4 years completed a 3-choice discrimination learning task. On each of 12 trials, a child was presented with three magazine photographs: one of an animal, one of an item of food, and one of an item of clothing. The positive instance on every trial was a member of the same conceptual category (either food or animal). Half of the children were initially given an example of the kind of stimulus which would be reinforced and half had to learn the conceptual rule through trial and error. Subsequently the children were given sorting, labeling, and concept identification tasks. Between  70%-100% of children at all ages used the category information to solve the discrimination learning task. Children who had been required to discover the conceptual rule independently did as well as those who had not. Even the 2 1/2-year-olds demonstrated the ability to spontaneously recognize and utilize a conceptual rule. Certain performance measures indicated an improvement over age. It was suggested that this progression is primarily related to the speed with which a conceptual strategy is adopted rather than the ability to use the conceptual information. This paper discusses a number of methodological issues involving the clarification of tasks for child subjects. (Author/MS)",

New Matching Familiar Figures (MFF) problems were designed and administered to fourth grade children to tap both kinds of strategies. Impulsive children performed better on MFF problems that required \"global\" analysis than on problems that required \"detail\" analysis, while reflective children showed the opposite trend. On the basis of these results it is proposed that  impulsive children analyze spatial information in large \"chunks\" and that reflective children analyze such information in small \"chunks.\" It is further proposed that it takes less time to analyze a stimulus if large \"chunks\" are the units of analysis. It is concluded that although response latency is an important and stable indicator of cognitive style, accuracy varies according to the degree of compatibility between the subject's strategy of analysis and task requirements. No numerical data are included. (Author/SB)",

Infants' responses were videotaped. Dependent measures in each condition were total visual fixation to the adult and length of first fixation to the adult. Both age groups discriminated mothers from stranger in the congruent face-voice conditions (MM and SS) by showing longer first fixations to the stranger. The older group also  discriminated mothers from stranger by the same measure in the face-no voice conditions (MO and SO). These result suggest that the original discrimination of mothers is not based on visual recognition alone. The older group discriminated between congruent and incongruent face-voice conditions by showing longer first fixations to the incongruent conditions (MS and SM) indicating that by 13 weeks infants have developed specific face-voice expectations for their mothers. There was more total fixation to all the stimulus conditions with age. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between mother-infant behavior and the infant's performance on perceptual-cognitive tasks as a function of the infant's sex. A total of 189 12-week-old infants and their mothers were observed in their homes during 2 hours of infant awake time. In addition, the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development was administered to each child in his/her home and the Corman-Escalona Scales of Object Permanence and an attention task were conducted in the laboratory. Results showed that for middle class infants, males received somewhat more proximal behaviors than females while the reverse appeared to be the case for the lower class infants. The highest proportion of maternal interactive behavior, however, was found for  mothers of lower SES males, while middle class mothers showed no interactive differences between males and females. Male infants were more responsive to their mother's interactions than female infants; however, there were few sex differences in infant behavior. Contrary to previous findings, males did not fret or cry significantly more than females. On the cognitive measures, a modality difference in habituation was evident on the attention task, but no sex differences were found for the Bayley MDI or object permanence performance. Data indicated a direct association between maternal behavior and infant perceptual-cognitive competence by 12 weeks of age with maternal interactive behavior showing an overall significant relationship and maternal frequency behavior showing different effects  for male and female infants.

Using the non-nutritive sucking paradigm, 48 infants 1-3 months of age were presented with verbal stimuli contingent upon criterion level sucking. Following habituation to a stimulus pair, the sound was changed in one ear and the rate of recovery in criterion sucking was recorded. After a short break, the same procedure was repeated with the shift in the stimulus pair occurring in the opposite ear. In both replication attempts, stimulus material, response criteria and equipment involved in recording response measures were identical to those used by Entus. However, the following control  measures were introduced: (1) an adjustable mechanical arm to hold the nipple-transducer; (2) a double blind procedure, rendering the experimenter blind to the order of stimulus combinations; (3) a divider screen, separating the experimenter from the subject in order to eliminate possible biasing interactions; (4) the level of criterion sucking was readjusted and reduced (Experiment 1) in order to ensure conditioning of the sucking response. Analysis of variance on the recovery scores was performed to determine the effects of ears, minutes, sex and order of stimulus change. In both experiments there were no significant differences in the recovery scores between ears. These results are discussed in terms of the possible effects of experimenter bias and lack of adequate controls that could  have contributed to the findings reported by Entus. (Author/MS)",

Sixty-four 3- and 5-year-old boys and girls were selected as subjects on the basis of physical attractiveness. Three types of same-age and sex dyads were formed on the basis of physical attractiveness (attractive, unattractive, and mixed-attractiveness) and were observed in a semi-naturalistic play setting. A categorical observational system was used to record positive social behaviors, aggressive behaviors, activity and object-directed behaviors, and sex-stereotyped behaviors. Few differences were found between attractive and unattractive children in the categories  indexing positive social behaviors. A developmental trend was found for aggression: no differences based on attractiveness were found for 3-year-olds, but 5-year-old unattractive children hit peers more often than attractive children. Finally, unattractive children were generally more active and preferred to play with masculine toys while attractive children were less active and played with feminine toys. (Author/MS)",

Data on patterns of mother/child interactions were collected for the experimental and control groups of poverty mother/child dyads at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center and a group of general population high education and occupational status mother/child dyads. The measures employed included: (1) The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the High Risk Index administered prenatally; (2) a 25-minute laboratory observation of mother/child dyads in free play sessions conducted at 6 and 20 months; (3) the Caldwell Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME), administered in the subjects'  own homes at 6 and 18 months; and (4) an adaptation of the Parental Attitudes Research Inventory (PARI), administered at 6 and 18 months. Results showed clear differences in the attributes of middle class and poverty mothers, with the general population mothers talking and interacting more with their infants and toddlers, scoring higher on all subscales of the Home Stimulation Inventory, and scoring as less authoritarian, more democratic, and more hostile and rejecting than the poverty mothers. It was concluded that within the poverty groups, day care intervention did alter the relationship between maternal variables and child status so that maternal variables were highly predictive of child status for the control group and less so for the experimental group.

Functional play was observed in 64 children at 9 1/2, 11 1/2, 13 1/2, and 15 1/2 months of age. Six sets of toys with 36 conservatively defined functional uses (ideas) were coded in 10-second blocks over a 15-minute session. Results indicated that functional play (e.g., stirring a spoon in a tea cup, bringing a telephone to one's ear) emerges abruptly at 11 1/2 and increases linearly through 13 1/2 and 15 1/2 months. Indiscriminate mouthing, waving, banging, and fingering of objects is greatest at 9 1/2 months and diminishes linearly. Thus, a stereotypic response  repetoire gives way to specific actions reflecting ideas appropriate to specific situations. Results strongly imply that a cognitive metamorphosis (the ability to generate specific ideas) underlies the many changes occurring in the 1-year-old infant. The potential for infant cognitive assessment is discussed. (Author/MS)",

Mothers' teaching style with 9-year-old children was observed in an induced teaching situation in the home, in a Guatemalan Maya town. In the induced teaching situation, the mother instructed her child in making an object out of tinkertoys. Her behavior was coded in categories involving verbal instruction and physical demonstration. The memory tests revealed verbal and visual factors, rather than unitary memory ability. Thirty-one children were selected typifying the following memory patterns: high performance on verbal with low on visual, high on all, low on all, and low on verbal with high on visual. The  percentage of mother's verbal instruction for each group (incidence of verbal instruction divided by incidence of verbal instruction plus incidence of demonstration) was 68%, 64%, 42%, and 32%, respectively. Kruskal-Wallace one-way analysis of variance showed the differences between the groups to be significant (p &lt; 02). The results indicate that experience with verbal instruction, as opposed to demonstration in context, may play an important role in performance on cognitive tests, particularly in tests with a strong verbal component.

Subjects were 24 children 26 months of age, each accompanied by a familiar caretaker. Twelve children (5 girls and 7 boys) were a randomly drawn sample of the general population recruited from county birth records. Nine of these children were reared at home and three were in full-time daycare. The twelve children in the experimental group (5 girls and 7 boys) participated in a daycare intervention project. The children were brought to an observation room with their caretakers or mothers and were observed in three 7-minute sessions which differed in the number of toys provided (no toys, one toy, 5 toys). Caretakers were asked not  in initiate interactions with the children or direct the children's play. Results showed no differences in the peer behavior of the experimental and general population children. A significant effect for the number of toys was found on the frequency of active initiations of peer interaction, with more active and positive attempts to initiate interactions occurring when there was either no toys or only one toy present. Experimental children were found to spend more time in solitary play with toys than did general population children when the five toys were present. Finally, data revealed that experimental children spent more time away from the familiar caretaker and were more likely to interact with the stranger than general population children. It was concluded that daycare may enhance  children's ability to interact with unfamiliar adults. (JMB)",

The Conference was successful in: building bridges of communication between senior citizens, professionals, and legislators at the local, state, and Federal government levels; establishing lines of priority among the experts; and directing their resources toward the maximum good. Two recommendations which clearly stood out were the: need to increase fiscal expenditures on Hispanic-oriented programs and research; and need to maintain a national center or clearinghouse on the Hispanic Elderly.

BACSTOP aimed to: create a mechanism that would stop and reverse the racial separatism and isolation pattern that began to develop among new 7th graders entering the school each year; and improve the educational performance of 7th graders in basic skills by refocusing students, faculty and administrative attention on the school's cognitive responsibilities. Activities were designed to bring students into early contact with each other in situations requiring that they  communicate with each other and work together to bring about a positive and successful experience. Four activities encompassing two days and one night were developed as the major thrust of the outdoor program (rope course; backpacking; cross country skiing, winter camping and dual solo; and a canoe trip). In addition each student was given the opportunity to sign up for one 5-day expedition in an isolated area in Northern Michigan. By the end of the 1975-76 school year, the school represented a more positive profile. There was a higher level of positive biracial interaction among 7th grade students; and rate of achievement exceeded the district rate of achievement. (NQ)",

Covered are: teachers' role and responsibilities; fund raising; food planning; students' projects; suggested activities in geology, ecology, weather, map and compass, human history, and creative  writing and art; activities during the course--introduction games, group journals, environmental awareness exercises, group experiences, values clarification, poetry, stories, readings, and personal interviews; and course evaluation. Appendices include: an OB short school program proposal form, time line chart, backpacking and short ski program models, sample menus, insulation and chill factor charts, common animal tracks, first aid kit and clothing lists, a general bibliography of ski touring literature, rules for preventing hypothermia and for avoiding and surviving snow avalanches, and a ski touring program evaluation form.

        "description":"How do we estimate personal growth? What do experiential education programs accomplish? Personal growth (affective domain) often is fostered through experiential education programs, but it is difficult to measure the relationship between the two. One manner of measurement is the observation of external actions by a student that demonstrate what personal, internal growth is taking place. This observation can yield an accurate, sensitive estimate of personal growth. It requires, however, clear definition of program goals and student observable behavior. This paper explores this manner of measurement by discussing the necessity for objectives, describing the affective domain, and discussing the utilization of behavioral indicators to make affective objectives workable. Six program  descriptions are included as examples of the combination of affective measurable objectives with the field of experiential education. Illustrating what is possible and being developed in the field of experiential education, the examples include the necessary behavioral indicators, which guide the teacher-observer in the recognizing and categorizing student change. The programs cover: involvement in the local community; living within a new community environment; outdoor activities for spring, summer, fall, and winter; and outdoor pursuits for mentally retarded and for &quot;disaffected&quot; students.

        "description":"Using aggregate data from several Idaho counties and towns, the study examined the economic forces which pressure small town people and merchants--pressures which ultimately shape and will shape small towns in areas like Idaho. Six towns chosen for intensive study were Priest River, Cottonwood, Riggins, Shoshone, Oakley, and Malad. Focusing on small towns and their businesses, the study examined the: regional economic theory (location and regional economics) by providing a spatial model of small towns; relationship between the range of goods and services and the town size; and relation between community size, migration, and the expenditure patterns of local governments by using cross-section county data. It was found that: costs of providing public services was related to  population changes, and local access to commercial goods and services was also closely related to population. The evidence on public services seemed to support the contention that small communities suffer from significant diseconomies of small scale and that outmigration imposes an additional burden of increased cost on those people who remain. Transportation improvements have allowed residents of a small town-based community to have better access to the goods and services of nearby larger towns. The elimination of jobs in the countryside has reduced the role of some small towns in line with the reduced population to be served. (NQ)",

        "description":"There are three major phases in the process of community development projected for the San Joaquin Valley's west side. The first phase involves agricultural experiments using different kinds of crops, agricultural techniques, and ownership arrangements. Beginning when enough people have returned to the land to create a demand for an expanded town, the second phase involves a population of up to 20,000 living and working on several tens of thousands of acres of land. The third phase invovles the overall regional development of the west side. Focusing on strategies for the second phase, this paper set out a long-term strategy for rural economic development; outlines a program for providing back-up services and the necessary community-building on the west side and discusses how  rural communities might be organized and financed, what services they can provide, and what benefits might accrue from the development process. Discussed are the: economic considerations affecting west side development; present agricultural strategies of the planning groups; prerequisites for new town development with land reform; basic effect of land reform; land financing effects; estimate of expanded town development costs; economics of profit and nonprofit new town development; financing the rural new town; community/local government partnership for the town; and transition phases--from Huron to the rural new town.

        "description":"Embodying a thoroughly grass-roots, democratic approach, the Native American Language Education (NALE) Project of D-Q University began operation during 1973-74. Local Native Americans are employed to work with the indigenous population in the local communities. Members of the local community are provided the time and opportunity to discuss, meet, and present their views, feelings, and opinions regarding the total language development process which occurs within their own community. The elderly people, who possess all the knowledge and wisdom of tribal language, culture, and history, are periodically contracted as professional consultants because of their tribal expertise, to correct, evaluate, and approve language materials before they are printed and distributed. In 1973-74  materials were prepared for, and disseminated to, a large audience comprised of Indian tribes across the country. Most staff effort was focused at the Papago in Arizona and the Zuni in New Mexico. By 1974-75 virtually all resources were focused at Papago and Zuni. This report includes: a summary of the historical and current situation of the Zuni and Papago peoples; discussions of the community development theory and the NALE project, and of the role of self-determination in language development; a description of the NALE project (background, philosophy, general objectives, and operation); and a brief discussion of the project evaluation.

These guarantees of Native rights are found in the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; sections of the Treaty of Guadalupe, the Mexican Constitution, California's 1850 Constitution, and the California Act for the Government and Protection of Indians; and various California Indians claims cases. Appended are two versions of the California bill AB 4239 (the one passed by the State Assembly only and the final version passed by the entire legislature). This bill resulted from a conference held at  D-Q University in late 1975 to develop legislation to protect Native American cemeteries and sacred places. Also appended is an opinion by the California State Attorney-General's Office summarizing the legal protections available for Native cemeteries under chapter 827, Statutes of 1971. This opinion covers: whether chapter 827 gives the task force created pursuant to its provisions the power to prevent the disturbance of native California Indian burial sites; whether the chapter authorizes the State to prevent such disturbances; and whether there is any provision of law other than chapter 827 which could be used to prevent the disturbance of such burial sites.

Data were derived from the total adult noninstitutionalized population of the U.S. (survey respondents were categorized as follows: 135 rural nonfarm, 343 rural farm, and 1,023 urban residents). An attempt was made to interrelate bivariate relationships identified in the literature search in a causal sequence  utilizing symbolic interactionism and Blau and Duncan's theory of intergenerational status transmission as the overall framework. The key variables reflecting model differences across residences were identified as: respondent's perceived financial situation at age sixteen, respondent's education, and respondent's general happiness for the rural nonfarm model; respondent's father's occupational prestige, respondent's general happiness and respondent's job satisfaction for the rural farm model; and respondent's education and general happiness for the urban model.

Classifying residents as rural farm, rural nonfarm, and urban, a determination was made of poverty level families in each county (number and percentage). Characteristics (62 variables) measuring county population by age and sex, numbers of males and females employed by occupational categories, income, and educational and marital status for the 3 sectors were examined, and then 10 of these variables were  examined in terms of migration. Results indicated: the incidence of disadvantagement was greatest in rural farm and rural nonfarm areas; family disadvantagement for the county as a whole prevailed in most of South Dakota; 1970 family disadvantagement was primarily a consequence of families with a female head and concentrations in the male labor force of farm managers and operatives; high outmigration between 1960 to 1970 was due to a high proportion of families with female heads and low employment for rural farm males either in high income employment sectors or as farm managers and operators.

Since Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas have had significant experience in this field and have moved forward in the development of policy and programs in the area of bilingual education, Project representatives from these states were asked to give presentations discussing the state-of-the-art of bilingual/multicultural education. Participants also visited the Institute of Texas Cultures and six local bilingual educational programs; listened to a group of junior high school students who shared their experience in crossing  racial barriers; and listened to a discussion of a unique and challenging program developed for the Bay City (Texas) Independent School District. Presentations covered bilingual education and evaluation problems, the Bureau of Indian Education, the &quot;Lau&quot; issue, language assessment and a sociolinguistic alternative to the Lau remedies, and the present state of bilingual education. This report gives the presentations and a synopsis of the other activities. Also included are the participants' responses to an evaluation of the seminar. (NQ)",

It is shown that it is possible to use the concept of intellectual independence to establish an observation  scheme for analyzing science teaching. Examples of the scheme in use are provided to demonstrate how science teaching can be described in terms of epistemological features. Using this approach, it is possible to make sound judgments about the intellectual quality of science teaching and to make logical predictions about the contribution such teaching can make to a learner's intellectual independence.

Two pairs of pupils from each of ten classes were recorded for a single class session using two independently operated portable videotape recorders while they participated in science activities. Transcripts of the tapes were coded using a classroom analysis scheme designed to reflect the process nature of the activities, to emphasize the notion of teacher control, to code physical actions, and to permit identification of individual pupils as both senders and receivers of communication. Among the results of the analysis of the tapes were that: (1)  teacher and pupils initiated approximately equal numbers of interventions; (2) long interventions, regardless of initiation, almost invariably ended with the teacher giving directions on procedures; and (3) the proportion of teacher talk was almost universally greater than for the two pupils combined.

A 2 X 3 design was used, with two levels of grouping: individuals and dyads, and with three levels of mental ability: high (H), high plus low (HL), and low (L). The experimental problem was to solve the riddle of the frozen wooly mammoth, which required the subject to hypothesize, request information, and form new hypotheses. An interactive computer assisted instruction system was used as a data source, feedback mechanism, and monitoring system. Eighty undergraduates participated. The dependent variables were: number of hypotheses; number of data requests; number of data matches; total times; time expended for hypothesis; and proportion  of positive, negative, and neutral information. A between-subjects ANOVA was used to analyze data. Results showed that H dyads requested significantly more data than H individuals, while L dyads received significantly fewer data matches than L individuals and HL dyads. H individuals spent significantly less time in the problem space than H dyads, and L individuals spent significantly more time than dyads. L subjects received significantly fewer instances of positive information, more neutral information, and spent more time reading neutral information than HL subjects of H subjects. H subjects received significantly more positive information, less neutral information, and spent less time reading the neutral information. (Author/DT)",

The preservice teacher's perception and performance of role expectations in the teaching of science, the preservice teacher's attitude toward science in the elementary classroom, and the preservice teacher's knowledge and performance in inquiry skills were the three areas explored. Students enrolled in two different pre-professional programs were involved in the study. The control group was from a more traditional program, emphasizing methods courses and student teaching. The experimental group involved a campus-based field experiences sequence as well as methods courses and student teaching. Several instruments were used for measurement in the areas of inquiry (process) skills, attitudes, and  teaching behaviors. Administration of instruments occurred before and after the science methods course and at the end of student teaching. It was noted that although mixed results were apparent, the major difference in methods course experiences occurred in the ability of students with field experience to more adequately model specific teaching roles when asked to do so. Other results and implications are discussed. (CS)",

Steps for building a general framework for curriculum planning are related to key questions which should be considered in applying this framework to an approach selected. Presented are characteristics of the major approaches to curriculum planning; i.e., the Social Demand approach, the Manpower approach, and the Cost-Benefit approach. The factors of demography, attitudes of social groups, governmental educational policy and expected rate of economic growth are considered in terms of curriculum planning. Methods of getting real costs of education and problems characteristic of rural and primary school education are discussed. Requirements (community support,  money, prepared teachers, and planning) of curriculum change are emphasized, and strategies for effecting curriculum change are outlined. The roles of the advisor and curriculum planner are defined. Finally, ten conditions that have been established for success in educational planning are listed. (CS)",

The purpose of this study was to condense this set of 35 statements into factors which were inherent to the set. A second purpose was to collapse the statements into fewer meaningful and manageable groups. The priority rankings given to each item by the respondents were analyzed through four factor analytical procedures. The first analysis indicated that there were six factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 underlying the 35 research statements. When the number of factors which could develop was limited to six, the nature of one factor changed somewhat because of a shift in the item loadings. When only five factors were  allowed to develop, this factor disappeared and the items in it loaded on several other factors. The five factors which remained were identifiable in the initial analysis and the six-factor limited analysis. When the factor was limited to four, the nature of the factors was much more ambiguous because of shifting items. (Author/MH)",

A total of 154 seventh-grade students from six classes completed a five-week block of instruction in earth science composed of units on earth motion, latitude and longitude, and map skills. Teachers were provided with performance objectives, diagnostic progress tests, unit tests, learning materials, and activities. Students were stratified on three levels of aptitude and randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: (1) control; (2) teacher-directed remedial work; and (3) student-directed remedial work. Achievement and retention data were analyzed using a  3 X 3 (aptitude X treatment) analysis of variance with quantitative scores from the Iowa Test of Basic Skills as covariates. Both groups of students receiving diagnostic tests scored significantly higher than the control group. Significant differences were found between the two groups of students that received teacher- or self-guided remediation on only one unit. Analysis of the retention test data showed that initial differences measured were not apparent after a two-month span. (MH)",

It was hypothesized that males will receive significantly higher mean scores than females on all measures; that field-independent subjects will receive significantly higher scores than field-dependent subjects on all measures; that sex, when controlled for all background variables, will not contribute significantly to mean scores on measures of formal thought; and that the factor structure among Piagetian measures of formal thought will show &quot;written&quot; and &quot;manipulative&quot; factors for females, but not for males. The main battery of measures consisted of twelve tasks, eight clinical and four  written, intended to measure three Piagetian schemata: proportions, combinations and permutations, and correlations and probability. The Embedded Figures Test was administered individually as a measure of field-dependence-independence. Statistical analysis of results confirms the first two hypotheses. Rejection of the third hypothesis is discussed, and it is noted that sex and field-dependence appear to operate independently in influencing analytical problem-solving ability. As for the fourth hypothesis, no tendency was revealed for written and clinical tasks to separate into discrete factors for either males or females. (CS)",

This report contains a brief description of the OWN program, a discussion of the work required to implement the program beyond the single-school pilot phase, and an evaluation of the effect of the program in the nine schools. The evaluation of the OWN program was conducted by comparing the performance of students from the nine schools using the OWN program to performance of students from four schools using a traditional approach. All students were given a pretest and posttest developed specifically for this investigation. The test results showed  that in each grade (3-6), students using the OWN program made significantly greater improvements than did students in the traditional approach. Benefits of the program were substantial for third and fourth grade OWN students who had scored below average on the pretest; these students averaged from 3.6 to 4.2 months gain. When teachers' attitudes toward the OWN program were examined using a Likert-type questionnaire, 87% of the teachers expressed a favorable overall opinion of the OWN program and 90% responded that their students enjoyed working with the program.

Subjects recorded their confidence in their answers for both practice and test items, along with the amount of time they spent studying the practice feedback (in CA and AI conditions). On practice items, AI feedback produced greater confidence than NF. The subjects' confidence increased after the first six (out of eighteen) practice items. More time was spent on feedback following an incorrect response than a correct response, and this difference increased as confidence increased. For a correct answer, time decreased as confidence increased and overall, more time was spent on AI  feedback than CA feedback. For an incorrect answer, this direction reversed for AI and CA feedback conditions from medium to high confidence. On the test, AI and CA feedback conditions had more correct answers and higher confidence than the control NF group. Implications for the design of instruction are discussed. (Author/DT)",

The inadequacies associated with energy alternatives to petroleum, such as coal and nuclear fusion, are identified and discussed. Thus, society is left with only the solar options: wind, falling water, biomass, and direct sunlight. The historical development, technology, and current status of each of the solar options is detailed. The social and political ramifications of the conversion to a society based on solar energy are  hypothesized. The author concludes that the conversion to solar energy is technically feasible, economically sound, and environmentally attractive. (BT)",

He was assisted by a team of teachers and graduate students at Teachers College, Columbia, in New York. His materials were unique in being: (1) the first nationally developed social studies materials; (2) the first social studies materials developed specifically for junior high school students; and (3) the first curriculum materials to compile data from a diverse team of experts. The materials reached their zenith of popularity in the  late 1920s and early 1930s and were frequently revised within those years so that their topical quality would be maintained. Rugg's materials reflected his concern for training students to deal intelligently with the problems of a changing society. Although they have been criticized for being based on insufficient research, their conceptual structure is considered to be excellent. (Author/MK)",

Senior class members of the P.K. Yonge Laboratory School in Gainesville, Florida and four teachers participated in the community involvement project. The purposes of the project were to help students increase their communication and independent study skills; gain a better understanding of community life; and appreciate the contributions of people of various ages, backgrounds, and occupations. Project implementation included communication with  parents, community members, and students about the program. Student responsibilities included biweekly reporting of activities and findings to a seminar, preparation of a resource bibliography, a final presentation, and a project notebook. Students, teachers, and community participants assessed the program. Findings indicated that students believe the program improved their job performance and community awareness and that teachers and community participants viewed the program as a valuable experience.

Intended as a profile of an administrator whose personal accomplishments broadened American education, the study is also a history of progressive and vocational education in Chicago during the early 20th century. Characterized as a woman who worked against factionalism and divisiveness, Ella Young was described by Jane Addams as possessing superior intelligence and character. The account of her life and career is based on newspaper sources, published and unpublished archival material, and manuscript collections. The study is presented in six sections. Section I describes her early background as the youngest child of hardworking parents of Scottish descent and her training  as a teacher. Section II discusses her association with John Dewey at the University of Chicago Lab School from 1899-1904. In section III, the stage is set for her 1909 appointment to the superintendency of the Chicago City School System. Sections IV and V, which contain the bulk of the paper, explore the role she played during her years as head administrator of the second largest school system in the country and discuss her attempts to expand the manual arts curriculum, upgrade teacher's salaries, and provide educational opportunity for all interested students. Section VI describes her retirement years. References are included. (Author/DB)",

General criticism of the expository nature of 80% of the material reviewed is that it emphasizes passivity and does not stimulate  student interest or analytic thought. The inquiry method, although more interesting to students, does not generally convey basic information and is often hampered by legal and social science jargon. Case studies and role playing are the two most promising inquiry methods for teaching civic and legal education, although they often lack diversity and sufficient detail.

        "description":"The influence of social science research on educational policy, particularly since the 1954 Brown vs Board of Education decision, has been significant. The paper presents an historical overview of the judicial use of social science data. Three questions are investigated: to what extent has social science influenced judicial decision-making? what has been the evolution of social science as a contributor of evidence to desegregation litigation? and what place will social science play in the future? Legal decisions relating to these concerns are reviewed. Questions are raised regarding the competency of legal officials and policy makers to interpret the data, the utility of research findings for the court when they do not have the entire support of the academic or scientific  community, the validity of the research, and the bias of the researcher. The influence of social science research has been most apparent in areas of desegregation, the provision of educational opportunities for children from low income families, and the reform of state educational systems with an eye toward easing the burden of the local property taxpayer. The conclusion is that lawyers and social scientists can play valuable roles in policy making if lawyers concentrate on determining what is relevant in litigation and social scientists on what of the relevant is reliably known.

        "description":"The theory that organizations are ideological inventions of the human mind is discussed. Organizational science is described as an ideology which is based upon social concepts and experiences. The main justification for organizational theory is that it attempts to answer why we behave as we do in social organizations. Ways in which ideas and concepts shape assumptions about organizations and organizational behavior are presented. For example, social scientists often base their research upon a vision of reality which holds no greater truth than alternate views. Social scientists must understand different individual realities if they are to make generalized statements about the social structure and provide a link between experience and reality. A review of relevant sociological  literature by C. Wright Mills, Erving Goffman, Anselm Strauss and others is presented. Particular attention is paid to the writings of Max Weber who maintained that social scientists should be aware of their own values and assumptions in order to guard against self-deception and the deception of others. The conclusion is that organizational theory should consider the nature and objectives of organizations and expand the interpretation of social reality rather than attempting to control it or argue for a single interpretation of that reality.

Focus is on problems of the urban and suburban school student. It is designed to help students overcome problems of inexperience which can hamper sincere group expression. Seven chapters discuss specific aspects of organizing. Chapter one discusses how and why to plan a strategy before beginning to organize. Thorough knowledge of the issues is stressed. Various tactics outlined in Chapter two include building a power base (leafleting), threatening the people in power (picketing), and appealing to the good will of people (petitioning). Chapters three and four suggest ways of organizing small groups and student unions; and define  needed skills such as fundraising, mimeographing, power structure research, using media, contacting lawyers, and running meetings. Selection of issues through student polling is discussed in Chapter five, followed by examples of issues based on ageism and sexism in Chapter six. Repression, apathy, transience, and racial and class divisions are among the problems reviewed in Chapter seven. To illustrate certain points, examples are drawn from successful and nonsuccessful student experiences. The pamphlet concludes with an annotated bibliography of 22 related books and magazines. (AV)",

        "description":"The relationship between external reinforcement of behavior and depression is explored. Specifically, the psychological study measures the role of cognition in depression by comparing decision-making problems, lack of assertiveness, and perceptions of control in male and female undergraduate college students and psychiatric patients. It was hypothesized that the expectancy of external control would be associated with decision-making difficulty, choice inconsistency, depression, and lack of assertiveness. Procedure included administering decision-making and choice inconsistency tests to a sample of 102 college students and measures of depression and lack of assertiveness to additional samples of college students and psychiatric patients. Results indicated that externality was  consistently and, often, significantly correlated in the predicted direction with decision-making, depression, and assertiveness. However, this relationship seemed to vary in intensity across sex and situation. Thus, it was concluded that externality in males is associated with decision-making difficulty and choice inconsistency, while externality in females is more closely associated with depression and lack of assertiveness. Implications of these data for the treatment of externally controlled clients through cognitive restructuring and training of specific behavioral skills are discussed. (Author/DB)",

Initially, religion was the one social institution which gave black slaves a common tie before the Civil War. Baptist and Methodist ideologies provided emotional messages of salvation, and Bible stories told orally appealed to the slaves' aspirations for freedom and liberation. After the Civil War black churches became institutionalized. They increased their efforts to improve quality of life by establishing colleges, insurance companies, and political groups. In recent years, black churches have placed more emphasis on economic, social, and political problems than on otherworldly concerns of  salvation. Two groups can now be identified: storefront churches and more traditional, institutionalized churches. The author suggests that the black church increase its role of leadership in directing blacks toward a high spiritual quality of life which may not necessarily be the same as the modern American materialistic approach to life.

        "description":"Complete career patterns for a sample of immigrant men were studied to determine what factors influenced occupational decisions and the type and status of the jobs which the men obtained. A sample of 202 Polish, Italian, and other immigrant men in Rome, New York, provided three groups for comparison. Residential and occupational information were obtained from city directories and school attendance records of their children. Occupational titles were standardized into four categories: unskilled; operator, clerical and sales; craftsmen and foremen; and professional and managerial. Data indicate significant residential segregation by ethnic group; none of the immigrant fathers held professional jobs, although small percentages were store managers; Italian children remained in school  for the shortest amount of time, yet obtained higher job status than did Poles; and career growth often came through midcareer job changes. These findings suggest that traditional career education job models, which show a long period of development in one job, are not appropriate for immigrant children. Also, additional scholarship funds should be available for adults to return to school for further training or education. (Author/AV)",

Intended as a means of raising the level of professional consciousness and giving practical guidance to curriculum developers, the paper discusses the relationship of prejudice, bias, and self-reference to educational and scientific research. Section I describes the theorem of natural selection in professional practices which encourages professionals, such as curriculum designers, to adopt role behaviors appropriate to their favored social status. Section II presents information on selecting the set of practices within a given profession which will be most acceptable to the dominant class. The conclusion is that curriculum researchers and  designers must reject the dominant class influence and consciously choose those curricular practices which will enable pupils to liberate themselves from oppressive sociopolitical influences. Suggestions for further research include: (1) investigation of how the remedial reading and testing movement replaced progressive ideas in curriculum research and practice, (2) identification of psychologically effective and politically feasible alternatives within the existing school framework, and (3) extension of educational efforts outside the school.

The classroom environment was broken down into three domains: authority function of the teacher, friendship function of the teacher, and student-student relationships. These areas of the classroom environment were assessed by the Classroom Environment Scale, a 90-item forced choice student-answered scale which purports to measure nine dimensions of the classroom. Data from this scale were gathered in five types of high schools in Connecticut: urban, suburban, rural, vocational, and alternative high schools. Over 6,000 students participated in the study. Statistical analysis of the data  showed that alternative schools have strong peer and teacher relationships; vocational schools are low in the area of teacher support; urban and alternative schools are highly task oriented; vocational schools emphasize competition; and suburban schools are low in teacher authority and rule clarity. Because of the differences in environments, one can infer that students at the various schools undergo different socialization experiences and have different socialization outcomes. (Author/AV",

Under apartheid blacks and whites attend separate schools which prepare them for continued segregation in social and economic spheres. There are four educational systems: the blacks (Bantu) are administered by the national Department of Bantu Education, the coloureds (Mulattos) by the Coloured People's Representative Council, Asians by the Department of Asian Affairs, and whites by four provincial administrations. All students seven to 16 years of age must attend school, and all must learn both official languages, English and Afrikaans. Teachers must be of the same race as the system they teach in. The student-teacher ratio of blacks is  almost three times that of whites. Most black teachers have only junior certification (10th grade achievement) whereas all white teachers have graduated from high school and almost half have university degrees. Two major problems in teaching are the overabundance of women teachers and the increasing percentage of secondary teachers who teach courses for which they have had no training. Financial support varies dramatically within the educational systems: state spending per capita for whites is almost 18 times the amount spent for blacks. South Africa has 15 universities. Three are black; only one offers courses in both English and Afrikaans. Currently, efforts are being made to encourage teaching in native languages at elementary and secondary levels. (AV)",

Topics discussed include demographic evaluation systems, psychological consequences of population change, family formation and marital relationships in population research, and personal communication and population research. Methodological and theoretical issues are treated in Part II. Discussed are methods used in forecasting family  planning behavior; multiple-regression and facet techniques used in population research; test-retest reliability; preliminary findings in birth planning values and decisions; social and psychological determinants of fertility intentions; values and demographic conditions in attitudes on population policy; psychological determinants of nuptiality; and fertility choice behavior. The book ends with a brief look at educational issues in Part III, discussing the development of psychologists for work in the population field. (Author/RM)",

Using 18 activities, students trace their origins, assess the importance of ethnicity in their own lives, and document ethnic diversity in their community. Objectives in three areas are emphasized: discovery skills, values and value analysis, and recognition and knowledge about ethnic heritage and related concepts. Each activity is identified by one or more organizing concepts, such as perception, diversity, and heritage. Teaching strategies include group discussion, role playing, interviewing relatives, and spending time with people of different cultural backgrounds. Focus ranges from personal documentation of family traditions to awareness of stereotypes of  unfamiliar groups. Students are encouraged to use local resources such as telephone books to map the ethnicity of their community. Also, they answer personal attitude questionnaires about their reactions to belonging to particular ethnic groups. The units can be used as supplementary activities in social studies courses, or they can serve as a two-week intensive program on ethnic heritage. The developers caution teachers not to force personal ethnic analysis on students who are unwilling. (AV)",

George Rogers Clark was a frontier hero of the American Revolution who explored and conquered territory in Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois. The multimedia exhibit is open to the public from February 25, 1976 through February 25, 1979, the 200th anniversary of Clark's victory at Vincennes. Supplemented by several auxiliary displays and changing exhibits, the story is told in two major galleries. It follows Clark from his boyhood in Virginia, through his early years in Kentucky, and finally his return to Williamsburg where he received secret orders to attack the British outposts in the Old Northwest. The pamphlet combines the biographical story of  Clark's expeditions with photos and sketches of his military equipment, clothing, and significant events in his life. Clark's compass, surveying measuring chains, belt buckles and swords are illustrated. Reconstructions of forts and garrisons are shown. Dioramas illustrate Clark's treaties with Indians and his most famous campaigns against the British. In addition to this pamphlet, outreach programs of the exhibit include a filmed tour of the exhibit and primary and secondary school teaching units and film strips. (Author/AV)",

Entering freshmen, as well as students who have declared majors, are encouraged to read the handbook in order to decide if they want to pursue academic study in the fields of English and social science. Thirteen career areas are analyzed, including advertising, banking, business, broadcasting, journalism, real estate, public relations, research, and travel. Within each area, a variety of specific jobs are described. For example, within the field of broadcasting possible jobs are program director, staff announcer, newscaster, broadcast technician, general manager, sales representative, and press  writer. For each career area and for almost every job, the handbook defines the field or job, describes requirements for academic and experiential background, estimates salary ranges, and provides information about relevant information sources such as the National Association of Broadcasters. Useful editorial comments alert students to special aspects of certain jobs. For example, manufacturers' sales representatives should have highly competitive personalities. The handbook concludes with a bibliography of 39 books, pamphlets, and articles. (AV)",

        "description":"The author provides a global review of family planning techniques and their impact on national birth rates. Sterilization, the pill, and intrauterine devices are the most popular methods of contraception worldwide. Abortion, where it is legal, is also extremely popular. In countries such as the United States where population control is not an urgent concern, there is a need to educate young people about contraception, make devices readily available, and eliminate the social stigma that birth control is an untouchable subject. In developing countries with critical population problems, family planning action is required on several fronts. Decentralized programs have shown greatest success. These programs combine increased supply of devices and motivation in the form of peer  reinforcement and educational efforts. When a variety of contraceptives is made available, people seem more willing to participate in family planning because coercion by community or government seems less rigid. The author describes in detail successful programs in China which are the responsiblity of small groups in factories and villages. Tight community bonds are instrumental in their success. Funding needs and agencies for global birth control are discussed, as well as changing attitudes of national governments. (AV)",

Three hundred ninety-one seventh and eighth graders from suburban and rural areas of Cherokee County, Georgia, participated in the study. Two rating scales were developed from responses to an open-ended questionnaire which asked students to list their likes and dislikes about social studies. The two rating scales, containing eight and ten items each, were administered to the students. Item format was a statement, such as, &quot;I like social studies when the study of current events is emphasized in class.&quot; Students marked agreement or disagreement on a scale of one to five. Analysis of responses shows that, in terms of content, students prefer social geography, social  history, current events, and culturally-oriented areas of social studies. In terms of methodology, students prefer discussion type classes, films and filmstrips, interesting and readable texts, and no homework. The author points out that educators should not make curriculum and methods decisions based on student preference only, but he does believe results of student surveys such as this should be taken into consideration.

The study is based upon a 1975 survey of member states of the Council of Europe and upon a 1973 symposium on pupil participation and co-responsibility in decisions concerning school activities. Presented in eight chapters, the report discusses aims, key points, general tendencies, and future prospects of participation in Austria, Cyprus, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Scotland, Spain, and Turkey. Participation by students, parents, teachers, staff, and interested representatives at the local, regional, and national levels is assessed. The two main obstacles to participation identified in the survey of these countries are authority and lack of communication. Four recommendations  are proposed in response to these obstacles: (1) modification of central educational authority, (2) training of potential participants, (3) circulation of information on educational problems, and (4) truer representation of constituencies by parent and student delegates to educational committees. Two basic principles widely proclaimed by participating countries are pupil-centered education and equality of opportunity. The conclusion is that participation is steadily increasing and will continue to increase if unhampered by central educational authorities. Survey questionnaires, replies, and case studies are presented in the appendix. (Author/DB)",

The content pattern for grades 8-12 provides opportunities for greater in-depth studies of the United States and the various cultural areas of the world, using a discipline approach, including  history, economics, political science, sociology, geography, and anthropology. Examples of implementing both a chronological and a thematic approach are provided as guides.

        "description":"Some practical ways to improve reading skills in social studies classes without sacrificing content objectives and goals are presented. It is emphasized that social studies teachers are best suited to teach reading skills in their own subject field. Social studies teachers need to focus on three reading skills: vocabulary development and word recognition skills, comprehension skills, and study skills. To make a conscious effort to help students improve reading skills, several methods are suggested for gaining an information base about students reading ability. These include use of standardized tests of reading ability; informal surveys of students' reading habits; and content inventory consisting of reading passages followed by questions about the main ideas, inference, and  details. The cloze technique, in which students fill in blanks in a reading passage, indicates student understanding of the central idea as well as vocabulary development. Students' reading gaps can be determined by comparing their reading ability with textbook readability based on the Fry scale. Effective teaching techniques to improve content reading are discussed. These include purposeful reading directed by teachers' prereading questions and discussion, and the SQ3R method (survey, question, read, recite, review). Directed reading activity, in which teachers guide students through reading assignments, is recommended. In addition, students should keep vocabulary notebooks. (Author/AV)",

Films can be used to illustrate concepts or historical events, communicate the essence of foreign cultures, and enliven dull textbook content. Five types of films are described including educational films (narrated surveys or overviews), dramatic reenactments, and motion picture \"mirror\" films of the times in which they were made. Films with little or no narration are excellent for inquiry and hypothesis formation. Films on issues promote class discussion. Sources of films range from public libraries to school and university film libraries. Addresses of over 50 sources are listed for free films, feature films,  and firms which supply school districts. Teachers are reminded to order films well in advance. Suggestions for pre- and post-film viewing are presented. Projectors should be checked. A lesson plan should be developed to introduce and follow through the film's theme. On any given topic, students might be asked to identify issues given different emphasis in the film and in their textbooks. Rerunning segments of films can help during class summary discussion. Teachers are encouraged to keep a file of their evaluations of individual films. (AV)",

        "description":"The author discusses uses and sources of photographs as effective teaching aids in social studies classrooms. Pictures are not new among learning resources, but they adapt well to new focuses in social studies education. One third of the pamphlet explains how photographs can enhance learning. They can promote discovery learning, concept development, and affective as well as cognitive learning. They are useful resources for independent and ethnic studies projects. Situations are described in which photographs clarify values, reinforce learning, correct stereotypes, promote good self-images in children, and stimulate quiet students. Free sources of photographs include old textbooks, travel bureaus, family pictures from trips, embassies, and local and state libraries. Magazines,  books, and study prints can be purchased specifically for pictorial study. Over 30 such resources are identified by title and publisher. Teachers are encouraged to mount pictures so they will last, keep files easily accessible, and cross-reference files to get greater use from the contents. Provocative questions for indepth study of pictures are suggested. The pamphlet concludes with a list of manufacturers of inexpensive cameras and film, and a bibliography of 15 books on the use of pictures. (AV)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to speculate about the relationship between societal change as presented by the women's movement, geography, and trends in education. Its thesis is that by looking at geographic teaching as an institutional response to a social revolution, a model for educational change can be developed on a much larger scale. Three approaches are presented for integrating awareness of women's issues with effective geography instruction. A basic approach is discussed which involves elimination of sexist behaviors and texts from the classroom. A checklist for avoiding sexist behavior and sexism in curriculum development accompanies this discussion. Changing course content to include supplementary information on women is described as a second approach. Although there is  a dearth of published material about women, course content can be adapted to include issues such as economic trends or migration patterns among women. A third approach involves a new perspective on learning with focus on student inquiry and research. The authors include a brainstorming outline and resultant course description which they developed for a college-level course called &quot;Geographic Perspectives on Women.&quot; According to their own particular interests, students individually identify patterns, institutions, and characteristics of women. Then as a group they establish research topics involving techniques such as regionalization or investigation of complex causality through case studies. Students receive feedback on individual projects and reports from the instructor to complete the  learning process. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This report presents the childbearing experience and fertility expectations of American women based on data collected in the June, 1976, Current Population Survey. Survey findings include the birth expectations of young single women who, as they marry, will contribute a major portion of the births in the United States within a few years. An introductory section summarizes significant trends. Of the 13.5 million future births expected by 18 to 24 year old white women reporting in the survey, over one-half are expected to be contributed by currently single women, and 43% by currently married women. The fertility rate has dropped in women 18 to 24 years of age from 3.1 in the early 1960 to 2.1 in 1976. This may be due to temporary postponement of childbearing on the part of young  wives. For married women of all races 14 to 34 years old in 1971, fertility rates for the five years ending in 1976 are about 88% of the rates expected for that period in 1971. For comparable age groups, single black women have significantly higher levels of childbearing than do single white women. Data indicate an inverse relationship between fertility and educational attainment. The bulk of the report consists of tables of data. Two appendices define terms such as &quot;birth cohort&quot; and &quot;parity&quot; and review the source and reliability of data presented in the report. (Author/AV)",

        "author":["Silvestri, Gary"],
        "description":"This paper highlights the developments in teaching methods in China in the era of the post-Cultural Revolution, and explains how these methods grew out of educational experimentation during the Yenan period. The Yenan period followed the historic &quot;long march, &quot;when Mao Tse-tung and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) established their base in Shensi province. At that time, a school was established characterized by political education, firm leadership, integration of theory with practice, and simplified curriculum. The basic method of teaching was the enlightenment method, an inquiry process involving initial questions and group discussion to develop answers. Many of these practices are now prevalent in Chinese schools. Political education stressing Maoist teachings is of primary  importance and begins in the fourth grade. Schools are run by workers, revolutionary cadres, and local PLA Units. Curriculum is related to needs of individual communities. Productive labor is emphasized as well as book learning, a concept which helps produce a classless society. The teacher's authority is not absolute; traditional respect for teachers' intellectual superiority is no longer acceptable. This has created a need to re-educate teachers to have an ideological outlook consistent with Maoist tenets. Problems arising from this change include class discipline and blending Maoist thought into all lesson content. (Author/AV)",

The tapes used were vignettes of persons demonstrating specific teaching skills in the areas of lesson organization, questioning, using student ideas, praise and corrective feedback, and variety and variation in teaching styles. Ninety-six subjects were assigned to one of four groups. All groups were pretested and posttested with identical measures. For each of the five topics, the treatment groups were: tapes only; tapes plus instruction; instruction only; and control. It was hypothesized that preservice teachers who receive instruction and view protocol tapes will score significantly higher on related posttests than teachers who only receive  instruction or who only view tapes. An unexpected consequence of this study was the finding that the control group, which received neither verbal nor visual instruction related to the topics of the tapes, performed just as well on related posttests as groups that did receive such instruction. The results of this study support the contention that no generalizations can be made concerning the effectiveness of media in instruction and that each type of media must be evaluated individually.

One homeroom group of twenty-five students was observed in interaction with nine teachers of math, English, social studies, and science over a one-year period to elicit both quantifiable and qualitative data. Classroom observation techniques included sequential records of student-teacher interaction, running accounts of student behavior, and a questionnaire describing student attitudes toward school and self. Pupils were surveyed in September, mid-January, and late May. In mid-January, teachers were given descriptive information based upon the observation data, including information about pupil attention rates, the quantity of  teacher-initiated interaction, student-initiated interaction, disciplinary comments, praise, criticism, and extended interaction. General teacher reaction to this type of nonevaluative, descriptive feedback was extremely receptive, though each teacher's reaction and behavior change during the second semester was different, as illustrated in separate vignettes of each. Teachers expressed a desire for more frequent feedback and seemed eager to establish a dialogue with the observer-researcher. The observation-feedback method used was viewed as generally useful for improving the ability of teachers to improve classroom life. (MB)",

        "description":"This study documents the kinds of planning that teachers engage in before a lesson begins and identifies differences in planning procedures between teachers. The subjects were 40 second- and fifth-grade teachers in California including 20 teachers with high average pupil gain scores and 20 teachers with low average pupil gain scores. The teachers were provided with special curriculum materials for one lesson in reading and one in mathematics and were asked to adapt these materials for use in their own classoooms. Each teacher planned and conducted a 20-minute lesson in each subject area. Patterns of similarities and differences in response to the lesson planning task were identified. Teachers varied in specificity, format, and types of information included in written plans, used  behavioral goals rarely, made more specific than general statements, and referred frequently to cognitive aspects of the lesson. No teachers mentioned seating arrangements, though it was obvious from observation of their lessons that seating arrangements were a planned aspect of most lessons. Comparative data on seating arrangements indicates some significant differences between teachers with high and low pupil gain scores--teachers with low pupil gain scores showed a tendency to be inattentive to the appropriateness or comfort of physical arrangements of their pupils. Teachers with high pupil gain scores showed a greater attention to cognitive aspects of lessons and were the only ones to develop original behavioral objectives; teachers with low pupil gain scores tended to think in  generalities rather than specifics.

It is recognized that the teacher-learner process is more than what is consciously taught in the school curriculum. What each person takes into the situation, such matters as personality, attitudes, expectations, socioeconomic status, and sex, has an effect on what is learned. Young children in the early years of schooling tend to model a teacher's behavior and to accept the teacher's assessment of them. High expectations, respect, and supportive behavior on the part of the teacher will elicit high achievement on the part of the child. On the other hand, a teacher may unintentionally reveal a subtle dislike or indifference to a child that can have a  highly detrimental effect on the child's learning achievement. The conclusion is reached that a teacher's attitude and overt behavior has a powerful effect on the learning process and that teachers should be aware of the influence of their own biases, personality traits, and expectations.

The program enabled faculty and staff unable to take a leave of absence to maintain their present position while participating in the program. Although each participant's plan of studies was individualized, certain elements of the program were shared: (1) a professional core of seminars and laboratory studies in higher education; (2) a series of institutes, tutorials, conferences, externships, and discussions with outside experts, agency  heads, and other personnel; and (3) formal training in doctoral-level research and evaluation activities, including the design and outline of a dissertation. As a basis for designing the individual plans of study and research, each participant was required to pass a qualifying examination early in the program. Upon successful completion of the individual plan of study, exclusive of the dissertation, some students elected to receive a certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies and terminated their participation at that point. The program was termed a success by both the participants from FCC and the VPI &amp; SU staff. (MM)",

The subjects participated individually prescribed learning activities, which involved small-group interactions directed toward the growth and development of perceptual skills, perceptual-motor skills and self-concepts, and interpersonal skills. The activities were implemented through a multi-faceted reading program, which served as a foundation for daily instruction and permitted the children to learn through their perceptual strengths. This training was integrated into the reading program. One hour of remediating activities was provided each day to meet each child's most serious area of perceptual weakness. Throughout the program the children were given a  battery of diversified tests and were constantly reevaluated. The findings indicated that children with learning disabilities can make startling progress when placed in an individualized program of instruction and continuing evaluation. The implications for placing learning-disabled children in regular classrooms are discussed. The conclusion is reached that if &quot;mainstreaming&quot; such children is to be an effective alternative, an individualized program of instruction and continuing evaluation is essential to the child and vital to the teacher, who is charged with the responsibility for the child's learning. Educators must build evaluation into all their programs dealing with learning-disabled children enrolled in special and regular classes. (JD)",

        "description":"An investigation was conducted to determine the effects of a modularized version of the Miltz (1971) &quot;How to Explain Program&quot; upon preservice elementary teachers enrolled in an educational foundations course, utilizing pupil performance as an indicator of explaining effectiveness. Specific objectives were to determine if: (1) use of the &quot;How to Explain Program&quot; results in higher teacher scores on a measure of explaining knowledge than no instruction in explaining; (2) elementary pupil concept attainment scores are affected by whether or not preservice teachers received the &quot;How to Explain Program&quot;; (3) a relationship exists between preservice teacher scores on a test of explaining knowledge and pupil mean scores on a concept attainment measure. Thirty-five preservice teachers  were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group and require to teach a hypothetical geometric concept lesson to randomly selected groups of elementary pupils. Preservice teachers were tested for knowledge of explaining, and elementary pupils were tested for concept attainment. Pupils taught by the treatment group exhibited higher concept attainment scores than those taught by the control group. Treatment group preservice teachers also performed better on a test of explaining knowledge. No significant relationship was obtained between explaining and concept attainment scores. (Author)",

        "description":"The work-study team concept has evolved from a Teacher Corps grant to Stanford School of Education and Herbert Hoover Junior High School, San Jose, California, and represents the basic vehicle of the project for collaboration between the university and school in providing more effective inservice education, school improvement, and field-based research. Eight work-study teams were organized: four concerned with the subject areas of mathematics, language arts, social studies, and physical education; four &quot;innovation teams&quot; dealt with multicultural education, bilingual education, teaching in open space, and community involvement. Four of the teams were relatively successful, two remained functioning through the year, and two effectively disbanded before the end of the year for lack  of support or interest. Two of the more serious difficulties were goal definition, and trust and leadership. Positive experience suggested that collaboration is possible if: (1) decisions affecting the school community are made by the school-staff team members; (2) time is invested in developing good team relations; (3) team members are willing to assume new roles; and (4) concrete, immediate problems provide the initial focus for collaboration. Limitations of the concept involve (1) the length of time needed to develop trust and credibility, (2) individual differences in team member capacities for dealing with competing goals, (3) the capability for stimulating unperceived staff development needs, and (4) practical limitations involving participant involvement, incentives, physical  distances, scheduling etc. Guidelines for determining the need for and organizing effective teams and for ensuring their continuing effectiveness have been appended.

        "description":"Research was conducted upon relationships between students' conceptual level (CL) and form of course organization (high/low structure) as it affects student attainment of course objectives. In addition, feelings toward the training organization were observed. Synectics training was conducted in which thirty-six undergraduate teacher trainees were paired as to conceptual level and divided into two groups, one receiving a high structure training format in which learning activities, sequence, and pace were determined by the instructor, the other receiving low structure training in a student-centered format. Existence was hypothesized for (1) a positive relationship between CL and performance in low structure treatment; (2) no relationship or a negative relationship between CL and  performance in high structure treatment; (3) a negative relationship between CL and feelings toward training in low structure treatment; and (4) a negative relationship between CL and feelings toward training in high structure treatment. Posttesting revealed a high consonance between subjects' performance of the Synectics teaching model and their feelings toward training, regardless of treatment, though performance and feelings were somewhat higher under conditions of high structure than under conditions of low structure. Likely factors for explaining this discrepancy between predicted findings and the results are inadequate control of intervening variables, weakness of instrumentation, nature of the task, design of treatments, and/or limitations of theory. Debriefing of the subjects  revealed a preference for low structure treatment and agreement upon the value of peer teaching, demonstration lessons, video-tape use, and other teaching techniques used in the research.

The main findings of this review is that, while guides for developing performance specifications abound, research into the utility of such procedures is minimal. The same situation prevails with research concerning the evaluation of instructional products. Two basic problems, which must be solved before adequate empirical data may be accumulated, concerning D&amp;E models are: (1) just what constitutes  a development or evaluation model, and how can one identify and adequately describe such models; and (2) what are the actual purposes for using development and evaluation models in materials development. As researchers begin to address these questions and use them to focus their work, better evidence will come to light regarding the utility of using models in the development and evaluation of instructional products.

Unexpectedly, students whose teacher did not support them indicated that they felt they had gained more peer support than students whose teacher did support them. Students in the cooperative learning structure indicated that they had more peer support and had higher expectations about the decision-making experience. They did not indicate significantly greater confidence or commitment to  making the decision than did students in the competitive learning structure.

Violence, vandalism, and anti-social behavior on the part of students created a situation in which teachers spent more time keeping order in the classroom than in actual teaching. The practicum was set up as an inservice education project with the aim of changing teacher behavior in the classroom and thereby changing children's behavior. Teacher training sessions, in which teachers were encouraged to explore their classroom behaviors in order to begin establishing a helping/supportive relationship with students, were the basic elements of the project. Continuing evaluation and examination of personal attitudes were encouraged. Performance of students and changes in  their behavior were observed, and tests were conducted before and after the three-month project. Emphasis was placed upon teachers establishing a sensitivity to the problems of the students and reacting to them in a helpful way. The practicum established that teacher behavior affects the learning situation, that teacher behavior can be changed, and that the change can improve student learning.

Conclusions indicate that strenuous physical activity has beneficial effects in the physiological development of the child, which apparently carries over into adulthood and that physical activity is needed for normal growth and development.

Extrinsic pressure arises from ongoing societal change in the face of a dichotomy between educational theory and practice. Intrinsic pressures for change evolve from the need for constant renewal of institutions and individuals in order to remain interesting and creative. Specific issues complicating change procedures include (1) a limited knowledge base concerning the process, effectiveness, and relevance of particular educational changes; (2) the ethos and milieu of the educational profession, strongly supportive of continuity; (3) the  inertia of organizational and mental structures; (4) questionable transferability of innovative procedures from one field situation to another; and (5) the question of ideological intent--planners and classroom teachers more often than not prefer merely to tinker with the educational system rather than to introduce substantive change.

School systems are examined from a sociological point of view. The nature and status of teaching is explored within the framework of the school as a social system operating in the wider arena of the community. (JD)",

        "description":"In this speech the subject of eroding public confidence in the public schools is discussed. Elected school boards and school administrators quite frequently do not solve the problems facing the schools, and this failure is often because of lack of communication with the public and lack of citizen participation in decisions affecting school governance. A strong and rising force in the school system is the emergence of powerful teacher organizations, often oriented toward self-interest and politically effective. The result is that teacher organizations have acquired significant control of public education, and other local forces have either acquiesced or been disenfranchised. The problem is complicated by the fact that many school administrators are members of teacher  organizations, or are sympathetic past members. Participation in school governance is a right of every citizen affected and should not be discouraged. With the decline of citizen participation there is the danger of significant growth in state influence and control, reinforced by politically active teacher unions. A meaningful local school advisory council can be the backbone to restoring public confidence in education. Citizen participation is central to the reform of the collective bargaining process. An informed public is an important ally when there is a need or interest in improving education. (JD)",

The objective of the COP was to provide for indigenous community residents working as paraprofessional teacher aides in the nation's low-income urban and rural schools the opportunity to advance within the education profession and, ultimately, to improve the learning of the children in those schools. The program received Federal support. An important factor in the development of this program was the character of the individual trainee. Belonging to the same ethnic and minority groups as the children with whom they dealt, they brought to the position of teacher aide rapport and sympathetic understanding of the pupils. There gradually developed a cooperative working relationship between schools in the COP  program and local institutions of higher learning. Colleges and universities became involved, adjusting credit requirements, recognizing the value of experience, and eventually accepting COP interns as students. This involvement led to the hoped-for end product--a teacher aide could take courses in cooperating colleges and finally receive teacher certification. This enabled many low-income and minority group people to advance in the teaching profession from the modest beginning of helping in the classroom to fully accredited teachers, often achieving degrees beyond the basic B.A. (JD)",

Additional purposes were to determine: (1) the effect of using the short form SAT instead of the long form SAT in multiple regression equations, and (2) whether a difference exists in the motivation of the same students, taking the SAT in the spring as part of the regularly scheduled national SAT testing program and in the fall as part of a special experimental testing session designed for entering freshmen. This was examined by comparing the correlation of spring and fall SAT scores with a third spring  score, School and College Ability Tests (SCAT). The 12 variables used in this study were SAT short form (verbal and quantitative), ACT (English, mathematics, and composite), SCAT (verbal, quantitative, and total), SAT long form (verbal, quantitative, and total) and high school percentile rank (HSPR). Results suggest that, in general, the ACT and SAT are equally able to predict first semester GPA either alone or in multiple prediction with HSPR. HSPR is, by far, the best single predictor of success. Adding more variables to the prediction equation increases the multiple regression only slightly. Finally, the short form SAT appeared to be as good a predictor of first semester GPA as the long form SAT. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"This paper attempts to provide a general equilibrium framework for comparing the merits of alternative methods of raising the income of the employable poor. The strategy is to specify a complete and interacting set of factor markets, parameterize alternative program types in a manner convenient to this specification, and then solve the system of equations that characterize this economy for the comparative static response to the initiation of a small version of each program type. Within the income maintenance category the rankings implicit in impact effect analysis recur when general equilibrium effects are considered. Wage subsidies are more transfer-efficient than the negative income tax, or earning supplements. The size of policy multipliers are, however, quite sensitive to  elasticities of substitution in production. The general equilibrium impact of targeted employment and training programs is quite different from the impact effect. Expanding the employment of the skilled lowers the income of the less skilled, especially when elasticities of substitution and occupational choice are low. In general, equilibrium effects of transferring workers from the low to the high skilled work force imply that education and training are by far the most effective means of aiding the low skilled.

The program was funded under the Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I. The purpose of the program was to improve reading grades, reading comprehension, and auditory discrimination. Slightly less than 400 tenth through twelfth grade students from five high schools participated in the program. Students were referred to the program by teachers, guidance counselors, agencies, and family friends. Students attended double periods of ESL classes. Pre and post standardized tests assessed reading improvement and auditory discrimination of  the students. The report concluded that all students improved their reading grades at least one grade level. In addition, 74 percent of the students achieved some improvement in English comprehension. (JP)",

Practical ways to implement a minority business development strategy utilizing existing minority-owned land as a base are considered. One idea in particular is discussed: the possibility of giving minority landowners access to federally owned land in ways that would contribute to the viability of existing minority farm enterprises. It has been found that black landowners have been losing their land at a rapid rate in the South in large part because the size of their individual holdings is not sufficient to generate an adequate income. Federal landownership is quite extensive in the South, where most black-owned land is concentrated. Commercial  activity is already quite extensive on federal landholdings in the southeast. The use of public lands to accommodate the grazing needs of minority-owned beef cattle enterprises is one of the most interesting possibilities for systematically utilizing public land in a land-based minority development strategy. Public lands could also contribute substantially to other minority enterprise development operations as well, including a variety of specialty crop production activities and timber operations.

        "description":"The delivery of services to children of minority groups is hampered by the lack of recognition of ethnic factors. Although often overlooked, ethnicity is a key component in all phases of child welfare, including provision of homemakers, foster family care, institutional placements, and adoption. The study reported here is exploratory research with several preliminary goals. These are: to identify the major issues of concern to members of ethnic minority groups with regard to service delivery; to review proposals which move in the direction of a multi-ethnic service system; to develop a typology defining commonalities in needs among ethnic groups; and, to propose standards for service delivery where factors of ethnicity are involved. The study is concerned with children of five  minority groups: American Indians, Asian Americans, Blacks, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans. As a first phase of the research, the literature of the past ten years in professional journals, books, and unpublished papers was reviewed. Part one of this paper refers to the four major concerns discussed in the literature, with a section on each. These are: elimination of myths; lack of recognition of cultural differences, lack of appreciation of bilingualism; and, threat to group survival. Part two comprises three sections on proposals for change, including re-education and retraining, programming for cultural content, and changes in the direction of a multiethnic service system.

The discussion addresses three issues: the persistence of ethnic groups in American society, the shared heritage of American traditions, and the importance of personal and group identity in the education of every American. Three criteria for pluralistic education or three major underlying assumptions about pluralistic education are delineated. These are: (1) knowledge and understanding of the heritage of other groups that make up the pluralistic culture of Americans, and (3) knowledge and understanding of the relationship between and among people that form and have formed the ethnic groups in the United States.  Also presented is the rationale for a coalition of the movements that are represented in pluralistic education, namely, integration, bilingualism, ethnicity, and the women's movement.

        "description":"The admissions offices of 103 large, U.S. universities provided information regarding their admissions and retention of minority students for the eighth consecutive year. Results showed that black freshman enrollment was three percent in fall, 1969 and only five percent in fall, 1976, down from a high of six percent in 1973. Non-black minority freshman enrollment remained low and ranged from 0.2 percent American Indians to 1.7 percent minorities other than Hispanic or Asian Americans. The numbers of minority freshmen entering large universities seem to be either the same or decreasing. Most trends are holding steady, although the use of recommendations for general admission is down, the number of special programs for minorities is down sharply in public schools but steady in  private schools, the average number of admissions criteria employed by each school is up, and the number of schools employing different admissions criteria for minorities has dropped in 1975 and 1976, all of which show trends back to 1969 levels. The very large decrease in black freshman enrollment in the Middle States region since 1973 could be important, since that region has been the trend setter in the past. It appears that private schools have not only done better than public schools in enrolling minority students, but they have done a better job of retaining them. (Author/JM)",

The purpose of the Transitional Classes Program was to provide educational experience for emotionally handicapped students returning from residential centers. The program's basic goals were to assist students in developing school appropriate behaviors and to provide intensive academic remediation in reading and mathematics. Of the 244 students who participated in the program, the 118 students who received pre and posttests constituted the sample. Operating in eight sites located in four New York City boroughs, the program was staffed by qualified teachers, paraprofessionals, two counselors, a teacher trainer, an attendance  teacher and two supervisors. The objectives were achieved through the use of a behavioral management model which is explained in detail in this report. To measure academic gains, the reading and arithmetic sections of the Wide Range Achievement Test were administered as pre and posttests. Statistically significant gains in reading and mathematics were made. It was concluded that the Transitional Classes Program was successful in increasing the reading and mathematics achievement levels of its participants beyond expectation, that the intensive individual and group remediation provided by the teachers was an important contribution to the success of the program, and that the behavioral management model and the team approach proved to be a useful model for facilitating student growth.

The major objective of the program was to enable the pupils to achieve competency and fluency in the use of the English language and to assist them in attaining an achievement level appropriate for their grade level placement. This was accomplished by providing the students with experiences in language within functional settings through an audio-lingual method. Instruction was conducted in small groups of from four to eight for a period of forty to sixty minutes for two to five days a week. Varied learning materials were used. A total of 3,808 pupils from kindergarten through the twelfth grade  participated. An analysis of pre and post test scores revealed that all grades made gains of from almost five to seven months with the exception of grades ten, eleven, and twelve which had a gain of one year and one month. There apeared to be no significant difference among treatments where there was a combination of English as a Second Language and/or speech or guidance or when the treatment was only English as a Second Language. The fact that there were no significant differences in improvement among treatments suggested that the supportive services may have been helpful to those pupils who otherwise may not have functioned as well in the English as a Second Language classroom.

Attention was also paid to elements that are seldom examined such as pupils' needs, the concerns of parents and communities, and the problems of administration and the frustration of teachers. Although each task force was considered separately, several issues which were similar enough to be considered common to each group are treated together. The five areas that reflected mutual concern were: curriculum development, performance evaluation, personnel training, parent  and community participation, and funding. Among the findings were the following: (1) each of the task forces indicated a need for a utilitarian-based education, reflecting the particular needs of pupils from disparate cultural background, (2) national standardized testing was criticized by all task forces for being a poor tool used to evaluate the performance of non-middle class and non-white pupil populations, (3) the task forces stressed that effective teachers were those sensitive to the unique needs of the community served by their school, and (4) all task forces stressed the urgent need for long-range planning to achieve sound program implementation.

A discussion of selected research literature on early and advanced sensorimotor development in black children, institutional management of these children, and educational policy for precocious black children is discussed as a basis for educational policy decisions. The current use and abuse of medication for sensorimotor management of selected black children in schools is explored, the \"third grade syndrome\" wherein eager black achieving children begin their academic decline is explained, and specific implications of selected knowledge acquisition patterns of black children are delineated.  Methods which the educational establishment uses to manage active black children are homogeneous grouping in special learning centers, prescription of drugs, suspension from school and benign neglect. It is suggested that instead of these methods, educators should apply a humanistic, open individualized learning situation for all students. Furthermore, this paper points toward educational support for a model of active intervention which should achieve major cognitive gains for low income black children when implemented. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"A questionnaire formulated from sections of the Inventory on Family Life, prepared by the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth, was administered to over two thousand high school students in Rutherford County, Tennessee. The questionnaire was designed to gather responses on a five point scale regarding stable and unstable family characteristics, as outlined in the inventory. It was also designed to ascertain the degree to which these applied to the students' families. Approximately 265 black students completed the questionnaire. Areas of black family socialization which were contrasted with white family socialization were as follows: (1) demographic data, (2) mutual family trust and parental truthfulness, (3) mutual family respect and loyalty, (4) feelings of family  togetherness and the perceived degree of &quot;doing things together&quot;, (5) family friction: discipline of children, family quarrels, and divorce, and (6) community support: church attendance, school activities, and community activities. Findings indicated that although blacks were high in some &quot;unstable&quot; family characteristics such as separation, divorce, unemployment, poor housing, etc., an examination of their responses in the areas of the &quot;stable&quot; family did not reflect the stereotype of highly distressed, disorganized and deviant characteristics. Moreover, in some areas such as family togetherness, family respect, etc., blacks responded more postively than whites. This discrepancy suggests that the ususal black studies are too narrow in their focus on the problem aspects of black families.  (Author/AM)",

The seven booklets provide a guide representing an integration of metric teaching methods and metric materials to place the adult in an active learning environment, with learning activities arranged to help the adult learn metrics by actually using metric measures. The first section of booklet 1 contains a general introduction to the series and to metrics instruction; the second contains guidelines for conducting inservice sessions on metrication; the third section is an evaluation of selected metric equipment. Booklets 2-7 each contain from one to four units of instruction for teacher  inservice sessions. Unit contents include objectives, teaching strategies, teaching evaluation, sample written exercises, and lists of resources. The units in their respective booklets are as follows: Booklet 2--understanding the need for metrics, understanding calibration, the decimal system, and understanding prefixes; booklet 3--measuring length, and determining area; booklet 4--measuring volume; booklet 5--measuring weight; booklet 6--determining temperature; and booklet 7--conversion between metric units. (Although the series could be used by adult educators for self-study, the authors recommend that it accompany inservice sessions led by trained metric educators.) (MF)",

The author, in narrative and tabular detail, examines the association between unionization and education of the work force as well as skill differentials and industry unionization; derives a formula for the MSP for a multisector, multi-input economy having a union wage differential and varying flexibility of relative wages; presents empirical specification and results of a regression analysis of 1968, 1973, and 1974 Current Population Surveys (CPS) supporting hypotheses 2, 4 and 5; and calculates the social return to schooling and compares it to private return.

Evaluation was conducted through questionnaires, interviews, and observation. The Ebensburg project, conducted at a vocational-technical school, expanded the TIME scheduling model (Temporally Individualized Modular Education--a flexible scheduling arrangement) into the business education departments at six leading high schools. Practicum modules for academically oriented students and job or work experience modules were provided. The Crawford County project focused on the elementary component of career education to continue to develop and implement a  model computer resource career oriented curriculum for use at the K-6 level which focuses on career awareness, self-awareness, and the significance of work. Field orientation and exploration constituted a significant part of the Philadelphia program and also featured a strong career counseling and guidance component. The McKeesport project focused on the development, operation, testing, expansion, and diffusion of a comprehensive career education program (K-12) with emphasis on developing a model adaptable by other school districts. In this report, goals and objectives, procedures, evaluative results, conclusions, and recommendations are described in detail for each of the four sites.

To assess the program process, the local program directors, school administrators, teachers, and students were interviewed, instructional materials were examined, and classrooms were visited during 2-day site visits. Utilizing tests developed in Ohio, the pretest status and pre- and posttest growth of program and non-program students were analyzed to evaluate student  learning. The 11 conclusions regarding student learning suggest that the program has influenced the learning of students, has made slightly more impact on cognitive than affective learning, and has been most successful in the elementary grades. The four conclusions about program process indicate that program directors and coordinators are capable of assuming a leadership role in infusing career development concepts into their schools, and appear to be providing for program expansion.

        "description":"Increasing attention is being paid to linking education and the market place to prepare youth for a productive role in work. Three areas constitute the ingredients for developing a realistic strategy: (1) Changes in the market place, (2) a delivery system for increased youth employment, and (3) local industry-education councils. Over the next decade significant changes will have impact on the employment situation for youth and will require major adjustments in the educational programs focusing on school-to-work transition. Some of these trends are technological changes, occupational changes from goods to services, new market areas primarily in the South and Southwest, a rise in educational requirements, higher incomes, declining birthrate, and more women and blacks in the work  force. A delivery system for youth employment should focus on school-to-work transition, with industry and education collaborating on the following: Statement of goals, staff development programs in career education, school building coordinators in career education, curriculum restructuring to reflect career education concepts, career information/resource centers, job placement services (including needs assessment, job development, student development, placement, and followup), school building-employer partnerships, and task forces of volunteer career consultants. Industry-education councils can link the market place and the delivery system on the local level as representatives of business, education, labor, government, agriculture, and the professions work together on coordination of  school industry cooperative efforts.

Further, its objective is to identify factors underlying the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of court decisions and out-of-court settlements in producing changes in minority employment patterns. Special attention is given to the construction and shipbuilding industries and to the issues of hiring, union entry, upgrading, and seniority systems. To advance an understanding of the dynamics of combatting employment discrimination, the authors present a new conceptual framework for interpreting activity in this field. The authors suggest that conclusions and recommendations drawn could be of interest to attorneys,  judges, minority organizations, and government agencies attempting to remedy employment discrimination.

Project evaluation procedures involved the development and testing of hypotheses which would determine the accomplishment of the project objectives. Findings showed that the project was instrumental in reducing students' vocational anxiety and increasing their vocational assurance. There was also a positive  increase in the teachers' attitude toward career education. This report is presented in four sections: Section I covers the project purpose, research hypotheses, definition of terms, procedures, experimental design, instruments, and statistical analysis of data; section II describes the Career Planning and Placement Program; section III contains results and findings as they relate to the research hypotheses; and a section IV includes the summary, conclusion, and recommendations.

        "description":"A national study of the vocational education programs in 164 large cities was conducted to explore perceived needs; determine the priority of these needs; and compare the priorities in terms of city size, geographic location, and minority concentration. Data was collected through interviews, a mail survey, and a literature review. After the needs were identified, they were divided into 30 &quot;major goal&quot; statements and 260 &quot;specific need&quot; statements to be prioritized by urban educators. The six highest priorities related to an adequate and equitable funding base, vocational guidance, relevance of vocational content, basic academic instruction, vocational student job placement, and community relations and support. Many of the specific needs related to the highest major goals. As an  example of the unique priorities according to type of city, the need for up-to-date equipment was considered stronger in medium and small cities than in large cities, higher in the Northeast than in other regions of the country, and greater in high minority cities than in either medium or low minority cities. A number of recommendations directed to audiences at the local, State, and national levels were made. A list of the cities included in the mail survey and selected results from personal interviews are appended. (LMS)",

Based primarily on information from the Current Population Survey, conducted and tabulated for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Bureau of the Census, the estimates in the report are for persons 16 years of age or older in the civilian noninstitutional population during the calendar week ending May 15, 1976. A two-page summary of the findings on multiple job holders begins the report. Following are four tables of figures showing primary and secondary jobs for persons holding two jobs or more, by industry, class of worker, and  sex. A fifth table gives the main reasons for working at more than one job, with figures for age, sex, marital status, race, and usual weekly earnings. Appendix A, three pages of explanatory notes for the previous five tables, describes briefly the labor force concepts, sample design, estimating methods, and reliability of the estimates. Appendix B contains 14 reference tables giving more detailed information and figures as to the occupation (primary and secondary), industry group, class of worker, hours worked at secondary job, total hours worked, earnings on primary job, and personal characteristics of persons holding two jobs or more. Some tables are further categorized as to age, sex, and race. (BL)",

Prior to discussion of the models, the author briefly discusses (1) the need for individualized instruction in vocational education and (2) three dimensions for classifying models: Content dimension, time dimension, and proficiency or competency level  dimension.

Some approaches to determining simulator training effectiveness, such as surveys of pilot and instructor opinions, are not considered particularly reliable. Several other approaches have also been suggested. One factor influencing simulator training effectiveness is simulator design, including fidelity of simulation and design for training. Fidelity refers to the extent to which features of the aircraft and its environment duplicate their real world counterparts. Studies on the influence of such features as visual fidelity, motion fidelity, and handling characteristics are somewhat inconclusive. Design for training refers to the inclusion of features  which facilitate training but which may bear no particular resemblance to features of the aircraft and environment being simulated. The sequencing of simulator and aircraft training and training program content are also influences. Past experience, aptitudes, skills, attitudes, and expectations of trainees and instructors represent potential influences on effectiveness of simulator training. Studies show that expectations for simulator training are usually fulfilled. (LMS)",

        "description":"Several issues in education resulting from the change to the Carter administration, and how these changes will affect the remainder of the twentieth century, are discussed in this speech. The author first makes the assumption that there is the possibility of a sharp break in the educational policy of the last 10 years, noting that there has been much criticism directed at education and educational leaders throughout the country, particularly education's high costs. Key issues discussed are as follows: (1) Concern for early childhood education, which could become a vigorous component in the struggle for Federal money (According to the author, if there is a struggle to put more money in early education and other areas, it might well be that vocational education's effort to get a  larger part of the Federal share has reached a plateau.); (2) the possible creation, under the new administration, of a new department of education, which could intensify competition between higher education and elementary secondary education, between vocational and early childhood education, and between the research people and the program people; (3) the consolidation of Federal programs; and (4) the authorization (under the Educational Amendments of 1976) of teacher centers, and emphasis on the problem of retraining people for both different occupations and skills and opportunities during their entire lifetime.

Specific findings are presented in each of the major areas discussed. Following are the overall findings presented: (1) GED program participants had lower average aptitude scores than high school diploma holders, but higher ones than nonparticipant nongraduates. (2) A higher proportion of certificate holders planned service careers in comparison  with their peers. They had higher pay grades at separation than noncertificate holders, but lower ones than diploma holders. (3) The GED certificate was regarded less highly than the high school diploma, but was perceived of considerable value in both inservice and postservice environments. This was particularly true for inservice where the certificate was accepted officially as meeting the requirements for a secondary education credential. (4) The impact of receiving a certificate was reported to be favorable by both certificate holders and noncertificate holders. The major effects of receiving a certificate were seen as increased confidence in personal ability and increased feelings of general well-being. (Author)",

The report begins with four brief sections: (1) An overview of program purpose, administration, population, services, and adjudication; (2) highlights of 1976 major events regarding jobs, wages, and services; (3) statistics on WIN characteristics of the WIN population (numbers who registered in WIN, entered employment, and deregistered by sex, race, age, and education); and (4) comparison of 1975 and 1976 statistics on  intake, employment, and employment and training programs. The fifth section covers program results and includes tables on job entries by occupation and sex; entry wages by sex, race, and age; and types and numbers of supportive services initiated during the first quarters of FY 1976 and FY 1975. A brief section on funding covers the program costs and the basis for making State allocations. Finally, the last section, a perspective on WIN, traces the program background and chronology of WIN legislative documents and their program effects, revised WIN regulations, projects initiated to evaluate WIN and test innovations; and focus for FY 1977. An appendix includes 5 tables regarding unemployment rates and WIN job entries by State; WIN registrants and those entering employment and  deregistering; hourly wages by sex and State; and initiated social and day care services by State.

        "description":"To determine the efficacy of instructional television for adults in GED (General Educational Development) programs in large urban areas, a study was conducted using Kentucky Education Television's (KET) newly marketed GED preparation series (which was instituted with the help of the Chicago Public Library and local colleges). The study was guided by three main purposes: To assess the effectiveness of a design for fitting televised instruction (ITV) into a larger instructional network, to compare the GED performance of adults who were prepared by this TV course with a comparable sample of GED testees who prepared for the test in some other way, and to assess students' perceptions of TV instruction in general and of this television series (KET/GED) in particular. This report  includes a complete description of study procedures, results, and conclusions. Overall conclusions note the following: (1) Remedial education via ITV is an attractive format for urban audiences when such instruction is offered at no cost to the student. (2) Forty percent of the audience tested stated that they would not have been able to prepare for the GED test in other ways, indicating that ITV does reach in part a new audience which would not access conventional instructional programs. (3) Major motivational factors included convenience of the weekend broadcast, preference for TV instruction, confinement to the home, and a perceived compactness of the course. (SH)",

She describes the methodology used as ethnographic research, which entails an analytic description of a culture by looking at an institution as a culture of its own and, for example, attempting to illuminate the meaning of a supervisor's role and perceived performance in terms of the culture of the mental retardation facility. Steps outlined as part of the methodology include identification of salient issues, development of categories of concern as areas on which to focus the diagnosis, identification of symptoms, and movement through inference to  symptoms to problems to educational needs. The procedure is called responsive because it is meant to respond to the information needs of the client and rigorous because the diagnosis is done with careful description and attempts to document the bases on which judgments are made. For example, the data collection process described involves a variety of techniques: Formal and informal interviews, observation, document analysis, and questionnaires. Strengths of the procedure are also discussed. A summary of the diagnostic study conducted for the dissertation is appended. (LMS)",

Eighty-four adult education graduate students, enrolled in four sections of an adult learning theory course taught by three different instructors, completed an evaluation form, a value survey, and an adult education attitude scale at the end of the course. Multiple regression and path analysis showed that (1) adult education attitudes and selected values accounted for 27% of the variance in student evaluation of faculty, (2) adult education attitudes were responsible for 8% of the variance in student evaluation of faculty, and (3) values were not significantly related to student evaluation of faculty. A path model suggested that values influenced student evaluation  of faculty through attitudes. The findings suggested that values and attitudes play an important part in student evaluation of faculty and should be recognized when interpreting the results of such ratings. (Author)",

        "description":"To examine the characteristics of expertise, a study at the University of Minnesota cardiac clinic compared differences in diagnostic ability and strategies between novices (fourth year medical students) and experts (specialists in pediatric cardiology). The investigator presented a model for expertise based on knowledge of subject matter content and knowledge of reasoning procedures. Four medical students and four specialists diagnosed eight cases, four in a simulated clinic task and four in a consultant task. All sessions were audiotaped. The novices and experts made different diagnoses based on a varying knowledge of the subject matter content and the use of different reasoning procedures. For example, a student used the procedure of successive scanning (considering only one  hypothesis at a time) when he was reasonably sure of his diagnosis, while a specialist used a focusing strategy (reducing the set of hypotheses already generated) to limit the possibilities. The conceptualization of expertise as a combination of knowledge of content and knowledge of procedures is particularly relevant to the adult educator. Since most adults have mastered general strategies of learning, they need to learn and apply the procedures unique to an area in order to develop expertise in that area. A careful investigation of the expert's strategies can be utilized for programs designed to develop that expertise. A bibliography and diagrams related to the study are included in the report.

(SHAPES is an instrument used for community development project evaluation.) First, four sources of data on SHAPES are analyzed for assumption, processes, and instrumentation design traits which have a bearing upon S(L)EA. Next, assumptions and specifications for S(L)EA are discussed, followed by the description of a case study in which one of the S(L)EA interpretive frameworks, considered to provide useful and meaningful  feedback to a learner using S(L)EA as a reflection medium, is examined. (The interpretive framework examined involved the development and use of a self-designed set of S(L)EA card clusters.) Methodology and findings are presented, with the findings also shown in diagrams and tables. The final two topics cover the evaluation research applications of S(L)EA, and experience with S(L)EA in a program evaluation. (SH)",

        "description":"According to the author, service or outreach activities by faculty members at research oriented institutions, including land-grant ones, typically go unregarded, with the most highly esteemed effort being productive scholarship (through such endeavors as journal articles, papers, and research grants), teaching being of secondary importance. In this paper, the author analyzes the factors which established the dominance of scholarship in American higher education. Particular attention is paid to a 40-year period following the Civil War, when the nature and diversity of universities was becoming clear. Events in this century, leading up to World War I are also analyzed. The rhetoric which advocated service and practicality in courses is compared with emerging tendencies of faculty  members to concentrate on discipline oriented research. Effects of the German university model and the emergence and recognition of scientific inquiry are examined. Particular attention is given to alienation of faculty members from a growing materialism in American society, with the intention of determining what effect, if any, this tendency had on outreach by faculty members. The search for themes in the post-Civil War period is tied to an examination of two land grant institutions--the Universities of Georgia and Illinois. (Author/SH)",

A brief review of literature and previous ABE evaluation processes of the Gateway districts are discussed first. Theoretical and practical  limitations of the Gateway followup study are then presented and the design of the study is examined.

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore the relationship between anomia (a feeling of alienation, of being cut off from society), attitude toward adult education, and nonparticipation in formal adult education activities. The subjects of the study were adults who lived in a specific area in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had the following characteristics: The working inhabitants were mainly blue-collar workers, over 99% were white, and formal adult education activities were available in or near the area. Out of a systematic sample of 201 households, 147 adults responded to an interview schedule, a response rate of 73%. Conclusions based on statistical analyses of the findings were as follows: The higher the level of anomia a person has, the less favorable his or her attitude toward adult  education; the attitude toward adult education of nonparticipants in formal adult education activities is significantly lower than that of participants; and only those nonparticipants who are 26.5 years or older are more likely to have higher levels of anomia than participants. A solid majority of nonparticipants surveyed indicated a desire to learn. Therefore, it is suggested that adult educators examine the effectiveness of their methods for extending their services to those adults who do not participate in formal adult education. A more personal approach to reaching nonparticipants--through acquaintances, friends, and relatives or through organizations to which adults belong--may be more effective with blue-collar workers.

Data gathered from field interviews in six States were analyzed qualitatively through the use of content analysis and quantitatively through the  use correlational and multivariate analyses.) The body of this paper describes the research approach used in the project in terms of the various activities that were undertaken, their relationships to each other, and why they were done, concluding that (1) the complementary use of qualitative and quantitative analyses provided a basis by which the results of the data analysis of the first and second years could be compared; and (2) when qualitative and quantitative findings from each year were compared, findings from the first year were generally substantiated and extended.

        "description":"In an attempt to test the extent to which attitude change occurs as a function of social role, data was collected on two occasions occuring five years apart (1969 and 1974). Subjects were 72 persons aged 17-19 years old in their last year at high school. They completed the author's modification to the Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale in 1969 just prior to high school graduation. Five years later the modified C-scale was readministered. By this time the subjects had left school, some were married, others had travelled overseas, some were involved in political movements, others were continuing education. A 1969-1974 Conservatism Scale discrepancy score was calculated for each respondent. Discrepancy scores were then entered in a regression equation where respondent's \"social  roles\" were the independent variables. From the study results, it appears that the post high school years (early adulthood) are a time when attitudes are shaped by social roles and experiences which accompany each role. The first section of this paper presents background information. In the second section, describing the study, the results are interpreted within the framework of a model which involves a distinction between changes occurring because of developmental events in contrast to historical time and historical events.

Forty-one adult basic education students, ranging from 16 to 62 years of age (mean age of 25) and predominantly from lower socioeconomic groups, were administered the following three instruments, used to measure reading comprehension, level of logical judgment, and conservation of linguistic structure, respectively: The California Achievement Test; Peel's test of logical judgment (in which a paragraph was read to the subject, followed by two questions; subject's response was then rated according to coordination of information and data source); and Hutson's instrument consisting of eight pairs of sentences (which varied  in terms of probability of occurrence and in terms of similarity and dissimilarity of meaning) in which the subject was asked to judge the equivalence or nonequivalence of paired sentences. Major findings revealed (1) that adults do function at different levels of logical judgment and that the functioning level is independent of the adult's reading achievement score, (2) the validity of Peel's concept of levels of logical judgment is supported, and (3) the two variables, linguistic conservation ability and reading level, are significantly related in adult populations.

        "description":"A 21-year longitudinal study (1955-1976) was conducted on the educational and professional careers of men who specialized in engineering in Ontario, Canada. Data was collected from schools, universities, employers, and the subjects themselves. In 1956, 683 males and no females enrolled in university engineering courses. In general, the engineering students were a superior group. Of the 683, 65% (444) graduated and the other 35% withdrew without earning a degree. In most cases, withdrawal followed academic failure. The withdrawals were older than the graduates, were more likely to be living away from home, and had fathers who were not in high status occupations. Six or seven years after graduation, 69% of the graduates were practicing engineering in Ontario. Those who did not  become engineers in Ontario were practicing the profession outside Ontario or had entered other professions. Information was collected on employment during the academic year, during summer vacations, and after graduation. After approximately fourteen years of working, the average graduate had had three employers. Almost half the respondents had earned no degree other than the bachelor's. Of those who had obtained advanced degrees, 40% had chosen an engineering related field, almost 25% had obtained a master's in business administration, and 10% had obtained doctorates. Four out of five respondents had undertaken some formal education since graduation, although not necessarily for credit. Shortly after graduation, the courses chosen were highly technical; later, they showed ever-widening  interests. (LMS)",

        "description":"This paper is a three-part narrative report of a study in which structured interviews were conducted with 30 professional women in higher education in West Berlin to determine their career attitudes and aspirations. Background information includes an account of the author's preparation for conducting the study and her concern for semantics in translating interview questions from English to German. The description of the method, which incorporates a view of the subjects' and the culture's attitudes toward females as professionals in higher education, is presented in four steps: Gaining an understanding of the administrative structure of the four institutions in West Berlin which were included in the study; gathering information on the comparative numbers of men and women at each  rank of the professorial ladder at these institutions; selection of the 30 women to be interviewed; and conducting the actual interviews. Major conclusions discuss implications for the future of women professionals in higher education in West Germany, with two of the findings revealing that (1) most of the women feel that the bias against women in academia is so entrenched that they must not only perform exceptionally, but they must have great courage and strength to persist and advance, and (2) as far as choice of career was concerned, only 11 of the women ended up in their first choice. Of the other 19, at least half cited specific reasons related to discrimination against women for having to choose their second or third career option. (SH)",

A personal data form consisting of personal characteristics (age and sex) and professional characteristics (years of experience in adult education, institution from which the doctorate was secured, professional role, and institutional setting) was mailed with an instrument, designed to measure orientations to change, nonchange, and value-interest, to a stratified random sample of 225 professional adult educators with a major in adult education who received doctorates from 1960 to 1970 inclusive. The data were quantified and analyzed by multiple regression and analysis of variance which produced means, correlation co-efficients of  personal and professional characteristics with orientations, and on F-test to analyze variation which might be attributable to the independent variables (personal and professional characteristics). The following hypotheses for professional adult educators were supported: (1) Their orientation toward change and nonchange are associated with value-interested orientations, (2) they are change oriented, (3) they are value oriented, (4) women are less change oriented than men, (5) orientation toward change, nonchange, and value-interest are associated with the institution from which the doctorate was secured, and (6) orientation toward change and nonchange are associated with the institutional setting.

        "author":["Misanchuk, Earl R."],
        "description":"A common approach to needs analysis involves the development of a self-report questionnaire administered to members of the intended audience. Such an approach poses a problem however: Concern for data reliability demands polling as many respondents as possible, while concern for cost-effectiveness dictates minimizing the size of the sample. The solution involves a sub-group of the population responding to all items in the questionnaire, and parameters estimated from the sample data. Yet this approach may not be the most effective and efficient one. Multiple matrix sampling (MMS), a technique whereby both the population of respondents and the universe of items are jointly sampled, may be the answer. Basically, this technique involves the random assignment of some items to a random  sample of respondents, with other random samples of respondents receiving different random items. A computer estimates the parameters from the sample data gathered. The study reported herein begins with the pool of data generated by a self-report questionnaire needs analysis and proceeds to estimate those same parameters through the use of MMS. These estimates are then compared to the known values and to corresponding estimates from traditional respondent-sampling techniques. The paper concludes with a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of MMS. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the characteristics of adult education in rural areas, to determine the differences between adult education in rural and urban settings, and to explore possible barriers which prevent rural residents from seeking further education. The investigator analyzed existing literature on participation rates, needs assessment data, interest indexes, program evaluations, and research studies and compared it with studies conducted on adult learning experiences in a rural area--West Central Minnesota. The study focused on formal educational programs, predominately at the postsecondary level, but also drew upon information and data from informal educational settings and community education (secondary) programs. It was found that rural adults focus their  efforts toward noncredit personal development, whereas urban adults participate more readily in credit programs of a vocational nature. Other findings were that adult education in both settings is concentrated most heavily in age categories below 40 and that men participate more frequently in urban areas while women participate more frequently in rural areas. It was also found that significant barriers to continued learning exist more often for rural adults than for urban adults, the most serious of which are access to educational programs (distance), lack of adequate finances, and lack of advising and counseling. Based on the results of the study, the investigator recommends that adult education programs in rural areas be developed with a strong emphasis upon self-improvement and  personal development and that program costs be kept minimal. The report includes a bibliography and an outline map of West Central Minnesota. (LMS)",

The analysis of representative studies selected from a survey of the literature is divided into four sections, one for each of four types of studies: (1) Administrative reports, (2) comparative studies, (3) cost-benefit analysis studies, and (4) studies relating to the development of technology, instrumentation, data systems, methodology, and guides and manuals. A brief summary is presented on the usefulness of each type of study, and general comments are added regarding future trends for followup research and criteria used to evaluate vocational programs. The overall conclusion stated is that  followup studies continue to suffer from some severe problems, some of which are procedural and others conceptual. These problems are listed, and recommendations are made regarding (1) the need for increased research activities on relationships between vocational education and economic cycles and (2) the need to encourage and sponsor research efforts on a higher scale at the State, regional, and national levels.

To evaluate SIGI's potential usefulness to NTID, answers to the following questions were sought: What sources and methods are used within SIGI to obtain occupational information? How often, and in what way, is this data base updated? Does SIGI portray more information than is currently available through standard sources? Is SIGI an effective means of collating current labor market  information? To answer these questions, ETS literature on SIGI was reviewed, ETS personnel concerned with the SIGI occupational data base were questioned, and local directors of a nationally dispersed set of SIGI field demonstration sites were contacted by telephone. Because of the low percentage of occupations in SIGI that related to NTID training programs, and since the SIGI data base did not seem to add to the prepared career counselor's arsenal of occupational information, it was recommended that plans for application of the data base to the NTID program should not be pursued.

        "description":"Prepared as part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' periodic reassessment of its projections of the future growth trends of the various sectors of the American economy, new labor force projections to 1990 are presented based on trends in labor force participation as observed through 1975 and on the most recent population projections of the U.S. Census Bureau. Major points of emphasis are the following: (1) The U.S. work force, which has been growing at unprecedented rates since World War II, is expected to grow more slowly during the next 15 years. (2) Projections developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) show that the labor force should grow at an annual rate of 1.9% in the latter half of the 1970's and only 1.1% a year during the 1980's, compared with a rate of increase  of 2.3% during the first half of the 1970's. (3) Behind this slowdown is a sharp drop in the birth rate of the 1960's, which means there will be fewer youths reaching working age in the 1980's. The authors discuss specific 1975-1990 labor force participation projections of women, men, youth (16-24), prime age individuals (25-54), and older age persons (55 and over); compare present with earlier BLS projections published in 1973; explain methods of driving projections and underlying assumptions; and suggest alternative projections based on two different fertility assumptions. A supplementary table is appended which shows noninstitutional population, total labor force, and labor force participation rates by age and sex, actual for 1970 and 1975 and projected for 1980, 1985, and 1990.

Section I defines paid educational leave as &quot;leave given to an employee for educational purposes for a specified period during working hours, with adequate financial entitlements.&quot; Section II discusses developments within the International Labor Organization and that body's recent acceptance of a convention on paid educational leave. The history of the support of the concept by the Center for Educational Research and Innovation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is also recounted. Section III summarizes a study of the paid  educational leave programs in 10 countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia). Section IV reviews the interest shown, the perspective, the potential benefits, and the roles played by labor, management, government, and education with regard to paid educational leave as it developed in various countries. The final section highlights the potential significance of paid educational leave, recrurrent education, and continuing education and offers some suggestions for adjustments in American educational policy and practice.

        "description":"With the increasing amount of leisure time people are facing due to shorter work weeks and longer life spans, there is a growing need for public agencies to offer fulfilling leisure time activities to its community members, as well as teach them how to use this time appropriately. The YMCAs, (Young Men's Christian Association), and YM-YWHAs (Young Men's-Young Women's Hebrew Association), which exist in many communities, are agencies which could answer to these needs. This paper describes the YM-YWHA of metropolitan New Jersey (West Orange), an existing Y which, according to the author, satisfies the needs of its community. This description covers staffing, policy, and programs (recreational and educational) and activities for different age groups (children, teenagers, adults,  including older adults). Also discussed are some of the problems and future goals of the Ys today. It is suggested that perhaps some of the programs and philosophies described could be adapted by other Ys in an attempt to make their association an agency which offers the best in leisure time activities.

        "description":"To evaluate a secondary level occupational education program in New York State, the author used a system termed LOPE (Local Occupational Program Evaluation), which began with the development of a statement of philosophy and measureable objectives based on teacher and administrator input. A questionnaire based on the objectives was administered to graduating students and to the same students six months after graduation to evaluate the performance of the school and its staff in meeting the established objectives. One of the objectives was: Upon completion of an occupational program, 65% of the students will rate the experience satisfying. Students responded to the statement: My experiences in the specialization which I pursued while in the occupational education program were:  (Responses ranged from &quot;very satisfying&quot; to &quot;not at all satisfying.&quot;) Data obtained during the two-phase administration of the instrument indicated that five of the seven stated objectives were met. It was concluded that the LOPE system, which measures the &quot;products&quot; (graduates) of a program, can be useful for accountability because it uses measureable objectives. Resource materials, including a position paper by the author, data collection forms, and transparency masters on LOPE, are appended to the report. (LMS)",

Two program evaluation methodologies, each requiring different approaches and resource expenditure, were developed that could provide the needed information about the effectiveness of the provision of employer services, the customer relations component of the U.S. Employment Service (ES), which promotes the use of the ES among community employers by encouraging or directly soliciting job listings. Section 1 of the report is an introduction covering basic assumptions, reasons for developing two methodologies rather than one (The request for proposal called for a net impact evaluation  while the contractors thought a survey technique was best), and the organization of the report. Section 2 provides a review of the project, tracing the steps in the development of the proposed methodologies (includes sources of information, types of information, and data collection techniques). Section 3 is a description of the purposes, structure, and processes of the employer services program and presents a categorization scheme for local office programs. Section 4 explains why experimental variation is necessary for independent net effect program evaluation and outlines the requirements of such experimentation. Section 5 presents the two alternative evaluation methodologies with net impact experiment being described in greater detail than the survey technique but both in depth  considered to be sufficient to permit their use.

        "description":"This final report of a project conducted to design, develop, and test a comprehensive management plan for vocational education in Missouri is divided into three sections. Section I describes the rationale and components of a model based on the general systems approach to planning. An analysis of the planning process introduces several planning tools that were developed. Section II presents detailed examples of the application of one component of the planning model, The Decision Making Support System, the essence of which lies in the application of quantitative tools to the analysis of vocational education planning problems. The applications explained include linear programing, goal programing, multivariate statistics, and heuristic methods. Resource allocation planning problems  are dealt with as well as the problems of needs assessment and of projecting employment for planning purposes. Section III addresses a variety of issues that relate to improving vocational education planning. The question, &quot;Is improving vocational education planning more myth than reality?, is dealt with. Barriers to improving planning are discussed as well as the effect of the lack of administrative responsibility as it relates to vocational education planning. The report concludes by considering the possible future of vocational education planning. Appended are a discussion of data gathering and analysis and a copy of the operational master plan for vocational education in Missouri through the year 1990 that evolved in part as a result of this study.

Change occurs with or without planning. The major purpose of planning is to bring about some needed and agreed upon change designed to correct or improve upon an existing situation. Appropriate planning provides for collection and analysis of data makes possible an orderly and systematic procedure for achieving change, identifies goals and objectives, and identifies feasible alternative courses of action. For effective and meaningful planning and change, the relationships between the two processes must be carefully considered. Planned change requires at least three fundamental components: Analysis of \"what is\" and  identification of discrepancies between \"what is\" and \"what should be,\" planning or designing of procedures to reduce the discrepancies, and provisions for implementing and evaluating the plans. Organizations should direct special attention to awareness of need, collection and analysis of data, determination of defensible alternative procedures, development and testing of plans, and dissemination of worthwhile practices. In addition to understanding the interrelationships of change and planning, educational organizations must consider the relationship of many environmental factors to change, including attitudes, technology, legal constraints, role of leadership, evaluation, and sources of change.

The four models are the Appalachia Educational Laboratory (West Virginia), Far West Laboratory (California), Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (Oregon), and Research for Better Schools (Pennsylvania). (Although the four laboratories applied different strategies in the development of their own versions of EBCE, each of the four programs  achieves three common goals: (1) Each program is student-centered and provides personalized learning experiences to all students, (2) the focus of student learning activities is in the community at cooperating experience sites, and (3) each program has developed procedures and materials for integrating academic learning with career experiences.)

The studies reviewed were conducted nationwide using a variety of research designs, instruments, sample sizes, and statistical analysis approaches. The findings were (1) generally supportive of CE in 19 studies where reading and/or mathematics were impacted at various levels of significance and in one study reporting that the treatment students maintained growth in the basic skills; (2) moderately supportive of CE in 16 studies showing reading and/or mathematics grade equivalent score improvement and  achievement gains; and (3) unsupportive of CE in 3 studies revealing either negligible or minimal impact. Although few generalizations could be made, it was noted that (1) a few more citations of positive results were itemized for reading than for mathematics or total language; (2) most of the successful studies collected data over one academic year; (3) the more intensive CE treatments led to more positive results; and (4) with few exceptions, CE had few adverse effects.

It was concluded that school and work experience both pay off in more dignified and meaningful work and that finding evidence of wage differentials which compensate for nonpecuniary benefits is very difficult. Paper II: A survey of unionized municipal workers was done to determine whether the new generation of educated workers would make new kinds of job demands. A questionnaire was mailed to 164 accountants, 214 college  office assistants, and 427 social service supervisors and administered to 90 nurse's aides through interviews. It was found that the desire for changes in the job seems related to patterns of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with particular job aspects rather than to age or education. Paper III: Utilizing information from the same survey as Paper II, an analysis of responses suggests that union leaders do not initiate demands for job enrichment because they correctly perceive their members' relative unwillingness to forego pay increases in order to get more opportunity for job involvement.

The handbook contained seven program components based upon a review of the literature, exemplary career guidance programs, and consultant assistance. These components are needs assessment, program organization and management, program activities for teachers and counselors, career information resource centers, community resources, counseling, placement, followup, and evaluation. A series of workshops were conducted at each of the four selected sites in New Hampshire to  educate the staff in the program approach to career guidance and to familiarize them with the seven components of the model. Of the four secondary schools, three indicated that the needs assessment component was most needed and useful to them. There was general consensus that the primary benefit of the handbook was to force school guidance staff and the associated educational community to think of their guidance efforts as a program rather than a series of unrelated or random activities. As a result of the field test, the rewritten handbook was made available to each of the junior and senior high schools in New Hampshire. (TA)",

Three goals were specified for Phase IV: (1) To develop a model for training school administrators and counselors in their role in career education, (2) to develop and test a set of materials for use by school district personnel to train groups of administrators and counselors based on the model, and (3) to revise materials and develop new approaches used for training teachers and teacher educators. Project strategies and procedures included the development of a model based on change theory concepts. A set of materials defined as a module was developed for each part of the descriptive model. The major focus of the materials (eight  modules contained in 14 separate documents) was to give cadre trainers sufficient background to properly serve as instructors and to provide materials which the trainer might use in 30-hour workshops for administrators and counselors. A set of activities and a bibliography were also included. Other project activities were teacher evaluation of communically produced career education materials and compilation of a school-by-school description of exemplary career education programs in Hawaii.

The first two sections of this report provide a description of program, information on the locale, economy, education, and special factors of the service areas. The evaluation is covered in the third section under two subsections. The subsection, Information  and Data Concerning Process Evaluation, includes the project director's monthly progress reports and a five-column evaluation worksheet covering data on personnel/staff functions, appraisal factor, essential points, rating scale, and findings and stipulations. In the second subsection, Product Evaluations, each program's objectives and evaluative criteria are outlined and discussed separately.

The rest of the phases and steps are as follows: Phase II: General Planning (select and organize steering committee and advisory council, identify perceived needs, and conduct goal setting and prioritizing process); Phase III: Program Planning (obtain board approval of goals and planning budget to continue, select and organize ad hoc committees, identify expected student outcomes, identify all constraints, and give interim report); Phase IV:  Assessment (write operational and instructional objectives, and develop or identify pretest instrument); Phase V: Pilot Program (develop inservice for staff, infuse program into identified curricula, and modify planned program); Phase VI: Implementation (develop inservice for staff, and implement program); and Phase VII: Evaluation (evaluate effectiveness of program, modify actual program, and recycle program). The guide suggests that each phase should involve students, staff, and community.

Chapters 3 and 4 cover labor market studies, including the National Longitudinal Survey, and chapter 5 reviews projects exploring barriers faced by women seeking employment. Chapter 6 discusses  several experimental projects undertaken by ETA to improve the work opportunities of women, including Minority Women's Employment Program (MWEP). Other government activities that affect women at work are discussed in chapters 7 to 9: (1) Manpower programs, including the Work Incentive Program (WIN); and (2) the policies and actions of the U.S. Employment Service, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and occupational licensing authorities. The final chapter makes recommendations for future directions in R&amp;D projects, child care, education/training, outreach employment programs, and organizing efforts. (EM)",

Next, there are two sections briefly describing how to determine student needs and interests and how FHA related to the curriculum. These are followed by scope of learnings charts that list learning outcomes for the six content emphases within each subject area for levels I through V with the latter three presented in extensive detail. Finally, the guide describes the development of a course, including examples of both subject area and content emphases course outlines, and presents New York State's home economics sequence requirements toward high school graduation.

Three regional workshops were held where the participants, selected by a steering committee using specific criteria, generated competency statements in four areas (industrial materials, power technology, visual communications, and industrial arts--professional) based on Pennsylvania's Generic 22 (a compilation of 22 statements delineating the general competencies needed by all teachers, regardless of grade level or subject area). Following these workshops, the steering committee synthesized and edited these competencies into a single set of  statements. One hundred and twenty-five industrial arts teacher educators, supervisors, classroom teachers, and lay people attending an annual conference provided verbal and written feedback about the statements to the steering committee before the final editing was done. This booklet concludes with a complete list of the competency statements in the four areas and an appendix which includes Generic 22; an overview of project events, procedures, and dates; a list of the workshop participants and staff; and the criteria used for identifying competencies during the workshops.

        "description":"In Wisconsin, different agencies administer vocational education on the secondary and postsecondary levels. Students and educators at both levels have reported substantial duplication of course content, texts, reference materials, equipment, and instructional processes. Therefore, a project was designed to expand and improve articulation (that is, communication, cooperation, and coordination of curriculum) between the two levels. A major contribution of the project was to plan and conduct a series of district workshops for vocational educators designed to upgrade staff capabilities to expand and improve articulation. Approximately 800 educators participated in the workshops. An evaluation questionnaire was randomly distributed to about 100 participants, 86% of whom responded.  Responses were positive and supportive of the articulation project and workshops, and most participants indicated they wanted followup workshops. It was concluded that the articulation workshops did help upgrade staff capabilities. Among the recommendations were suggestions that articulation efforts be both horizontal and vertical in nature, that they encompass K-16 grade levels, and that they be expanded beyond just curriculum articulation. Based on responses from workshop participants and on the observations of project staff, a schematic model was generated to provide a guideline for future program implementation. (LMS)",

        "description":"To assess the attitude of high school students toward travel away from their home school for vocational training, a two-part study was conducted. The objective of the first part was to determine the number of students in the State of Washington who actually traveled away from their home schools for vocational training and of the second part to identify those factors which influence students' decisions to travel or not. Primary sources of data included information from the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, earlier State studies, questionnaires, and telephone and personal interviews. A limitation of the study was that it was not based on a probability sample. It was found that while most students were willing to travel away from their home schools for  vocational training, few actually did so. Factors found to influence a student's decision to travel or not included lack of knowledge and awareness of courses offered away from the home school, inability to relate their future occupational goals to the vocational courses offered, and career counseling and recruitment efforts. Students were also found to prefer to travel to a vocational training institution other than a neighboring high school. Finally, it was concluded that the keys to successful skill center operations include maintaining a good program reputation, establishing a good communication network, insuring the strong commitment of the participating districts, and choosing a good location. Appendixes include survey forms and results of surveys of students, administrators,  counselors, and teachers. (Author/LMS)",

Their primary purpose was to provide an interdisciplinary approach to their teacher education programs by offering more relevant short-term inservice training for teachers and administrators who were beginning to incorporate career education into their respective classrooms and schools. The centers presented workshops during the summer of 1972, provided technical assistance to school districts through onsite visits during the school year, and coordinated the efforts of their own institutional departments in terms of career  education. In this final evaluation report, sections 1 and 2 describe the procedures used by the evaluation team in collecting and analyzing data obtained from the questionnaires mailed to both summer workshop participants and to nonparticipants. Sections 3 through 6 deal with data presentation, data interpretation, and evaluation findings on a component by component basis for each center. The data presentation and data interpretation for the questionnaire administered to superintendents and principals is described in section 7 along with the information obtained from the onsite interviews and related evaluation findings. Section 8 presents the major recommendations of the evaluation team based upon the evaluation findings. (WL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to evaluate the Boston Public Schools Career Exploration Project. The project model contained assumptions regarding need for a significant amount of funding, a teacher training program, phased implementation with a concentration of effort in pilot schools, substantial amounts of materials, creation of positions of leadership, creation of cross-disciplinary teams, and an evaluation component. The evaluation approach included 77 teacher interviews and 54 student interviews at the 12 pilot middle schools and 7 questionnaires completed by representatives of the 14 partial-implementation middle schools. Major findings and conclusions are (1) that the majority of teachers interviewed are using career education materials and have initiated career education  activities in their classes, (2) that the program has increased communication among school team members but still needs to involve more school staff, parents, and representatives of the business community, and (3) that six of the pilot schools now have career information centers. Although the overall model for change was mainly supported by the findings, a refocusing of effort is needed in the next phase with regard to identification and use of students' career choices and interests; greater emphasis on curriculum adaptation and development by individual teachers; time for increasing staff involvement in program development and coordination; and coordination of Boston and State fiscal and program planning efforts.

Following a brief introduction to career education, five components of career education program infusion are covered: (1) Planning a Career Education Program (a systems approach to implementing career education, and developing the implementation plan which involves developing a rationale for change, determining subject and grade level involvement, developing goals and objectives, determining staff  development needs, planning a staff development program, identifying curriculum areas that require revision, providing for resource materials, determining administrative procedures, obtaining and allocating resources, developing a time chart, determining assessment procedures, and ensuring program continuance and growth); (2) Organizing the Program (selecting a manager, establishing task forces and an advisory committee, selecting consultants, and establishing communications channels); (3) Obtaining Resources for the Program (budget categories and sources for funding and other resources); (4) Implementing the Program (getting started, staff development considerations, and materials development); and (5) Evaluating the Program (obtaining feedback, and designing the components for  evaluating program management, staff development, materials development, selection and use of materials, implementation, and instrumentation).

A list of six factors (administrative, personnel development, community, guidance, instructional, and curriculum) used to organize and structure school programs was prepared to direct the inquiry about cooperative activities (helpful relations, actions, and pursuits carried on between school resources and program factors which are aimed at the  accomplishment of a goal). Data were collected from six career education demonstration sites in southern California via a telephone interview with a site contact person followed by onsite systematic exploratory interviews with the contact person, school personnel, students and parents, and members of the business, industrial, labor, and general community. The nine promising school practices identified are curriculum legalization, communications, community resources, instructors' handbook, career guidance centers, careers fair, minisocieties, community classrooms, and construction technology. (Each practice is described and strategies for and considerations affecting implementation are discussed; six conclusions are presented; and the program factors, telephone interview form, and  systematic exploratory interview form and technique are appended.)

Data were collected by using ASVAB-Form 3 for all Air Force nonprior service enlisted accessions from September 1973 through October 1975. The analyses included 43 clusters of enlisted training courses (for example, intelligence, audiovisual, and weather). Both test data and educational background data proved useful for prediction of Air Force technical training performance; moreover, when used in  combination with each other, more accurate predictions were possible than through the use of either alone. Generally, test data alone provided more accurate predictions than did educational background alone. In many instances, separate race or sex group prediction equations were not homogeneous (i.e., the sub-group equations differed from each other enough that added accuracy in prediction could be achieved by using a separate equation for each sub-group). Predictions based on educational information were more susceptible to race bias than those based on test data. (Tables of data appear throughout the report.) (LMS)",

        "description":"Two Ohio State University commencement addresses, one by former Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz in March 1977 and the other by former President Gerald R. Ford in August 1974, deal with the topic of education and work. Willard Wirtz discusses the problems of unemployment among youth and the elderly and cites the need for national education/work policy to resolve the problems. He mentions programs suggested by President Carter and calls for a new economics which would recognize that there is a limitless amount that needs to be done in the country and in the world, and that while some natural resources are in critically short supply, the human resource is boundless. He suggests a viable economics that \"puts people in the first place instead of someplace else on down the line.\"  President Ford proposes a new partnership between labor and educators, suggesting that the universities open their doors to working men and women, not only as students but also as teachers, and that labor open its ranks to researchers and problem-solvers of the campuses whose research can give better tools and methods to workers. Ford says that he will ask Congress to extend two laws--one providing for higher education, the other for vocational education; and that he has asked the Secretaries of Commerce, Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare to report on new ways of bringing the world of work and the institutions closer together.

        "description":"The LORS technique is a combination of several techniques such as role projection, simulation, psychodrama, feedback, value clarification, role reversal, dramatization, decision making, process analysis, and others. The significant difference is that, when the techniques are used together, each often undergoes changes to the point that the effect upon participants is increased learning over any one technique used alone. The LORS technique necessitates preparation and causes participants to anticipate action which may or may not occur. As a result, the participants learn how they have produced or perhaps prevented anticipated actions from occurring. Since the LORS technique is a sequence of situations which are dramatized with preparation and discussions between each the students  often have extensive involvement with meaningful learning. The situations presented are in skeletal form with only the background information of what occurred to cause the group to come together. The particpants are identified with personality characteristics and/or specific information about background but not the detail description of values held and roles to be portrayed. Thus, each participant prepares for the situational dramatization according to his or her perceptions of what a person in that role would be like and how such a person would act within the situation. Reality testing is provided for those anticipated roles and outcomes as the dramatization unfolds. An interesting facet is that in the next situation the same character may be present but is to be portrayed by another  participant who must continue from where the \"characterization\" left off in the last situation.

Participants were 440 undergraduate students at the University of Wyoming. Each participant was given a description of a rape scene that varied along the dimensions of the first four factors of the design, and was then asked to answer questions about the victim, including a question of the degree of fault attributable to her. Significant effects on fault attribution were found for all factors except for the physical attractiveness of the victim. Discussion of the findings pointed to a discrepancy between legal and moral concepts of  justice and distortions that occur in attribution processes. The discrepancy between legal requirements for conviction based on victim resistance and advice that is given to women on how to deal with sexual assault was also discussed. Inaccuracies in attributions of fault and those aspects of rape statutes concerning victim resistance were criticized. (Author)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between four independent variables and a fifth dependent variable - juvenile delinquency. The four independent variables were: (1) perception by youth of parental acceptance or rejection; (2) normative orientation of parents--conformist or deviant; (3) normative orientation of reference others--conformist or deviant; and (4) the primary source of youth identification--parent or reference others. A theory was developed linking these five factors. Questionnaires were administered to 640 boys and girls in the ninth through the twelfth grades in three high schools and two drop-in centers in North Dakota. Findings revealed that responses to the four independent variables did discriminate between the respondents according to  their extent of delinquency involvement. The normative orientation of the youths reference others proved to be the best predictor followed by the parent-child relationships identification of the youth with reference others and parents delinquency. A multiple regression analysis revealed that all four of the independent variables acting together explained R=.605 of the variance in the dependent variable. A configuration table depicting all possible outcomes between the independent variables and the dependent variables indicated linearity and proved to be useful in predicting delinquent or conformist behavior.

The analysis reveals that a multidimensional conception of the adolescent role informs understanding of the dynamics of the status attainment process; that perceived peer status does not mediate antecedent effects on aspirations and attainments controlling on significant other influences; and that personality traits operate as selection mechanisms for peer group identifications, aspirations and attainments. The sample consists of a 17 year-old male age cohort of high school seniors studied in 1957 (N=442) and again 15 years later in 1972 (N=340). Estimates are based on structured equation models.

One such group is the population of community residents now being served by the Baer Consultation and Diagnostic unit of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center. These community residents have been referred to the Center primarily with problems of various degrees of organic brain syndrome. A brief description of the three-day evaluation procedure at the Center (which includes physical, social, and psychological services), the team conference, and the family conference is included. The presentation focuses on the on-going process of evaluating  available test instruments and either accepting, rejecting, or revising these for use with this particular population as well as the implementation of new, broad-range tools in the assessment package. The paper also describes the usefulness of the latter, in helping to make decisions in regard to treatment and/or alternative living arrangements for the population of elderly community residents served.

The arrangement of the list of nouns (randomized or completely categorized) and instructions (instructed that the nouns could be in terms of categories or not instructed) were manipulated as factors. Individuals participating in the categorized-instruction condition recalled an exceptionally high percentage of nouns and demonstrated a high degree of category clustering of those nouns. The results of the study were interpreted as indicating that the elderly person's performance when dealing with to-be-recalled stimulus material varies as a function of the organizational demands placed upon him.

Some enter the field with insincere motives -- martyrs looking for souls to save. Others cannot tolerate the stress. Persons who become counselors on alcoholism through personal and professional experience stand a better chance at becoming quality counselors in the field. Usually they are recovered alcoholics who practice A.A. principles and who have developed a \"forever student\" attitude about their role in the alcoholism profession. (NWS)",

Out of a total of 424 questionnaires, 301 (71%) were returned. Results indicated that 89% of the B.A. graduates were working full-or part-time; 16% of the women were in school full or part time; 10% listed their full-time employment; and only 3% of the graduates were not working or actively seeking employment. Among A.A. graduates 73% furthered their education--55% were working full-time, with 66% in school. Only 4% were unemployed and looking for work.  Almost 60% of the students had no previous work experience. Women graduates still predominate in the \"traditional\" areas of female employment (clerical, sales, teaching, and medical health related vocations). Specific suggestions are provided for increased emphasis on part-time and volunteer work, summer jobs, supervised internship, and expanded placement services, as ways to improve the employment outlook for women graduates.

The number of problems circled ranged from two to 90 with an average of 28 problems. Problems most frequently circled concerned personal, social, and course work areas. With the exception of the Education Methods students and their concern for obtaining a teaching contract, there were few differences in the problems reproted by the participants of this study and their predecessors of the 1960's.

        "description":"This paper examines some of the aspects of compliance, its antecedents and consequences, that emerged from a sutdy of 136, 2 1/2 year-old boys. The investigation studied parent-child interaction by means of naturalistic home observation, ratings based on observation and interviews, and experimental procedures. Four compliance criterion measures, including a rating of internalized standards (which was significantly associated with overt compliance) were correlated with other child and parent variables. Compliance was found to be positively correlated with child independence and maturity of speech and negatively with a rating of attachment. Multiple regression analyses of the criteria with parent variables indicated that consistently enforced discipline, psychological rewards,  encouragement of independence and maternal play contributed importantly to the positive prediction of compliance, whereas material rewards and physical and psychological punishments were negatively associated with it. A weak association between mother's education and compliance was noted. The findings of the correlational analysis support a cognitive theory of moral development and point to the importance of a consistent parental authority role. A sequence analysis, however, demonstrated effectiveness of 'power assertion' in the immediate stimuli controlling compliance. Implications for early development are discussed. (Author)",

It was assumed that the relations among items in multi-component line drawings are constrained by at least two organizational dimensions, structure and content, which influence retention of pictured information. Each subject viewed slides of structurally integrated and unintegrated versions of coherent and anomalous scenes. One component in each scene served as a target on a yes/no recognition test. With regard to the organizational dimensions, the results showed clear effects of scene content across developmental levels. Developmental differences were observed in two aspects of the recognition memory task: Kindergarteners used more  conservative response criteria than older subjects, and the recognition accuracy of college students was superior to that of the children.

Various infractions of school rules which can lead to placement in the behavior clinic are: truancy, fighting, use of obscene language, smoking, disrespectfulness, and/or suspension. During the 1975-76 school year, a random sample of 50 students in grades 7 through 12 was studied. The rating scales SPAT (School-Pupil-Attitude Teacher) and SPAS (School-Pupil-Attitude Student) were constructed by the researcher to be utilized by teachers and students. Sample rating scales are provided in the paper. Results indicate that both teachers and students feel that behavior clinics are worthwile and beneficial; however, clinics are not changing such feelings as \"loneliness\"  and \"pride,\" but may be giving reinforcement and support to positive attitude change.

While self-reports revealed egalitarian ideals, less than half the respondents perceived their current relationship as egalitarian in practice; rather, these relationships tended to be male-dominated. Behavioral measures of outcome power based on joint discussions by each couple aslo indicated slight male dominance. Interestingly, the sexes differed in verbal styles used to achieve power. Males rated as powerful by outside observers proposed more opinions and facts than their partners, whereas females rated as powerful opposed and questioned their partners. Little correlation was found between different measures of power, a result  which agrees with other research on power and suggests that power ideals, perceptions, outcomes, and styles are distinct domains of a multi-dimensional concept.

It is a community-based treatment center directed toward reeducating children with behavioral problems and their families so that future maladaptive behavior is unlikely to recur. The Project resources are designed to treat behavior disorders that may be a function of inappropriate learning, perceptual or learning disabilities or emotional adjustment difficulties. Program effects on the juvenile justice system are intended to: (1) reduce the necessity for interaction between law enforcement and children; (2) reduce the probability of adjudication by providing reasonable alternatives; and (3) prevent the necessity for  incarceration by providing appropriate treatment in the natural environment. Program objectives may be stated as : (1) to discover the ongoing antecedent behaviors that may lead to future antisocial behavior and result in a maladaptive life style; (2) to develop a comprehensive treatment program to correct antisocial development as early as possible; (3) to develop new resources and coordinate existing resources; and (4) to measure the effectiveness of the work.

        "description":"Two experiments were conducted to examine self-fulfilling expectancy influence in a simulated supervisor-worker interaction. The first experiment led supervisor subjects to expect either high or low compliance from their workers. All workers completed a set of five tasks twice, once when instructed to work fast and once when instructed to work accurately. Speed and accuracy of worker performance was measured, as was the frequency of supervisors' repetition of work instructions. Results indicated that expectancy influence was found only when workers were told to work fast on the first completion of the tasks, and that high-compliance expectation supervisors repeated work instructions more frequently than low-compliance expectation supervisors. A second experiment failed to  replicate the successful expectancy effects found in the first. However, results from the second experiment did confirm and extend earlier findings with respect to the cueing of expectations by supervisors, and the apparent awareness of these cues by workers. These two studies were interpreted to indicate that expectancy influence is fragile and difficult to demonstrate. They focus attention on the recipient of an expectancy communication, and they point toward overt mediation of expectations. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper provides a review of Benjamin Mendelsohn's delineation of a typology of criminal victims. The typology consists of six categories: (1) completely innocent victims; (2) victims with minor guilt; (3) voluntary victims; (4) victims more guilty than the offender; (5) victims who alone are guilty; and (6) the imaginary victims. It is noted by the author that of the six categories, only two are concerned with victims whose guilt is less than the guilt of the perpetrator, and an argument is presented that the strong orientation toward the culpability of the victim lies in the preponderance of rape studies on the victimology literature. It is suggested that one of the greatest needs in victimology is for data collection on victimization for a wide variety of offenses--rather  than primarily on rape which may not be generalizable.

An original measure consisting of four subscales was developed to assess individual differences in the theoretical, social, economic and aesthetic domains, and was administered to a student sample. Comparisons between split half reliabilities of each subscale, and correlations with other subscales support the hypothesis in the theoretical, social and aesthetic domains. Results are interpreted as indicating that tolerance for ambiguity may be stable within but not across experiential domains. It is suggested that appropriate measurement may best be achieved by conceptualizing tolerance for ambiguity as a domain specific trait.  (Author)",

        "description":"Unwed pregnancy in young women was conceptualized as a motivated goal interactively determined by both personality and situational factors. The primary behavioral correlate indicative of this predisposition is inadequate use of readily available birth control techniques (B.C.) for the sexually active female. In addition, sex frequency and the situational variable of degree of stability of the sexual relationship were also expected to be related to the motivation for motherhood. If this model is appropriate, then significant interactive differences should be found in fantasies about having children as a function of these variables, with stronger motivation (more fantasy) expected in inadequate B.C. users, involved in higher sex frequency, in more stable relationships. In addition  to the obvious fantasy effects, it was expected that motivational differences of the same sort would also be reflected by measures of sex role style and gender identification on a more unconscious level. Subjects were 129 sexually active unmarried college women. The evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that unwed pregnancy is a motivated event rather than simple bad luck. Conclusions also concern themselves with the possibility that situational events (stability of relationships) may change personality structure. (Author)",

The program varies in length, usually from six to eight weeks, depending upon the seriousness of the problem. In Alcohol Rehabilitation Centers (ARC) and Alcohol Rehabilitation Units (ARU) immediate health problems are attended to, diet is regulated and vitamin intake is managed. There are films, group therapy, psychodrama, relaxation therapy and individual counseling sessions. In addition, patients attend Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meetings up to five times a week. The booklet provides the names and locations of facilities around the world that make up NAPP. Counseling services are available to every Navy man or woman, regardless of type of duty or location.

Although first year results were encouraging in terms of counselor and staff reactions, the amount of computer use was only moderate. For the 1975-76 year, three of the four original colleges were retained in the demonstration; another was added; and a fifth project site was created. During 1975-76, the computer was used at the five sites by 1,165 different students for a total of 1,786 times. Considering only the performance of the three colleges involved in the demonstration both years, use of the computer in the second year increased by 93%.  Site-to-site variations in use were marked. Approximately two-thirds of the students using the computer were in occupationally-related or special programs. The largest student group using the computer was in its first semester. Different approaches to recruitment were tried, with special demonstrations and counselor referrals promoting the most use. Attitudes toward computerization remained positive. (Author/JLL)",

The results of this study of 103 6 through 12 year old children who were administered the WISC-R suggest that the discrepancy between scores on the verbal-performance sections and between subtests is generally no greater for the learning disabled group (above IQ of 80) than for the mentally retarded group (below IQ of 80). Therefore, the application of remediation techniques based on the  strengths and weaknesses found by use of profile analysis methods using WISC-R scores should not be discriminately applied to children scoring above a certain IQ criteria and not to their counterparts who score below the criteria for labeling as learning disabled.

        "description":"The primary goal of research performed in Oakland, California was decision models for four felony classes--robbery, assault, with a deadly weapon, car theft, and rape--to determine cases having sufficient probability of clearance to warrant intensive investigation. A secondary objective, determination of personal-appearance and crime-event descriptors contributing to offender ID and case solution by investigators, led to consideration of the value of computers in the investigative function. Only for robbery it was found feasible to construct a decision model. Primary case-solution factors, e.g., victim knowledge of offender, statistically dominated other, random factors. The findings showed that, unless offender ID was made by responding officers, case solution at the detective  level was minimal. Therefore, it was concluded that patrol and investigative functions cannot be viewed as completely separate. Documentation of relevant crime scene information by patrol heavily influences case solution by investigators. The findings reinforced the importance of a national issue: habitual offenders. Analyses of the felony case sample drawn showed 80-88% of the suspects had prior offenses. Confronted by similar experience many police agencies have turned to computer-based M.O.-type investigative systems to assist in tracking and models for four felony classes--robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, car theft, and identifying known offenders.

Subjects were 108 girls at a state institution for juvenile offenders and 83 girls randomly selected from an urban high school in a predominantly lower status area. Age range was 12-19. Questionnaires were administered to both groups to see if girls were involved primarily with status offenses, incorrigibility, etc., as depicted in the literature, or whether there were girls who had gotten involved in crimes generally considered\"masculine.\" Results indicate that while most of the girls in the institution had committed many of the \"traditional\" female offenses, there was evidence of significant involvement in more serious crimes as well.

The new master plan for Special Education in California calls for at least two levels of assessment, one to be implemented in a school appraisal team, including teachers, program and resource specialists, and an administrator. More serious problems are to be referred to an educational assessment service that provides specialized evaluation by psychologists, physicians, and other professionals. For the first time it seems that some real consideration is being given toward providing a built-in system at the school level for assessment of student academic skills as the need becomes apparent. It seems logical that such a comprehensive evaluation procedure should be  an integral part of any educational setting which attempts to deal with students as individuals. (Author)",

The major reasons for writing the contract included apprehension about the pre-marital socialization system in our society, concerns regarding marital role agreements, and as an alternative to the present marriage arrangement. Reactions can be summarized as being generally negative in that most couples interviewed felt it was too inflexible, and detrimental to the future success of the marriage by discussing, in advance, the possibility of termination. However, the major positive reaction was that all of the couples felt that it would be a very worthwhile idea for couples who were  seriously considering marriage to be exposed to the contract for reasons of clarification of role expectations, marital obligations, financial expectations, etc. This point was reenforced by a divorcee who felt that such an exposure would have made a significant impact on his earlier marriage; quite likely he would not have married.

The therapeutic role which involves expressing affection and giving tender care to children is assumed primarily by the mother. Men appear to be sheltered by their wives from any degree of involvement with their children. Ideally, men ought to be free, if they choose, to go beyond the limits of the traditional masculine role and become more fully involved in child rearing roles. Recent literature is suggesting that men are assuming a more expressive posture with their children. This is, in part, due to the increasing number of working mothers who are asking their husbands to become more involved with the children and, in part, due to the women's  liberation movement. Recent research on widowers indicates that the existing notions about men not being capable or desirous of parenting at the expressive level is highly questionable. (Author)",

The TEP effort represents an attempt to develop competencies of scientific inquiry and other applications of transactional concepts. Competency areas are described at a level intended to be specific enough to have clear  meaning, but not so detailed as to be unnecessarily inflexible or unwieldy in application.

In the first part of this study, those cases were divided into halves, with each half randomly selected so as to provide proportional representation from each of nine mental health agency types. Then, both halves were factor analyzed using three different rotational methods in order to determine which method most reliably reproduced which  factors in both samples. It was found that the orthogonal rotation most reliably replicated four factors. In the second part of the study, the entire sample was factor analyzed, and factor scores for each of the four most reliable factors were recorded for each case.

In 1976, by Presidential proclamation, Americans were urged to focus attention on the issues concerning older people. NRTA accepted this charge with an added dimension: to encourage high school students to initiate meetings with older people, in an educational setting, to discuss the issues. The anticipated outcome was increased awareness and understanding. This report is based on information received from high schools by April 15, 1976. From frequently-reported statements a clear pattern emerges: the Youth Conferences offered a valued and much-enjoyed learning experience for both groups  of participants, the youth and the older people.

        "description":"Vanguards in Training presents, in summary form, the National Training System's (NTS) Training Grant Program supported throughout the Nation by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to increase the skills, career mobility, and credentials of drug abuse prevention, treatment, and research personnel. The program summaries speak for themselves and give evidence of the time and effort given by program directors and their staffs. The NTS reflects the philosophy of career development found in each of the Branch's programs, and the conviction that training involves not only learning and development of skills but also the acquisition of credentials. Therefore, each training program supported by the Institute is concerned with the full development of the trainee. A resume of the  purposes, provisions, and requirements for the Training Grant Program is described in the first section of this document. Summaries of individual projects which have been funded under each type of grant are then presented by state. Projected summaries were drawn from material available to the MTB at the time of initial funding; project outcomes are not included in the summary statements. (Author)",

It was initiated to gather in detail the extent and dimensions of alcohol and drug use among a sample of New York students in grades seven through twelve. This survey was conceived as a benchmark study--to establish a statistical baseline against which trends could be measured. The report is organized into three parts: (1) sample and methodology; (2) questionnaire construction and application; and (3) findings. (Author/YRJ)",

It also seeks to learn which prevention program topics the students desire. Further, the report addresses the issue of the credibility of various sources of information on drugs and the people who are, in the eyes of youngsters surveyed, the helpers. This information has direct pragmatic value, since it speaks to drug and alcohol use from a perspective that should yield pathways to timely and meaningful intervention. (YRJ)",
