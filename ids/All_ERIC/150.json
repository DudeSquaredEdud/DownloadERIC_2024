A complete review of, and recommendations with respect to, the property tax are contained in the first part. School finance and a detailed proposal for local option equalization with projections through 1985 for each town are contained in the second part. Proposals for reform of the assessment system, including an estimate of revenues presently being lost through improper (and unlawful)  underassessments are set forth in the third part. A recommendation for a Uniform Municipal Practices Act dealing with referendum requirements, town budgets, and town financial reporting is contained in the final section. (Author/JF)",

This volume (the third of three) is in three parts. The first part reviews State-level taxation on individuals. It evaluates the impact of the sales tax, compares it to other States, and offers an alternative to the present 7 percent rate. A review of the need for a personal income tax is contained in this section, and recommendations against its adoption are presented. This first part also contains the Commission program for elimination of the tax on dividends, while increasing  the tax on net long-term capital gains. The second part describes the need for business tax reform and offers programs designed to stimulate business expansion, retooling, modernization of equipment, etc.--all designed to create more jobs for Connecticut workers. The final part sets forth a variety of procedural reforms designed to simplify the revenue code and appeals procedures. (Author/JF)",

Nor does such a rule or regulation deny a parent all control of the education of his child.

Eight new towns were chosen to provide a fair sample as to stage of development, location, management, and attention to the arts. This report also relates experiences in other settings--small towns, big cities, and the suburbs--of programs, support, planning, and facilities that could be applicable to new towns.

        "description":"Although the practice of rotating principals among schools (i.e., systematically reassigning principals among schools on a regular basis) has been the subject of much rhetoric, a sparsity of research on this subject has been reported in the literature. Consequently, in a 1973 survey of the 585 school systems in the nation enrolling 12,000 or more pupils and a selected sample of 201 smaller school systems, a question was included to discover if a school district had a procedure that calls for the systematic rotation of principals among schools on a regular basis. Copies of available policies or guidelines governing the rotation procedures also were requested. Replies were received from 468 of the 786 systems, and the statements of all the respondents to the inquiry favored the  systematic rotation of principals and centered around the phrase &quot;for the professional improvement of the principal.&quot; The rotation of principals initially was reported by 25 of the respondents; however, in a followup mailing to the 25 school systems, three reported that their replies had been in error, two indicated that their rotation systems rarely were used, and five did not respond. The remaining 15 school systems responded affirmatively to both the inquiry and the followup mailing. This publication is based on the 15 affirmative responses, on information from selected journal articles, and a study completed by the Minneapolis Public Schools. (Author/EA)",

Three school districts--Port Huron, Northville, and Utica--selected the four-quarter mandated design for their K-12 studies. Under this plan, students are divided into four groups and assigned by family units to attend three of four quarters on a staggered basis. The Freeland school district selected the mandated trimester design which calls for the division of a lengthened school year into three 78-day trimester segments. Students attend school seven hours a day for two trimesters. The Ann Arbor school district selected a modified  split-trimester design in which students attend five of six 36-day blocks in a year. The Okemos, East Lansing, and Haslett school districts selected the five term or continuous school year design for their cooperative secondary study. Under this plan, students may attend four or five 9-week terms a year. The report describes the nature of the communities involved, how the communities were informed of each plan, community attitudes and vacation preferences, and the implications of the extended school year for school finance.

The first plan, a 5-term design adopted by the tri-districts of East Lansing, Okemos, and Haslett, offers students a choice of attending any four out of five 9-week terms or all five terms if they desire to graduate early or take enrichment courses. The Northville 45-15 plan report deals mainly with reactions from staff, participating and nonparticipating parents, in addition to providing some cost benefit analysis. Also reviewed are the evaluation studies of three other extended school year plans currently in operation--the Valley View  45-15 plan in Lockport, Illinois; the 45-15 plan of the Dale City section of the Prince William County Public Schools, Virginia; and the Quinmester plan of Dade County, Florida.

It can provide a means of periodically monitoring achievement in the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. The program is modeled after the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), an ongoing educational project designed to give educators and the lay public a better look at those knowledges and skills that American youth have acquired. NAEP provides for a systematic, continuous, census-like survey of knowledges, skills, understandings, and attitudes as exhibited by students and young adults in four age levels and across ten different subject areas. By following the NAEP model, Minnesota can hopefully reduce the Minnesota student  assessment results to NAEP results for students in the nation as a whole, as well as for those in the Central Region; and take advantage of exercise administration, data collection, sampling, and data analysis methodologies developed by NAEP.

        "description":"Any attempt to derive conclusions from the literature regarding leadership in education is limited because much of the literature consists of untested opinion and most empirical studies are based on information from one school or one school district and are thus very limited. Most studies utilize variables that are unique to the particular study and/or are nontheoretical, thus providing little in the way of a framework for integrating findings from different studies. Generally, studies fail in specifying the conditions under which a relationship between variables is tested, thereby running the risk that an actual relationship is undetected; and investigators tend to use perceptions of involved persons rather than observations by a third party as sources of information regarding  variables, thus making findings subject to the attitudes or the memory of participants in the organization. In many cases, information regarding both variables is obtained from the same respondents, thus inflating the obtained measure of relationship because of a response set. Finally, the models used for differentiating among behavior patterns provide for limited alternatives and frequently involve one specified behavior (with the only other option being the absence of the one specified), thus running the risk of not differentiating what are actually meaningfully different behaviors.

Although the use of a systems approach in public programs is just beginning, it seems to hold considerable promise for education. Hence, the Nevada State Department of Education has designed a model for systematic, comprehensive educational program planning and evaluation which should be applicable to educational problems at any level of operation or complexity. The model provides seven basic steps for a systematic approach to problem solving: needs assessment, problem definition, program development, program operation and evaluation, final analysis of evaluative data, dissemination, and  recycle. The approach is predicated on the existence of a workable relationship between goals and objectives. (Author/WM)",

Boards wanting to meet their goal-setting responsibilities should consider the following: \"goals\" are general statements of what ought to be, rather than what has to be; goals are, by their very nature, expressions of policy; the process of identifying and reaching consensus on goals requires the broad involvement of staff members, the public, and students; attainable objectives should be set consistent with these goals so that some measure  of progress towards those goals can be attained.

Traditional solutions, continually increasing costs, and the need for greater emphasis on the learning environment provided the impetus for focusing attention on the options for local determination with minimum emphasis on regulating procedures. Project findings reveal that the design of new flexible facilities for career education requires space management--matching students' learning needs (curriculum) with the things of learning (space, tools, aids), placing them within a time frame (schedule), and doing this all within an allotted budget. Suggestions  and building designs are offered for flexible facilities into which an almost infinite variety of settings can be placed that include delivery of the services necessary for facility operation without destroying the universal quality of the space.

Traditional solutions, continually increasing costs, and the need for greater emphasis on the learning environment provided the impetus for focusing attention on the options for local determination with minimum emphasis on regulating procedures. This document explores questions that should be asked about the construction of a career preparation center--whether it be a new building, an addition, or the remodeling of an existing facility. Some of these probes concern the kind of building to be built, the method to be used in its construction, and whether  time and/or cost are of the utmost importance. In answer to such questions, the author explores some of the new concepts that have been emerging and developing in the construction process, such as systems building, fast track scheduling, construction management, and the \"recycling\" of existing buildings.

Doe. Peter Doe had graduated with average grades, had never encountered serious disciplinary problems, and had maintained a regular attendance. Reading specialists who examined the plaintiff after his graduation from high school indicated that he was reading at the fifth grade level. The plaintiff later subscribed to reading tutoring and made significant progress. The complaint presented nine legal grounds of school district liability in the four general areas of negligence, misrepresentation, breach of statutory duties, and constitutional deprivation of right to  education. At the conference recorded here, Ms. Martinez and a number of educational experts discussed the case and its implications for the future of litigation in this area. (Author/JF)",

Everyone connected with the management of an independent school has something to learn about a budget, the most obvious person being the new headmaster. Similarly, all department heads, the librarian, the athletic director, the members of the faculty-salary committee, a beginning teacher full of enthusiasm about a new film program, perhaps a student leader concerned about getting things done and trying to learn how things get done. In short, anyone needing school money for school purposes or responsible for its expenditure can do his educational job better if he understands the workings of the school's budget. This booklet is planned with all of these persons in mind.  Discussed are timing; the roles of staff, faculty, and trustees in preparing the budget: the effect of faculty salaries on the budget; the preliminary budget; and budget control.

This is the first in a series of comprehensive ERS national studies of salaries and fringe benefits for administrative and supervisory personnel in public schools. This report gives precise information for school districts responding to a national survey of a stratified random sample of large, medium, and small school systems. The major part of the report consists of a system-by-system listing of the 562 districts that furnished usable salary schedule information. The listing gives each system's minimum and maximum scheduled salaries for associate and/or deputy superintendents, assistant superintendents, and certain other central-office  positions; and scheduled minimum and maximum salaries for supervising and assistant principals. Salaries shown for superintendents are salaries actually being paid since the salaries of superintendents are usually based on an individual contract with the school board. The listing also includes detailed information regarding the scheduling of salaries for principals (e.g., differentials for days on duty, academic preparation levels, and size of school to which assigned). Also, methods of structuring schedules based on their relationship, or lack of relationship, to the schedules for teachers are shown in the listing. Summary tables are included that show mean, median, and ranges of minimum salaries scheduled and maximum salaries scheduled in reporting systems. (Author)",

There is general agreement that educational development has not achieved the status now accorded to the general avocation of research by educators. This appears to be the result of a relatively short history and a lack of preciseness in the description of the developmental process. The recent institutionalization of the educational research and development process by Congress and the U. S. Office of Education through the establishment of the educational R&D centers and regional educational laboratories has resulted in a convergence of opinion on what constitutes educational development as well as a clarification of which organizations should  be primarily responsible for the development function in education. Moreover, the pre-eminence of the Federal Government in specifying the direction of educational research and development through its funding of programs and projects indicates that political considerations are likely to continue to influence the growth and direction of educational development in the United States. The recommendation is made that managers of educational developmental programs adopt strategies which will support a mix of both small- and large-scale developmental projects. (Author)",

It is also a set of recommendations on how to make such educational field experiences a central aspect of the curriculum in order to obtain maximum benefit from such involvement in the community. The proposal is designed to encourage school district administrators and teachers to offer practical programs carefully planned to use community resources effectively. It is not a suggestion for schools to increase the frequency of the typical unplanned field trip. Inherent in this proposal is the belief that the common perceptions of educators as to what constitutes a relevant education for young people today need  re-examination. It is the position of this proposal that such a process of re-examination dictates the need for a major reconstruction of the teaching-learning process and the relationship between the school and the community. The educational field experiences suggested for students in this proposal are not to be viewed as \"add-ons\" to the existing instructional program, but rather, as experiences, to be made the foundation of as much of the school program as possible.

Several research studies are cited which give support to the point of view that leadership characteristics of a group are invested in the followership. A person may lead, but to be followed, the leader must accept, or seem to accept, the tradition, norms, and goals of the group and assist the group in achieving the purpose the group has identified. Compatibility between the principal and the teachers in terms of close agreement of educational philosophy would appear to be necessary conditions so that a principal might function effectively. Computer matching is suggested as a vehicle for achieving the needed conditions for fostering  educational change through the leadership of the principal. (Author)",

This report describes a case study carried out in Chicago, in which an integer programing technique was used to investigate a basic problem in planning allocation of attendance areas. The study demonstrates that programing techniques can also be useful for planning public facilities such as schools. While the  particular results reported are specific to the case study, the mathematical model described and tested is generic and can readily be adapted to other areas. (Author)",

        "description":"The fiscal neutrality standard established by courts in recent cases holds that the level of spending for a child's education may not be a function of wealth other than the wealth of the State as a whole. In most States, funds for capital improvements in school districts are even more closely tied to district wealth than are funds for operating expenses. This report examines school construction expenditure trends in several States and discusses several proposals for equalizing expenditures. These proposals include full State funding, power equalizing, and minimum foundation plans. (JF)",

        "description":"A number of educational finance proposals suggest that the State become the primary collector and dispenser of revenue to support public education. Under such proposals the State would become, in effect, the employer for collective bargaining purposes. Accordingly, this paper deals with representation issues, the scope of bargaining, and problems of resolving bargaining impasses. It also discusses the implications of State funding and Statewide collective bargaining. The main argument advanced in support of State assumption of all or nearly all costs supporting public education is that only through such a device can equality of educational opportunity be achieved. With the present inequality of wealth among school districts, one premise follows--that there is a close correlation  between district wealth and educational opportunity. It follows because teachers are the chief ingredient of any educational enterprise, and some mechanism must be found to distribute teaching talent more equally; poor teachers should not be concentrated in the poor districts, while good teachers are concentrated in the rich ones. A Statewide collective bargaining arrangement providing for uniform conditions of employment would, according to this argument, take the comparative advantage away from the affluent districts and thereby promote greater equality. The concluding sections of this paper present comments critical of that proposed remedy. (Information on pages 48-67 not complete on this copy. (Author)",

The bill provides for approximately 50 percent State funding of K-12 current operating expenses and incorporates the power equalizing principle for those districts that wish to make expenditures greater or less than the median school district in its size class.

        "description":"This paper describes the development of school finance reform in Oregon from 1968 through legislative enactments in 1973 and proposals for the voters in 1974. The first section describes the 1973 school finance reform proposal, rejected by voters, as it was originally submitted (whereby the State would have assumed 95 percent of the operating costs of the local schools in Oregon.) The proposal's provisions for raising State and local school revenue and tax relief, its effect on selected school districts, and its legal implications are examined. A supplementary paper describes the three phases of State school finance reform legislation approved in 1973. The first phase provides for adjustments in both personal and corporate taxes and in property tax relief. A proposed  constitutional amendment to provide for structural changes in school district financing constitutes phase two. The third phase represents a legislative proposal that, if passed by the voters, will provide for changes in the personal and corporate tax rates to provide for 50 percent State support of public elementary and secondary education. This portion of the presentation also describes the impact of the proposed legislation on selected school districts and compares the new laws and proposals with previous reform attempts.

        "description":"This paper provides background information relating to a school finance reform movement in Utah and describes the passage of a 1973 bill that provides a power equalizing system to redistribute excess revenue from local taxes in combination with State uniform school funds for a guaranteed program to all districts. The law should bring the level of expenditure in the less affluent districts up to the level of the more affluent districts, provide for additional increases in all districts, provide extra support in those districts that have higher cost per student than the average, and relieve all students up through high school of any requirement to pay special fees or charges for their education. The paper describes the law's provisions for raising local school revenues for current  operations and for capital outlay and debt service, for local property tax administration, and for property tax relief. The principal State aid program is described in detail along with the program's effect on selected districts. The document concludes with a discussion of the new law's legal implications.

In spite of mechanization and technological developments, 'the person' still represents the major facet of productivity, and 'people' comprise the very purpose of education. In Ohio, an attempt has been made to develop a career continuum as a thrust in education to lead youth to a point of career choice; provide at the high school level a means of preparation for work or further education; and provide a continuing education program throughout adult life for either technical education, collegiate education, upgrading existing work, or retraining for new occupations. The vocational program is a broad program in which any boy or girl who wants to enroll can find a place.

This paper is concerned with the structure of delivery systems whereby services are provided to pupils. Specifically it deals with the re-emergence of the intermediate educational unit as a viable alternative system for the provision of cooperative services to local school districts. Wisconsin's cooperative educational service agencies (CESAs) are described structurally and functionally from a general perspective. In addition, the cooperative services provided for educationally disadvantaged and handicapped children are examined in greater detail. Case studies of ESEA Title I and special education  cooperative programs in two CESAs are also included as examples of the potential of regional agencies regarding the provision of differential services to children with special educational needs.

Because of the wide variation of State laws and the inherent vulnerability of school children and of any vehicle stopping on a highway, there can be no justification for the position that everyone is presumed to know the law and that nonuniformity is therefore not significant. School bus regulation must obtain a degree of conformity in basic requrements so that all drivers know what obligations they have when meeting or overtaking a school bus. Uniform regulations would promote the safety of passengers in the bus, pedestrians near the bus, and of drivers approaching school buses in all  States. Thus, the author advocates that each State should amend its laws to conform with the school bus stopping provisions in the latest edition of the Uniform Vehicle Code. (Author/MLF)",

In addition, the reports turned out to have considerable appeal  to community, parent groups, central office personnel--as well as for the principals and assistant principals.

The goal for language development is given to be increase in effectiveness and accuracy in handling both receptive and expressive language. Activities are presented by name or purpose, materials needed, procedure, and in some cases variations. Given are activities for identifying sounds, following directions, playing an animal game, playing a noise game, matching objects or pictures, imitating action, recognizing similarities and differences, and responding to soft and loud sounds. Also offered are activities such as responding to whispered instructions, answering questions posed through the medium of a tape recorder,  developing extended conversations, and playing guessing games. Other activities included emphasize categorization, experience with tactile blocks, spatial concepts, breath control, picture recall, dramatic play, a puppet show, and telephone use with real telephones (if possible). Directions accompany the language assessment chart which is designed to be a quickly administered individual evaluation for weekly assessment of 32 skills such as referral to self with pronouns and ability to increase volume of speaking voice.

        "description":"Presented by handicapping condition are program standards in Ohio for public special education of exceptional children, 6 to 18 years of age, and for legal dismissal from school attendance. The state board of education is said to be authorized by the state legislature to prescribe and adopt standards, grant permission to local school districts to operate programs, and to provide services for handicapped students. Program standards are given for the following handicaps: aural handicaps, physical handicaps, visual handicaps, multiple handicaps, learning and behavioral disabilities, emotional disturbance, and mental handicaps (educable only). Also, standards are given for speech, language, and hearing services; school psychological services; transportation; individual instructional  services; individual supplemental services; and legal dismissal from school attendance. Typically specified in relation to handicapping condition are general guidelines for the special education unit; eligibility; assessment and placement; aspects of the comprehensive program (including services); class size and age range; housing, facilities, equipment, and materials; the educational program; supervision and other support staff; and qualifications for teachers, aides, therapists, and volunteers. Specified for severely handicapped students are standards for individual instructional services such as home or telephone instruction and supplemental tutoring. It is explained that legal dismissal from school concerns school age children with IQ levels under 50 and is based upon evidence of  psychological evaluation, trial placement in programs, and conferences with parents.

        "description":"A sample of approximately 385 hearing-impaired elementary and secondary school students whose mathematical achievement ranged from second to sixth grades were examined to determine the effectiveness of a computer assisted elementary mathematics program on the acquisition of computational skills. The students selected were from a population of over 2000 students in 15 schools for the deaf in four states and the District of Columbia. The curriculum provided for individualized instruction, acceleration in areas of proficiency, drill in areas of deficiency, and daily reports in profile form on student progress. The curriculum was composed of the following 14 sequential mathematical strands: number concepts, horizontal addition, horizontal subtraction, vertical addition, vertical  subtraction, equations, measurement, horizontal multiplication, laws of arithmetic, vertical multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, and negative numbers. Five groups of 77 students each were assigned 10, 30, 70, 100, and 130 sessions on the computer. Major results of pretest and posttest data indicated that the computer assisted curriculum enabled hearing-impaired students to achieve gains expected of normally hearing students, that greater numbers of sessions on the computer were beneficial for all students, and that the gains could be achieved in short sessions of 6 to 10 minutes per day.

        "description":"Computer graphics representing the alphabet used by deaf persons for manual communication were used in the FINGEX experiment, which measured Ss' ability to read fingerspelled sentences at different rates of speed, and in the CONFUS experiment, which measured similarities between fingerspelled characters by assessing confusion caused by rapid character presentation. In the FINGEX experiment, six hearing Ss who knew the manual alphabet completed 21 sessions in which they chose the best of four words to complete 40 sentences fingerspelled on the display. Results indicated that the Ss performed better at the 1.3 character per second (cps) rate than at the 1 cps rate, that performance at the 2 cps rate was almost as good as performance at slower rates, and that large gains over the  training period at the 4 cps rate might have reflected delays between sessions and differences in Ss' fingerspelling ability. In the CONFUS experiment, 3 deaf and 12 hearing Ss completed 31 sessions, each lasting approximately 10 minutes, in which each fingerspelled character was randomly presented five times for 50 milliseconds. Disappearance of each character was accompanied by noise. The time between the noise pattern and the Ss' typing of the character corresponding to the character on the display was measured. Results indicated that object confusions within character clusters were high (such as in the cluster composed of S, N, T, and A, which differ in thumb position only), and that confusions between clusters were low. Overall results implied that the computer-generated alphabet was  a useful tool for teaching fingerspelling and for obtaining empirical measures of character similarity. (MC)",

The communication processes in the manual are said to have been derived from the clinical model of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. The format of the manual, which is divided into a section on curriculum and a section on language; the paginal cross-reference system; and the presentation of activities according to a hierarchy of increasing difficulty are explained. Suggestions are made regarding teaching style, activity management, and behavioral management through environmental structure.  Directions, materials, and resources for activities that develop visual and auditory reception and association, manual and verbal expression, visual and grammatic closure, visual and auditory memory, auditory closure, and sound blending are given for the following curriculum areas: color, food, animals, toys, clothes, seasons, shapes, sizes and basic measurement, family, houses and homes, community helpers, senses, transportation, body parts, and opposites and analogies. Each section on an area of language to be strengthened, such as manual expression, is preceded by an introduction which defines the area, suggests a sampling procedure such as asking the child to show use of a comb to assess capabilities in the area, lists skills required for proficiency, and to illustrate approaches to  arrangement of pictures or objects that are appropriate for activities.

Major theories such as the cultural deviance theory are noted in the introduction by D.R. Mitchell. J. E. Ritchie defines delinquency as law breaking, critiques delinquency research, and offers a paradigm of social forces for analysis. Considered by B. C. Atwool is whether punitive measures and isolation can be reconciled with effective therapy for institutionalized delinquents. Sociological perspectives of delinquency are examined by D. Chapple. Among recommendations for the prevention of delinquency by I.J. McKissack is prevention of opportunities for crime and refinement of methods for dealing with distrubed offenders.  Procedures of the New Zealand courts in dealing with juvenile delinquents are reviewed by A. C. Rounthwaite. R. A. Austin gives a critical look at the rationale and efficacy of the legislative and punitive approach to delinquency. B. S. Parsonson reviews applications of behavior modification to delinquent behaviors. The previous seven papers are assessed by J. F. Thompson who notes the common assumption of delinquency as a social problem, I. J. McKissack responds to Thompson's comments and defends his concept of social maturity. (DB)",

The children in the first study were rated on the performance objectives before and after 7 months of program participation. Scores were compared with normal developmental norms for nonhandicapped children. The scale evaluated the following areas: socialization, daily living skills, motor development, perceptual abilities, and language development. Greatest mean progress tended to occur in perceptual abilities (15 months) and socialization (14 months) while least progress was made in language development  (9 months). Eating and toileting skills showed the greatest progress among areas of daily living skills. In the motor development section greater progress was found for fine motor control than for gross motor skills which were at a higher level at both pretesting and posttesting. The children in the program progressed at a rate greater than would be expected from normally developing children suggesting that the handicapped children are &quot;catching up&quot; to their normally developing peers. Results of the second study should provide more complete data on subgroups of deaf blind children. The Azusa scale was found to be appropriate for measuring developmental progress, improving instruction, and evaluating programs for deaf blind children. (DB)",

        "description":"Emotional problems and behavioral patterns of parents who have deaf blind children are described clinically and in short case studies. Deaf blind young children are said to be isolated from their families due to lack of sensory cues; to display behaviors such as back arching and fear of walking; and to experience frequent health crises such as heart involvement. Stress in parents is described in relation to the mother's feelings (such as prenatal expectation of a perfect child) and the narcissistic insult she suffers when the child is defective. Discussed is the normal mourning period both parents experience which involves three sequential elements: numbness, disbelief, and withdrawal from the outside world; disappointment and feeling of loss with accompanying affective and  physical symptoms; and intense re-experiencing of memories and expectations. It is maintained that mourning must be understood by both the helping professional and the mourner to allow defense mechanisms to organize and that only as the parents learn to cope with their feelings can they help the handicapped child. Five case studies are presented that show different affective reactions of parents. Given in one example is the case of 17-year-old Dave whose parents cannot surmount disappointment, pain, and anger and thus are unaware of Dave's needs to socialize even though Dave uses oral expressive language and braille and is on his way to college. Concern is expressed for disadvantaged families, and agencies are urged to assume responsibility for any child or family that seeks help.  (MC)",

Etiological factors are given which include maternal rubella (accounting for 27 children), meningitis, prematurity, neonatal anoxia, and Rh incompatability. Discussed are the following testing procedures: pure tone audiometry (which is not appropriate for children with minimal or no hearing and vision); play audiometry, such as dropping a block in a bucket, a procedure said to be useful for children above 2 years of age but to have limitations in an outpatient setting because extensive training sessions are required; conditioned orientation response audiometry, which was effective for 25 children who perceived the light  stimulus; impedance audiometry, involving use of an electroacoustic bridge for obtaining data from both ears (22 of 24 children tested showed middle ear involvement); and behavior observation audiometry, for detection of overt responses such as startle reflexes or cessation of an activity in very young or otherwise untestable children. Some of the results indicated that 22% of the children had hearing sensitivity within the range of normal limits, but had problems other than blindness that precluded language and speech development; that two children were untestable; and that of 37 children with significant hearing loss, 62% were in the severe to profound range (10 were rubella children).

Medical factors are examined in relation to frequent hospitalization of the rubella children before 18 months of age. One of the case studies shows how young adult parents were so traumatized by their infant's hospitalizations (69 days) that they were unable to use medical or educational assistance for 7 years. Economic factors are said to involve expenses for many specialists: cited is the case of a 4-year old child whose parents worked to meet surgery expenses and were denied public assistance because their combined income was above the poverty line. Emotional factors are described to include initial shock of  parents on learning their child is defective and subsequent behavior, such as withdrawal and resentment, which complicates the child's need for a close relationship. A further stress is attributed to the lack of affectionate behavior, typical of deaf blind children. Illustrative of additional stresses on parents is the screaming, flooping, or seizure-like behavior of a 2-year-old who later, at 4 years of age, showed some affection for her grandfather but none for her mother. Professional factors are described in a case study showing the dilemma of parents who attempt to follow conflicting professional advice. Professionals are advised to be sensitive to perceptual differences and to work out a plan of action toward mutual goals to help families with handicapped children. (MC)",

Noted in two greetings are types of aides such as audiovisual aides or lunchroom aides in New York public schools, amendments to education laws that focus on teacher aide certification, and the functions of the interstate certification project. In the keynote address, Dr. Joseph Halliwell discusses widespread confusion over the role of aides and outlines a procedure for the training and effective utilization of aides. Considered in a presentation on teacher aides in public schools are recruitment and selection, role definition, training, and evaluation. Teacher aides  and the medical model are the subjects of the following paper. Reported upon is a workshop for participants to discuss the role of aides with emotionally disturbed children and to discover individual talents for better aide utilization. Focused upon in a panel discussion are such topics as goal setting for emotionally disturbed children and the career ladder for aides. Additional paper is included in which is is maintained that putting aides on the career ladder compromises teaching as a profession. In a conference evaluation it is reported that participants were generally enthusiastic despite an unsatisfied expectancy for learning how to handle emotionally disturbed children. (MC)",

The author describes a completely automated closed-field maze series for rats developed to counter inaccuracies among observers using a conventional maze. It is reported that experiments with 130 rats to determine the cause of pica (the voluntary ingestion  of lead by children) showed that calcium-deficient rats ingested significantly more lead than non-deficient or iron-deficient rats. Experiments attempting to produce picas in adult rats by conditioning procedures were said to have negative results. The most severe effects of protein malnutrition on learning ability were found to occur when the malnutrition was imposed prenatally. (DB)",

Project purposes are described in terms of a system of evaluating and field testing educational materials (such as captioned films) and effective teaching techniques with handicapped children. The 14-step evaluation model is explained to begin with the assessment of curriculum and learner needs and end with final decisions regarding material acquisition and utilization. Investigations concerning the evaluation design and technique (pretest-treatment-posttest) are discussed as are questions of sample size, item number, and differences among population subgroups.  Investigations of testing effects with EMH children are said to have centered on the effects of pretesting and the effects of response modalities (whether at the computer terminal or by paper and pencil). Vocabulary level is seen to have been investigated through the validation of an available vocabulary list and the development of computerized techniques to process narrative texts by word frequency and level of difficulty. It is reported that investigations concerning children's responses revealed that responses tended to be short and failed to exhibit understanding of important concepts. Also noted are teacher reactions and attitudes to the films. (DB)",

        "description":"Presented is evidence on the increasing need to plan for the accommodation of the physically handicapped in the design and construction of present and future public buildings and transportation facilities in Canada. Terms such as &quot;architectural barriers&quot; and &quot;disability&quot; are defined. Statistics on disability incidence in Canada (one out of seven persons) are presented and reasons for the increase such as improved medical care and motor vehicle accidents are suggested. Psychological effects of architectural barriers are seen to include an increased sense of isolation and dependency. Recreation is thought to play an important role in the social life of the handicapped and to require more accessible facilities. Negative effects of architectural barriers on the economy are  illustrated by hospital and housing costs and employment cost benefit figures for vocational education. Existing legislation on architectural barriers in Canada, Britain, and the United States is summarized and critiqued. A survey of public and private transportation problems of the physically disabled is reported. The major recommendation of the report is the need for a government affiliated coordinating authority with functions such as revising relevant legislative standards, conducting cost feasibility studies on elimination of architectural barriers, serving as a central source of information, and counseling individuals and organizations on accessibility features. Appended are a bibliography of 121 items and examples of pertinent forms. (DB)",

The students were taught in three 40 minute classes 2 days each week. Classroom teachers participated in weekly inservice workshops. Two teaching procedures (such as locating a doll on a model landscape) were developed for each of the cognitive areas (such as sequential ordering). Nine tests were developed and administered including a pretest and posttest of cognitive skills; a drawing test of ability to select, combine, and represent; an evaluation  by an art therapist-painter; and a teacher rating scale. Also, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking was administered. Performances of the 18 children were summarized. The results indicated that the art procedures were useful in reaching conservation, grouping, ordering, and spatial orientation as well as in evaluating cognitive and visuospatial abilities and disabilities, and that art educators could go beyond art without neglecting development of art skills and values.

        "description":"Reviewed in the paper are studies on college and university living, facts and proposals from persons cognizant of residential living, and information about present residential accommodations of students at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). The aim of the paper is given to be collecting previously unknown data about housing of deaf students before NTID residential facilities are completed. Students in residence halls are said to engage in self selection of peers and to exhibit seemingly inappropriate changes of life style in their search for identity. It is maintained that manipulative procedures, such as having a residence hall serve in loco parentis, have been only moderately effective and tend to inhibit the self deterministic peer process. Residence hall  potential for reducing student isolation is said to depend on the hall's capacity to encompass formal and informal activities of students and to provide staff that function as a common ground between the institution and student needs. The residence hall is seen as realistically contributing to the peer process and to educational goals when it is based on the living learning center concept. The concept is discussed in terms of integration of all activities and assimilation of deaf and hearing students into a common peer culture through the use of trained student personnel as staff members. Questions related to student life in residence halls based on the concept revolve around the extent of academic input required, an arrangement between the residence hall and the physical education  department to provide recreational and competitive activities, and a reallocation of professional and administrative responsibilities.

Program gaps are seen in areas such as student rights and responsibilities, school exclusions, home-based programs, accident  prevention, and use of private resources. Mentioned among issues of concern to the commission are use of corporal punishment and rights of juveniles. Major recommendations are concerned with problems such as the lack of coordination on common program operations by departments and agencies; the lack of a common format among departments and agencies for budget, program planning, and objectives; and the failure to provide certain needed services and programs.

Special education (SE) presents problems in certification which are held in common with general education and are unique to SE. Some SE trends that will foster changes in certification are educating handicapped students in regular classes with resource room teacher support and reducing the number of categories for SE certification. That the performance based concept has also permeated inservice teacher education is evident from changing  recertification procedures and increased interstate reciprocity in certification. (MC)",

The present educational period is said to be characterized by conditions such as oversupply of teachers, and increased cost of education (and public response) that pose a challenge to standards and procedures in the accrediting process. Tabularly and textually presented is the history of accreditation in teacher education. Definition and purposes of accreditation in teacher education  are discussed. Reviewed are the development, structure, and functions of the National Commission on Accrediting and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). Standards are discussed in relation to curricula, faculty, resources, and facilities for basic programs and students. Considered are development and application of guidelines for teachers in specialties such as the professional standards/guidelines project of the Council for Exceptional Children.

Areas reviewed in relation to learning disabilities encompass assessment, teacher effectiveness, the concept of perceptual deficit, and myths in remedial education. Speech and hearing problems are considered with readings on speech disorders and corrections, articulatory competency and reading readiness, and sociological/psychological factors associated with  hearing loss. The gifted child is seen to benefit from identification by counselors, a broadened concept of giftedness, creative expression techniques, and program planning. Mental retardation is discussed in an overview and in relation to community expectation, use of theories of J. Piaget in a program for trainable retarded students, a work study program, and a job readiness check list. The visually impaired are featured in readings on play and intellectual development, self concept, management of young deaf blind children, approaches to teaching partially sighted children, and \"learning through listening.\" Staff expectations, integrated classrooms, architectural barriers, readjustment of paraplegics to the community, and the need to feel human are the subjects of readings on the  physically handicapped. Readings on emotionally disturbed children focus on history, the community, teacher competency, and a curriculum for disordered behavior. (MC)",

        "description":"An experimental course in organic chemistry utilized computer-assisted instructional (CAI) techniques. The CAI lessons provided tutorial drill and practice and simulated experiments and reactions. The Conversational Language for Instruction and Computing was used, along with a CDC 6400-6600 system; students scheduled and completed the lessons at their own individual paces. Since CAI accomplished the routine instruction, weekly lectures were reduced from three to two, but more time was devoted to essential theoretical concepts and student problems. Students did spend greater amounts of time on the lessons, but achievement was greater, especially for students in the lower and middle ability ranges. Students' attitudes were positive, and they developed self-reliance and independence  which helped improve their lab performances. Experience with the course convinced its authors that students can take a more active part in organic chemistry instruction. In addition, it was concluded that both the traditional and the experimental approaches placed great time demands upon students and that further modularization was not necessary, but that increased attention should be given to the synthesizing of individual units into interdependent constructs.

They provide individualized, self-paced, learner-controlled education, offer discovery experiences which are realistic, and promote problem-solving, decision-making, and immediate feedback. They seem to motivate students and provide them with a means of studying complex systems. Limitations of simulation include the tendencies to over-simplify and over-systematize reality and to stereotype complex situations. Simulations will be even more useful if they are systematically developed, with instructional design following these steps: 1) analysis of instructional content, 2)  specification of objectives, 3) definition of target audience, 4) identification of suitable simulation topics, 5) analysis of the feasibility of each topic, 6) design of the simulation, and 7) evaluation. This kind of systems approach to design will remove educational simulations from the realm of the haphazard and provide educators with a demonstrably effective instructional tool. (PB)",

Significant results included the findings that participants valued their experiences and reported an increase in their media-related skills. They found better jobs at higher salaries and tended to move into influential administrative positions at the individual school or, less often, at the county, district, or other broad organizational level. College media programs were also strengthened as a result of these institutes and a multiplier effect was  achieved since graduates were significantly involved in training their colleagues in the field. The study did not substantiate that the original objective of producing a sufficient number of trained personnel had been fully achieved, but it did support the conclusion that the institutes were an effective means of developing trained manpower to meet the needs spawned by the unprecedented growth of educational media and technology. Therefore, it was concluded that as personnel needs continue to grow, the institutes should continue to play an important role. (PB)",

The educational needs of: 1) the information scientists who design information systems, 2) the information specialists who carry out specific tasks, 3) the scientists who use information, and 4) editors and publishers are outlined. The growing sophistication of the organization, methods and techniques of information transfer are reviewed, and the point is made that new educational programs are needed if UNISIST is to be a useful entity. The second section of the paper discusses the contirubtions which professional societies can make to training and manpower problems and describes the manpower problems of modern science. Following this, specific suggestions  are put forth concerning teaching methods, techniques, curricula and educational management. (Author)",

        "description":"A computer-assisted course was designed to provide students with an understanding of modeling and simulation techniques in quantitiative ecology. It deals with continuous systems and has two segments. One develops mathematical and computer tools, beginning with abstract systems and their relation to physical systems. Modeling principles are next presented, with emphasis on compartment-flow models, followed by discussion of simulation. The FORTRAN IV language and the IBM 360 Continous System Model Program are then described in detail, and equilibria and stability are treated. In part two, students were burdened by the math required and the amount of time spent on programing languages. The first difficulty was overcome by the introduction of compartment-flow models, the second by  the development of an easy-to-use computer program. This Compartment Flow Model Simulation Program (COFLO) is an input language which takes a description of a compartment-flow model and simulates the behavior of the modelled system, converting the model system into a FORTRAN program for compilation and execution. COFLO has been implemented on the UNIVAC 1106 computer at the Southeast Regional Data Center of Florida Atlantic and Florida International Universities. (LB)",

This situation is partly due to the fact that teachers who have a clear conception of the teaching-learning interaction are not involved in the implementation of technological innovations. Teachers and teacher educators can ameliorate this situation by developing an adequate conception of the educative act itself. One such model would view it as an intentional act of probabalistic nature, consisting of four dimensions. The purposes dimension involves the clear stipulation of the changes in the learner's behavior which are expected, while the procedures dimension encompasses the instrumentalities introduced to effect these changes. The  information dimension is comprised of the experiences and data used to justify educational procedures, realizing that only probable validity is possible. Finally, the measurement and evaluation dimension permits the teacher to test his educative hypotheses. Such a framework assigns educational technology to the procedures dimension and enables the teacher to evaluate it in terms of his compatibility with the stipulated purposes, its appropriateness to individual learner needs, and its utility in producing the desired learning.

First, it describes some of the problems in diagnostic assessment of learners--the process of discovering what repertoire of behavior each learner has already acquired and where the gaps are in that repertoire. Second, the paper examines problems in the generation, analysis, and banking of test items. Next, problems in the selection of a particular sequence of objectives for an individual student by the computer  are discussed, and finally, some of the problems that teachers and students experience in using the computer system are identified.

The first chapter identifies the context of the evaluations and traces the origins of El Salvador's ITV system. The second chapter presents the results of four years of research on learning, while the third chapter presents a picture of student attitudes across the four years of research. Students' educational and occupational aspirations are summarized in the  fourth chapter, and background information of the students, their schools, and their communities is presented in the fifth chapter. The next few chapters report studies of teacher attitudes and behavior, studies of the efficiency and cost of the new system, and an administrative history of ITV. A final chapter reviews El Salvador's ITV system and concludes with a brief discussion of some alternative strategies for the use of instructional technology to expand educational opportunity.

        "description":"The author presents the argument that television reality is a new kind of performance in our environment: we don't respond to it and it doesn't acknowledge our presence. The images and sounds of television reality are \"its\", and our human organisms must be disconcerted by these \"its\" occuring in the privacy of our homes. We are being taught to accept the convention of two dimensional pictures and three dimensional sounds in private space, and we are being asked to accept both actors and non-actors, narratives and non-narratives together with life-like natural sound as real. The danger in this is that we may be giving up our capacities for response to authors so distant and alien to our own personal intentions that we may never be able to make contact with them. Citizens of a  democratic republic cannot afford distant authorities, yet we sit and move in the presence of television without being seen or heard by the performers. Continuing this way, we may be forced to discover one day that all experience for us has become a metaphor, a symbol, a surrogate for something else. (SH)",

        "description":"The value of instructional television for universities and public school systems has often been swallowed up in the complexities of producing programs. Television can be better used in the classroom as an instructional resource, taking advantage of already produced programing that is available from sources such as the Public Broadcast Service. Schools should work closely with their local educational television stations (ETS) both to obtain access to these programs and so that a balanced variety of programing is broadcast by the ETS that will be useful to all the schools in a given area. When conflicts arise, schools can tape broadcast programs and make them available when they can be effectively used. This suggestion raises the question of copyright laws; the legality of  nonprofit use of recorded materials is not clear, although there are guidelines available that suggest that a program may be taped for one-time use. A Piggyback unit, or a cart with a color television and a videotape playback machine, is an effective means of presenting the program once it is taped. (SH)",

The unit consisted of four modules, one each on electrical terms, safe use of electricity, a household circuit game, and the cost of electricity. A CAI unit called \"heelec\" was prepared, evaluated by its users and judged acceptable by students and instructors. Development time was comprised of author time and computer related activity time; records showed that author time and computer related activity were nearly equal for each of the four modules, thus supporting the conclusion that two distinct kinds  of specialists--content authors and computer personnel--are needed to develop CAI units.

Seventy-five teachers received training and participated, along with 2000 secondary students. In general, it was found that the computer performed calculations well, relieved students of tedious tasks, aided evaluations, promoted problem-solving and discovery learning, improved instruction and motivated students and teachers. All of the 647 students who took the computer science course passed at least 80% of the  performance objectives and 90% of them used their skills afterwards. In the math and science courses, pre- and posttests of selected units revealed an improvement of 40% in student performance after five hours of CAI instruction. Low ability students using CAI showed marked gains in both reading and math, and administrative tasks were successfully handled by the computer. Thus, it was concluded that consortia of small districts could justify the expense of a computer network. (LB)",

Sixty-four university students were randomly assigned to treatment groups in which they received either no objectives, a partial list of objectives, or a complete list of objectives for an instructional film viewed together by all groups. Mean scores on an 18-item criterion test, which contained one item per objective, were significantly higher for subjects receiving objectives than for those receiving no objectives. Learners who received partial lists of objectives performed as well or slightly better on the test portion for which they received no  objectives. It was thus concluded that providing objectives to students prior to presenting instructional materials not based on objectives facilitates student performance and that presentation of partial lists of objectives did not appreciably limit the students' attention to content for which they had received objectives.

One goal was to develop a simulation which gave the student maximum freedom and responsibility in the design of the experiment and provided only the primary experimental results, thereby affording him practice in planning and data analysis. The specific purpose was to develop a program the student could use to perform simulated thermodynamics experiments. The decisions about experimental variables to measure and control, and the values to use, were made by the student, although they could have been added to the program. An attempt was made to provide, as output, only those variables which are directly  measurable in the laboratory. For example, if an assignment required the measurement of the specific heat vs. temperature curve for a given substance, the student must accept the limiting fact that specific heat is not directly measurable and must define what other parameters to measure, what conditions to use, and what analysis to make.

Chapter III analyzes classroom TV in the State University, including its development, administration, potential  utilization, cost-effectiveness and reasons for its current underutilization. PTV in the state is surveyed, with attention devoted to its instructional services, public programing, program production services and statewide network. Chapter V studies PTV finances, especially PTV station expenses, and state and other sources of funding and the report concludes with an overview and look at the future of ETV, including both its ITV and PTV components. Eleven appendixes provide additional detailed data. (PB)",

        "description":"A ten-year research study designed a mechanized information system in the information processing field. Special attention was paid to implementation criteria entering into on-line retrieval through man-machine dialog from a remote typewriter or video terminal and four major areas were investigated: search strategies, machine stored indexer aids, disc file organization, and graphic displays. The final system developed, SOLER, is a powerful library-oriented information system permitting browsing through the data base, narrowing of the search to selected files, and further restricting to chosen segments of each file. SOLER is useful to experts, indexers, and searchers, using the Real English search language--a complete English grammar--to permit users to engage in a full dialog with  the computer. Other major findings include the following: 1) there is a significant difference between information, which is broad and qualitative, and data, which is formal, specific, and quantitative; 2) there are significant differences between information handling in library versus problem-solving environments; and 3) computerized library systems can extend the scope of catalog information and provide helpful indexing tools to users.

        "description":"An interactive computer-assisted instructional (CAI) system, called CODE, is used to teach transactional analysis, or coding, in elementary accounting. The first major component of CODE is TEACH, a program which controls student input and output. Following the statement of a financial position on a cathode ray tube, TEACH describes an event to which the student responds by typing his coded version of the accounting entry necessitated by the event; the program evaluates the responses, provides feedback, updates the financial position and begins a new cycle. Other components of CODE are: 1) TRANS, a data file which stores instructions, statements, events, and entries; 2) UPDATE, a program which creates new data files and modifies existing ones; and 3) RESULTS, a data file which  monitors student performance. The hypothesis that coding can be well taught by an interactive CAI system is supported by the findings in learning theory that systems which provide feedback, offer attention direction and develop positive attitudes will be most effective. Preliminary testing shows that CODE meets these requirements; formal experimental testing of CODE has been scheduled for the fall semester of 1973 at Kansas University. (PB)",

        "description":"Research in paired-associate overlearning sought means of decreasing the variability while maintaining the magnitude of the decrement in stimulus-response latency (SRL). SRL was divided into decision latency (DL) and manual response latency (MRL); it was hypothesized that self-pacing of inter-item intervals would reduce V. Group I received stimuli at fixed intervals after each response group II controlled the intervals. Practice continued for 16 trials after the trial of last error (TLE). Self-pacing reduced the variability of SRL, but also reduced the post-TLE decrement by teaching fast responses in practice. The task was altered to increase pre-TLE for group III. Pre-TLE SRL of group III equaled that of group I, but post TLE did not. Self-pacing slightly reduced the variability  of SRL, but DL was no less variable than SRL, and post-TLE decrement in DL was less than in SRL. It was concluded that: 1) it was unnecessary to shape fast responses during practice; 2) self-pacing decreased the variability of SRL; 3) the attempt to reduce variability by measuring DL was unsuccessful; and 4) the process underlying post-TLE SRL decrease influenced both DL and SRL.

Eighteen experienced students in the Computerized Registration Involving Student Participation (CRISP) project worked with the Michigan Terminal System to produce an on-line course registration system for students which would interface with those main parts of the current system dealing with room scheduling, transcript production, etc. Interfaces with the current Data Systems Center were ordered, student groups with individual functions were organized, and internal and external specifications stipulated.  The student-designed system was sucessfully demonstrated, resulting in support from the cnetral university administration for further development and eventual implementation of the system. The conclusion was therefore reached that a class project could produce a realistic system, 1) provided that good tools are available, particulary a general-purpose time-sharing system, and 2) that continual guidance on the interface with the system's eventual environment is maintained.

The OLS is based upon the belief that learning and life are synonomous and that what is needed is not a system to teach but a system which allows people to learn by bringing them into contact with learning resources. Such a system is learning; in addition, its goals are derived from individual needs and its resources are provided to meet such needs. These resources are of six major varities: people, equipment, materials, facilities activities and evaluation. Computers would be essential to the system's operation since they could best manage the large quantities of data pertaining to learners, resources, administration, evaluation, finances and research and development. It  would be highly difficult to implement such a system in an existing environment but it would be feasible to develop an OLS in a new community, provided Federal or state support was attracted.

With the support of industry and local educational television, every classroom was equipped with a six-channel closed circuit TV set and six headphones, at a cost of $42,250. The purpose of the project was to use TV programs to improve the academic performance of the school's students, who previously had been underachieving. The program was flexible, teacher controlled and attracted staff commitment. Existing shows, such as Sesame Street and Electric Company, and teacher designed programs were used as integral parts of the instructional effort. Preliminary test results indicated significant improvement in student achievement,  particularly in language arts. For example, as compared with the previous year's classes, second-graders showed an increased gain of five months in vocabulary level and six months in reading comprehension; the corresponding figures for third graders were five and three months. The conclusion was reached that TV used systematically for recognized goals is an effective teaching tool and plans were made to expand the program. (PB)",

Following this, significant curricular adaptions and classroom applications for five types of handicapped learners are summarized and current progress in the assessment of needs and in the development and evaluation of materials is cited. Advances in media utilization in teacher training programs are described and seven major delivery systems are outlined. Main conclusions reached include the following: 1)  instructional technology has much to contribute to the personalization of instruction; 2) considerable progress has been made in the development, evaluation and utilization of media and materials; and 3) the developing delivery systems contain within their present elements the seeds of a network capable of providing each handicapped learner the resources necessary to insure him a successful educational experience. A substantial bibliography with 341 citations to documents dealing with instructional media and the handicapped is appended to the report. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"In recent years the many efforts to individualized instruction have been hampered by a lack of communication among professionals. The Descriptor for Individualized Instruction was developed to facilitate communication. It functions in several ways: 1) as a summary of a single program, 2) as a means of comparison between programs, 3) as a tool to compare an existing program with its projected development and 4) as an aid to program development. The descriptor is a graphic representation which identifies, quantifies and describes the relevant parameters of a program of individualization. The nine components of the descriptor are: objectives, rate, sequence, instructional materials (media), management of information, management of instructional components and program pattern. A  preliminary program descriptor is also used to describe the setting for the individualization program. The first edition of the descriptor evolved from an exploration of the literature and consultation with qualified professionals. It was then field tested and revised. Although there is no &quot;hard data&quot; available, the staff feels there is informal evidence that if used properly, the descriptor is both reliable and valid. The field tests were conducted in the areas of mathematics, reading and teacher education. The applicability of the descriptor to other areas is unknown as yet. A copy of the descriptor is included.

Results included the findings that children watched TV an average of three hours a day; this varied little throughout the country and between those viewing Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and those watching commercial programs. Younger children preferred the former, older the latter. Parents gave overwhelming support to PBS, especially to Sesame Street, Mister Rogers and Electric Company, rating these superior to their commercial competitors. Ninety-six percent of the parents favored changing practices regarding commercials on children's TV, with 40% wanting their elimination, 25% a reduction, and 25% a  clustering of commercials at the end of programs. Annoyance was expressed over toy commercials and the quality of the toys themselves. Most parents felt TV was influential; they thought TV, especially PBS, taught communication skills, enhanced social learning and broadened interests. They also felt TV had too much violence and materialism and that certain programs could foster passivity and anti-social behavior. Negative concerns were greatest among parents whose children watched TV most heavily and who concentrated upon commercial programs. (Author/PB)",

Four groups of students, each composed of high, medium and low ability individuals, were created; each viewed a 20 minute television lesson on how to study. They differed only in that each was taught by a different instructor--a basic airman, a sergeant, an officer or a civilian. It was hypothesized that the sergeant would be most consistent with the students' expectations and that hence his group would experience the least cognitive dissonance, learn the most and exhibit the least perceptual distortion. Posttest results, however, showed no significant differences in either learning or distortion, and it was concluded that rank did not  create differences in the televised instructional situation. Studies of other instructor variables, students, content, and instructional media were recommended. Investigations of whether the instructor's rank involves the student's ego, of the degree to which dissonance varies over the length of exposure to another person and with instructional media, and of whether or not dissonance occurs in situations like these where students are required to participate, were also suggested.

Although less convenient than special purpose languages, FOCAL has direct command capability which is easy to learn and which provides full mathematical support. No specific author mode is available, but FOCAL is quite simple and can be used without programer assistance. A MODIFY command provides online program correction, and file protection is available  to control use of this feature. With this system, sophisticated teaching programs can be presented to three simultaneous users in only 12k of 12 bit core. The system is expandable, but is especially suited for small-scale use with the mainframe unattended, when the PDP-12 might not be in use. (Author)",

These were: 1) the effect of paragraph organization on free recall of sentences and on the selection of clustering strategies; 2) how persons differing in subjective organization differ on recall and strategy selection; and 3) the relation between subjective organization and other cognitive abilities. Three groups of students studied paragraphs organized by concept names (N), concept attributes (A) or at random (R); measures of verbal comprehension, verbal creativity, associative memory, closure, and subjective organization were taken. Analysis of results showed that the N group recalled the most correct statements, that clustering by names was predominant for all groups, and that unique correlation patterns existed among cognitive factors and  recall scores for each group. These findings indicated that learning a highly organized passage and using a preferred recall strategy yielded superior recall. Analysis of the subjective organization data indicated that highly organized students were not greatly influenced by the inherent structure of learning materials, whereas low organizers were. Thus, students low in subjective organization require highly structured materials, while students high in subjective organization perform similarly on materials with high and low structure.

Despite this finding, however, no differences on a retention test in rule application skills could be attributed to the memorization of rule statements. (Author)",

To save time and to provide comparison, this course was based on the objectives, format and logic of an earlier course, PUNCT. The present data base is a sentence pool composed of certain sentence patterns called prototypes, each with a unique call number. A program author can call a type of sentence by using the prototype name. By employing certain macros, he can use the sentences from the pool as if they had been hard coded. Original sentences can be quickly and simply added to the pool. Flow charts document the process from the time a sentence is called from the pool until it has been displayed and finally answer processed. The description of  how the macros are used, and what must be included in a macro call, is a more detailed account expanding drills and providing new sentences within the already coded data base, but a modified system of macros is needed to simplify recall from the sentence pool. The speed of the system will be improved by translation into the APL programing language. (Author/SL)",

The programer deals mainly with two types of information: 1) control logic or course structure information, and 2) content information. The preprocessor enables the programer to deal with the latter of these in a more natural way than Coursewriter II allows. The effectiveness of the preprocessor is currently being evaluated by using it to implement a 1500 Coursewriter II precalculus math course. (CH)",

In addition, the psychologists may supply such scientific data as human reaction times, visual perception, reach distance, etc. This kind of communication between military psychologists and the design engineer could lead to development of products which make less demand on human resources.

The first of three integrated courses exposes the student to the range of computer applications in the humanities and teaches him to write nontrivial programs in the PL/1 Programing Language. Instruction is arranged around programing problems; students survey the literature of computer applications and do a design project. The second course concentrates upon teaching students how to break complex tasks into their components. Natural language use is stressed and additional technical information is presented, including matters such as job control language and system utilities. In the third course the student solves a  complex problem. He develops a thesis, translates it into operational terms and computational procedures, performs an analysis, interprets the results, and maps the results back to the level from which he began. The sequence has been judged successful since it teaches students both the general techniques of problem-solving and, more specifically, creative, substantive ways to use the computer in the humanities.

In addition, he asserts that Lakoff's work may provide a service in that it constitutes a reductio ad absurdum of the derivational paradigm of modern linguistics and shows that only a system with the ability to reconsider its own interferences can do the job that Lakoff sets up for linguistic enquiry.

For French, there is a further breakdown according to language skills, grammar, reading, structures, conversation, and culture and civilization. For each level there is an objective statement which specifies the behavior variable or the intended behavior of the student as a result of having participated in a set of instructional experiences. Following is a detailed list of activities that the student must engage in successfully in order to attain the stated objective. The value of such a guide is in helping the teacher to select appropriate learning experiences, in  communicating to others what is expected, and in providing both the student and teacher with a standard for evaluating progress. Objectives should not be seen as limiting teacher innovation or what the student is expected to know. (HW)",

She believes that the institution of bilingual education in the city's schools is an important first step in elevating Spanish to the position it deserves as a means of instruction and communication. The instructional materials still need, however, to reflect the predominant culture of the Hispanic population. Closely related is the need for well-trained Spanish-speaking teachers who can easily relate to the educational problems of the students. These measures will help to reverse the negative self-concept that Puerto Ricans have of themselves and their language. With such a change of attitude, the author believes will come the self-respect necessary for a  true appreciation of Puerto Rican Spanish, which when spoken properly is different but in no way inferior to Peninsular Spanish.

Spanish 2 students were divided into three groups, two experimental and one control group. One experimental group utilized the individualized approach in Spanish 1 and Spanish 2. The other studied traditional Spanish 1 and entered an individualized Spanish 2 class. The control group completed Spanish 1 and Spanish 2 by the traditional method. Pre-tests indicated that there was no significant difference in achievement among the groups. Post-test results showed that the students whose initial experience with the individualized approach began at level 2 made less progress than did the other two groups in listening and writing. It is concluded  that orientation difficulties noted in the first year's research are more severe when they are experienced at level 2. Students with two years of individualized instruction make progress similar to the traditionally taught group. Their attitude is more positive and, regardless of level of achievement, more of them continue learning Spanish than do those in the control group. For the previous report, see ED 066 100. (Author)",

The program was designed for students whose English language proficiency does not enable them to follow courses at INNOTECH, which are conducted in English, and it was intended both to develop their listening skills in technical English and to expose them to part of the actual INNOTECH curriculum. The course consists of 50 units recorded on cassettes, each with an oral passage of 200-800 words lasting from two to eight minutes. The tapes are supplemented by printed material which includes questions, answer keys, transcriptions of the texts,  and step-by-step instructions for the program. The course was found to be effective in improving the aural comprehension of technical English at least as much as the former program which involved five months of classroom instruction. In addition, the report emphasizes its economical aspects; programmed materials and cassettes are used rather than teacher time and more expensive recording equipment. Included with the report are two appendixes; one gives the introduction and instructions from the program material and the other gives samples of the printed program material. (HW)",

        "description":"This study describes and analyzes the state of English teaching in Colombian public secondary schools in 1971. Examined are the present status of the Colombian school system, the English curriculum, the attitudes of English students, and the organizations which contribute to the study of English in Colombia. The methods used to teach the language are described by observing a stratified sample of 30 classes and recording teacher behavior via the Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories system. It is found that lecture is the most common teacher behavior pattern, but that pattern drills are also widely used. Self-evaluation studies indicate that the listening and speaking skills are the weakest and that professional preparation is the strongest of the English teachers'  competencies. Major problems include large classes, poor pay, anti-Americanism, a lack of didactic aids, a nearly total absence of articulation, and a paucity of in-service programs. The English student is found to be quite negative, especially boys. Organizations contributing to the teaching of English are Colombian-American Linguistic Institute, the binational centers, professional associations, the Fulbright Commission, and the British Council. The study also describes the national curriculum guide and the most commonly used textbooks. Following the study are recommendations and appendixes, including a list of those interviewed and an extensive bibliography. (Author/HW)",

        "description":"This document contains the proposal to redesign the baccalaureate degree at Bowling Green State University. The proposal ties together 3 principal efforts. The first of these is a complete reform of the general education and particularly the freshman year experience. A second major theme is the development of new program lines that cut across traditional departments and that follow broad career directions. The third interest is in cost-of-college for the students at this state-supported university. In short, this proposal calls for a major commitment on the part of the University starting in the fall of 1972 with 8% of the freshmen, carefully chosen to represent a broad range of abilities; the plan assumes curriculum reform based upon a new approach to the freshman year followed  by opportunities for a variety of career-oriented programs. Also this proposal introduced opportunities for an interim year in which students can participate in significant off-campus experiences without significant payment to the University. The proposal contains: (1) curricular modules based on student development objectives; (2) integrated academic and residential programs; (3) specially developed counseling programs; (4) opportunities for a shortened baccalaureate; and (5) more program options for faculty as well as students. The appendices contain proceedings of a conference on innovative teaching. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"The Thirteen College Curriculum Program (TCCP) is a new curriculum for black colleges, consisting of 5 freshmen and 2 sophomore courses, developed by the participating colleges and the Institute for Services to Education, in a project of intervention--new variables introduced and their effects measured, rather than pure research. The resulting curriculum does the following: makes learning more active; includes new topics demanded both by advances in knowledge and changing social conditions; establishes an administrative structure on the campuses outside familiar departmental lines. Validation consisted in reduced attrition; comparable or better performance by program students compared to regular students; improved attitudes; endorsement by students and teachers; expansion of  program to more students and teachers on the initial campuses and to new insitutions, now totalling 38--all as measured quantitatively by tests and questionnaires, and qualitatively by conferences and visits. Begun the summer of 1967, development involved yearly, 6-week summer workshops of several hundred teachers, to create new materials and learn about previously developed materials, coupled with yearly tryouts in the classroom. TCCP is still going strong, the original 13 colleges are now developing new upper-level courses and additional colleges are planning to join the program in the summer of 1974. (Author)",

Meanwhile, there is pressure-witness the recommendations of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education-to establish 2-year community colleges in areas not now served by such institutions. A solution to both problems may have been found in Ohio, where the newly formed Rio Grande Community College District proposes to contract with Rio Grande College, a private 4-year college, to operate the community college program. If the plans are approved, the four-county community college district stands to avoid the heavy capital expenditures normally involved in setting up a community college and Rio Grande  College gains an assured future.

Legitimizing student safety-values can complement representational conflict by promoting the release of tension and thereby enabling students to turn their efforts toward constructive endeavors. Student withdrawal can be prevented with new designs that promote student responsibility, authority, and participation in the higher education system. Racism on campus can be prevented through the promotion of a celebration of ethnic differences. New designs imply that mental health delivery systems on campus will have to become more  open and involved with community programming and participation. A brief questionnaire by which services can judge how responsive they are to community involvement and how prepared they are to adjust programming efforts to new designs are included. The new designs suggested are offered not only as a means to prevent stress and conflict on campus, but also as a means to increase the quality of educational life for each campus member.

These changes have placed new demands upon the higher education system. But dynamics within the system have grown inflexible and dehumanizing as a result of system priorities. These priorities set in motion dynamics that compel campus members to conform to system needs. Human concerns that would dictate that the system grow and change in conformity with campus needs are suppressed. The quality of educational life suffers as a result. Problems proliferate as pressure builds between system demands and human needs. A sense of purpose is eroded. Dissatisfactions among campus members are high while crises or conflicts erupt easily.

Such a trend will be a significant environmental characteristic for the higher educational community, inasmuch as graduates from secondary schools comprise the principal source of demand for higher education. Because of the variations among geographical subdivisions in birth rates, migration, and anomalies in the grade-by-grade enrollment, the patterns of change for small geographical regions may be expected to vary from those on a state or nationwide basis. For the application under investigation, the number of graduates from public and private secondary schools in each of the sixty-seven  counties in Pennsylvania were projected over a 10-year period by application of what is characteristically referred to as the cohort-survival method. Using enrollment data collected routinely by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, cohort-survival rates were computed for a number of historical years between each pair of grade-levels between one and graduation for primary and secondary school enrollments of each county. These rates were then applied to the most recently available compilations of grade-by-grade enrollment to generate projections of high school graduates for each county over the specified time horizon.

        "description":"Decisionmaking in organizations is examined from the perspective of open systems organization theory. Employing this perspective, this paper represents a critique of the views held by planners and systems analysts and the conflicting assumptions of their critics. The conclusion reached is that neither the assumptions held by planners, nor those of their critics are wholly acceptable to the policymakers. Policymaking requires a mixed strategy of decisionmaking that is dependent on situational constraints and on tradeoffs between desirable but conflicting values. This paper begins by briefly describing a controversy over the management and organization of the University of California library system. A theory of decision process selection is suggested that provides a framework for  analyzing this controversy. This theory suggests that there are 2 major paradigms that policymakers use to describe decision processes. The historical roots of these paradigms are noted and the paradigms are described. The report suggests that there is a gap between normative assumptions of the decision process paradigms and the conclusions drawn following an examination of the constraints and values found in higher education.

        "description":"The data for this paper are taken mainly from a longitudinal study of the college graduating class of 1961. Based on a subsample of earlier respondents, this study was primarily concerned with the graduates' evaluation of his college, his opinions on the goals of higher education in general, his opinions on the financing of higher education, and his plans for his children's college education. Questionnaires were received from 4,868 of the 6,005 persons in the subsample, for a response rate of 81%. The questionnaire included items on political attitudes and orientations. The questions that concern this paper were part of a battery tapping support for student and black militancy, and views on draft deferments for students. Results include the following: students in humanities were  likely to support protests; and father's education is one of the strongest early determinants of support for militancy. There is a possibility that studies such as this can be used to predict to a college which applicants will engage in protest and the use of such a study to prevent the admission of such applicants. However, it is the very characteristics that support dissent that colleges are looking for in potential students. Therefore, colleges are unlikely to deny admission to bright children from well-educated families or students who are likely to go on to graduate school for the reasons that they may support activism while at school.

Its purpose is to create the substance for a debate about the quality of teaching and learning at the undergraduate level. The major themes of the report are: (1) Stanford's rise to national excellence as a major research university over the past three decades has had both positive and negative consequences for undergraduate education. (2) Only about one in every three Stanford undergraduates is satisfied with the present quality of faculty-student relations and the advising system. (3) Four important outcomes of the educational process are positively and strongly linked to the amount of interaction students have with professors. The incidence of these outcomes for Stanford  undergraduates as a whole is very low. Four basic objectives are suggested to improve the quality of student-faculty interaction: an enrichment in the level and quality of student-faculty interaction; a restructuring of the University's faculty evaluation and reward system; a redirection of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies so as to increase its effectiveness as an advocate for undergraduate education; and a greater awareness by undergraduates of the benefits of interaction with faculty members, and the necessity to participate in the initiation of it.

The proportion of first and second-year students who were attending 2-year colleges rather than 4-year colleges increased from 31% in 1966 to 43% in 1972.

        "description":"Three approaches that can guide a nation's public policy with respect to graduate education and the supply of highly educated persons are discussed: manpower planning, human capital analysis, and the principle of free student choice. The first two perspectives were judged to be inappropriate and the free-choice principle endorsed. The reliance on individual decisions that follows from this principle, however, requires sound labor market information if the combined actions of students, universities, state and federal legislatures, and employers are to result in reasonably efficient outcomes: i.e., approximate balance in the supply of and demand for individuals with advanced education. The current state of the labor market forecasting techniques for doctorates was reviewed with the  following conclusions: (1) Existing techniques for protecting future supply of and demand for doctorates were found to have serious limitations. (2) It was found that too few resources have been applied to the collection and analysis of information pertaining to the labor market for highly educated manpower. (3) The federal government places too much stress on the immediate state of the labor market in determining policy with respect to the support of graduate education. The report concludes with 6 recommendations designed to improve the environment for decision and policymaking with respect to graduate education. (Author)",

The first chapter establishes the legal and historical base of both statutory and constitutional universities. The second chapter is a brief description of the social milieu and the state organizational context in which the university finds itself. The third chapter reveals the study findings obtained from documents and records as well as from interviews and questionnaires. The fourth chapter analyzes  the interrelationships of the four principal sets of actors involved in the study--governor's staffs, legislative staffs, state coordinators, and institutional leaders. The last chapter provides tentative conclusions about the operational meaning of constitutional and statutory status and the implications of the findings for institutional autonomy and independence.

        "description":"To manage effectively the higher education enterprise is a complex matter. Part of the problem of managing complexity is the need for monitoring data in time series such that the on-going enterprise is viewed at comparable times in comparable terms. Part of the answer at the University of San Francisco is the development of time series data on students, curriculum, faculty, and a number of noncurricular items. However, the need for systematic financial review called for time series data on financial categories. But beyond such tuition and fees history and specific financial data, the need for certain meaningful ratios or indices is evident. There is also a need to study the balance sheet data over several years and subject these to important meaningful indicator construction.  This paper is committed to the development of appropriate theory for total institutional analysis of the university enterprise. This document provides for cross-institutional comparability through the taxonomy of WICHE/NCHEMS Program Classification Structure (PCS). Hopefully, this effort proves useful to institutional needs in budgeting and planning as well as useful to others with similar needs. (Author)",

Project AHEAD (Associated Higher Education Assistance for the Disadvantaged) was aimed at the disadvantaged in an effort to find high-risk students in impoverished neighborhoods and provide them the financial aid, educational help, and counseling necessary to succeed in college. It aimed to demonstrate that such students could succeed and that area colleges and universities, as a consequence of participating in or observing the project, would permanently increase their level of enrollment and service to such students. Summary conclusions include: (1) Compensatory education is not as stimulating and satisfying to disadvantaged  students as credit-, career-, and degree-oriented curricula. (2) Strong counseling and supplementary instructional help can salvage many disadvantaged students. (3) A worthwhile proportion of disadvantaged students can succeed in college. (4) Many apparent dropouts resume college work when their circumstances permit. (5) Older disadvantaged students do better than younger ones. (6) Maximum encouragement of disadvantaged students requires full financial aid for tuition and expenses. (Author/PG)",

The comprehensive colleges and universities are institutions that may have doctoral programs and that offer master's degrees, and have an enrollment of more than 3,500 students. General baccalaureate colleges may award master's degrees and have enrollments under  3,500. Two-year colleges include community colleges, technical institutes, university and college branches, and other campuses offering less than a baccalaureate program.

Subjects for the study were comprised of the entire freshman class of fall and spring registrants at the University of Lethbridge during the academic year 1968-69. The two groups of students, those registering in the fall and spring semesters, respectively, were compared on a number of variables. The results of the study show that the fall and spring semester registrants do not differ appreciably on general characteristics, and that it is most likely a misconception that the spring semester enrollees are largely the repeaters of high school courses. Data showed that a substantial proportion of spring registrants were  either transfer students or those who had to defer university entrance for a semester or so due to financial or other personal reasons. The educational preparation of a transfer student is appreciably better than that of a freshman matriculant. This may be the reason why this group despite its achieving a significantly lower grade-point average on the high school examinations, gave a performance comparable to those of fall registrants in the freshman course examinations.

The purpose was to continue the process of teacher development of undergraduate curriculum materials and concomitant instructional practices. Attending the 6-week conference were faculty, staff, and graduate students from 23 predominantly black institutions. The conference was divided into units by the curriculum areas, including: English, mathematics, biology, humanities, physical sciences, social institutions, and philosophy. Questionnaires were distributed near the end of the conference to elicit the participant's attitudes toward undergraduate instruction in general, their  attitudes and opinions about the quality of materials and procedures developed during the conference, and their feelings about the mechanics of the conference and the quality of the conference staff. This report presents and discusses the responses of a sample (40) of teachers who participated in the conference as members of the original 13 College Program experimental units. The results are presented both by total summaries of responses and by responses according to the teachers' different curriculum areas. Selected summaries are presented by the number of years the teacher had participated in the program, by the teacher's sex, and by the teacher's race. General rating tendencies are also presented.

Each Pre-College Center offers English and mathematics classes, special-interest workshops, cultural and recreational activities to about 200 high school seniors and juniors, who remain in the Program for one full year. On Saturday mornings during the academic year and daily during the summer session, six selected teachers in each discipline conduct classes of not more than 20 students, using materials that are developed to  broaden the contexts of English and mathematics instruction. This document presents an introduction to the Pre-College Program, a brief history of the program, and examples of the English and mathematics program.

Results of a questionnaire administered to seniors enrolled during their freshman and sopomore years in an innovative curriculum program (Thirteen-College Curriculum Program) and seniors who experienced the traditional curriculum during all four years of college indicated: (1) the seniors tended to be first-generation college graduates, the majority of whose parents had not completed high school. (2) Limited financial backing was a constant factor in the probability of students reaching graduation. (3) Seniors who had their initial college experience in the TCCP had higher grade-point averages than did  seniors who did not have such initial experiences. (4) Across all students, the greatest degree of nonacademic participation was in two areas--student government and community service. (5) While 80% of the seniors indicated they would pursue at least one degree beyond the bachelor's, only 20% were actively making application to graduate school. (6) While majors such as education and religion have had traditionally heavy enrollments at these colleges, among these seniors a larger number majored in business and science. (7) 50% of the seniors professed ambivalent feelings about the personal satisfaction gained from attending their particular college.

Following references to newly available data, the paper deals first with work done at SUNY-Buffalo, Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania, the American Association of University Professors, and the Institute for Educational Development using mathematical models of steady-state staffing. Reference is next made to several institutions at which some tenure-related action has recently been taken: Miami-Dade Community College, the University of Hawaii, Bloomfield College, the Virginia Community College System, the City University of New York,  Vassar College, and Colgate University. Attention is then given to four special issues: (1) tenure quotas, and the effects of high and low percentages of faculty with tenure on the chances for tenure of probationary faculty; (2) the cost implications of a faculty evenly distributed by age and rank; (3) the growing limitations on institutional choice imposed by government requirements under the Equal Pay Act and other legislation involving nondiscrimination; and (4) the place that provision for early retirement might have in a long-range personnel plan. Three other unresolved issues are identified: the labeling of all nontenured faculty as \"probationary,\" the problem of shifting student interests within an institution, and the question of what tenure guarantees.

This concern is reflected in the development of programs to reassess science curricula on all educational levels. The Thirteen-College Curriculum Program (TCCP) approach to physical science has been to widen the forms of mathematics and its applications to include the natural, though sometime unsophisticated, schematic models developed by students. The theme of this program is student-centered teaching; the program attempts to involve students in principles of each of seven disciplines through first-hand discovery. The students begin with concrete examples and empirically develop from them relevant abstractions  and generalizations. The students have tended to become oblivious to some of the artificial barriers between disciplines and have gained a greater appreciation for the structural similarities among them. In this article an example of a class-activity-investigation concerning a conservation law is presented. The investigation concerns the study of a conservation law and contains basic laws of physics and many aspects of the nature of the scientific method. (Author/PG)",

ISE does this through long-range programs at predominantly Negro institutions. The institute's major functions are curriculum reform and attracting funds to get new educational programs started. But it also has sponsored a social action project in which students work with local community agencies. Another ISE effort is a series of conferences across the South to prepare young college graduates (Negro and white for future roles as teachers in integrated schools. This document presents a brief history of the ISE, a description of the Thirteen-College Curriculum Programs (TCCP), including a description of the 4 courses taught in the TCCP  curriculum during the last academic year (ideas and their expression, quantitative and analytical thinking, social institutions, and natural science), describes the conferences for integrated teaching, and the communication skills institutes (to improve, if necessary, the ability to communicate orally of the graduates of predominantly Negro colleges who plan to teach), and a description of the Community Action Program (CAP).

Survey findings indicate: (1) There was a pronounced upturn in corporate support of education between 1970 and 1972. (2) Among 19 industries, ten reported increased dollar support of education between 1970 and 1972, while nine industries reported less dollar support of education in 1972 than in 1970. In two cases this was accompanied by a decline in pre-tax net income (PTNI). (3) A total of 671 companies supplied some information for the 1972 survey, and their reported contributions to education amounted to $128.0 million. In comparison to the 1970 survey, this represents a decrease of about 1.2% in the number of corporations, and an increase of 2.6% in the total dollar  support of education. (4) The 16 companies in the primary metals industry head the list, with educational support equal to 0.56% of the PTNI, roughly 2 1/2 the average for all companies participating in the survey. Changes in giving patterns, prospects for 1973, and national trends are discussed.

In an effort to enable the whole process of long-range planning to succeed, it is necessary to: (1) create a special organization for planning that is professionally  staffed; (2) focus upon the learner and not the teacher; (3) orient the institution-wide college family to the good of the whole school; (4) emphasize the process of planning; and (5) continue the capability and requirement for review and evaluation of goals, plans, and the planning process. The role of the Office of Alumni Relations will necessarily change in an effort to know how well the school is doing by its graduates and gathering that data will be a major portion of the alumni officer's work in the future.

Therefore, before higher education can deal with the question of accountability, it has to define the role of the college or university in relation to society. One alternative is that the campus operate as an absolutely insulated entity, the other is for the institution of higher education to be completely responsive to the state. The proper answer to this dilemma lies somewhere between the two extremes, with the college or university assuming dual roles. To make administrators accountable they must be responsible. Education is too important to be monopolized by educators, and its mission should be determined by society. The only way to  guarantee the mission of higher education is carried out is to make administrators fully accountable to society. Concern should be with administrative freedom of action if our administrators are to be responsible for effective management. (Author/PG)",

The findings include the following: (1) Pennsylvania compares well with other states in regard to physician-population ratios and other general indices. (2) Despite this, Pennsylvania is far from meeting optimum care physician ratios. (3) Basic care specialists such as those in family medicine, general practice, and internal medicine are and will be in short supply unless a radical change in the rate of  physician entry into these professions occurs. (4) Some sections of the state are seriously lacking in basic care physicians while others are close to the optimum figure. (5) The need for more physicians in Pennsylvania can be met by: (a) producing more physicians; (b) facilitating the use of paramedical personnel; (c) changing delivery systems to increase physician productivity; and (d) encouraging better geographic distribution to meet rural and urban area needs.

Eighty-eight (89%) of the colleges responded to the survey questionnaire. The findings indicate a tendency toward implementation of only certain types of fees. During the 1973-74 school year, student body membership fees will be required by 81 (92%) of the responding campuses. Health fees which are levied for health services, will be collected by 47 (53%) of the campuses. Adult fees will be required by 42 (48%) of the campuses. Parking fees will be imposed by 29 (33%) of the campuses, and  community services' fees (for community events and classes) by 26 (30%). Physical education class fees will be required by 5 (6%) of the campuses.

        "author":["Lombardi, John"],
        "description":"At their inception, community colleges adopted the traditional department/division structure. But there is a trend in community colleges toward combining related disciplines into a single department. Despite any administrative effort to subordinate or abolish the traditional department, the faculty within each discipline considers itself a close-knit community. This community exerts great influence on educational quality and indoctrinates new instructors much more successfully than does the college. The community college department is moving toward the four-year institution department in which instructors exercise a great deal of self-governance. Tenure and seniority are important in departmental governance. Part-time instructors have little voice in departmental governance and  paraprofessionals have none, but a trend is beginning toward including paraprofessionals as members of the bargaining unit, partly because of the potential danger of paraprofessionals being used to staff classes during a strike. Student activism is still a minor movement in community colleges, but changes involving more relevant courses and students' rights have been made as a result of the activism of the 60's. To counteract the insularity of subject-matter groupings, colleges are experimenting with plans for mixing departmental units in the same building and classrooms. To counteract the trend toward self-governance, administrators are experimenting with new structures to replace the department and chairman, most commonly the division headed by an administrator.

        "description":"The committee is convinced that attrition is so interwoven with the entire college philosophy and operation that attempts to minimize it must be viewed as a total campus effort. The following definition of attrition was used for computing attrition at the class level: (1) all F's, (2) all withdrawals from class for students enrolled for 7 hours or more who do not simultaneously withdraw from college, and (3) all total withdrawals from college for students enrolled for 6 hours or less. Complete withdrawal of students enrolled for more than 6 hours is not included on the presumption that the causes are not directly linked to specific classes, which is the focus of this model. Research has shown the effectiveness of personalized education in minimizing attrition. The more contact  students can have with individual faculty members, department chairmen and administrators, the more likely they are to be satisfied with their education and to remain in college. The committee strongly urges the campus to conduct a searching review of all policies and procedures to determine which, if any, should be revised to provide personalized education. The committee also suggests consideration be given to the formation of appropriate task forces to design strategies for implementation of those recommendations requiring more detailed planning. As many of these recommendations as possible should be implemented in the 1973-74 academic year. (Author/KM)",

A client group was compared with two groups of non-clients by means of questionnaire administered on registration day. A total of 1,269 day students, 80 percent of the student population, participated. Group one consisted of 575 freshmen who had no previous exposure to counseling at Niagara. Group two was made up of 400 freshmen and second- and third-year students who sought and received counseling at Niagara. Group three consisted of 294 second and third-year students who had neither sought nor received counseling at Niagara but who had been exposed to counseling in the past. A 23-item multiple choice questionnaire was constructed to obtain information  concerning respondent characteristics, use of counseling services, satisfaction with counseling, perception of effective counseling, and preference for certain counseling styles. Counseled respondents were found to be very satisfied with their counseling at Niagara. Although most would use counseling services primarily for educational concerns, the same majority would consult an instructor before going to a counselor with academic problems. Most respondents would consult a close friend in case of personal difficulties before going to a counselor. The majority also perceive counselors as a source of assistance with career planning and prefer to seek counseling rather than be called to see a counselor. Recommendations for further research are made. (Author/KM)",

Three components supplementing the classroom activity of the sociology of work course were eight mini-courses, independent study, and an extensive, full-time, volunteer work placements. Thirty interested first-semester freshmen were chosen from admissions interviews to be participants. Of the 26 who completed the program, 24 were helped substantially in focusing their occupational plans. Twenty-nine percent of the staff and faculty had meaningful contact with the  program. A program similar to the Exploratory Year has been incorporated into the ongoing college curriculum offerings. An ongoing, cooperative, career education high school program began as a direct outgrowth of the Exploratory Year.

The research effort of the project was to develop and test an integrated systems of instruction built around discrete technical concepts that are basic to more than one technology and have multiple applications. The system requires that each concept be presented in a logical sequence with concurrent applications in Electricity, Mechanics, Physics, Mathematics, and Technical Communications. Student achievement was measured and recorded at all stages of the program. Instructional materials were student tested, revised, and  retested. Case studies were made to identify the administrative problems encountered in introducing the system in new as well as in existing two-year schools. The project was completed in August 1973. At that time, EMT project materials were being used in 30 states, and planning assistance had been provided to 375 schools. At least 70 of these schools established new electromechanical technology programs using the EMT materials. Post-project dissemination of the planning and instructional materials developed is being effected. (Author/DB)",

A total of 40.1% of the schools responded, with 154 schools providing statistical data and 182 selecting a yes-no option. More schools experienced increased enrollments of women in accounting, Management, Computer Technology, Marketing, and Retailing programs and less in Drafting, Electrical-Electronic Technology, Chemical Technology, Engineering, Industrial Supervision, Mechanical Supervision, Mechanical Technology, Transportation, Wholesaling, and Purchasing. Eleven programs showed percentage-wise increases,  and three programs showed decreases: Electrical/Electronic Technology, Mechanical Technology, and Transportation. Of five techniques listed as means of attracting women students--increasing number of women faculty, use of pictures of women in publicity, seminars for high school counselors, elimination of male pronouns in publicity, and use of women recruiters for programs--pictures of women was the predominantly used technique. Schools that utilized a majority of the techniques had the predominance of increases. It is concluded from the survey results that: enrollment of women is slight in many of these programs, and is increasing only very gradually. (DB)",

Information obtained is to be applied to the analysis of the impact of the proposed Clinton campus of Prince George's Community College (Maryland) on the existing campus at Largo. Of particular interest is the way enrollments at Clinton can be expected to affect enrollment patterns at Largo. The influential variables emerging from the inquiries were: (1) proximity to a reference population, (2) accessibility of each campus, (3) the plan for scheduling programs and (more importantly) courses, and (4) the specialization intended to apply to each campus. Enrollment patterns at a multicampus  school apparently are not entirely dependent on the vagaries of the student but depend in part on the educational program at the new campus. Certain institutions surveyed also indicated that an initial dip in enrollments at the existing campus possibly may occur. (KM)",

A lack of understanding of the importance of the chairman's role has led to a neglect of the position in the administrative organization and a subsequent weakening of the meanagment structure of the institution. There are four principal areas at the middle management level that, if carefully evaluated and organized, could reduce management problems considerably: (1) the administration of middle management personnel--the neglect of the upper echelon administration to recognize fully the importance of the chairman's position; (2) the selection of middle management personnel; (3) the role  difinition of a middle manager, the departmental chairman; and (4) the training of a middle manager, the departmental chairman. The most critical, most needed position within middle management of post-secondary education is that of departmental chairman or its equivalent. The duties and responsibilities of a department chairman are listed, grouped under the following topics: managerially oriented, faculty oriented, curriculum oriented, clerically oriented, student oriented, and maintenance or support personnel oriented. A description of division chairman responsibilities at Golden West College is appended, as is a 46-item bibliography. (KM)",

The philosophy is that everyone should have access to higher education, at a price he can afford to pay, and that curricula should be geared to the real needs of persons. Most comprehensive community colleges offer programs designed to help persons enter the work world in two years or less. The emphasis is not on the degree but on the quality of preparation that will lead to successful employment and job satisfaction. Career education is the key concept. In addition to their campus programs, community colleges take educational programs into the community. This type of college education is extremely inexpensive. It still remains to be seen whether  the promises of the comprehensive community colleges--universal education, a vital interest in the individual combined with individualized instruction, meeting the needs of the college faculty and staff, pursuing accountability in a humanistic manner, keeping career education from becoming simply job training, and providing leadership in the area of human development instruction--can be kept.

The research employed a methodology in which a sentence was presented orally just prior to a tachistoscopic presentation of a picture in which various components were misrepresented. Subjects were 30 children at each of three grade levels (2, 5, and 9). Besides age differences, the variables under investigation were: (1) whether the misrepresentation involved the presupposed or the asserted proposition, and (2) whether the presupposition was indicated in surface structure by intonation or by syntactic structure. The finding that there was an interaction between age and manner of making presupposition is discussed in detail. It is clearly demonstrated  that intonational features are important until relatively late in the developmental course of language acquisition and the shift to sensitivity to syntactic structure occurs during a period when language development is assumed to be complete. The effect of acquisition of reading skills is considered as a possible means of accounting for these findings. (DP)",

        "description":"Arguments for an extension of Piaget's theory of cognitive development have been derived from philosophical and historical considerations of modern natural science. Implicit contradictions, which characterize these sciences as well as common thought, can be systematically apprehended only through a dialectic reinterpretation. The dialectic basis of Piaget's theory is expressed in his assimilation-accommodation paradigm, but development is interpreted as a continuing alienation from this basis, culminating in formal operations. Although Piaget's interpretations capture a rich variety of performance during childhood they fail to represent adequately the thought and emotions of mature and creative persons. For interpretations of adulthood and aging, a return to the dialectic basis  is necessary. Such a reorganization can proceed from any of the four major levels of development. It introduces intra- and interindividual variations into Piaget's theory. Individuals may operate either simultaneously or in short succession at different cognitive levels. The ceaseless striving toward formal operations becomes inappropriate and ineffective for the level of dialectic maturity. (Author/DP)",

A total of 56 nursery school and 40 college-age subjects observed pictures under name labeling, color labeling, imaging, and no label instructions. Subjects were then tested for retention of object identity and color information. In general, no label instructions led to poorer performance than any other condition; the three remaining groups, given an instruction requiring a discriminative response to each picture as it was shown, performed equally well. Significant age differences were found in memory for both object identity and color information; however, nursery school and college-age subjects showed similar relative performance when tested for these  two kinds of information, and most subjects at each age level showed superior retention of object identity over color information. These results suggest some limitation on the generality of claims that young children are more oriented to color information than are adults and, more importantly, that children represent their experience ikonically while adults tend to use a symbolic mode of representation.

An overt rehearsal technique was used in which 28 children in grades 3, 6, and 8 were instructed to rehearse out loud while trying to memorize a list of unrelated nouns. Control groups at each age level received standard free recall instructions, with no mention of rehearsal. Findings were consistent with earlier studies: older children performed better than younger subjects. The major developmental differences occurred over the primacy and middle sections of the serial position curve. Analysis of the data indicates that younger children use more passive rehearsal strategies than older children. They tend to rehearse only the item currently presented, while eighth graders intermix  large numbers of items. Discussion is based on this observation, and the implication is that the number of rehearsal contexts may be more important than the number of times an item is rehearsed in long-term memory storage.

The first involves the extent to which behavioral principles can contribute to the selection and specification of educational objectives, and the design of programs to meet these objectives. The second issue involves the shifting of emphasis from the early behavioral focus on environmental control shaping the child to consideration of how the environment can be manipulated so that children learn to  control their own behavior and effectively change their environments.

It was predicted that age, ethnic group, and sex would significantly influence mean levels of achievement, but that analyses of patterns of item performance would reveal a similar sequence of concept and skill acquisition regardless of ethnic group means. These predictions were called the &quot;fixed-sequence hypothesis&quot;. Age and ethnic group were significant influences on performance; sex was not. Scalogram analyses showed that each ethnic group's performance tended to form a scalable item set, but for a somewhat  different ordering of the 25 items. Thus, the results were inconsistent with cognitive-developmental theory. It was condluded that individual differences are likely to affect development when sequences are highly task specific, but that the bulk of the evidence still supports a general sequence of stages in cognitive development.

Subjects (N=237) were 11-year olds in six Ontario parochial schools. Openness of the school program was assessed with information collected from teachers in the Dimensions of Schooling Questionnaire (DISC). Analysis of results indicates that openness of program was not significantly related to children's curiosity behavior. A curvilinear distribution for curiosity and openness of program was obtained, similar to the distribution postulated by Berlyne  for cognitive conflict and specific curiosity. This similarity is the basis for discussion. It is concluded that the tentative evidence obtained raises some questions as to whether open programs necessarily enhance curiosity behavior. It is suggested that a moderate level of program openness may be the optimum environment for fostering curiosity. (DP)",

        "description":"This document reports a study investigating the effects of father absence on measures of cognitive, social, and motivational development in infancy. The sample included 54 black infants, 27 of whom were classified &quot;father-absent.&quot; This classification was based on two indices, (1) a dichotomy of father-absent or father-present based on mother's responses to questions, and (2) a rating scale describing amount of father-infant interaction. Sixteen measures of infant functioning were analyzed for the study. The analysis indicated that for female infants there were no relationships between father variables and infant behavioral variables. For males, the following dependent variables were significant: Bayley Mental Developmental Index scores, a cluster from the Bayley Scales measuring  social responsiveness, another cluster measuring Secondary Circular Reaction, and exploratory behavior as assessed in situational tests. It is speculated that one of the father's functions in infancy may be to provide stimulation that augments the primary caregiver's by introducing a degree of novelty. No explanations for the sex differences could be formulated. It is concluded that the results are tentative, and much observational research is needed. (DP)",

These concepts, based on human role-taking capacities, include empathic distress, sympathetic distress, personal guilt, and existential guild. At first, a child cannot discriminate between himself and others in emphatic distress. Then he learns to discriminate and can feel sympathy for others through four developmental stages: (1) the child's assumption of the other's feelings are first based on the projection of his own feelings, even though his objective is to relieve the other's distress; (2) the child becomes aware that the other's perspective is different from his own, and guesses what his feedback should be, (3) the child  synthesizes his empathic distress reaction to the other's feelings in a situation with a cognitive construction of the other's general misfortune, and (4) the child can comprehend the plight of entire groups of people. The concept of personal guilt is described as a synthesis of sympathetic distress and an awareness of being the cause of the other's distress. Existential guilt, which is the last concept, is described as coming from a realization that a person is enjoying what others cannot enjoy, or is not suffering what others suffer. Anecdotal examples of each prosocial behavior concept are given. (SET)",

Most nonconservers are very selective in their use of the information provided by these dimensions. Most preschool and kindergarten nonconservers used length to define amount, while ignoring width. This was true regardless of how extreme the transformations were, in what order children saw the transformations, and whether the transformation was begun anew on each trial or continued from trial to trial. The youngest preschool children, however, were not as likely as the older preschoolers to restrict themselves to the length dimension. The results were interpreted as being counter to Piaget's four-step equilibration model of how compensation and conservation  develop. (Author/SET)",

Five basic issues were identified: (1) It is necessary to distinguish between acquisition of new responses and performance of those already in the repertory. (2) The relationships between the modeled behavior and the responses expected of the subject should be examined through investigations of the extent to which exposure to the model can affect diverse response classes to diverse stimuli, particularly with linguistic, problem solving, and creative tasks. (3) The amount of structure given to subjects varies greatly in the literature, with regard to explicitness of instructions and type of task used. (4) There has been little  uniformity in choosing dependent variables. Many kinds of verbalizations, grammatical parameters, and more unusual behavioral dimensions (i.e., attitudes) have been used. (5) Finally, many commonly used terms (i.e., creative response) need to be defined somewhat arbitrarily, for the sake of standardization. (DP)",

If it can be demonstrated that creative (unusual, flexible) behaviors are increased upon seeing other creative behaviors modeled, this finding would contradict the simple matching to template interpretation for modeling influences, as well as provide clues as to effective methods for teaching creativity. After analyzing three studies which are related to this issue, it is concluded that the effects of modeling are not confined to providing precise demonstrations of the kinds of behaviors deemed desirable. A model presented as incidental to the subject's task, who demonstrates behavior different from that used as a dependent variable, can still affect the  flexibility or rigidity of an observer's problem solving behavior.

Locus of control research is traced from the early laboratory experiments which demonstrated that instructions and perceptions about skill and chance could dramatically affect subjects' performance, to field research investigating whether individuals carry generalized expectancies about the control of reinforcement. The paper focuses on three specific areas that are emerging in the research and have implications for further understanding of expectancies about locus of control and behavior in general. (1) The first topic is the relationship between belief in internal control and physical health. In general,&quot;internals&quot; have been found to be most likely to take preventive measures to stay healthy. (2) The second area has to do with the relationship between internal control and emotional well-being. Results have been quite similar to the studies dealing with physical health. (3) The final topic concerns perceived power and personal competence. However, little research evidence is available on this topic. (DP)",

The California Psychological Inventory was administered to the college students. In all experiments, subjects had the choice of obtaining rewards one at a time, either by pushing a lever or choosing freely from a filled dish. There was a great preference for obtaining rewards by bar pressing. The preference decreases from nearly 100 percent to about 50 percent as subjects increased in age. No significant differences were found for type of rewards, sex, or race of  subject and experimenter, except that males bar pressed significantly more than females in the college group.

The  1972-73 evaluation examined the program's 3 components: instruction, staff development, and community-parent involvement. The evaluation design consisted of comparing REPSAC students with a similar group of children not in the program for learning aptitude, English and Spanish language development, and sensory, perceptual, speech, and psychomotor development using a pretest, posttest, and 2-group analysis of covariance; observations; and interviews. Among the major findings was that REPSAC students made significant gains in Spanish language development and speech development. (NQ)",

Nine delineations are compared for specific variables to test for differences in computed properties of each variable and for differences in estimated  relationships among variables.

The accumulated test results will serve the purpose of differentiated assessment of the overall progress of education. NAEP defined 192 separate populations for testing by the following subdivisions: sex, race, geographic region, age group, community size and type, and socioeconomic level.  This report discusses rural education and national assessment for reading, writing, citizenship, science, and literature. Objectives, samples of test questions used, test results, and implications for rural schools are discussed. A brief historical overview; the assessment procedures and schedule; and the social and psychological, cultural, economic, political, and military implications are also covered. (NQ) Aspect of National Assessment (NAEP) dealt with in this document: Program Description.",

Two kinds of information were obtained--personal interviews and dental examinations. Data were collected during Spring 1972 for the first year phase and during Fall 1972 and Spring 1973 for the validation. The information was summarized and analyzed by descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and path analysis. Six separate models were discussed and  analyzed. It was found that similarities exist in the models developed across dimensions of ethnicity and residential groupings, and that financial factors and \"symptomatic orientation toward dental care\" were the greatest determinants of dental care behavior.

Datawere collected by interview-type field schedules from all families within selected clusters of households. The schedules were reviewed item by item to locate attributes likely to be significant and those attributes were subjected to statistical significance tests. All items retained were given score values and classified into 3 categories: biographical, economic, and environmental. This scale was the basis for analyzing social patterns of income both by tabular and regression analyses. Major findings were that families could be placed in 7  separate patterns and that there was a consistent change in variable relationships throughout the patterns. The study suggested that the family income patterns may be used to conceptualize the profile of rural poverty so that programs can be directed to specific people for specific remedial purposes.

Students were equally divided into bilinguals and monolinguals, and responded to 3 questionnaires which dealt with attitudes toward being Mexican American, educational aspirations, school involvement, family background, acculturation, and attitudes toward teachers, counselors, and schools. Data indicated that there seemed to be a strong relationship between bilingualism and the degree of the student's acculturation. It appeared that the greatest difference between bilinguals and monolinguals was home background. There was  little evidence, however, that bilinguals have more emotional and social problems than monolinguals. It was also noted that, since this study did not include the socioeconomic factor, results were inconclusive.

It appeared that purposeful or meaningful use of time was directed to an expression of handwork, often artistic. Leisure time activities, family influences, and  school activities affected students' artistic ability. The more artistic group scored consistantly higher in artistic expression.

Information was collected from 50 former students from the years 1965 and 1968 on their education, present status and suggested school improvements. Data were collected by direct and indirect interviews in: post-school occupations, drop-out ratio, educational progress, and spouse occupation. The investigation revealed that there is a definite trend toward the improvement of the Spanish American's position in the North Platte Valley. It was found that the Spanish Americans were finding more attractive positions in industrial, semi-professional or professional occupations; that there was a tendency for the largest percentage of  dropouts to occur in grade 7 and diminish through grade 12; and that there is a definite relationship between the amount of education acquired and participation in community activities.

The evaluation project was concerned with 3 major objectives: (1) an examination of the 1972-73 school program using a 5 stage model; (2) &quot;backup and start over&quot; assessment; (3) possible alternatives which may be derived from the first and second objectives. This report is concerned only with objective one. The 5 stage model evaluates: (1) the adequacy of the educational needs assessment, including specification of goals and objectives; (2) the adequacy of program planning, including staff preparation, orientation, academic leadership; (3) adequacy of program implementation; (4) adequacy of internal evaluation of program progress; and (5) end of year student behavior  outcomes. Listed are 12 findings, which include that there is general agreement that the school facility is not needed for general education of children, and almost all students today are admitted under social criteria, reflecting learning handicaps in large numbers. Eleven recommendations are also presented, e.g., serious effort should be made to design and install a program to meet the needs of children with severe social-emotional learning handicaps, and staff qualifications and competencies must be specified by the program designer(s).

The purpose of this report is to give a brief summary of the conditions of the various peoples, to sketch out what policies--if any--the governments of their various republics are adopting towards them, and to suggest ways in which their lot might be improved. The situation of the Indians in the Altiplano of Ecuador, Peru and Boliva, and of the Mapuches in Chile and Argentina differs in character from that of South America's other autochthonous people. This  report is concerned with the jungle and plain dwellers of the Amazon basin and adjacent lowlands, excluding the Guyanas and Argentina in detail. It covers the dimensions of the problem; church, army, and state attitudes toward native peoples; and future policy.

Disability was defined as the inability to assume expected roles. Seven Mexican American migrant workers in California, 75 small town Blacks in East Texas, and 37 rural Whites in Vermont were studied. The social life orientation variables employed in this study were evaluation of life situation (relative to parents), improvement of life conditions (over last 5 years), life satisfaction, housing satisfaction, and marital satisfaction. Major conclusions were: (1) the occurrence of membership disability has a tendency to negatively influence,  to a very limited extent, evaluations of levels of positive evaluation of improving life circumstances; (2) the occurrence of membership disability does not produce a negative impact on perceived life satisfactions; and (3) the level of disability among disabled families does not influence the views homemakers have of life progress and social satisfactions.

The purpose is to suggest some acts necessary for science teachers and educators to implement science education. Research reports are exemplified to illustrate the prevalent ways for reporting research conclusions as truth, findings, and trivia. Misperceptions of scientific endeavors are described as an explanation for researchers' selection of the reporting styles. Diverse views about truth, objectivity, ambiguous nature, and research scope in science are considered as the primary characteristics of misperceptions, and the inability or  unwillingness to separate findings from explanations is taken as their major source. Reflections of the misperceptions to science teaching are discussed, especially for the non-generalizability of research findings to the teaching situation. The author suggests the science teacher and educator make distinctions between findings and explanations, ask questions about the source of truth, and encourage students to present rival ideas and prize the doubt in order to be morally honest to the knowledge of the scientific endeavor.

Irrelevance of disciplinary courses, formal study, and compulsory schooling to societal situations are discribed as the major challenge to present curricula. Logically organized science disciplines are considered as designed primarily for the study of science but not for applicative use. The importance of problem-oriented science or theory to good practice is a matter open to discussion, and the ability of replicating or reinstating science knowledge is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition  for an individual to attain good performance on his job or in his personal life. The primary use of the theoretical schemata of the disciplines by nonspecialists is interpretive in nature. Science education should not emphasize the replicative and applicative use of school learnings. The author concludes that research studies are needed to examine the interpretive teaching of science in schools and to build a conceptual context with the nature of life made intelligible. (CC)",

The document consists of four sections. The first three sections are concerned with programs and courses offered for K-12, elementary, and secondary school teachers. A specified schema format is used to analyze the programs in terms of content, strategy, outcome, and evidence. Five types of information are provided for each institution: the name and location of the institution, name and address of the information supplier, program descriptions, analytical results presented in the schema format, and lists of available materials. The fourth section contains responses which cannot be adapted to the format.  The authors indicate that the schema presentation is designed to provide opportunities of examining the role of performance-based teacher education programs in connection with their intended outcomes and evidence of their objective attainment. The document is published through the joint effort of the Association for Education of Teachers in Science and the ERIC Information Analysis Center for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education at the Ohio State University.

The documents are limited to journal articles, dissertation abstracts, and abstracted reports, primarily appearing in 1970. Nature of the research conducted is analyzed in terms of curriculum improvement projects, learning theories, child development, curriculum research, instrument design, teacher education, instructional methods, behavioral science, attitude analyses, student characteristics, and comparative and evaluative studies. Summaries are made concerning research findings from articles categorized in each of the areas. The authors indicate that individualization of instruction, Piaget studies, attitude measurement, inquiry teaching, and  interaction analyses are emphasized. The quantity of research increased in 1970, with one-sixth of the studies related to new curriculum projects and over seventy percent presented as doctoral dissertations. The majority of the studies are short-term, localized, and of questionable value in the overall advancement of more effective science education. A bibliography of the reviewed articles is included.

The area, though beyond the limits of the incorporated city, was part of the urban school district which transcended the political boundaries of the city to include its non-incorporated suburban areas. The framework of the study was built upon the four fundamental elements of human ecology: population, technology, environment, and organization. Residents were surveyed to determine age, mobility, and career stability. Local business men, land developers, and county planning officers, were interviewed; land use patterns within the area were analyzed. The study established that  there was no definable neighborhood: the attendance area was an artificial construct used to delimit the elementary school population. The research methodology provided information from which school administrators and district policy makers could estimate growth patterns, financial support for educational programs within the area, and the effect that these factors could have upon school programs.

Some ways in which public education may generate more involvement by individual consumers are examined here. Arguments behind moves to reform educational institutions are presented and preliminary findings of a study of private, non-religious schools are reported to indicate why middle class parents leave public school systems and remain in independent schools. The parameters of this choice are defined by differentiating between the actual processes for producing and allocating public services and ideal conditions of markets and  bureaucracies. To understand the problem of more satisfactory delivery of educational services, three questions were asked of four non-religious, independent, nonpublic schools in the Washington D. C. area: 1) what caused parents to reach dissatisfaction with public schools? 2) how do these alternative schools satisfy them? 3) do these schools provide models to apply to public schools? Data revealed seven substantial reasons for leaving public schools and six factors of parent satisfaction with alternative schools. (Author/KSM)",

The background of the question and the content are developed, stressing academic discussions about America in eighteenth-century Europe, especially in France. A short biography of Jeremy Belknap, the American Rrespondent, is presented, emphasizing his other writings. A classroom study guide describes how the essay may be used in the classroom by suggesting techniques for the study of its style, form, and content. The primary benefit of the question is seen as a stimulus for the student in considering America  as a whole and in placing this larger idea of America in the context of mankind. Further reading materials are discussed. Belknap's answer and a form for recording the viewpoints of aboriginal Americans, African Negroes, European immigrants and those who remained in Europe, are reproduced. (KSM)",

The purpose was to try to resolve whether these concepts are best understood from an instinctivist, operant conditioning, social learning, or stage-theory approach. Current issues in the field, significant scientific theory, and the relevance of these matters for public policy are discussed. Research procedures included: a review of the literature; construction of a classification scheme of essential elements in the theories reviewed; an application of these elements to classes of human characteristics; and an attempt to evolve a  value-free concept of the moral domain. Findings dealt with generalizations about theories of human behavior and moral action. Implications of the findings present negative warnings about prevalent attitudes toward the inculcation of moral codes which stress democratic liberalism. The bibliography partially lists the pertinent literature (72 documents) and lists all works analyzed in the research process. (Author/KSM)",

It is argued that teachers of the social studies must learn about the politics of school organization and become involved in the political process in such organizations. In the first two sections of the essay it is shown that the purposes, goals, and objectives shape the way the functions of schools are performed and that the emphasis given to each function is an expression of the organization's purposes. The concluding section discusses dimensions of the decision-maker in social studies curriculum and  instruction and how he can get the most out of his present school organizational structure while working toward a new school organizational structure. This proposed structure is described as one that places governance functions in the hands of bureaucrats and curriculum and instruction in the hands of the teachers. The teacher's role in accomplishing this model is described as promoting learning to know oneself, to know one's organization, and to know how to change both the organization and self. (Author/KSM)",

Chapter IV describes the new method being tested in the classroom. Students were provided with copies of mass publication magazines and newspaper microfilm produced in 1948. These materials, along with limited reprints of statistical data and secondary sources, constituted a \"history laboratory.\" After following the 1948 campaign and arguing the major issues, each student voted and defended himself in a final essay examination. Evaluations by independent observers are presented in Chapter V. It was agreed that  the course was more than normally popular, and that there were some real cognitive gains. The final chapter presents the author's assessment and recommendations regarding the art of teaching and the process of innovation. Appendices include numerous examples of work done by a random sampling of students in the experimental classroom. (Author/KSM)",

This seminar was concerned specifically with sociocultural facilities and equipment serving the intellectual, artistic, and physical pursuits of individuals, families, and social groups. The main portion of the proceedings are the introductory remarks and discussion of the three main themes: leisure activities in the different European countries; government policies in the cultural field and their effect on facilities; and innovative pilot projects in the field of sociocultural facilities. Recommendations from four working groups touched four areas: the needs and desires of the population and the government's sociocultural policy; the role of  the local authorities in the sociocultural policy; the relationship between private industry and the government's sociocultural policy; and popular culture and the sociocultural policy. Appendices list participants and summarize the discussion in the four working groups. A related document is SO 006 640. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The suggestion that academic professions ought to be treated as games and that graduate school training should consist of preparation in gamesmanship is in this author's viewpoint, perfectly in keeping with the epistomological revolution. The literature of the 1960's which criticized the scientific world-view is reviewed. Three positions that revolutionaires might take are outlined and a fourth position, a compromise, is offered: that the various modalities of human thought and expression cannot be separated, but that in different sorts of behavior one of the different ways of knowing dominates or leads the others. The conclusion drawn from this position is that graduate training must be concerned with facilitating the development not only of the student's capacity for abstract  reasoning but also that of his intuitive modality of thought and expression. A model for reforming the training of future faculty in sociology is based on viewing the academic enterprise as a game, such as football, and the two are compared for use of jargon, complex mathematical models, and rhetoric. Two functions of a game which justify the time and money spent on the sociology game are noted: 1) it keeps a number of capable and energetic men occupied; and 2) it provides an occasion for rare insight into human society.

Emphasis is on the three most outstanding trends. The first, the concept of life-long education, involves an extension of pre-school education and continuing education for adults. The second consideration is the adoption of a comprehensive type of common school for the first phase of secondary education. The most uncertain important aspect of the educational process which commonly presents itself is the stage that lies between the common or comprehensive type of school and entry either to full adult employment, military service, or tertiary education at the age of 19 or 20. Other trends are discussed in chapters on the extension of pre-school  education; primary education; problems of goals and structures in secondary education; administration, curricula and reform; technical education and employment; the interplay of educational innovation; resources for learning and pedagogical method; assessment and orientation; the training of teachers; school and community; and the international perspective.

The first of four sections lays out a set of objectives that environments for youth should meet. Part Two examines a number of institutions and processes that affect youth, including historical background, rights of youth, demographic, economic, biological and psychological development, and aspects for youth culture. Part Three presents seven issues that environments for youth resolve in some way: segregation from adults vs. integration with adults; age segregation among the young; grouping by stage of development, patterning of self-development and productivity; role-segmentation vs. community; the scope of formal  schooling; and the legal status of youth. The last secion provides a number of proposals for change in institutions affecting youth. These alternative directions concern change in school structure, alternation of school and work, work organizations, youth communities and organizations, protection vs. opportunity for youth, use of vouchers, opportunities for public service, and research on on-going processes among youth.

Developed as a learning experience for decision makers and public participants, the simulation emphasizes the integration of political, social, economic, and environmental issues in the resolution of five complex sociotechnical problems. The game simulates a meeting of the Regional Planning Commission of a fictitious county in which participants assume roles of commission members and interested citizens. Package data includes a newspaper, a large three-dimensional model of the county, a notebook of resource information, and a general introduction with regulations. An informal atmosphere of leaderless group discussion and a formal structure of parliamentary procedures force a  confrontation and decision on the problems and issues presented. The political, social, economic, and environmental considerations that should arise during the game are discussed in the game handbook, as well as intended audience participation roles. Details of the evaluation process, a list of county participants, and a description of the county are appended. (Author/KSM)",

Seventeen 10th, 11th, and 12th grade social studies classes at Nyack High School, Nyack, New York comprised the sample. The classes selected ranged from high ability to low ability groups. Students responded anonymously to the following two questions: Supposing that someone had fallen asleep 100 years ago and had just awakened, what should he know about the last 100 years? What do you think of the world we presently know? Tell us whether you would want it to be different and, if so, how it should be different. Student responses reflected the following themes and patterns: 1) material developments of recent times; 2) a sense of social chaos; 3) a wide variation of ideological  viewpoints - from leftist-to conservative orientations; 4) a basic dissatisfaction with our present world; and 5) a sense of existential uncertainty.

To meet this need, a consensual perspective on national social studies goals, a description of recent categorizations of goals within conceptual frameworks, and a summary of a present study are offered. The official statements on the goals for social studies published during the twentieth century are reviewed, reflecting an earlier emphasis on nationalistic loyalty and a common commitment to social responsibility, to intelligence, and to human dignity. Three prominent goal classification theories which have recently appeared - the Joyce framework, the Barth-Shermis view, and the Thomas-Brubaker dimensions - are sketched  and summarized. An assessment device based on the dimensions of Joyce and Thomas-Brubaker, used to determine if social studies philosophical positions differ according to job category, reached three conclusions: the theoretical dimensions are not supported by empirical evidence; differences existing in philosophy do not appear to be significantly determined by job category; and the group tested placed high priority on social studies goals reflecting moral concerns.

Thucydides'&quot;Peloponnesian War&quot; provides such illustrations as the Funeral Oration of Pericles, which might be a contemporary eulogy for those who died for the continuance of their democracy; the debate between the Athenians and the islanders of Melos with the Athenians' justifying the &quot;necessity&quot; of their invasion; and the history of self interest among Athenian leaders, which eventually brought their democracy to an end. Thucydides in modern context is rewarding reading, can fascinate a class, and can change the prejudice that antiquity is for museums and quivering scholars.

The collateral issue of deciding how the resources of the Agency for International Development (AID) is discussed. The content is threefold. First, an examination of some of the indices, evidence and trends of educational development during the past decade are considered. Secondly, a review of some of the more important AID activities in education during that same period establishes a general profile of priorities. Finally, basic concepts, principles, and actions which can guide AID in its  educational activities of the 1970's arise from an analysis of AID investments in education and an AID strategy in education. Ten statistical tables of financial obligations for the 1960's and 1970's are appended. (Author/KSM)",

The person-oriented variables of openness vs. closedness; generalized expectancies for internal or external control of reinforcement; and personality traits were investigated. The role-oriented variables of situational role conflict, personal role conflict, teaching performance, and teaching attitude were also explored in 157 elementary education majors. Analysis of data reveal a) the MEP  students reflect both greater situational and personal role conflicts than the control students; b) MEP students have personalities that are better suited for teaching than the control students; and c) no differences in teaching behavior exist among students, although the MEP students develop a more positive attitude toward teaching than the control students do.

Tables with results and comparative figures are included in the text. The paper states that athletes were revealed as no more superstitious than nonathletes in the realm of general superstitions, although they did list more superstitions pertaining to sports than nonathletes did; females in both instances  were more superstitious than males but males had more sports-related superstitions. Many sports-associated superstitions, it is stated, seem related to certain aspects of general superstitions (e.g., female athletes' concern for uniform and hair, social activities; male athletes' concern for food, position or playing order, travel dates and times). The conclusion of this paper, on the basis of this study and previous research, presents two general statements as to superstitions: a) under the impact of stress (in this case athletics), even educated people seek emotional balance; b) people don't become less superstitious with time but rather change the nature of their beliefs.

The present study evaluated the political attitudes of students of the University of Western Ontario on several dimensions: a) &quot;global conservatism-liberalism&quot; as measured by the McClosky Scale, b) self-assessments of political ideology, c) political activism as measured by the Rehberg Scale of Political Activism, and d) Likert issues related to political ideologies. A questionnaire mailed to selected athletes and nonathletes was the method for data collection. The analysed data indicated that, regardless of measure employed or variable introduced, the athletes and nonathletes  were predominantly liberal in their ideologies. These facts applied to &quot;global liberalism&quot; as well as &quot;issue-oriented liberalism&quot; and were interpreted to indicate the following: a) rejection of the American, data-based theoretical propositions regarding the political beliefs of Canadian athletes or b) intrusion of methodological problems such as a social desirability response set. The need for replication of the study was emphasized, particularly in the United States, where more concern has been expressed regarding political ideologies of athletes in comparison with nonathletes in the university setting.

Results show that a) teacher characteristics of achievement motivation, dogmatism, and belief systems are systematically related to preferences for teacher control strategies; b) teacher control styles have strong effects on student decisions  concerning their college education (high-control strategies lead students to favor the value of efficiency; low-control strategies, the value of personal and social growth); and c) students with high internal control perform better under low-control conditions and those with high external control perform better under high-control conditions.

These workshops cover the entire range of competencies needed for initiation and installation of a career development program for kindergarten through the postsecondary level. An emphasis is placed on an experiential approach to ways of implementing career education in the classroom utilizing such strategies as field trips; role playing; &quot;hands-on&quot; experience in occupational simulation situations; dialogue with resource persons for community, business, and industry; and extensive use of multi-media resources. Academic subjects are correlated with the career emphasis in a way that  helps students perceive them as tools for encountering the real world more effectively. (Author/JB)",

The program, being self-instructional, allowed students to work at their own pace, but they did participate in group discussions. The following data were gathered: time to complete reading and exercise assignments; errors on workbook exercises (constituting criterion-like tasks); and student comments. Analysis of this data revealed that the program worked well. Student comments were generally favorable. The only revisions in the program were made on the instructions to students on how to use the program.  Recommendations are made for further evaluation of the revised program. The appendixes include information on workbook error rates; results of final exercises; and participants' comments on overall evaluation, other models, the handbook, and diagramming.

        "description":"Regardless of the type of physical activity used, interval training is simply repeated periods of physical stress interspersed with recovery periods during which activity of a reduced intensity is performed. During the recovery periods, the individual usually keeps moving and does not completely recover before the next exercise interval (e.g., running a predetermined distance at a set pace, then jogging another distance at a set pace). The interval training approach offers the possibility of accomplishing a greater amount of work in a shorter period of time and the possibility of programs of unlimited variety and flexibility. To aid physical education instructors in organizing their class time, several programs were developed based upon time for the 600-yard run-walk and the mile  run. This paper presents such an approach as an excellent way to initiate an interval training program in a physical education class where time is limited and relatively large numbers of students have to be handled. (Two charts with running times and interval running times are included; there is also a blank interval running recording form.) (Author/JA)",

These efforts resulted in the development of the Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP) for preservice teachers, a new Master of Education degree, and an &quot;Academic Fair&quot; summer program for in-service teachers. STEP is a five-phase, competency-based, individualized program which features early and continuous contact with secondary school classrooms and students, individualized learning packages called &quot;seedpacs,&quot; continuous assessment and monitoring, and a variety of teaching/learning methods. The  new Master of Education degree program deals specifically with the continuing educational needs of practicing teachers and the in-service needs of school districts. It, too, is an individualized program in which credit is earned by performance, not by time served. The &quot;Academic Fair&quot; summer program features scheduling that is truly flexible: independent study, small groups, meetings scheduled once or twice a week, classes that meet all day, and classes that never meet.

Four professors comprise the elementary education team responsible for this program. They have dual assignments: as professors who teach and model effective strategies and as clinical professors in a given elementary school who supervise the prospective teachers. Each sequence of study is revised and finalized by the entire team. Prospective teachers generally spend one-half day  in a clinical student teaching assignment followed by an afternoon class on campus at Boise State. At any given time the student teachers' clinical schedule may be altered to give them all-day teaching experiences in their respective classrooms or intensive, in-service workshops. Placement for the two semesters' student teaching is done by cooperative efforts of the building principal and the clinical professor.

The program has three primary objectives. The first objective is to provide business education methods students with exposure to the realities of the secondary school, its facilities, organization, procedures, curriculum, and students. The second objective is to provide for an integration of methods and measurement for business education students. After foundation skills courses, representative subject areas of the secondary business curriculum are presented and applications of this curriculum are then applied and interwoven,  enabling the students to understand the comprehensive role of the classroom teacher. During this period, students participate in directed field experiences that enable them to evaluate and apply the theory of classroom instruction to the realities of the classroom. The third objective of the program is to make the business methods students aware of the innovations and new programs designed for today's youth, the needs of a changing society, and the importance of self-evaluation. An added objective is that after seeing a videotape of actual classes recorded on the field trip, students and teachers in graduate classes will become motivated to employ innovative teaching/learning strategies of their own.

The Choctaw Bilingual Education Program has concentrated its attention on four Oklahoma schools, in the old Choctaw Nation, where this problem is acute. With the cooperation of administrators and teachers in these schools, of Southeastern State College, and of leaders of the Choctaw community, a system of teacher education has been worked out that brings the Indian child into the mainstream of school life without sacrificing his identity as a Choctaw. The program emphasizes three  educational imperatives for Choctaw-speaking children: a) they must have experiences both in and out of school that help them to develop positive self-concepts; b) they must be able to use the Choctaw language as the basic instrument of learning and acquire facility in English as a means of supplementing and extending their learning of Choctaw; c) they must have teachers and classroom aides who understand Choctaw and patterns of Choctaw thought and behavior and who accept these as fully equal to the English language and Anglo-American patterns.

SR is defined as a horizontal approach to language learning, a process of gradual familiarization where students are presented with a mixture of language structures from the outset; these structures are taught in natural contexts based initially on concrete classroom and social situations, the situations becoming increasingly abstract as the student progresses. The expressed theoretical basis of this approach is that people generate language based on what they already know and continually abstract and revise internalized grammar rules from the input they receive. Section one of the document describes this philosophy  and the goals of SR. The second section presents the history of SR.

        "description":"Aware of problems both with the lack of preparation on the part of their cooperating teachers and with beginning teachers' transitions from theory to practice, Tennessee Wesleyan College designed two experimental programs: a) Workshop Experience for Cooperating Teachers, wherein the roles of the cooperating teachers were explored, and b) Workshop Experience, Problems of Beginning Teachers, wherein many of the problems faced by beginning teachers were delineated and analysed. Both workshops explored, in depth, the performance-based teacher education model. A unique feature of both these programs is that the total cost for conducting them was underwritten by the college. There was no tuition cost for participants. Thirty-five cooperating teachers and twenty-five beginning teachers  were enrolled.

Seven forms of this questionnaire were used, each giving a different ordering of the information sources. Students indicated their single most preferred type of information source. Data from the students were compared with figures from  university and junior high school faculty members. The students' sources which showed above the chance level, personal experience and logical considerations, were the professors' and teachers' second choices, respectively. This disparity between professors' preference for logical considerations and the students' for personal experience has been incorporated into the Rutgers curriculum through basic educational psychology courses.

Pupils completed an achievement test and a rating scale of these teachers which placed the teacher in a high-, medium, or low-effect group. A comparison of the frequency and types of questioning and reinforcing behavior between high- and low-effect teachers was then made. The data from this show that a) high-effect groups ask more rhetorical questions than the low-effect groups; b) high-level questions distinguished groups from one another more than low-level questions; c) high-effect groups provide more positive verbal reinforcement than low-effect groups; and d) frequency of negative reinforcement does not distinguish one group  from another. When using IQ as an aptitude measure and frequency of any teacher behavior as a treatment, results show that a) more able students perform better with low-frequency questions and low-frequency positive reinforcement and b) less able students show greater achievement with a high frequency of negative reinforcing behavior.

The need for this revision stemmed from severe concern on the part of faculty members, public school officials, and students that the traditional way of training teachers was not doing the job. After two years of planning, a Field-Based Teacher Training Program was initiated in September 1973. This program shifted emphasis from a traditional college campus-based approach to one requiring considerable field experience. A feature of this program was the large involvement of public school administrators and teachers in the program. This cooperation was even carried to the point where public school districts shared the  cost of salaries for the field experience supervisors. The cost sharing approach would indicate some guarantee of heavy interest, contact, responsibility, and accountability. The new program is under constant evaluation by the field-based supervisors, faculty members of the education department, faculty members from other disciplines at Johnson State College, public school officials, and students. Furthermore, the field-based center is definitely oriented towards competency-based teacher education. (Author/JA)",

In each phase, students participate in a significant block of activity in area schools, as well as in competency-instruction sessions, individualized contract assignments, small-group seminars, and work with an advisor. These activities are interrelated, sequenced, and culminate in a full-time supervised teaching experience. Evaluation is achieved by various means. Each competency area is assessed. Teacher candidates and advisors collaborate in evaluation. Finally, the candidate  constructs the model by which his supervised teaching will be evaluated. Goals for continued professional growth are specified at exit from the program. An overall aim in the program is to promote opportunity for the teacher candidate to move from involvement to deeper commitment to education. (Author/JA)",

Programs were initiated and strengthened in order to a) improve the educational opportunities available to low-income and migrant youths and better prepare teachers to serve them; b) broaden the education of future teachers through international travel, study, and exposure; c) allow for maximum professional development and utilization of faculty members; and d) develop a continuing program of teacher education offering a strong learning and teaching experience through a variety of  alternative plans. The reorganization of programs has been ongoing and has resulted in such specific changes as a preservice program for all student teachers, field-centered and performance experiences as part of the requirements of courses, alternative strategies for the completion of courses, and, most important, an interdisciplinary academic approach to the preparation of teachers. The changes that have come about in the School of Education have resulted entirely from self-evaluation and self-initiation, without outside agencies requiring or financing the changes.

        "description":"Instructors in the Department of Education at Purdue University have developed a combination of educational innovations called &quot;Individualized Instructional Analysis System (IIAS).&quot; The system is a combination of microteaching, interactional analysis, and audio-tutorial techniques. The microteaching aspect employs a teacher who teaches a very brief lesson which is videotaped. He then observes and participates in a critique of the taped sample of his teaching, revises his teaching, and then performs the whole sequence again. Interactional analysis involves the identification of certain verbal behaviors in a classroom and the evaluation of them. Thus, it is possible to ascertain how much the students talk relative to how much a teacher talks; how many questions are being asked;  whether the questions really extend a student's thinking, or whether they cut it short. Audio-tutoring is an individualized process which makes use of a variety of programmed audiovisual materials in such a way that students learn according to their own rates. With the audio-tutorial system, the student and the teaching device are paired off. The one-to-one ratio provides each student with a tutor of unlimited patience. (Included in this document are a summary of the program, a case study, and material from student evaluations.) (Author/JA)",

These three elements are integrated to constitute a total learning package (L-PAC). L-PACs are units of work with specific objectives, learning activities, and an evaluation plan. The student progresses through the required and elective L-PACs at his own pace. The Field Experience component is also competency oriented, and each course includes a number of field experiences which expose the student to public school classrooms and other work with children. The university professor and the cooperating  teacher share the responsibility for developing a list of competencies. The Personalized Development Experience involves students in small interaction groups designed to develop self-understanding and human relation skills. A number of the L-PACs have both required and optional learning seminars, in which the faculty member serves as a resource person to the student. Evaluation of a student's progress is based on completion of objectives, thus dropping the traditional grade system. (Author/JA)",

The taping was made possible through close coordination of university supervisors, public school personnel, and a technical assistant. The first phase of the program allowed the student teachers to be taped once during the quarter by the technical assistant. A second phase of the program calls for the student teachers to tape themselves and make these tapes available to their university supervisors and supervising teachers for evaluative purposes. As part of phase two, student teachers will tape themselves more than once during the quarter.  It is felt that additional tapings will enhance the meaning of this self-evaluative technique by allowing the student teacher to view his progress. Prospective student teachers will learn the basics of operating video tape equipment during undergraduate methods courses and microteaching sessions. Equipment used in the second phase is made available to the school where the teacher is assigned. (Author/JA)",

Anthropological field methods rather than traditional research methology were used to collect the data. The major findings were: (1) test scores did not reveal any overall shifts in achievement either above or below the level expected on the basis of prior performance. (2) Instruction was characterized by freedom of choice for the student. (3) Most parents planned to re-enroll their children in the school. (4) The primary sources of parental dissatisfaction were a disagreement concerning instructional  philosophy and the teaching strategies designed to develop a sense of personal responsibility and independence in the students. (5) Decision-making at the school is extensively democratized. (6) The role of the principal is that of a coordinator or facilitator rather than that of an authority or power figure. Instructional leadership was excluded from the role of the principal. (7) There was no satisfactory method for regularly monitoring student progress or for reporting progress to parents. (8) Competent teaching aides were important to the functioning of the instructional program. (EH)",

Major emphasis was placed on the child's cognitive and social development in the context of the classroom experience. Data was collected through the use of 24 forms, questionnaires and tests. Major findings were: (1) life circumstances associated with family economic status were associated with the child's performance on measures of cognitive development and achievement upon entering a Head Start Program. (2) There were significant overall gains on cognitive development, preacademic readiness, the ability to learn a  new task, and achievement motivation. The gains were greater than expected at usual maturational rates. (3) As age increased, achievement motivation increased and adjustment problems decreased. (4) Teacher demographic variables were not related to the progress of the children. (5) Programs did make a difference and the highly structured focused, and well-implemented compensatory programs brought about greater immediate cognitive gains than low structured, diffuse and less well implemented programs. (6) There was substantial variation in cognitive gains among classes and a significant amount of this variation could be predicted from class and teacher-based observation. (EH)",

Characteristics of the signal identification task were manipulated by varying signal duration and signal-to-noise ratio. Subjects received a battery of reference ability tests and then proceeded to perform the criterion task under the different experimental conditions. To determine the relationship between task characteristics and ability requirements, the reference battery was factor analyzed to identify a reference ability structure. The loadings of the various criterion task conditions on that structure were then estimated. The Auditory Perceptual ability was found most related to criterion task  performance and increased in importance as background noise increased and signal duration decreased. Thus, these variations in task conditions produced changes in the degree of involvement but not in the patterning of the abilities required. Implications for predicting task performance are discussed. (Author/EH)",

Emphasis is given to separating the impacts of school and non-school learning inputs. Student study time has a positive impact and time watching television a negative impact on learning practical skills such as arithmetic computations and spelling. The impact on more conceptual language and arithmetic skills is smaller and sometimes reversed. The qualitative aspects of teacher and parent teaching inputs are highly substitutable. Lower achieving students are more dependent on teachers than higher achieving students because they have less educated parents and access to fewer other non-school learning inputs. They attempt to compensate by studying more and  obtaining more help from their less educated parents, but the teacher is their primary skilled teaching input. Consequently, schools have a greater marginal impact on lower achieving students. They tend to equalize achievement among all students even when poorer quality resources, in particular teachers, are allocated to lower achieving students. Greater equalization could be obtained by allocating the higher quality school resources to lower achieving students. Parent, student, school and teacher questionnaires appear in the appendix as well as several zero order correlation matrices. (Author)",

Starting from the notion of implicit theory of personality and Kelly's personal construct theory, it has been assumed that a person's individual constructs would be more meaningful than scales provided by the experimenter in ratings of other people, since the individual constructs best represent those dimensions that a person habitually uses in his interpretations of the social environment. In the present study four indices of cognitive complexity and one index of extremity of ratings were used to test the effects of the meaningfulness of constructs. The results did not support the hypothesis that perceptions  of other people are characterized by greater complexity when subjects use their own constructs rather than constructs provided by the experimenter.

The specific objectives were to: 1) Apply a Cost-Utility Model to a \"real world\" situation in a public secondary school; 2) Develop a technique for obtaining dollar values which represent program threshold cost; and 3) Measure the judgmental gap--the difference between dollars actually budgeted to competing programs and dollars recommended to be budgeted based on the output generated from the cost-utility analysis. The process of evaluating programs for purposes of resource allocation provided a process for coming to some concensus about the relative  worth or value of these educational programs. The Cost-Utility Analysis procedure stimulated the collection of program cost data not previously available to the budget administrator, such a program threshold cost. The discrepancies between the recommended and actual program budget allocations were small enough to justify a more comprehensive application of the program evaluation and budget allocation process.

It should help officials designate eligible attendance areas and select project areas, using the best available data. The handbook can serve both as a reference guide and as a step-by-step guide to selecting target areas. For the 1971-72 school year, the handbook should be particularly helpful in refining the use of data sources used in previous years. The section that tells how to translate data to attendance areas and then how to compare attendance areas is especially useful. For the 1972-73 school year, the handbook will serve the  additional function of explaining the geography and use of the 1970 census data. For the purposes of this handbook, an eligible attendance area is defined as an attendance area which meets the legal requirements of having a high concentration of children from low income families. A project area is an eligible attendance area that has been chosen by the local educational agency to be a participating area for the Title I program. Target area is a term frequently used to refer collectively to eligible attendance areas and project areas. (Author/JM)",

Two theories related to the disadvantaged have evolved: the first is the \"deprivation theory\" which stresses the importance of an enriched environment, during the early years, on the cognitive and emotional development of the child; the second is \"the cumulative intellectual deficit theory,\" which points out that the child's emotional and intellectual deficit increases as he passes from grade to grade. No one has been able to fully explain the cause for and process of the diminishing organismic development of the disadvantaged child from a restricted, impoverished environment. The author attempted to provide such a rationale as to the \"how\" and \"why\" of the resulting influence of deprivation by means of a theory of human  development which included the new concept of bioplasmic forces, etheric or growth forces on which Russian scientists and others have been doing research since 1939. Prior to this, a theoretical foundation in child development was established and normal growth patterns were examined. The author attempted to explicate the stages in child growth by means of the concept of controlled-movement over locomotive, speech and cognitive development. (Author/JM)",

The first volume of the report comprises four chapters and seven appendices. Chapter 1 has as main purposes (i) to describe the study in terms of experimental design, sampling, data collection, analysis method, and overall logic of analysis, and (ii) to determine how ESAP funds were translated into activities undertaken by each school. Chapters 2 and 3 report the evaluation results--Chapter 2 studying ESAP's impact on student attitudes toward integration, and Chapter 3, ESAP's effect on student achievement.  Chapter 4 briefly states the conclusions of the study and their implications for policy recommendations. The first 3 appendices (A, B, and C) are analyses of the material in Chapters 1-3. Appendix D is an analysis of the achievement test used, E describes the scales constructed, and F the sample. Appendix G presents intercorrelations among the program variables. The main finding of the study was that black male students in the experimental schools had achievement scores one-half grade level higher than those in the control schools. Among the recommendations were: that programs like the ESAP should be maintained, federal pressure to eliminate classroom segregation should be maintained, and federal policy regarding achievement grouping should be more flexible.

The fourth paper demonstrates that the racial composition of the Southern schools does not affect black achievement in any manner. The last paper is an effort to find some &quot;scientific way&quot; to look at the present furor over busing. In summary, it is contended that while desegregation does not seem to harm white achievement, it does little to raise black achievement. However, it is held that the most reassuring note is that teachers in desegregated schools can be influenced to accept desegregation and to make their black students welcome. (Author/RJ)",

To inaugurate this series, Dr. Doxey A. Wilkerson, an eminent educator and advocate of equal educational opportunity for several decades, was interviewed. Dr. Wilkerson is Professor of Education at the Ferkauf Graduate School of Yeshiva University. He was a professor in several black colleges and universities for many years and is now involved mainly in the preparation of teachers for effectively working with children of the poor. The interview includes discussions of the following questions: Which of a complex of influences in-school and out-of-school  contributing to the widespread retardation and high dropout rates among children of the poor are most critical? If teachers would only teach, would disadvantaged children learn effectively? Within the context of a school system whose priorities are wrong and whose administration is at fault in this, what can we expect of a teacher? What changes are of special importance in improving the quality of education for children of the poor? What role should black and Hispanic studies play in the education of children in our city?

Jordan, Jr., Executive Director of the Urban League, and a foreword by Andrew Billingsley, is reviewed. Dr. Hill begins by identifying five family strengths, which for blacks constitute \"adaptations necessary for survival and advancement in a hostile environment.\" The strengths are not different from those cultivated by some white families. The first major strength of poor black families is strong kinship bonds. The second strength is a strong work orientation. The third strength is adaptability of family roles, a response to economic necessities on the part of black, low-income families. A fourth strength of the black poor is their high  achievement orientation. The fifth major source of black family strength is religious orientation. In his conclusions, Dr. Hill asserts that an examination of black family strengths couldassist in understanding their weaknesses, and could thereby lead to a proper program for aiding blacks in America today.

One might have thought that by 1973 publishing houses would have eliminated the need for this type of criticism, but this is not the case. The Michigan Department of Education has reported on a study of 75 texts used in its secondary schools, and the results are chilling. To insure accuracy and balance the educators selected three reviewers for each text, carefully trying to mix professional historians, classroom teachers, professors of education and district social studies personnel. The reviewers were asked to rate their one or two assigned texts on the basis of  accurate presentation of minorities. The two-volume report, constituting the most thorough study of its kind, focused not only on the black role but on that of other minorities, and some reviewers included women in their evaluations. The 46 experts were asked to evaluate the texts on a scale of \"Very Good,\"\"Good,\"\"Fair,\" or \"Poor.\" Of the 75 texts only eight received \"Very Good\" as a rating, 15 were rated \"Good,\" 31 were rated \"Fair,\" and 21 were rated \"Poor.\" Thirty-one per cent of the ratings were on the positive side; 69 per cent on the negative side.

        "description":"There is little question that the primary element regarding school desegregation is the latent and overt racism pervading American society. Perhaps it is unrealistic to suggest that the school, the transmission belt of American mores from one generation to the next, is likely to intervene in the already existing pattern. Moreover, statements and actions of the national administration do not always serve the cause of equality of educational opportunity. However when there is no commitment at the local level, it is unreasonable to expect that something will happen at the national level. Another deterrent to racial integration is a growing resistance from many white ethnic groups to recent social and educational gains by blacks and other socially visible minorities. While it may not  be an exact parallel, the reactions of the more militant and dissatisfied elements of minority communities may also be serving as a deterrent to desegregation. One of the more covert deterrents is the developing pattern of teacher organization and teacher militancy. The equating of compensatory education with desegregation of schools exemplifies a critical kind of racism prevalent in our society. The process of integration, moreover, has failed to receive full attention once black and white children are together in the classroom. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The paucity of research and writings about nursing and the urban poor seems to indicate that the nursing profession has not yet analyzed and evaluated itself in this regard. If so, the nursing leadership has accepted its share of the challenge to improve the capabilities of practitioners who work with the poor without having assessed the effectiveness of its practitioners or its curriculum in the delivery of health care to the poor. There are some direct clues in the writings of non-nurses that nurses' perceptions of urban poverty should be further studied. No studies were located, for example, which examined the perceptions of associate degree nurses regarding the life situations of the urban poor population, although there are several reasons why it would be an appropriate  group to study. Those left out of the mainstream of society have developed adaptations of values. Attention to such life styles should tell a good deal about how and why certain groups are excluded from the mainstream and are unable to obtain adequate services. These insights can guide officials and planners to see that education, health, and social service techniques and delivery modes must be restructured if they are to be equally available to the disadvantaged poor.

        "description":"During the 1971-72 academic school year, a study was conducted which described and compared the attitudes of white high school seniors toward black Americans in three suburban high schools. These schools varied in terms of the possible interaction between black and white students as reflected in each school's racial composition, grouping procedures, and curricular options. The study compares the attitudes of high school seniors in an all white high school with those of seniors in two racially mixed high schools. It was hoped that the study would provide some insights about the effect of intergroup contact on attitudes. However, the study also examines the implications of findings which maintain that contact alone may not break down the stereotypes between the two groups if the  contact occurs in situations where status distinctions are maintained. The study thus makes a distinction between an integrated setting which seeks to facilitate the positive interaction of a racially mixed student body, and a desegregated setting which is not characterized by practices aimed at fostering interaction. The attitudinal data strongly support the possibility that the efforts of the integrated district to provide a highly positive environment for black and white students had a positive effect on their attitudinal responses.

The phrase \"black studies\" is used to refer to those programs and departments which may have different designations but are highly similar in content to black studies: Afro-American studies, race and ethnic studies, African and Afro-American studies, and possibly other variants. Directly and deeply affected have been white sociologists whose expertise is in the field of race and ethnic relations. For them the experience with black studies has been at once puzzling and painful. Both their professional competence and their personal motives have been publicly questioned. During the past year the author has visited more than 50 campuses around the country and  has conducted interviews with 150 white sociologists who, like him, have invested much time and much of themselves in the systematic exploration of race relations. In addition, more than 40 directors or associate directors of black studies programs and a smaller number of other social scientists were interviewed. The data gathered is used here as a starting point for an examination of some of the implications of black studies for higher education in the 1970's, focusing on their significance for administration, teaching, and research.

The paper includes brief descriptions of studies of school desegregation programs in the states of Connecticut, New York, Michigan, and California, together with a more extensive coverage of his own research on a voluntary desegregation program in metropolitan Boston called METCO. He reports few positive effects, and concludes that \"massive mandatory busing for purposes of improving student achievement and interracial harmony is not effective and should not be adopted at this time.\" This critique of Armor's paper makes such points as: Unrealistic standards for judging the effects of \"busing\" were used. The selection of studies was biased and  incomplete. The critical distinction between desegregation was ignored. Biased and incomplete descriptions were provided of the few studies discussed. The use of white control groups was inadequate and often misleading. The METCO research had serious weaknesses. The achievement effects of \"busing\" were more complex and positive than reported. Shifts in aspiration and \"academic self-image\" during desegregation are positive in meaning. Shifts in racial attitudes during desegregation were exaggerated and interpreted too narrowly.

The CULS approach assumes that, in order to meet the demands of quality education for black students, the University must be prepared to do certain things it never did previously and to modify some of the things it has always done. The University, from this perspective, is seen as an instrument for the service of the black community (just as it is for its white constituencies). Practically any aspect of black student life is fair game for the attention of CULS if it has direct or indirect connections with the stated goals. The focus is thus upon relatively unique  approaches to solving problems experienced universally by black students at large predominantly white institutions. The accounts include analyses of problem situations, rationales for methods, descriptions of techniques, and indicators of their success or failure. The hypotheses and conclusions about fundamental psychological issues underlying black higher education are based on incidental and systematic observations of the program's activities as well as controlled experiments and surveys of students.

        "description":"In June, 1969, the Government of the District of Columbia sought and was awarded a grant by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, under Section 314 of the Housing Act of 1954, as amended, to train 25 public housing youths in five maintenance skills: painting, window glazing, landscaping, screening, and carpentry. In addition to being taught one or more of these skills, the trainees were to receive some instruction in property management. They were also to be given some personal and academic counseling. The broad objectives of the 314 demonstration project were two-fold: to improve the condition of public housing units by helping to reduce a large backlog of needed repairs; and to instill a sense of responsibility and pride in the trainees while providing them with  skills to enter the job market. Of the original 25 trainees, 18 remained with the program for the full 14 months. Numerous maintenance repairs were accomplished at the public housing sites. There were unmistakable signs that the trainees developed self-confidence and a sense of social worth as a result of the project. All trainees either returned to or continued in high school for the duration of the training program, despite the fact that several had previously dropped out of school or were on the verge of dropping out.

        "description":"The twin rationales for this study are: (1) that the educational implications of metropolitan conditions deserve further study; and (2) that these implications transcend national boundaries. The study focuses on two facets of metropolitan school systems located in four metropolises: the characteristics of teachers and the patterns of perceived success of the respective school systems. In an attempt to use some sub-national unit, this study considers selected elements of the educational systems of Amsterdam, London, Paris, and New York City. It is hypothesized that in both respects, the four cities not only differ from the norms of their respective national settings but they differ in the same direction from nation to nation. It is predicted that both metropolitan teachers and  what is termed the perceived success of their school systems are marked by features peculiar to the metropolitan setting: its heterogeneity, mobility, concentration of expertise, and so on. The purpose of this study is, however, not limited to identifying similarities and differences within and across countries. Explanations of findings are suggested, by considering why certain differences between metropolitan and national norms are less marked in some countries than in others, and why the differences are sometimes in unexpected directions, or inconsistent.

The investigator developed and pretested a 40 item questionnaire. Random sampling procedures were used to obtain 400 subjects, to whom the questionnaire was mailed. Respondents, numbering 260, or 65 percent, returned questionnaires. The final subjects included 28 project directors, 72 principals, and 160 teachers. Approximately 70 percent of the respondents reported that program funds had a some/large effect in providing additional facilities, personnel, and teacher training. Most of the participants reported that the extent to which program money induced  educational effectiveness was some/large. Almost 80 percent of the project directors indicated a some/large effect of program activities on educationally disadvantaged students, while 74 percent of teachers, and 72 percent of the principals exhibited the same opinion. Eighty-four percent of the directors and two-thirds of the teachers and principals perceived the effect of the program on interracial experiences to be some/large. The bulk (over four million dollars) of the almsot 6.5 million dollars in program grants went into two activities--curriculum revision and teacher training. (Author/JM)",

The function of this paper is to develop an &quot;itemized and categorized&quot; analysis of one of the five workshops. This summary was prepared from notes on four lectures presented by Dr. Dan Dodson under a grant from the Emergency School Assistance Program. The workshop upon which this paper is based was divided into four sessions. The content of the workshop can be divided into the following major topics: (1) The city as a socializing institution and its humanization through social encounter; (2) the traditional role of the public schools; (3) new educational concepts;  (4) the legitimation of the authority of the schools; (5) desegregated education; and, (6) implications for educators. A section entitled &quot;Research Notes&quot; provides a sociological perspective on such terms as power, educational bureaucracy, and power structure. (Author/JM)",

It indicates that the basic issue in the busing debate is racial desegregation in our nation's schools. Section two, \"Busing in Perspective,\" examines the history, scope, and cost of busing; the law and busing; and, the attacks on busing as a symbol for racial desegregation. Section three, \"Busing: What are the Objections,\" discusses six assumptions of busing against the background of four axioms of social change. Section four, \"The Impact of Busing: The Child,\" discusses the question, \"What does racial balance have to do with education?\" It presents a discussion of the range of opinions on that question including an overview of the arguments  of Jensen, Jencks, The Rand Report, the Fleischmann Report, the Weinburg Analysis, and the work of Kleindorfer, Levin, and Stout. Section five examines several \"Alternatives to Busing.\" The discussion proceeds from the premise that the availability and suitability of alternatives depend on the importance assigned by the community to the objective of racial integration. Section six, an \"Appendix,\" includes the memorandum from the Commission on Civil Rights to Congress relative to the anti-busing amendment, and the bibliography used by the staff in researching the topic.

        "description":"This report has a descriptive and evaluative delineation of those programs which have been (or are being) developed for Puerto Rican students in the public schools of Jersey City. The data of the report have been gathered in those schools with large Puerto Rican constituencies, and have been cast in the perspectives afforded by discussions with administrators, teachers, and students. What has evolved has been carefully measured in a multiplicity of dialogues with Puerto Rican parents whose aspirations for their children must remain the essential touchstone for all assessments, in the final analysis, in an area of such crucial concern. Some programs in operation in the Jersey City Public School for Spanish speaking pupils are as follows: teachers who specialize in &quot;English as a  Second Language Program&quot; have been assigned to 16 elementary schools. One school has the &quot;New Jersey Bilingual Education Program,&quot; funded under Title VII of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act. It consists of four bilingual teachers, and &quot;English as a Second Language&quot; teacher, a &quot;Spanish as a Second Language&quot; teacher, and a community liaison officer. Another school has a Bilingual Program under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act. Six bilingual teachers are assigned to the program.

The Title VII bilingual program operated at the fifth grade level in three schools with two bilingual program classes in each school. The program had an enrollment of 111 students--34 English dominant and 77 Portuguese dominant students. The product objectives of the Instructional Component focused on student achievement in the academic areas of mathematics and science; the production of Portuguese and English speech sounds and grammatical structures (oral and written); and the social interaction between Portuguese and English dominant students.  The objectives of the Staff Development Component required the staff to increase their academic knowledge of such aspects of bilingual education as use of materials, evaluation, and instructional methodology. Staff training also included efforts to improve the staff's teaching methods in the classroom. Objectives of the Parent-Community component focused on the involvement of parents of participating students and of the community at large in activities related to the bilingual program, and on the dissemination of program information to the parents and the community.

        "description":"Project Success Environment was funded under Title III of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act to help alleviate the behavioral and academic problems of economically disadvantaged inner city students by providing them with the opportunity to experience, on an individual basis, success in school. The program that was developed during the three years of project funding consists of: (1) a positive contingency management system designed to deliver a high rate of reinforcement (and thus success) for appropriate social and academic behaviors; (2) a classroom arrangement designed to foster small group and individualized teaching; and, (3) some revision of the standard curriculum. This three-part program, usually referred to as the &quot;success technique,&quot; has been extensively tested  in 44 classrooms over the project's three years of operation. The results showed that during this time dramatic improvements in classroom management were consistently obtained. In addition, each successive year of the project's operation resulted in more substantial gains being made in achievement. Indeed, the very strong effects obtained in Year Three indicated that many of the problems associated with inner-city teaching have been eliminated or greatly reduced in project classrooms.

Those which are cited here come from a wide variety of sources: primarily from dictionaries, books of slang, and personal correspondence. Four cases are cited here: black as positive and black as negative, and white as positive and white as negative. The negative associations to black and the positive associations to white may have serious implications insofar as black and white are used as short-hand symbols to denote racial membership. A reasonable expectation, on the basis of generalization, would be that they would enter into judgements of people varying  in skin coloration (either one's own or that of others.) There may also be implications for individual personalities when the negative traits of a person became associated with black and the positive ones with white. Word maps are useful to the extent that they accurately reflect the territory represented. Unnecessary difficulties arise when symbols are not accurate insofar as important issues are concerned. Although symbolic functioning is of inestimable human value, psychologists and semanticists have rightly noted some limitations in the process. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The goal of this report is to introduce the kinds of data and the kinds of reports which are useful in the process of desegregating schools. In September of 1971, the San Francisco Unified School District desegregated its elementary schools. That it was able to open these schools in semi-normal fashion was due in large part to the services provided by the District's Data Processing Department. This report is intended to serve as a guidebook for Data Processing personnel in other school districts who may be faced with a similar situation. One fundamental change which is made necessary by school desegregation is the evaluation and development of new student assignments to schools based on the racial/ethnic distribution of students. The desegregation plan which had been developed  during the spring of 1971 and accepted by the Court in July organized the City into seven geographic areas or &quot;zones.&quot; School assignments are made by Census block. The close to 100 elementary schools which had been previously organized as kindergarten through grade six now were converted to &quot;primary&quot; (i.e., kindergarten to grade three) or &quot;intermediate&quot; (grades four to six.). This required the re-evaluation of school sites and their suitability for primary and intermediate grade levels. The advantage to changing grade level designation is that most children can be assigned to their local school for at least part of their elementary school years. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The physical, chemical, and physiological development of the brain and consequent behavior in all species of higher animals evolves from the continuous interaction of genetic and numerous environmental factors. Among the latter are nutritional, disease, psychological, learning, and cultural variables. Of these, nutrition is concerned directly with providing energy and nutrients needed for cellular structures and various metabolic systems. Indirectly, food may serve as a stimulus for behavior as well as providing a basis for social interaction. In most instances, the specific effects of sub-optimal nutrition on brain development in man are inseparable from those of other environmental factors. In some instances--such as when nutrients are imperfectly utilized owing to inborn  errors of metabolism, or when nutrients are lacking--malnutrition, per se, clearly alters the central nervous system by acutely or chronically limiting its metabolic, structural and functional capabilities and performance. In other circumstances, malnutrition, reflected in chronic limitation of amounts of food consumed, may result in general stunting of growth accompanied by reduced brain size, decreased brain cell number, and immature or incomplete biochemical organization of the brain.

Most of the articles are reworked presentations from two colloquia held in February 1972. A few of the articles describe new approaches used by Job Corps to address the health-related problems that can prevent disadvantaged young adults from achieving their self-defined goals. Others deal with common medical problems such as hepatitis, skin diseases, nutritional deficiencies, obesity, and sickle cell disease and traits. Yet others focus on sexuality,  venereal disease, and family planning. The last group of articles covers mental health and drugs--dealing with mental health emergencies, aggressive behavior, tobacco, drug addiction, and helping the drug-abusing enrollee in Job Corps. A list of materials produced by Job Corps health staff, including films, brochures, reports, and major publications available for distribution, concludes the monograph. (RJ)",

The discussions are concentrated on efforts for (1) community control of Schools; (2) decentralization of school administration; and, (3) existing and potential voucher systems for public schools. In relation to community control, an overview of the development of parent and community participation and control in public schools, a movement termed &quot;the emerging third force in education,&quot; is presented, and some existing examples of community controlled native American schools are analyzed. The decentralization program in the Los Angeles Unified School District is treated from contrasting  points of view, as are the numerous ways in which the citizens and educators of Detroit have dealt with that city's critical public education problems. The pros and cons of four major voucher systems are summarized, and the workings of the voucher plan in the Alum Rock Union School District is explained. The potential viability of vouchers for public schools is also considered.

        "description":"In empirically examining and developing a cultural diffusion model for the explanation of racial differences in mental ability scores, the major hypothesis of the model is that racial differences in mean IQ scores are a function, among other factors, of the degree and nature of contact a group has with the mainstream culture. The data were drawn from the cumulative school records of all the ninth graders who were in the Pittsburgh Public School System in the 1970-71 school year. The major part of the analysis involves the examination of the pattern of change in the IQ scores of the students who entered the system in the kindergarten and remained enrolled until the ninth grade. It was found that school and community segregation is related to an overall decrease in mean IQ scores  between grades K-8 for both blacks and whites. The IQ of students in lower social class school environments decreases over time while that of students in upper social class environments increases. Two major policy recommendations are suggested by these results and the overall approach. The first concerns the potential value of the use of information contained in school records for formulating and monitoring educational policy related to equality of educational opportunity. The second policy recommendation discusses the importance of school social class integration in the early grades. (Author/RJ)",

This program, he concludes, has not amounted to much more than an elaborate job-finding and applicant-screening program.

        "description":"Before the mid-1960's the Federal role in health care was extremely limited, but technological breakthroughs, the new importance of hospitals, and the recognition that the poor and elderly have been underserved prompted Congress to pass the Medicare and Medicaid package in 1966. Since then the Federal share of the health care dollar has risen by more than 60 percent. Soaring hospital costs resulted from disconnected and overlapping delivery systems and the tendency of the legislation to bias coverage toward inpatient care. The Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) bill provides a more balanced approach with a variety of services, outpatient care, and special facilities for a flat yearly fee. Since private health insurance is unprofitable, consideration is being given to a  national insurance program to provide effective coordination between organized modes of health care delivery. It would consist of two segments--the larger paid by workers and employers and the smaller subsidized by the government to aid the poor. A carefully considered plan must be pressed to completion and promptly considered in Congress. (MS)",

It therefore becomes increasingly necessary to consider life as a whole, rather than work and leisure separately. Freedom of choice as to the distribution of activities over the course of time is subject to constraints but they are not all inevitable. Trends are seen toward increasing  flexibility in respect to total working time, arrangement of working time within the work day or work period, development of part time work, and additional training after the end of fulltime schooling.

Nevertheless, it was possible to design, through a seminar program, a curriculum and appropriate experiences to equip the participants with the competencies needed for occupational education  in the area of environment.

An opinionnaire was developed to gather information on the respondent and his/her evaluation of the media. The data from the 66 o/o responding revealed that the design of the media was thought to be excellent and very helpful in improving self-concepts and related career education factors.

Many types of work which were done in vocational workshops in contract from industrial firms are now done by automation. Semiskilled labor is thus in diminished demand. There is a twenty year lag in the industrial image of vocational rehabilitation workshops. They do not reflect the vast technological changes or mirror the way people earn their living. Single workshops lack the resources and capabilities for coping with the situation. What is needed is a unified and coordinated effort to develop a model workshop of the future. A centralized computer and automated business service center could be used to train clients and perform supportive tasks  for other facilities. Other processes which could supplement work now being done include microfilming, small appliance repair, electronic circuitry assembly, medical equipment production, plastic extrusion and molding, and precision testing laboratories. Changes must be made so that the disabled may realize their full potential in a changing economic and social order. (MS)",

An Occupation Analysis Inventory (OAI) was generated containing 622 work elements (descriptions of activities and conditions). Ratings on the work elements were obtained by relevance to 103 defined human attributes (resulting in attribute-requirement weights). The OAI work elements were then correlated and subjected to factor analysis. Five test batteries and inventories measuring various abilities, interests, needs and satisfaction  were used to discover relationships between these variables and measurable behavioral potentials. Clusters of occupations were found to be discriminable and significant cross-validated multiple correlations between OAI factor scores and aptitude test scores were obtained. Other findings also indicate that a meaningful and potentially useful set of occupational descriptors has been developed and validated. (MS)",

The predictor variables were derived from the Occupation Analysis Inventory (OAI) and consisted of work-dimension scores describing occupations in terms of work activities and conditions, and attribute-requirement estimates characterizing occupation in terms of various human requirements. The worker variables were based on responses of job incumbents to selected interest, need, and satisfaction questionnaires. The results of various statistical analyses offered consistent support for the validity of the OAI descriptors.

Mailed questionnaire responses were received from 121 pairs of vocational directors and high school principals from the same school districts. It was found that the role of the vocational director was understood by both directors and principals, with both groups agreeing on 59 of 61 functions listed. Little association existed between the perceived role of the director and the local school district's line and staff relationships. The line and staff relationship of directors and administrators was not  clear as evidenced by more than half of the principals and directors disagreeing as to whom the director is responsible to. Directors in single school districts seemed to be more concerned with day-to-day operations while directors of multi-school districts showed more concern for overall planning and program development. The type of school district was also found to be associated with the preferred title of directors. (Included are a 26-item bibliography and the questionnaire and form letters used). (Author/SC)",

A search of the literature was conducted to determine the proper standards for probation caseload management and to identify problems associated with previous cost studies. In a comparison of physical and economic factors in Texas counties that have probation and those that do not, five relevant factors were determined: population, wages, taxable property, manufacturing value, and total income. The higher the statistics for any of the five factors, the more likely the county was to have probation. Different methods were used to determine the cost to the taxpayer for the operation of the prison system (direct  costs) and the costs to the State associated with loss of the breadwinner (indirect costs). Using the California system as a model with some modification, the Texas model determined that, with the State assisting the counties initially, the cost per man per day for probation was 5.22 less than for incarceration. Recommendations for establishing a probation system for adult felons were based on that determination. (Pertinent statistical tables are included in the appendixes.) (AG)",

They were followed from the beginning of 10th grade (1966) to one year after high school (1970). The most important determinants of unemployment among young men recently out of high school are family background and intelligence. High unemployment is associated with two groups: those with low intelligence who come from low status families and those with very high intelligence who come from high status families. For full-time workers in entry jobs: (1) the status of their job is determined by background, intelligence, and the availability of high status jobs in the area of employment; (2) wages are a function of the prevailing wage rate for unskilled workers. Full-time  workers display a high level of job satisfaction. Variation is associated with job expectations prior to entry and with both monetary and non-monetary job benefits. Type of job (Census classification), satisfaction, and descriptions of job characteristics are all intercorrelated. There is a 12-page glossary. (Author)",

        "description":"Career education is gaining acceptance as a way of making education more relevant and more human. There are five levels to the approach: Grades K-6 deals with career awareness; 7-9 provides occupational information and career exploration; 10-14 is concerned with job placement and specialized career education; the post-secondary level involves specific occupational preparation; and adult and continuing education covers the total spectrum. Since career education is an evolving concept, the levels are not distinct. The four models of career education (school-based, employer-based, home-based, and rural-residential) have implications for the role of counselor and the scope of responsibility of occupational guidance. The existence of varying opinions among nationally influential  groups and individuals concerning career guidance, counseling, and placement emphasizes the need for specifying objectives appropriate to a comprehensive and integrated developmental program in these areas. These might include identification of career development needs of students at all levels, programs for all levels, coordinated activities, placement programs, outreach functions, and job adjustment counseling.

The Educational Amendments of 1972, in providing the Emergency School Assistance Act, the National Institute of Education, and broader financial support, met these goals to a certain extent. It is very important that cooperative planning and action be achieved by the agencies, services, and organizations involved in life long education. The Allied Services Act and the Talmadge Amendment are examples of the Government's response to educational needs. Progress has been made toward several Adult Education goals but other goals need to be considered.

There has been legislative response to the nation's commitment to vocational-technical education. The financial returns of the career-oriented education are impressive in that it more than pays for itself, yet an inequity persists in the distribution of education dollars between college allocations and allocations to vocational education. The image of vocational education needs to be improved while career education is stressed. There are five levels of curriculum organization which can be effective in conveying the career education concept: K-6, 7-9, 10-14, post-secondary, and adult and continuing education.  To make career education a reality, it is necessary to consider all education as both academic and vocational, also cooperative programs must be improved, work experience must be available, job placement must be stressed, and programs must be updated. With better trained teachers and effective guidance and counseling, the challenge can be met. (AG)",

A need for interdisciplinary integration is expressed together with brief examinations of such attempts. There is a pattern revealed in the literature relating academic and vocational education: first there is a merging of courses within vocational service areas, then an integration of the vocational fields themselves, and finally, an integration of vocational and academic education programs through interdisciplinary programs. Selected program descriptions, research reports, and curriculum guides and manuals identify approaches used. The most promising is the Comprehensive Career  Education Model. Together with the four U.S. Office of Education models (school-based, employer-based, home/community-based, and residential-based) a significant social movement is formed. The literature cites numerous examples of programs in various areas using those models. In the future, the process approach will replace old approaches to education.

Analysis of the data revealed that two measures of parental influence (student perceptions of parents' interests in students' school work and parents' hopes that the student will attend college) did serve as mediators, while two other measures (active pressure and parental involvement) did not. It was also learned that work values did not operate as an intervening variable in the relationship between social origin and aspirations. The basic path for boys  through which parental background was related to career aspirations, according to the study is: Parental Background--Parents' Interest--Parents' Hopes for College--Student's Own College Plans--Student's Planned Occupation. The path for girls was quite different. Girls perceive less parental support for their educational activities than do boys and they are more independent of their parents' socioeconomic background. An analysis of the students' work values are revealed differences which the authors comment upon. Statistical tables are included. (AG)",

It points out what numbers of manager needs to know and distinguishes between data and information. Data must be organized to enable comparisons to be made and relationships identified. Conceptual problems in collecting and interpreting cost and output data are discussed. Much of the information does not require a formal application of statistical procedures, and while the remarks are directed toward government managers, they have wider application. Attention is given to defining analysis, who performs analysis and why, techniques of analysis, cost analysis, data analysis, and establishing a data base. The concluding section  provides three case histories exemplifying uses of analysis. (Charts, graphs, and tables are used to illustrate concepts.) (AG)",

Thirty-six participating secondary schools and community colleges in Massachusetts and New York generated over ten thousand raw objectives--RAWOBs--during the 1970-72 project. These were consolidated into 724 synthesized objectives--SYNOBs--designed to provide a means by which schools could select objectives on which their students would be tested and by which the schools and teachers could follow their own preferences in the processes of instruction. Next, a bank of test items was constructed reflecting the  common objectives across schools and the individual variations within schools. The results of the tests make possible the continuous evaluation of the effectiveness of methods and goals of teaching in a classroom, school, local system, or State. In the final report, descriptive and explanatory material is interspersed with the documents used in the project. A glossary and bibliography are appended. (MS)",

        "description":"At the Utah State Prison philosophy and purpose have changed from incarceration and punishment to education and rehabilitation. Where funds and personnel are available, inmates have opportunity for therapy, counseling, schooling, vocational training, and work release employment. Twenty-two rehabilitation factors have been identified and described. Leading the list in importance to both prison staff and inmates are Secondary Education, Vocational Training, Elementary and Basic Education, and On-the-job Training. Analysis of opinions of 170 persons at the prison, 68 staff members (32 percent of all staff members) and 102 inmates (sixteen percent of all inmates), reveals a more than incidental positive agreement on rehabilitation factors. However, staff gave counseling and therapy a  high place while inmates placed education and training first; this disparity came from the practical problem of lack of staff to provide adequate participation in these activities. The public speaking program had strong endorsement from those who participated in it and from the prison staff. In 1967-68 twelve and half percent of the inmate population enrolled in education classes and fourteen percent in vocational or on-the-job training. (Author/MS)",

The population consisted of 668 inmates who participated in vocational training between 1958 and 1968. All participants for whom addresses were available were either personally contacted or mailed a questionnaire. Special interviews were obtained from prison personnel, and direct observation was made of selected programs. It is concluded that those prisoners who have participated in rehabilitation programs at Utah State Prison have been favorably affected by them in their adjustment to society upon release. However, additional and expanded programs are necessary. Also, a  greater amount of the prisoner population must be involved in the vocational and rehabilitation programs.

Basic changes suggested in the organizational and administrative structure of local education agencies focus on the following requirements: (1) a director of school-community relations, (2) a general advisory committee to work with him, (3) designated school in each geographic school district for developing community involvement, (4) district advisory committees, and (5) organized activities that will modernize school-community relationships. These activities include a series of partnerships between specific employers and people in education, allowing for short-term commitment where necessary in order to  involve as broad a base as possible of community and school personnel. Community resource workshops for participants are recommended to provide participants a forum for learning, interchange of ideas, and development of cooperative programs. The name and address of the executive secretary of the National Community Resource Workshop Association is given for readers who want detailed information on organizing and conducting such a workshop. Training seminars for volunteers in the school programs are discussed and recommended. (Author/VT)",

The estimates were to be given both according to conventional conditions of magnitude estimations with a preassigned comparison standard and according to a modified procedure of magnitude estimation where the comparison standard was chosen individually by the subjects themselves. The test itself was administered to the subjects under standard conditions prior to the estimation procedures. When comparing the two methods of estimation used, a high correlation between estimates and a close correspondence of the modified method of magnitude estimation to the methods of ratio estimation and similarity estimation was noticed. A high correlation (r=0.90) between the  rank order of items according to perceived difficulty and the item sequence was found. Furthermore, estimated difficulty could tentatively be described as a positively accelerated function of standard scores corresponding to solution frequencies. The relative increase of perceived difficulty was more pronounced for subjects with a high performance score on the test than for subjects with a poor performance score. Probable causes of the results obtained as well as possible secondary factors affecting the estimates of perceived difficulty are discussed. (Author)",

Search time was measured as performance criterion. Perceived difficulty of the task was measured by the method of magnitude estimation, one of the matrices serving as standard. The results showed perceived difficulty to be a negatively accelerated function of both stimulus and response variables involved. It appears probable that the estimates of difficulty were contaminated by the structure and size of the visual field, particularly by the estimation of numerousness.

A high correlation between the rank order of items according to estimated difficulty and the real item sequence was obtained in all three tests used. A linear relationship was found between estimated difficulty and standard scores corresponding to solution frequencies. A close correspondence was noticed between the widths and the levels of the ranges of the estimates on  the one hand and the corresponding widths and levels of the standard score ranges on the other hand.

The Ss were asked to recall them in the original order, and then to estimate the difficulty of the task by means of the method of magnitude estimation. Messages were presented in pairs of different lengths, the first message in each pair serving as standard for estimating the difficulty of the other message. All pairs were presented twice. In Experiment 1, perceived difficulty was found to be an exponential function of message length. Ss with a higher immediate memory span gave lower estimates for the longest  messages than Ss with a lower span. In Experiment 2, the relation between perceived difficulty and message length appeared to be linear. It is argued that with shorter messages, estimates of difficulty were probably affected by the stimulus variable, while with longer messages the response variable (recall) might have been decisive for the perception of difficulty.

For this purpose, the psychophysical method of magnitude estimation was used. Time was measured as a criterion of performance. The sevenfold repetition of the task resulted in a drop of performance time from 61 seconds to 35 seconds, i.e., by about 43%, while the perceived difficulty decreased from the initial value of 10 to 5.2, i.e., by 48%. The course of both functions was fairly similar; the correlation coefficient of 0.96 showed a close relationship between perceived difficulty and time.

When removing the effects of similarity with regard to perceived difficulty on the correlation between  intertest correlation and estimated qualitative similarity (r=0.79), a partial coefficient of correlation of 0.74 was yielded, indicating that perceived difficulty accounts for only 12 percent of the association of 0.79 present.

        "description":"Nine studies are summarized which investigated the relation between attributes of performance as perceived by the subject and corresponding objective measurements. The attributes studied were: (1) intellectual activity perceived to be involved when dealing with a task (Studies 1 and 2), and (2) perceived difficulty (Studies 4 to 9). Study 3 combined both features. In Study 1, subjects with 9 years of schooling were asked to estimate the degree of qualitative similarity between sample items of 10 tests. Study 2 was basically a replication of Study 1 with high school students in another country. Study 3 investigated the extent to which the perceived difficulty of intelligence tests would covary with the estimates of qualitative similarity. Results on perceived difficulty were  summarized in Study 4. In Study 5, involving a simple motor skill task called &quot;wire labyrinth,&quot; perceived difficulty was found to be linearly related to performance, with time the only possible objective measurement. Study 6 involved the perceived difficulty of an immediate memory task in which successive messages of 4 to 10 digits were presented acoustically at two digits per second. Ss were to recall them immediately in their original order. Study 7 dealt with the perceived difficulty of a search activity in a visual attention task involving 7 complex stimulus matrices consisting of pairs of consonants. Studies 8 and 9 investigated the perceived difficulty of individual items in 4 tests of intellectual performance. (For related documents, see TM 003 055-061.) (KM)",

From other research concerning the factors in and effects of teacher expectancy, it appears that elementary school children make accurate perceptions of subtle affective and cognitive behaviors of teachers and peers. Furthermore, it seems reasonable that pupils can perceive differential expectations of the teacher and that these perceptions may be a vital link in whatever communication system may be involved in the self-fulfilling prophecy process. This study utilized all students in 24 classrooms, grades 1-6, who were administered achievement and learning potential tests at the beginning of the school year. After teachers ranked  their students according to how much achievement growth they expected from them, experimental pairs were selected and members of the pairs were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. A questionnaire to discern pupils' perceptions of teachers' differential expectations and treatment of students was also administered. Teachers were told that test scores indicated that certain students should advance much more rapidly than the teachers had anticipated. Observations were made in each classroom. No significant effects of experimental manipulation of teacher expectations were found. It was concluded, therefore, that the Rosenthal findings are spurious. (For related document, see TM 003 083.)

        "description":"The growth of spatial awareness and representation was studied in children between ages five and nine. A group of thirteen tasks was administered to subjects three times with periods of approximately six months among sessions. The tasks were selected to measure understanding of projective spatial properties (straight line trajectories, perspective, and the coordination of perspectives), Euclidean properties (length, angle and area), topological properties (proximity, enclosure, order, etc.), and the coordinates of space. In general, projective spatial awareness developed from an ability to produce simple straight line trajectories, to a recognition of perspective properties in pictures and scenes, to an understanding of how to construct projective lines and to coordinate  perspectives. Only by 4th grade were more than a few subjects capable of coordinating perspectives. Comprehension of the vertical coordinate of space, as well as ability to organize straight lines along the vertical axis, appeared at a younger age than a comparable understanding of the horizontal axis. Oblique projections of various kinds were consistently the most difficult, and lagged behind acquisitions for the vertical and horizontal coordinates of space. Awareness of topological properties was found among the youngest children, but here too a progression from simpler to more complex achievements was found with age. (Author/KM)",

The influences on reliability and accuracy of the nature of the rating scale (that is, the number and the specificity of scale points), the extent of clinical experience of the rater, and the training of raters were investigated. Subjects included 30 instructors, 36 junior dental students, and 16 dental assistants from the University of Pittsburgh. In addition, five expert raters were used. The subject groups (instructors, students, assistants) were subdivided into three groups so that three different rating scales could be used. The scales were: a 2-point scale with two specified points, a 5-point scale with end points specified, and a 5-point scale with all  points defined. At each of three sessions, subjects evaluated eight criteria of operative dentistry performance in five specimens, each containing one extracted mandibular second bicuspid. All scores were analyzed for between-judge and within-judge reliability, and for accuracy, that is, agreement with an expert score. Individual criterion scores as well as total test scores were used for the analysis. At one dental school instructors were able to reliably evaluate overall performance in operative dentistry. However, instructors were not able to assess specific criteria of performance accurately. Junior dental students performed similar to instructors, whereas dental assistants were able to be trained to rate overall performance fairly accurately. Practice with use of scale with immediate  feedback did not result in high reliability and accuracy. (Author/DB)",

From a group of 532 Chicago area high school juniors, a group who scored high on the Differential Aptitude Test and a group that scored low were selected. They were given nine problems to solve; they chose questions from a list until they felt they had enough information to solve each problem. A number of scoring methods were applied to the problems to determine the differences that existed between the two groups in relation to this type of test. The score for the number of problems right for each subject was higher for the upper group than the corresponding score for the lower group. Fewer worthless questions were asked  by the upper group, and the mean number of questions asked for each problem was less for the upper group.

Specifically, the study is directed toward the identification of tests and other instruments that can serve as markers for well established factors. It is the noncognitive area of the study to which the present report is addressed. There is sufficient concensus on many of the temperament factors to make a review and interpretation of recent factor analyses leading to such factors worthwhile. Separately presented in this report are 28 factors that can be called \"established,\" in that they have been found at least three times in reports emanating from at least  two different laboratories. It suggests and describes one to five subscales that might be used as marker variables. This literature review takes the form of a discussion of the various analyses in which the factor seems to have appeared and the extent to which the listed subscales measure it. The subscales of items, which this project will ultimately recommend as factor markers, will depend on the results of our own tryouts of the item categories listed in this report coupled with the findings reported in the literature.

        "description":"The aim of this investigation was to develop a justifiable and efficient procedure for locating the top two percent of the eighth grade students in an inner-city junior high school. The WISC performance IQ was chosen as the criterion measure. Four screening measures were used to select students for the WISC: an achievement test (the California Achievement Test 1970 reading and mathematics), a conventional IQ test (the California Test of Mental Maturity short form 1963), a &quot;culture fair&quot; test (Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices) and teacher nominations. Students scoring in the top two percent of the sample on one or more of these measures took the Advanced Progressive Matrices and the WISC. The top nine students on the WISC performance scale were designated mentally gifted.  Since four of the nine gifted students were not nominated by any teacher, the use of teacher nominations is not recommended except as a supplement to objective tests. A procedure involving the use of the SPM followed by the APM is recommended for selecting students for the WISC. This procedure would have identified eight of the nine gifted students in this study, and would have required the administration of only 14 WISCs. (Author)",

Task One, Learning to Discriminate Accurate Empathy, is described from five levels (low and high) of accurate empathy. The second task, also comprised of five low and high levels, is illustrated by examples of rejection of the student and of acceptance and caring for the student. Task Three, Learning to Discriminate Genuineness, with four low or high levels of responses by the teacher, illustrates congruence or its lack. In Task Four, Coding Your  Own Video Tape, the teacher is asked to code a video tape made in his own classroom, using the four tasks and his responses. A sample of a form for caluclating the response profile are provided. Task Five provides instructions to aid the teacher in interpreting his response. In Task Six, suggestions are given as to how the teacher can ascertain whether the program for the teacher has resulted in the students development of a positive attitude toward learning.

At the core of the problem has been the IQ testing of Spanish-speaking children. There is a need of paramount importance to modify the use of present IQ instruments and to develop new specialized instruments that utilize the language and cultural background of Spanish-speaking children to facilitate the assessment of their academic abilities. As in the case of IQ testing, on the standardized achievement tests, a  verbal factor appeared to militate against the optimal performance of Spanish-speaking children. Those subtests most dependent on English language skills generally resulted in poorest performance, indicating a handicap in language ability rather than in learning ability. (DB)",

The total program is designed to provide specific information about knowledge, skills, understandings, and attitudes in 10 subject areas. The first phase investigated the areas of Citizenship and Writing, using a state-wide probability sample of Maine's 17-year-old student population and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) model. This report discusses sampling considerations, exercise package development, administration and scoring, data analysis plan, descriptive analyses, comparisons with National assessment, and within Maine analyses.  The overall Citizenship results showed that there was a tendency for the Maine students to surpass national performance on concern for the well-being of others and respect for their rights as individuals. With respect to the Writing results, it is concluded that more emphasis on scholastic writing opportunities is needed to align Maine student performance with that of the Northeast region and the nation.

The centers' programs emphasize the joint participation of various institutions and agencies in the training of teachers. The evaluation concentrated on the programs' chief objectives, which were: (1) identification and recruitment of qualified public school teachers to serve in various roles as school-based teacher educators; (2) selection of appropriate clinical experiences to provide the student with background information and skill to develop competence as a teacher; (3) provision of inservice education for all personnel involved in the teacher-education process; (4) identification and creation of new and expanded range of sites of clinical experience, in particular those other than  public schools; (5) fostering experimentation and change in teacher education programs; (6) to harmonize diverse interests and open channels of communication; and (7) to organize so that a reasonable balance is maintained within the domains of each of the agencies in relation to policy making. A Likert-type scale and a checklist comprised the evaluation instrument, which was administered to 173 student teachers, cooperating teachers, principals, county supervisors, college/university coordinators, and center coordinators. The study data are presented in relation to the seven objectives. In general, the results showed that the teacher education centers are effective in providing inservice education, influencing program development, maintaining a flexible clinical experience program,  encouraging innovation, and creating mutual respect.

The focus of the study was on student behavior rather than on school programs. Nineteen scales from the Student Information System were used in the study. These scales assessed: Cognitive Skills, Learning Habits, Psychomotor Creativity, Personal Adjustment, Social Admustment, Maturity, Flexibility, Reality, Athletic Ability, Positive Learning Attitude, Positive School Attitude, Positive Community Attitude, Positive Attitude Toward  Others, Positive Attitude Toward Self as a Learner, Positive Self-Attitude, Self-Confidence, Healthy Aspirations, Optimistic Attitude, and Leadership.

An empirical development of a revised form was completed through two formative evaluation cycles. The revision was then subjected to a field test. Utilizing the revised form, field readers evaluated proposals which had previously been submitted to the Regional Research Program. As a control measure, previous evaluations were available. Comparisons with the existing form indicated that the revision provided greater objectivity and more comprehensive and specific coverage of proposal components. The mean number of comments and ratings per proposal obtained from four reviewers was 195 using the revision as  compared to 48 via the old form. The revision provided equal inter-rater reliability. Decisions tended to be more critical, and favorable recommendations were more likely to impose conditions upon the proposed project. The revision provided more adequate bases for ranking proposals, including several alternative scales for ranking. A panel review judged the input from the revision to be a more useful evaluation for both decision makers and applicants. (Author/DB)",

The four questions were: (1) Has there been a change in average fourth-grade achievement in Title I schools since 1965-1966?; (2) Has the difference between the mean reading achievement of fourth-grade children in Title I schools and the mean reading achievement of fourth-grade children in non-Title I schools changed since 1965-1966?; (3) Have the distributions of fourth-grade achievement in Title I schools been similar at the lower, middle, and upper quartiles for 1965-1966 and 1968-1969 school years?; and (4) What is the relationship between the 1965-1966 to 1968-1969 difference in achievement in Title I schools and the  1965-1966 to 1968-1969 differences in selected school related variables? The fourth-grade subjects in the study included 4,508 from 65 title schools during 1966, 5,067 from 86 non-title schools during 1966, 4,723 from 66 title schools in 1969, and 5,343 from 88 non-title schools in 1969. The results of reading subtests of The Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and the Stanford Achievement Test were compared. From the evaluation results, it was concluded that; (1) reading achievement in schools with large numbers of children from low-income families was approximately one year behind grade level; (2) reading achievement in large city schools is lower today than in 1965-66; (3) the factor related to achievement in schools with high concentrations of children from  low income families is attendance; and (4) achievement decreased to the same amount in Title I and non-Title I schools.

These goals were operationalized through the establishment of 12 programs: Family Centers; Expanded Kindergarten; Individualized Reading Instruction; Staff Development; School-Community  Advisory Committees; Advisory Boards; Summer Enrichment Exchange Program; Guidance Center; Articulation Counselor; Child Welfare and Attendance; Curriculum Development; and, Mini Grants. The report format for each of these components contains the elements: component description, objectives, and statistical results. The stated objectives are those which incorporate the more specific objectives for each year of the project.

The Program served approximately 1700 students, attending school in an ungraded organization pattern (ordinarily grades 1-6). In the &quot;Triad&quot; of schools served, McCarver school was de facto segregated in 1969, while Jefferson and Wainwright schools had minority populations of less than 1.5 percent. Academic achievement was measured through the yearly use of achievement tests at levels 2, 3, 5,  and 6. Teacher perceptions of pupil progress were measured by an examination of marks on fall and spring reports. A criterion-referenced mathematics test was used at Jefferson in levels 4, 5, and 6. Evaluation findings indicate that McCarver School is no longer de facto segregated. Minority populations at Jefferson and Wainwright are now approximately 15 percent. Due to the complexity of the program, it was not found possible to make conclusive general statements about achievement. (Author/RJ)",

        "description":"The objective of this paper was to examine what effect government subsidized day care by itself might have on the labor force participation of low income group mothers. The policy issue was as follows: will the provision of adequate day care services (in terms of cost and quality) to low income group mothers substantially increase their labor force participation (by removing a significant barrier to employment), thereby reducing their potential for the receipt of income transfer programs? Responding to this issue, the paper reviews existing research on the relationship of provision of day care services to labor force participation. The paper concludes that provision of day care by itself will not lead to vast numbers of low income mothers entering the labor force; an estimated  ten percentage point increase in labor force participation might occur in response to day care. The reasons for this percentage point increase being not larger are cited as: (1) many mothers prefer to care for their own children; (2) many mothers do not see the provision of subsidized day care as substantially increasing their net wage; (3) the structure of welfare laws makes employment, in some cases, economically unsound; and, (4) employment increases the already heavy burdens of the mother.

        "description":"The study described here is an attempt to answer the question: does the classroom ratio of non-white to white pupils influence the quality of the behavior of the participants in integrated classrooms? And, if so, is there an optimum ratio of classroom racial composition? To carry out such an investigation, an instrument designed to provide a quantified criterion of school district quality, \"Indicators of Quality,\" was used. It is based upon forty key concepts of classroom behavior categorized under four headings: individualization, interpersonal regard, group activity, and creativity. The study used data from over 18,000 observations taken from 164 of the 224 districts that have employed this instrument--60 districts having no classrooms containing non-white pupils. The major  finding of the study was that the percentage of non-white pupil classroom composition does have influence on classroom behavior. If the concept of racial balance is to include the criterion of the quality of classroom behavior, then the findings of this study are held to strongly suggest that two factors should be considered: the percentage of non-white pupil classroom composition, and the proportion of non-white pupils in the school. The most desirable racial balance with respect to the criterion of quality classroom behavior was found to be in classrooms of 21-40 and 41-60 percent non-white pupil composition. (Author/RJ)",

        "description":"This publication of advance data from the March 1973 Current Population Survey relates to consumer income: characteristics of the low-income population, 1972. About 24.5 million were below the low-income level in 1972, this figure being 1.1 million or 4.3 percent below the 1971 figure. The number of low-income whites declined by about 9 percent in 1972, while there is some evidence of a small increase in the number of low-income blacks. Over the same period, low-income persons 65 years and over declined by about 12 percent, while for persons under this age, the number did not change significantly. The sex of the family head continues to be an important factor--families headed by women have become a greater proportion of all low-income families. Significant differences in age  composition of the white and Negro low-income groups are found. Children under 18 years in 1972 accounted for about 36 percent of all whites below low-income level as compared to 52 percent for Negroes. On the average, 1972 incomes of low-income families headed by men were closer to being raised above the poverty line than were the incomes of families headed by women. (Author/RJ)",

        "description":"This report attempts to answer the questions: do social services help welfare recipients achieve self-support or reduced dependency? can this goal be realistically achieved given the present nature of services, the method of finding out who should receive certain services, and economic constraints? The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducting this review classified social services as either developmental or maintenance. GAO based its findings and conclusions on analysis of two randomly sampled AFDC (aid to families with dependent children) caseloads in Baltimore (Md.); Denver (Colo.); Jefferson County, Louisville (Ky.); Orleans Parish, New Orleans (La.); and Oakland (Calif.). One sample in each city included 150 cases receiving AFDC at August 1, 1971 and at July 31, 1972. The  other sample in each city included 150 cases whose AFDC grants were discontinued between August 1, 1971 and July 31, 1972. The findings and conclusions arrived at by GAO was that: (1) social services had only minor impact on directly helping recipients to develop and use the skills necessary to achieve reduced dependency or self-support; (2) it is unrealistic to expect that social services can play a major role in helping recipients achieve reduced dependency or self-support given the present operating circumstances; and, (3) over the long run, social service benefits are necessary if recipients are to benefit ultimately from developmental services.

Surveys that employed them tended to have larger samples, larger proportions of low-income respondents in the sample, and shorter and less complex interviews. In reply to the questionnaire reported in this study, about half of the 194 surveys of the poor conducted in 1967-71 employed such interviewers (\"indigenous interviewers\"). For most of the 12 interviewing tasks queried, ratings of interviewer performance were lower for indigenous interviewers than for interviewers matched only on race or on neither race nor class. They were rated about as well as others  on establishing rapport, contacting respondents, and locating the hard to reach. More intensive training and supervision of interviewers did not appear to affect assessments of performance. Directors of one-fourth of the surveys reported that they would definitely want to employ interviewers similar to respondents in SES in future surveys of the poor. Adherents of SES matching tended to be those who had employed them on the present study, and who further had actively recruited them, had employed a higher proportion of them and, to a lesser extent, were more satisfied with their performance.

Factor analysis with oblique rotation yielded three main factors, identified as fluid intelligence, crystalized intelligence, and a memory factor. Mean factor scores for the three ethnic groups differed significantly. The white and black groups differed markedly in fluid and crystalized intelligence but not in memory; the white and Mexican American groups differed markedly in fluid, but much less in crystalized intelligence and memory. The black and Mexican American  groups differed the most in fluid but only slightly in crystalized intelligence. There were also systematic ethnic group differences in the pattern of intercorrelations among factor scores, and in the correlations of the factor scores with an index of SES. The results are discussed in relation to Jensen's two-level theory of mental abilities and Cattell's theory of fluid and crystalized intelligence. (Author)",

Levels I and II are hypothesized to interact with SES and/or race such that: (l) SES differences are greater for level II than for I, and (2) the correlation between levels I and II, and the regression of level I upon II, are greater in upper than in lower SES populations. These hypotheses are borne out by digit span memory measures and Lorge-Thorndike Verbal and Nonverbal Intelligence Tests, obtained on all the white and black pupils in grades 4-6 in a California school district. Analyses were performed on raw scores, and orthogonal and oblique factor scores. The largest  effects in accord with the hypotheses are attributable to differences between the white population (all SES levels) and the low SES black group. One aspect of the two-level theory as originally formulated must be revised in light of the present evidence--i.e. the hypothesis of hierarchical functional dependence of level II performance on level I ability. There appears only to be slight degree of such dependence of level II on level I, and more for Nonverbal than for Verbal intelligence test scores. (Author)",

The general objectives of the program were: (1) to raise the level of achievement of pupils who are  deficient in the basic skills of language and reading; (2) to improve the self-image of the pupils through approval for any achievement and to provide an atmosphere of mutual self-respect; (3) to investigate techniques and materials which will assist teachers in more effective teaching of reading; (4) to create materials and operate a model demonstration center for the teachers of Hartford; (5) to provide a flexible environment that promotes individualized instruction geared to the learning styles of each pupil; and, (6) to promote an interest on the part of parents in the importance of school-home relationships.

        "description":"Drastic change is taking place in America today. If drastic change does indeed foster revolution then our challenge is to help bring about peaceful revolution by making those changes that give power to the powerless. Both the majority and the minority groups are presented with the challenge of developing strategies and techniques for implementing these strategies which will impart the educational, technical, social and political skills which will enable the weak to get bread, human dignity, freedom and strength by their own efforts. The American political system will yield only to imcremental changes. These can however be consistent--depending upon the ability of groups and factions to mobilize large numbers of people. A strategy for productive sociopolitical behavior could  utilize David Easton's model of a political system which emphasizes environmental influences on political activity. Along with changes in the sociopolitical arena are concomitant changes in other institutions such as the school. Educational innovation and sociopolitical innovation have been riding anunprecedented wave of concern. The bureaucratic structure of the school system and the political system is speaking and cracking at the joint. What is needed by those of us responsible for providing leadership in the school is a management strategy for producing change. Organizational development is an emerging management strategy which is action research oriented. It is a process which can be used to attack any problem in the schools.

In support of this statement we see it pointed out that a child or a group of children show some response to training, and this is held up as evidence against the heritability of intelligence or learning ability. Most estimates of the heritability of IQ in the European and North American populations on which we have good data fall in the range from 0.60 to 0.90 and most of these estimates are in range from 0.70 to 0.80 (not corrected for test unreliability. The fact that IQ has high heritability surely does not mean that individuals cannot learn much. But knowing that learning ability has heritability does tell us this: if a number of individuals are all given equal  opportunity--the same background, the same conditions, and the same amount of time--for learning something, they will still differ from one another in their rates of learning and consequently in the amount they learn per unit of time spent in learning. The fact that scholastic achievement shows lower heritability than IQ means that more of the variance in scholastic achievement is attributable to nongenetic factors than is the case for IQ. Consequently, we hypothesize what the sources of the environmental variance in scholasticachievement are, and , possibly we can manipulate them. (Author/JM)",

Differing mainly in regard to time-frame and comprehensiveness of scope, career education and adult education hinge heavily upon each other for their ultimate success. Career education considers the total economic progress and decision-making processes of the individual, while adult education concerns itself with the individual's access to, entry into, exit from, and reentry into educational experiences that will facilitate any  identified need of the individual. Adult education coordinators can do much to strengthen the existing bond between the two programs. Some of the things which can be done are: (1) Provide programs to fit the students rather than admit only those who meet prerequisites of the particular programs, (2) Plan more extensively and cooperatively with administrators, teachers, and students for postsecondary programs or \"next step\" level educational needs, and (3) Give more emphasis to data collection, goal clarification, and evaluation activities.

Guidance services include: (1) child study, (2) counseling, (3) orientation to the worlds of work and education, (4) coordination of home and community contacts, (5) identification of children with special needs and talents, and (6) coordination of various special services. Emphasis in this paper is given to guidance as a staff-wide concern  in elementary schools and to the belief that a guidance program is most likely to come about if there is a professional counselor on the staff.

This review of literature and research relating to performance objectives has revealed that a number of articles, instructional guides, conferences, and workshops have dealt with developing skills in writing performance objectives for vocational education. A limited number of research studies deal with writing and using performance objectives and the effects of the writing and using of objectives on teachers' attitudes. None of the studies have concentrated on performance objectives  alone. Future research should concentrate directly on performance objectives, with all other variables, such as teaching methods or instructional materials, controlled in the research design. Some suggested research areas include: (1) identifying strategies for incorporating the affective domain into the format of vocational education performance objectives, (2) identifying processes for integrating occupational analysis data directly into performance objectives and teaching strategies, and (3) creating and testing performance objective evaluation instruments appropriate for vocational education.

        "description":"This exploratory study, primarily an information collection and analysis effort, was made to determine whether there is a difference in the effectiveness and the cost of cooperative vocational education programs and of vocational programs without a cooperative component. Study data from 12 school districts in three States (Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio) for the 1969-70 and 1970-71 school years were used to explore the feasibility of conducting such a cost-effectiveness analysis. It was found that it is possible to analyze historical cost and effectiveness data on selected vocational education programs but that it is not possible to directly compare cooperative programs to those without a cooperative component, as it is unlikely that similar programs are offered using both  methods. However, cost-effectiveness analyses may be used as one element in policy formulation concerning vocational education methodologies. Detailed information collected and interpreted in the study are provided, leading to the overall conclusion that there is no obvious difference in the cost of providing either type of program nor are there any obvious differences between graduates of the two types of programs. A very limited employer survey indicated that employers tend to favor graduates of the cooperative programs. Recommendations for further in-depth studies are presented. (MF)",

To meet the challenge of relevance and utility, the role of formal vocational training has enjoyed increasing attention within the educational system in the past decade. Yet even with this, half of our nation's students are not being prepared for further education, for training, or for employment. A major revision in the educational delivery system is needed. In Rhode Island this is being approached at two levels, the preschool through Grade 12 level and the postsecondary and adult continuing education level. A task force has been created to study the postsecondary programs and services and to make recommendations for the development of an open university system.  At the preschool through Grade 12 level, a program is being launched to develop the career education concept as the central theme of elementary and secondary education. The purpose of this State project is to test the theory that a career-oriented program is superior to the traditional orientation and to determine which components or techniques are most effective. Included in this accession are two additional papers, one outlining the development and evaluation components of the State career education project and the other further discussing this project under the title &quot;Career Decision Making as the Focus of a K-12 Curriculum&quot;.

Data during the first five years of the VDS study have been gathered from several sources and at many different points of time from a sample of ninth grade students enrolled in three medium sized Pennsylvania school districts. To date eight monographs have been published by the VDS project. The first monograph describes the study as it was envisioned several years after its actual start, while  the remaining seven reports deal with specific investigations of the vocational development process. This paper provides an overview of the VDS project and summarizes selected findings and implications from the monographs. (SB)",

To achieve the project objectives, instructors of technical-occupational and related courses were invited to submit proposals specifying the rationale for selection of the course, the ends to be achieved by participation in the project, and the process for achieving  these ends. Proposals receiving a priority rating of &quot;one&quot; were funded, and the instructors of the approved proposals then attended a 2-day workshop in late spring 1972 designed to assist with the formulation of objectives and instructional units. Following the workshop, the instructors developed behavioral objectives and instructional units for their courses, which were field tested in the 1972-73 school year. A follow-up survey of 37 instructors revealed that the project enabled them to use commercially produced materials more judiciously and facilitated team teaching within and across division lines.

The approach fused aspects of vocational education, guidance, and a broad-based curriculum into a systematic and sequential effort within the elementary, middle, and secondary schools. Such an effort was designed to facilitate a comprehensive education for all students by including development of work skills and attitudes suited to an area of rapid growth in population, industry, and technology. The project by design and by nature placed special emphasis on students who were culturally, economically, or otherwise handicapped or disadvantaged. Programs at all levels, guidance programs, and job placement services are detailed in the report.  Based on three years' continuous in-house evaluation and on an outside evaluating, it was concluded that career education is an operational effort in Cobb County, Georgia and that the activity-centered approach has gained widespread acceptance from students, teachers, administrators, and parents. The project staff concluded that career education promotes a community-wide feeling that education is the joint responsibility of the home, the school, and the community.

The program involves 23 percent of the students in the Ohio high schools. In the 1972-73 academic year 113,041 students were enrolled. This publication is intended to provide answers relating to the cost effectiveness of the program. Interviews with 1022 persons (employers and the young adults whom they employ) provided the data from which conclusions were drawn. The study itself makes no statement as to whether the use of any particular curriculum caused the young adults in the sample to have the attitudes and outlooks that they have. The findings of this opinion survey  indicate however that there are differences today between young adults who are graduates of approved vocational education programs and graduates of other curriculums, and that these differences are largely in the direction of making vocational graduates better employees, both in their own self concept and in the eyes of their employers.

To obtain information on the area's educational and manpower needs, surveys were conducted of residents, businesses, educators, and former  vocational students. As a result of the total study, a comprehensive career education program from kindergarten through Grade 14 was recommended, with programs through Grade 5 to create an awareness of work, in Grades 6-8 to provide exploration of work possibilities, in Grades 9-12 for preparatory job training vocational-technical courses, and with postsecondary technical training at the Florida Keys Community College, a vocational center.

A secondary purpose was to explore the reliability of job-related ratings as a function of the number of raters. A taxonomy of 76 human attributes was used and ratings of the relevance of these attributes to each of the PAQ job elements were obtained. Conclusions drawn from these analyses were: (1) Raters are able to rate the relevance of human attributes to job elements in a structured job analysis instrument such as the PAQ with respectable reliability, and (2) A large number of human attributes appear to be relevant to the job elements of the PAQ. Implications drawn from these conclusions were: (1) The attribute  profiles of the PAQ job elements seem to be of potential use in determining job attribute requirements through job analysis with the PAQ, and (2) Such profiles, in turn, may be useful in establishing the synthetic validity of personnel tests. The determination of the reliability of the ratings as a function of the number of raters resulted in the conclusion that 8 to 10 raters usually would provide reasonably reliable ratings.

        "description":"The need for a new projective instrument for use with low-income, disadvantaged populations is postulated in this study, and the development of such an instrument, the Value Orientation Test (VOT), is undertaken. With a theoretical foundation drawn from the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; school of thought, the test is related to the implicit hypotheses of this concept. Exploration is made theoretically of the culture of poverty thesis, and findings from administration of the VOT are compared with it. Examination is also made of the study of values and the use of projective tests in the social sciences. The culture of poverty thesis is found lacking in empirical support, and the data here gathered lend added weight to doubts of its validity. It is concluded that the VOT has many potential  uses in training and work-placement programs for the disadvantaged worker, as well as theoretical value to testing the culture of poverty thesis. A new scoring system has been developed, and a manual with complete instructions for administering and scoring the test is appended to the report. A related document is available as ED 057 256.

This phase of the project studied the extent to which the educational programs in the school system reflected changes appropriate to preparing persons for existing occupations. Data from surveys of key employers as to the expected need for workers in various occupational categories and from surveys of the vocational offerings in the public schools and technical institutes were analyzed. It was found that: (1) The occupations for which vocational training is appropriate have increased at a rate exceeding the growth rate of the population, (2) Vocational offerings at the high school level  are appropriate to only 25 percent of the jobs in the manpower structure and offerings at the technical institute are appropriate to only 16 percent, and (3) There is little coordination between the business community and the schools in planning for programs appropriate to emerging economic and social changes in the area studied. In view of the findings, it was recommended that there be a reorientation of the curriculum toward realistic occupational goals to meet business and industrial needs.

The proceedings were recorded and this paper contains most of the remarks made on that occasion. Dr. Marland first framed the topic of career education, stating that it is still a concept, not a blueprint, but an all-inclusive concept ranging from the elementary grades through postsecondary education with particular meaning for the world of adult education. Dr. Koerner then commented on Dr. Marland's remarks, expressing his concern with both the term and the  concept of career education and emphasizing that basic education is the real need along with some old-fashined vocational education. Others at the meeting engaged in dialog with the two speakers, arriving at no specific conclusions but perhaps a better understanding of Dr. Marland's concept of career education. (MF)",

The CVAE program provided vocational courses to prepare students for semi-skilled jobs and also provided modified academic courses with practical application to the vocational courses. Questionnaires were mailed to the schools identified as containing CVAE for completion by supervisors and teachers. Questionnaires for CVAE students and former students were distributed during  school visitations made to 20 percent of the surveyed schools. This report compiles and compares the collected data. In the schools visited, 35 percent of the academic programs were judged to be failing, 32 percent were judged successful, and the remainder were progressing or improving. Most vocational programs were found to be successful, with only 6 failing. Programs judged to be most successful were used for comparative analysis. However, as teachers of successful programs returned more questionnaires than teachers of failing programs, significant conclusions could not be drawn. (MF)",

The manual contains self appraisal instruments  and directions for evaluating adult supplementary programs, adult preparatory programs, secondary and postsecondary occupational programs, and nonoccupational programs. Charts and procedures to be utilized in the followup of students in the Vocational Information Reporting System Manual and the self appraisal instruments to be used are included. (Author/SN)",

        "description":"This document is a digest of a final report presenting the view and experiences of former students in Texas high schools who left as graduates or dropouts during the school years 1963-64 and 1968-69. The study's objectives were to: (1) determine the extent to which work and studies or training beyond the high school were based on high school experiences, (2) gather employment status information, (3) obtain appraisals of courses, activities, and school personnel, (4) obtain suggestions for improving schools and preventing dropouts, and (5) establish a data base for educational planning and assessment. From the data collected, it was concluded that: (1) The most popular high school courses were electives in which practical skills were learned, (2) Demand for more advanced  college-preparatory courses was balanced if not exceeded by a reaction (from those never entering or not succeeding in college) against required courses, (3) The counselor's role should be more clearly defined, (4) Although teachers were generally approved, numerous criticisms indicated a need for greater attention in teacher selection and retention, (5) Boredom is a major problem in many classrooms and an important factor in dropouts, and (6) Progress was made by the schools between 1964 and 1969 in redirecting programs toward the world of work.

A sample of the State's 89 school districts was contacted by mail or interview, with 5,063 respondents in the 12,649 sample. Details of the sampling procedures and of the respondent profile are given. Respondents from both school years gave their highest approval to courses in which practical skills were taught. Slightly more than 30 percent reported that their opinions had changed concerning the value of courses they had taken in high school. Highest favorable opinion changes were toward bookkeeping, typing/shorthand, vocational  industrial education, vocational office/business, and vocational homemaking. An overall favorable endorsement of teachers was given, although some serious criticisms were made.

Respondents who had contact with counselors questioned the adequacy of the assistance received from them. Extracurricular activities were highly approved, especially athletics. On the other hand, some respondents criticized the overemphasis of athletics in relation to academic programs. The major reason for dropouts cited by those who had not dropped out was boredom or lack of interest. The reason most frequently given by the dropouts was marriage and/or pregnancy. Approximately one-fourth of  the respondents terminated their formal education with high school. Postsecondary schools were selected principally because of closeness to home. Of the career goals named, the teaching profession was the predominant field. However, the principal source of employment for most was in marketing and distribution. Almost half of the respondents felt that their high school courses had no relation to their jobs. Related documents are available in this issue as VT 021 091, VT 021 092, and VT 021 094. (MF)",

Two-thirds of the students sampled said that they had reached decisions about their future careers, but the data collected indicated that many of these decisions were reached in the absence of appropriate information about jobs and careers. Although the students claimed that counselors were not providing the information they needed, it was found that the counselors were concentrating on providing the data that the students requested most often: information about the training and education required to get a job. Books  and pamphlets on occupations have been the main source of job information for students, and most students considered them to have been of real help. However, the students would prefer direct experience with the world of work. The survey data suggest that the high school students reach career decisions more as the result of parental influences rather than through free choice. This restricted view of alternatives may cause waste of ability and thwarting of ambition, with the attendant dissatisfaction and alienation that come from ill-advised career decisions. The survey data are presented in narrative and tabular form. (MF)",

Both have particular application to the high school, which is the most likely arena of educational change for the balance of this decade. In career education itself, school-based models are being tested in six cities and some 85,000 children are now participating in at least some career orientation activities. Four sites have been chosen for the employer-based model, which offers a new setting for academic studies and keys them to job experiences provided by a consortium of local employers. The third model, the rural-residential, enables low-income families in Montana and five neighboring States to learn new skills for better jobs, more effective homemaking, or further education. Still in the planning stages is  the fourth model, a home-community effort that would use television and radio programing to encourage unemployed or underemployed adults to take advantage of local retraining programs. Adult education is certainly among our principal priorities for the 1970's. Other activities include development of instructional programs in career clusters, study programs for career education teachers and administrators, and 200 career education demonstration projects. All in all, our record in 1972 is presentable, encouraging in some aspects, and adaptable. (Author/MF)",

In the concept of career education in the community college there are two themes, specialization and regeneration. The specialization theme enables an individual to refine his ability to perform a particular life role or a segment of a life role in a more proficient manner. Regeneration means renewing one's capability to perform one or more of the life roles. The community college must accommodate adults at all age levels for the life roles brought about by changes in technology and society. Examples are presented to translate the career education concept into educational activities within the community college, including  diagnostic programs for recent high school graduates, credit consideration for veterans, and guidance for mature persons in new life roles.

The study focuses on the nature and extent of union involvement in PEP projects and the effects of such involvement in the implementation of the projects. Eight PEP projects were examined to determine the role and impact of unions and collective bargaining on the design and early implementation of each project. No standard pattern of union concern and action emerged. Most often, unions were concerned with possible preferential treatment being given to PEP participants at the expense of regular employees. Unions utilized a variety of mechanisms to pursue their views in PEP projects, including negotiations, grievance procedures, litigation, and management influence. Although unions  reaised questions and made suggestions in most of the cases studied in this research, they did not have a significant impact in the first year of these PEP projects. The experience with PEP provides policy considerations for the future of this or other manpower programs involving the public sector. Policy implications are offered for the legislation authorizing such manpower programs and their administrative implementation. Two options for further research are offered to expand and validate the findings of this study. (MF)",

To assist in planning, this study was conducted to explore students' occupational interests and to identify their employment opportunities after completion of postsecondary vocational-technical training. Student vocational interests were determined by a survey in the high schools of the counties included in the study. An employer survey was made to  indicate the employment opportunities. Results of the surveys and the questionnaires used are presented. The report suggests that the two junior colleges arrange, in cooperation with other postsecondary and with the secondary schools, to develop a master plan for utilizing their resources to provide the technical-vocational programs needed in the service area.

        "description":"This report describes a project to develop an internship program for prospective technical and vocational community college teachers providing both requisite teaching skills and work experience through actual classroom exposure, while allowing an on-the-job evaluation of the prospective teachers. To develop the program, a pilot internship project was conducted in the 1972-1973 school year by the University of Houston and seven area community colleges. Specific requirements for a working internship program as well as the pilot project structure are presented in the report. Program evaluation was made by the participating colleges and by the internship students. Both unanimously approved the program as valuable to the prospective teacher and to the college in which the internship  occurs. For the intern the program provides an opportunity to observe an experienced teacher and to apply classroom instruction methods, while benefiting the college by helping the college instructor. It was concluded that an internship program should be established as a regular part of the Texas educational system. A second pilot project was recommended for the 1973-74 school year to complete development of the internship program. (MF)",

Evaluation concepts, design and methodology for comparative evaluation, trial of the comparative rating scale model, and feedback loop with recommendations for revision are presented. The comparative rating scale model was developed to provide a comparative rating of similar programs at different community coleges, giving each individual rating in the form of a single rating score. Steps in the development and use of this score are described in detail. As a result of the study it was recommended that the program evaluation section of the Texas State Plan for Vocational Education be thoroughly revised and more precisely  delineated through development of a systematic methodology and review of data collection formats.

The primary purpose of the study was to examine the business, distributive education, and shop curriculums to determine if innovations in course offerings, course context, and instructional methods were occurring, what innovations were being used, and to determine what the teachers' opinions were regarding innovations. Responses obtained through interviews and questionnaires supplied the data. Findings include: (1) A majority of the teachers seemingly are receptive and cooperative in discussing innovation and change in vocational subjects, (2) More than half of the teachers are using innovative ideas that are new to this  geographical area where the opportunities are available for them to use new instructional methods and modern equipment, (3) About 72 percent of the surveyed population recommended changes in future curriculum and instructional methods, (4) While nearly all of those surveyed indicated a need for the availability of additional technical training, no one mentioned sources whereby teachers might update their current knowledge, and (5) Many of the newer methods are being used in local classrooms.

The objectives of this study were to determine the current status of industry manpower and to predict manpower needs for the 1970's. To carry out these objectives two questionnaires were developed, a personnel inventory of printing companies throughout the United States and a survey of organizations manufacturing equipment for the printing industry. Data are presented on the background for the study, major industry classifications, printing production processes, skilled personnel, sales/management personnel, wages, and minority and special group employment. Eleven recommendations for education and training were drawn from the study,  including increased emphasis on developing student interest in the graphic arts industry and in preparing students for production and managerial opportunities in the industry of the 1970's. Some specific instructional recommendations for educational programs are made. A summary survey of graphic arts technology prepared for this study by the Graphic Arts Research Center of the Rochester Institute of Technology constitutes almost half of the document. This summary survey was based on a literature search and provides occupational information and a forecast of graphic arts technology. (MF)",

Questionnaires distributed to 164 agribusinesses in the area supplied the data. Conclusive findings included: (1) Generally, management representatives surveyed were willing to assist the school in providing centers for field trips, but not many were enthusiastic about providing opportunities for supervised experience programs, (2) Employment in firms that hired large numbers of part-time employees  tended to be seasonal, (3) Agribusiness management and marketing clusters were considered most important for job entry of the 44 competency clusters surveyed, (4) Except for some agribusiness management and marketing clusters, the competency clusters were not commonly accepted as relevant to all types of employment, and (5) Skill type clusters were considered least important for obtaining employment.

The critique was prepared by a special committee on the Center for Adult, Vocational, Technical, and Manpower Education of the Bureau of Adult and Occupational Education, Office of Education, because this particular part of the report had appeared to some persons as an attack on vocational education. The committee chose two evaluation approaches, the first a conceptual one to determine underlying assumptions relating to that part of the report and the second an analytical study to determine if the report contained inadequacies which resulted in faulty findings. Excerpts from previous reviews of the study portion of the report are presented,  followed by a section concerned with the apparent conceptual framework in the \"Work in America\" portion being analyzed. This section of the critique lists 15 underlying assumptions, with the study committee's comments on each. A paragraph-by-paragraph content analysis of the work reviewed constitutes the largest part of the study. An \"index of inadequacy\" summarizes the findings of this content analysis, with an average of 4.2 inadequacies per paragraph found according to the evaluation criteria used. (MF)",

As March 15, 1972 marked the 10th annivarsary of the passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 (MDTA), the NMAC proposed that these letters be published to provide an intimate view of the evolution of Federal manpower policy and programing. The Secretary of Labor concurred with this recommendation to give maximum access to public records. Appendixes include supplementary documents and additional data about the structure and functioning of the NMAC. Eli Ginsberg, the chairman of the  NMAC and the drafter of the letters, has written an introduction which reviews the advice given during the first decade of manpower programs under the MDTA, identifies the principal themes which have preoccupied the Committee, and adds selected judgments informed by the perspective of time about the appropriateness and effectiveness of the advice which the Committee proffered.

Working increased grade point averages up to a point, after which favorable impact declined or became negative. The extent of career exploration experienced and its implications for longrun labor market prospects could not be discerned from the results of the study.

Recognizing that five percent of the discharged Armed Forces Medical Services personnel are separated at bases in Texas, the institution contracted with the Governor's Office of Comprehensive Health Planning to devise ways to direct separatees into health careers, find employment for the fifteen percent already qualified in health occupations, expedite and maximize enrollment of those seeking further training, and after analyzing Texas health manpower shortages, to recommend solutions to this  problem. The objectives were met to the satisfaction of the project officer of the contract and to the project staff by dividing the work into five areas: contact of separatees, counseling and vocational guidance, entry into jobs and/or training programs, followup of separatee status, and program evaluation. 891 applications were received in the time reported. Recommendations were made in three areas. (Correspondence, tables, outlines, and application forms are included.) (AG)",

Because of New Hampshire's intrinsic characteristics of climate and scattered population and the scarcity of qualified instructors, plans have been made to broadcast on educational television a fifteen part series, &quot;Return to Nursing,&quot; developed at Russell Sage College. This will be followed by a concentrated period of clinical experience for nurses. Funding is being sought. The need for reactivating auxiliary dental personnel was assessed by surveying dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants. It is felt that refresher training will best be accomplished  on-the-job or through the school for Dental Hygienists to be opened soon. Programs for reactivation of medical technologists and occupational therapists were found to be unnecessary. Many potential health workers cite inadequate salaries, inappropriate benefits, and frustrating working conditions as reasons for finding other employment.

New patterns of health care delivery such as group practice and health centers are assessed for their impact on health workers, the public, and health occupations education. Obstacles to further participation of non-physician workers in primary care are lack of money for training programs, conservatism or opposition by professional organizations and educational institutions, licensure laws,  and the lack of a general structure of health care delivery.

It presents a summary of Minnesota licensure laws as they apply to categories of health personnel and paramedical personnel currently unrecognized by the law. An analysis is also made of malpractice decisional law to examine whether such laws prohibit or inhibit optimal utilization of health personnel. Licensure laws have this effect by defining the limits of functions performed by licensed personnel and by proscribing the use of persons who are not licensed in a particular category. Medical malpractice law limits optimal utilization of personnel by exposing health care practitioners to possible liability if they deviate from laws, customs, and accepted standards of care. Alternative proposals for changes  in the law are set forth that would permit more latitude in the use of health care personnel, if such a goal is deemed necessary.

The third section is devoted to a discussion of the quality and quantity of nursing care in the state, supported by regional maps and statistical tables. The students and programs contributing to nursing education are discussed in the fourth section, with tables on admissions, graduations, dropouts, and types of programs. The fifth section is devoted to leadership in nursing--how it is effective and how it can become more effective. The final section concerns conclusions related to the  previous sections. A two-page bibliography concludes the report. (AG)",

A sample of 200 American managers is utilized for this purpose. The necessary data were collected using a Personal Values Questionnaire, a biographical questionnaire and an inbasket exercise. The managers were first classified into three different managerial style groups. The three groups were then compared for significant differences among them on thirteen personal characteristic variables. This analysis revealed such a difference on two variables--age of managers and the department in which they worked. In general, younger managers tended to be more autocratic and inclined to make quick decisions without consulting their coworkers. The older managers, on  the other hand, appeared to be more consultative and human relation oriented. It was also found that managers in sales departments displayed more a \"quick and autocratic\" style than those in the other departments who tended to be either more consultative or human relations oriented or both.

A number of studies have been completed dealing with various groups of individuals in diverse organizational settings (managers, educational administrators, union leaders and naval officers). These studies clearly show that personal values are both measureable and important to measure. Values are related to such practical and important concerns as decision making, managerial success and organizational context differences. This review of the findings also raises a number of questions which still need to be answered in this area. For example, at individual levels, it is not known how value systems develop and change as a result of  one's organizational experiences. At the level of an organization, the question of &quot;optimal mix of values&quot; of its members needs studying. It is hoped that future research efforts would be directed towards these and other such questions. [A seventeen-item list of references is included.] (Author)",

Nonfarm wage and salary employment is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 2.4%, with the corresponding national rate being 2.0%. The fastest growing industrial sectors will be manufacturing, construction, trade, services, and government. Jobs requiring relatively high skill levels, such as professional, technical, and managerial and structural occupations, are expected to have substantial growth. Jobs with lower skill requirements are also expected to expand significantly. Total job demand over the five-year study should amount to 215,000. Occupational categories which are expected to have the largest demand are clerical  and sales; professional, technical and managerial; and service. Those occupations which are not expected to exert a demand on the economy are agricultural (service) and processing occupations. More than 43,000 workers will be needed between 1970 and 1975 to meet expansion and replacement needs, as compared to 49,000 for the preceding five-year period.

A questionnaire was sent to 107 health organizations, 50 educational institutions, and 30 professional associations. Responses to the questionnaire, available statistical data, findings from other studies, and data supplied by consultants suggest that although the number of professional and ancillary health personnel have increased, they have not kept pace with the increasing population growth. Increasing specialization among physicians, high attrition and turnover rates among nurses, and excessive mobility stemming from discrepancies in job compensation are given as some  reasons for the shortage. Recommendations are made that planning efforts to increase the capacity and offerings for health careers at educational institutions must be fostered; that measures to encourage more people to enter health professions must be stimulated; and that steps to retain persons presently employed, to encourage the return of inactive professionals to practice, and to effectively utilize existing personnel must be taken.

The major physician must conserve his professional abilities through his position as team leader.

Regarding management practices, it was found that high producers kept replacement heifers, increased herd size, averaged a higher management level, and were using other recommended practices in comparison to low producers. Characteristics of cattlemen (high and low producers), management practices, and reasons for adoption of such  practices provided a basis for development of a useful educational plan for use with cow-calf producers in Marshall County, Tennessee. (A sixteen-item list of references is provided, as is a table which presents average and total beef management practice diffusion ratings by high, medium, and low producers for cattlemen interviewed.)

Areas of concern were accreditation, medical school affiliation, training programs, nursing home affiliations, and hospital personnel. The major conclusion was that there are definite manpower shortages in the 33 hospitals in Region 3. Suggested actions would be to hold meetings of hospital administrators, educational institutions, governmental manpower programs, and the New Jersey Health Careers Service to discuss means of meeting this need and to work out a plan of action.

The industrialization of Iowa with attendant decline in the importance of agriculture has led to population shifts to the cities, concentrating health services into larger, more economical units. Health professionals and support personnel are also becoming scarce in rural areas but their regional concentration, coupled with improvements in transportation and communication, make possible a wider spectrum of health care than could have been provided in the past.

Many startling changes must be made in our educational, social, and economic systems; and career education is the central instrument for the voluntary renewal of education. The counselor's role in this reform movement is that of catalyst, harmonizer, and orchestrator. Minorities (poor, non-white, and to a certain extent, women) have lacked the luxury of choice afforded others; hence they must be made knowledgeable about various alternatives, including the kinds of financial assistance available. A recent poll of 900 inner-city students from three large cities indicated that virtually every student put college finance information in  first and second place in rank ordering of informational needs. Kinship between what happens in the schools and what happens elsewhere is the heart of career education--and this practical application of knowledge should be the concern and responsibility of all teachers. Education should be saturated with the career theme. The counselor needs to put together the resources for career education. Career education is the profession's response to end the systematic injustices that threaten our society. (SC)",

Three existing surveys of Nebraska's nurse needs were reviewed, hospitals and nursing homes were surveyed, and inactive nurses were contacted by questionnaire to gauge their interest in courses. Transportation difficulties, family conditions, and apprehension were among the concerns of the nurses. Twenty-eight courses in sixteen locations during 1967-68 resulted in the retraining of 312 nurses. Followup in August 1969 of 257 retrained nurses indicated that 124 were employed in nursing, 80% on a  parttime basis. It was recommended that the University of Nebraska take future responsibility for refresher courses, that criteria be established to aid nurses assess their ability after long periods of inactivity, and that recruitment materials be developed.

Following a review of related literature, instruments were drafted, and three surveys were conducted. Input data concerning the instruments was gathered from professionals with expertise in vocational education, directors of area vocational centers, and high school students both involved and uninvolved in vocational training. This data was used to further develop the sociological testing instruments and procedures. These instruments were then used to determine evidence of peer groupings and sociological  status. A conclusion was that sociological status does attach to different curricular groups. Therefore, planning officers and educators should be concerned with sociological viewpoints and their ramifications when planning future vocational centers. It was also suggested that the survey instruments be considered usable for obtaining future data on peer group perception. (KP)",

Those in information management are arriving at a point in which a different direction or \"road\" may be taken. The familiar producer route has been one of service to programs. Although the producer aspect is of vital importance, the new planner or consultant road includes the added dimensions of the information specialist being a member of the overall decision making team in programming or managing Extension information. They must keep up with rapid  changes, trends, and developments in the communication field, using a multi-media approach to reach larger and more diverse audiences. Ways to get new ideas going include getting to know co-workers better, attending departmental planning meetings, and talking with the Director about ideas. To get on this consultant road, become a craftsman in the field, develop habits of dependability, become self-motivated, look at the broad picture, and think things through logically. (SC)",

A series of recommendations was drawn up. Additional Child Care, Guidance and Services programs should be initiated cautiously due to limited employment opportunities. A combined Home Furnishings, Equipment, Services, Clothing Management, Production and Services program would meet both student interest and employer demand for garmet factory sewing machine operators. Student interest in Food Management, Production and Services should be stimulated and programs  established. Hiring of cooperative education students should be investigated.

Each unit encompassed goals, performance objectives, learning activities, materials, and evaluation. A formula for measuring efficiency level of proficiency gain through pretesting and posttesting was worked out. Cost data for each unit in each class was broken down to include personnel, trips, and materials. Unit implementation costs varied widely. Cost per unit of proficiency gain was then calculated to measure effectiveness. The use of mean proficiency levels obscures  individual differences and an analysis of each student's proficiency level for each unit provides more meaningful information. Teacher evaluation of the units indicates some dissatisfaction with availability of materials, the tests, and the goal and objective components in relation to activities. Eight recommendations for refinement of the units are made. Appendixes include data collection forms. (MS)",

The findings indicated that disagreement existed within the age groups concerning the level of difficulty, defined by the amount of planning needed, of community projects and that  differences in 4-H club activities must be left to the choice of the members. The youth must be able to feel the commitment that is based upon one's own interest and motivation.

Data were collected by interviewing library users and by recording information on books borrowed by users. It was concluded that interest in reading will gradually build up in the community as a result of the library scheme. Recommendations were that: library boxes at small rural centers are a useful adjunct; library facilities should be limited to those rural centers  where there is an active, local, developmental organization; a special effort should be made to interest rural school-leavers in joining local libraries; simple library management can be easily taught; reading lists should be constantly updated; and a study of the difficulty of reading material in the vernacular should be done.

The results of both studies are reported. Accelerated literacy instruction was introduced and innovativeness was measured in the following farm season. It was indexed by finding out when respondents had adopted nine recently introduced farming practices. Methods used at Chiduku were improved for the later Seki study by weighing the innovations according to their importance and complexity and by gaining some control over extraneous variables. The major constraints to adoption of innovations were lack of labor, oxen, and equipment. The Seki findings indicate that literacy instruction  and innovativeness do not appear to be related, nor does there appear to be a delayed effect. The author &quot;cautiously concludes&quot; that illiteracy alone does not appear to be an immediate major obstacle to agricultural development. On the contrary, evidence suggests that economic &quot;take off&quot; in the context of improved opportunity structure precedes the demand for literacy instruction. Implications for rural development programs are described. A 34 item list of references, including the author's preliminary studies, is included. (MS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether alcoholics will show greater persistance in responding under punishment in a simple operant task as compared to nonalcoholics; and (2) with this task, under what conditions alcoholics will suppress their responses to the same extent as nonalcoholics. In the task, all subjects during acquisition received training with monetary reinforcers symbolizing rewarding aspects of drinking, followed by one of three extinction conditions symbolizing possible unpleasant aspects of drinking: (1) punishment only; (2) simultaneous reward-punishment; and (3) nonreward. The main finding was that following acquisition, alcoholics in the punishment-only and in the reward-punishment condition failed to suppress their responses to the  same extent as the nonalcoholic controls. The author discusses implications for treatment procedures drawn from the conclusion that punishment is not an effective agent for the modification of behavior in alcoholics. (Author/LAA)",

        "description":"Three test instruments were used in a self-concept study of 373 school children in grades three through six: (1) the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale; (2) the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire; and (3) the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. The study explored the relationship of self-concept to acceptance of responsibility for intellectual achievement and anxiety over intellectual failure, particularly as a function of age or sex. Results show that, across the grades, pupils with low self-concept gradually assume less responsibility for school success. Pupils with high self-concept gradually increase their acceptance of responsibility for success from grade three to five, maintaining a high level of acceptance in grade six. Girls consistently score higher than  boys on measures of anxiety. Pupils with low self-concept show much higher anxiety levels in all grades examined than pupils with high self-concept. Boys with low self-concept showed a generally consistent decrease in anxiety from fourth grade to sixth. The authors anticipate that a longitudinal design study might indicate the establishment of self-concept levels prior to the third grade, in which case attempts to enhance self-concept would need to begin at the outset of the school experience.

        "description":"As concern over illegal drugs and drug-related behavior is a relatively recent phenomenon, there are little data available on the correlates and/or determinants of drug-related attitude-behaviors. The research done generates confused and often conflicting results, largely due to failure to specify level of attitude-behavior measured. This project develops a scale of attitude-behavior toward drug users according to the Guttman Facet Theory. Measured variables determined to be potential predictors and/or correlates of drug-related attitude-Behaviors are: (1) demographic status; (2) socio-psychological status; (3) contact with drug users; and (4) political activism. An attitude-behavior questionnaire and a personal data questionnaire were administered to 666 individuals in five  groups selected for their known range of attitudes toward drug users. Results suggest that political activism and efficacy do not consistently predict attitude behavior. Factors which appear to account for significant portions of the variance are: (1) voting behavior; (2) participation in rallies; (3) contact with drug users; and (4) efficacy. The attitude behavior scale developed in this study may be of help in future research relating different predictors of drug-related attitude behavior to different subgroups. (Author/NMF)",

Using a male and female experimenter, the study examined the following five variables: (1) sex of helper; (2) sex role appropriateness of task; (3) anticipated future audience interaction; (4) sex role ideology of subject; and (5) self esteem of subject. The report concluded that, for high self-esteem males, help-seeking is inhibited in male-oriented tasks. Men appear to be limited by sex stereotyped training, a factor which affects their requests for tutoring, counseling, and other helping services. By deemphasizing sex-appropriate behavior and decreasing the pressure on men to be independent, we can free them to seek help when it is needed. Not only will such freedom allow better utilization of services, but  even more importantly it will allow men to grow as individuals. (Author/LAA)",

The basis of his optimism lies in the professional commitment to human learning goals and the expertise to become the instrument of learning valuation at a time when such a reordering of university priorities is probably critical. However, the threat to student personnel work is in its dependence on an interpretation of goals which value propriety over learning, restraint over liveliness, control over order and the status quo over change. This is an interpretation which is passe because it has delivered insufficient support and skill to the development of human potentialities. The major part of this presentation defines and discusses the relevance of five  conditions--support, accommodation, access, credibility, and assimilation--which appear necessary to sustain an environment in which learning is valued.

Five professional counselors and speakers in related fields assisted in the teaching and training of a peer counseling class of 48 students. The course was offered first semester, followed in the second semester by the Field Training Phase of the program. Evaluation methods included: (1) subjective measurement; (2) consultation; (3) feedback; (4) participant-observation; (5) written instruments; and (6) staff observations.  Data indicated that more students were reached and helped with peer counselors; and more assistance was provided than would otherwise have been possible. The majority of the peer counselors found that school became more meaningful and that they experienced personal growth in attitudes toward themselves and others. The peer counseling approach allows counselors to become guidance leaders for staff and students, and allows students to become co-partners in their own development. The program may serve as a model for other high schools. (Author/NMF)",

The author questions the extent to which social science research follows scientific procedures based on a \"hypothetico-deductive\" format and the extent to which its propositional structure is derived from theory. Arguing against the informality of social science procedures, the author seeks more textual closure by defining terms, unpacking the verbal formulations into simpler components, analyzing the nature of statements, identifying all variables, and making explicit the relationship between them. The report includes an examination of some underlying assumptions about social phenomena derived from linguistics  research. Rather than supporting deductive theory, the author suggests that the interpretive form of understanding expressed in ordinary prose can be used to discover facts amidst the complexity in which they exist.

The pamphlet describes four parts of the anxiety experience: 1) the anxiety cue, the particular thought, memory, or sensation which precipitates the anxiety affect; 2) the anxiety affect, emotion somewhat like that experienced in fear, which is unpleasant and demands relief; 3) the primary anxiety reaction, a defensive or withdrawing move by the anxious person; and 4) the adaptive anxiety reaction, a self-concept or considerable courage to face fear. The pamphlet also examines stages in danger judgment, ways of reacting to danger, and the function of purposeful forgetting which  becomes habitual when the danger is unavoidable and beyond mastery. The booklet concludes by providing teachers with cues for identifying anxiety in the classroom, and with specific strategies for helping the student to cope with that anxiety. (Author/LAA)",

Subjects received performance evaluations on a contrived project, thereby achieving either a high or low status.

This study discusses a program to improve black-white police relations through role playing techniques and small group interactions on problems of human relationships. Longitudinal in design, the study assesses: (1) changes in values and attitudes over time; (2) optimal implementation time for the training program; (3) effectiveness of the program; and (4) the attitudinal effect on officers of precinct assignments and inter-racial contact. Some positive changes took place in the attitudes of black officers participating in the program during academy training. Negative attitude changes occurred in white participants and  spread to white non-participants. A similar program conducted a year later avoided the severe backlash effect by downplaying its racially-motivated aspects. It, too, failed to improve black-white relations in any significant way. It appears that polarization between black and white officers begins upon entrance to the police academy, although a training program can sensitize each group to the other. Precinct assignment has little impact on values but strong impact on attitudes development, with duty in white precincts fostering undesirable viewpoints about blacks among both black and white officers. The study suggests that rotating precinct assignments for all officers would be a helpful step in combating stereotypic racial attitudes among all police. (Author/NMF)",

A poor concept of efficient utilization of time and organization, coupled with a weak academic self-discipline perpetuates a dangerous beginning for the black freshman. Parental lack of exposure to college does little to reinforce motivation, sense of direction, and self-concept. The document discusses ways of coping with the black student's problems in higher education and defines separation as a failure to prepare him for the culture in which he must function. The author also condemns one-way integration as a source of personal maladjustment for many black students and as a reinforcer of the dichotomy in American life. She concludes that  only when we accept and appreciate mutual peculiarities and differences will our efforts take on new meaning and become viable exercise of professionalism. (Author/LAA)",

In addition to evaluations of the target individual, dependent measures also included attributions of the motives underlying his stability or change and direction and magnitude of the subject's own opinion change. Results suggest that as long as an individual's final responses agree with modal group opinion, he is evaluated significantly more favorably than a consistent opinion correctness, desire to demonstrate assertiveness, and desire to see self as similar to attractive others. Agreement is attributed more to  desire to be liked and desire to see self as similar to attractive others. (Author/LAA)",

Despite the dearth of literature on behavior therapy as it relates to the adolescent, the author believes that the behavior therapist can help the adolescent. After exploring the tenets of behavior therapy, the author posits that the school might constitute an excellent place for the use of contingency contracts. An adolescent's ability to abide by his contract tells those around him that he is becoming more mature and responsible. He tends to live by the image which he himself has set up by abiding by his contract which further reinforces the attitudes of the adults around him and the spiral of  adaptive behaviors. The report includes an example of a family behavioral contract that states general and specific privileges and responsibilities. (Author/LAA)",

This study undertakes a more detailed analysis of the relationship between occupational categories and New Canadian status by providing for additional analyses of other non-school variables, such as the student's mother tongue and immigrant status. Since the concern of the school system lies with the individual child, this study uses student based data rather than census-type data based on head-of-household. Much of the data in this report regarding ethnic groups and their occupations seems consistent with expressed attitudes regarding immigrants. Occupational status among different ethnic groups does not always match the school success  of the children from those groups. Proportions of ethnic populations in various occupations appear to be related more to mother tongue than to whether or not the student was born in Canada, and to whether or not English was the student's first language. Numerous tables and demographic maps are appended. (Author/LAA)",

The Problems Inventory section of the Exit Interview Questionnaire provided the primary source of data which was later factor analyzed. The current research reveals quite clearly that male and female students have experienced different types of problems prior to the decision to withdraw from college. Women seemed more concerned with personal  adequacy, performance, or specific personal needs in their environment, while men more often reflected philosophical concerns related to education and career choice, or problems of a financial or physical nature.

Client movement is a function of the simulated variables: threat value of counselor and client statements, strength of the relationship, and an index of counselor competence. The simulation project is valuable as a means of training and evaluation in counselor education and in studying counselor cognitive processes. It also provides an opportunity to test the sufficiency of an explicit set of theoretical constructs for explaining client behavior. (Author/LAA)",

It was found that women performed significantly better (p.01) in the male-oriented than in the female-oriented situation, with this difference between conditions being greater for those women scoring high rather than low in the motive to avoid success (p.05).

A modified view of divergent thinking emerges which separates the creative, &quot;artsy&quot; student from the intelligent, scientific student. Such separation seems to be a consequence of the role of divergent thinking as a secondary indicator of the esthetic mode of thought, which in turn, seems to reflect a fundamental mode of cognition.

        "description":"Two-syllable words were presented singly for study followed by a two-alternative, forced-choice test to 120 college students divided into four groups of 30 each. Half of the new words on the test (\"I\" words) were constructed by combining two syllables taken from two different study words, and half were neutral words (\"C\" words). If, as a consequence of study, the memory for a word carries frequency information about each syllable of multisyllable words, the number of errors produced by choosing \"I\" words should be greater than the number produced by choosing \"C\" words. The results supported this expectation. Furthermore, differences which occurred during the test suggested that syllabic frequency was further increased during testing. Frequency induction to elements of larger  units was proposed as the mechanism by which formal similarity influences recognition. (Author/WR)",

The core of the PSRI is a scope and sequence statement which outlines the skills normally taught in kindergarten to grade six: word attack, comprehension, study skills, self-directed reading, interpretive reading, and creative reading. A cumulative reading record folder provides the teachers with a permanent accounting instrument that can be used for the years the child is in school. A major component of the PSRI is the Wisconsin Expanding Inventory of Reading Development (WEIRD), a series of group assessment tests of reading behavior for the initial placement of children, which enabled the Wilson staff to identify what reading skills  learners had, as well as those they needed. The two year experimental program implementing the PSRI for individually guided reading was termed successful by the teachers at Wilson School. (WR)",

The PRIMIR program is a method of individualizing the primary reading program through the use of a basal reader as a skills strand supplemented with paperback books and other reading materials to extend skills and efficiency. Over 600 first grade students participated in this experiment to determine the merits of individualized reading. Three experimental  groups were formed: divided day with PRIMIR, divided day without PRIMIR, and a control group of similar socioeconomic and achievement level makeup. The results indicated the PRIMIR D/D students showed significant reading achievement gains over the non-PRIMIR students, who showed superiority over the control-traditional students. (WR)",

        "description":"One facet in the development of a good program of reading is conscientious planning. The use of behaviorally stated objectives developed on a weekly, monthly, and unit basis provides the teacher with a means for measurable and meaningful evaluation. Individual diagnosis enables the teacher to know the level of instruction at which to begin a child and the specific reading skills he needs. Informal inventories, diagnostic tests, intelligence tests, ear and eye tests, and interest inventories are meaningful tools to employ at this stage of a reading program. Reading materials should be of varied interests and difficulty levels. This could include several sets of basal readers, supplementary materials, and multi-media materials. With this wide variety of materials a teacher can  choose those that are appropriate to the level of each child. Meaningful reinforcement procedures are of high importance in a successful reading program. The most effective reinforcements appear to be those directed toward the positive aspects of a program. A continuous evaluation based on objectives constitutes the final major phase of a reading program. The effectiveness of a program should be measured through an evaluation of the child's progress in relation to the objectives written for that child. (WR)",

Sixty nursery school children (average age 53 months) and 60 first graders (average age 84 months) were selected as subjects. Each child studied nine pairs of objects, photographs, or drawings for two trials of PA learning by the recall method. In the visual elaboration conditions, the two items of the pair were presented in some visual relationship to each other during study trials (e.g., spoon holding a candle) as each item was named by the experimenter. In the corresponding verbal elaboration conditions, the items were presented visually, side-by-side, and accompanied by an orally presented sentence (e.g., \"The spoon is holding the candle.\"). Five seconds  were given for each item in test trials. The results indicated that photographs and objects were associated with more learning than drawings at both ages and with both types of mediational elaboration; but it was suggested that differences among the three types of pictorial stimuli decrease with age. A previously reported Age X Elaboration interaction suggesting a relative disadvantage of visual elaboration for younger children was not replicated. (WR)",

Additionally, in the two experimental groups, teachers used an interpretation of test results as a guide for the remedial instruction, a counselor assisted the students according to their needs, and filmstrips and other materials supplemented the usual classroom materials. One experimental group was also  taken on field trips related to situations in their classroom reading materials. A close relationship was found between reading level and BTBC scores, and the number of experimental group children who reached the higher reading levels and achieved higher BTBC posttest scores surpassed the number of control group children who did so.

The first experiments involved the nature of the information about when an event occurred, the spacing of repetitions of an event, and presentation modality of an event. Results suggested that time and spacing are represented in memory by contextual associations, while modality is represented, in addition, by a literal copy of the perceptual experience. A second group of experiments involved the effect of the spacing of repetitions on retention. They suggested that the locus of the effect is on the second of two presentations of the event and that the effect is primarily a function of duration of the spacing interval. The third group of experiments involved memory  for the duration of an interval. Judgments of duration were not found to be related in any simple way to standard recall or recognition measures of memory for events during the interval. (Author/LL)",

Subjects performed significantly better with experimental forms than with control versions. However, treatment effect was differentiated according to reading grade level. The 4.0-4.9 reading grade group showed a non-significant difference with segmented print, while those in the 5.0-5.9 and 6.0-6.9 groups  registered experimental differences equivalent to six and nine months respectively.

        "description":"This monograph reflects some of the current thinking about inservice teacher education, with a particular focus on the role of inservice education in improving reading instruction. Chapter one, an introduction to inservice education, attempts to deal with the problems involved in implementing inservice programs as well as to establish the need for them. Chapter two discusses the process of inservice planning and implementation. The topics covered range from the identification of legitimate needs for inservice education, through the steps of implementation, to the evaluation of the efforts expended. Staff roles and responsibilities are dealt with in chapter three. Formats for inservice sessions (e.g., lecture, demonstration, observation, interviewing, brainstorming, role playing,  and buzz sessions) are presented in chapter four, and strengthsand limitations of each are considered. Some descriptions of inservice programs that have already been implemented are given in chapter five. (WR)",

The programs reviewed here represent a cross-section of the many language and perceptual readiness programs available. The assumption underlying each of these programs is that mastery of the readiness skills identified in the program contributes to later school achievement. The programs discussed range from sets of simple visual-motor and auditory discrimination tasks, to combinations of complex tasks, to tasks involving reception and production of language. The programs are designed to improve oral language or to encourage perceptual-motor development. The programs reviewed include: Peabody  Language Development Kit-Level 2, Auditory Discrimination in Depth, Perceptual Training Procedure, Developing Learning Readiness, Pathway School Program, Frostig Program for the Development of Visual Perception, Pictures and Patterns, Fairbanks-Robinson Program-Level 1, and Erie Program.

Sixty fifth and sixth grade students from an open area school were selected as subjects--14 students were reading at third grade instructional level, 15 students at fourth grade instructional level, and 31 students at fifth grade instructional level. In order to compare the groups, three hypotheses were established: there will be differences in the three groups' mastery of the six phonics skills studied; there will be differences in the phonics skills mastered by the fifth grade students reading below grade level and the fifth grade students reading at fifth grade level; and there will be differences in the phonics skills mastered by the sixth grade students  reading below fifth grade level and the sixth grade students reading at fifth grade level. Some of the results indicated that phonics skills mastery varies between fifth and sixth grade students who are reading at fifth grade level and those students reading below fifth grade level. Students reading below fifth grade level had mastered consonant sounds, consonant blends, and letter sounds. Students reading at grade level could profit from instruction in blending syllables into words. (WR)",

Subjects in the study were forced to process words and non-word strings both serially and under conditions which allowed simultaneous processing, and their performances were compared. Five inter-connected studies were performed. Experiment one confirmed the parallel processing effect for words, showing a striking increase in the percentage of words correctly identified as the number of letters present on the screen at any one time increased. Experiment two showed that words could be processed in parallel with a fair degree of accuracy even when letters were displayed in random temporal order. Experiment  three attempted to determine whether non-word strings bearing a statistical resemblance to English would show the parallel processing effect but found only weak positive evidence. Experiment four found no relation between the appearance of the effect and either the pronounceability or the frequency of non-word trigrams. Experiment five found no evidence that the effect extends beyond words to short phrases. (TO)",

A reading achievement program, developed by the Hoffman Information Systems, was the core curriculum for the students in the project. Only three or four students used the Hoffman materials at one time, and the materials were alternated with other curricular materials. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Survey E, Forms 1 and 2, were administered to obtain pre- and post-test measures. Analysis of the objectives  were made with the use of formulas developed specifically for the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test.

In such a study, no significant difference in motivation and aspiration, as influenced by media, can be found among ethnic and other groups. This phenomenon is likely the result of the ubiquitous availability of electronic and print media to all levels of society. These results throw doubt on the traditional McClelland contention that minority groups generally lack motivation. The findings also show no significant difference between the sexes' aspirations and motivations for work toward desired goals. Subjects demonstrated such behavior in tests of their viewing, listening, and reading; their  interpersonal communication; their communication topics; their role-reversal playing for media control; their knowledge about governmental agencies; and their attitudes toward various local issues. Very few significant differences appeared among ethnic groups; however, more women than men disliked violent and pornographic television programs. (CH)",

Three raters were trained to recognize 15 different types of figurative usage; they were then given a tapescript of the present case and asked to rate it independently. Analysis showed the session moved from a relatively slow starting segment to a rapid burst of metaphoric and interpretative activity and concluded with a temporarily successful resolution of the presenting problems. By guiding the  patient to help him see the familiar problem in an unfamiliar light through the use of figurative language, dramatic insights into the problem were gained. This was largely made possible by the highly verbal skills of the patientand by the fact that this variety of gestalt therapy makes use of personifications. Nevertheless, figurative language provides not only a playful heuristic capable of springing a momentarily blocked patient, but it may also tell us a good deal more about the patient and his problems than could probably be articulated in any other way.

It is concluded from the case study that when the patient and the therapist used non-literal language, the metaphors generated alternatives for the insightful solution  of the patient's problems; the metaphors built upon one another in a therapeutic cascade of insightful communication.

        "description":"One of the keys to economic behavior is decision making in production and the market place. Traditionally, economists have assumed decision making to be rational and based upon complete information, but this is not the case in actual situations. Actual problem solving is based upon communication behavior and availability of information. If, as is so often true, the communication behavior is irrational and closed (that is, not open to information input), then problem solving will not occur, or, if it occurs, the solutions will be faulty. The Columbian (South America) agricultural system proves this thesis when tested for openness or closedness. That is, the system and the people are closed to new information input, and thus an archaic agricultural system is perpetuated.  Communication behavior and information availability must be considered in studies on economics. (CH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the written and oral discourse of a subject with an established reputation as an author, editor, lecturer, and television host, to determine whether his written discourse was more complex syntactically than his spoken discourse. The oral language sample was taken from a taped television program in which the speaker responded to questions asked by three guest journalists; the written sample was taken from four newspaper columns written by the speaker. The samples were then segmented into minimal terminal syntactic units and the words in each sample were counted, as were the clauses, nonfinite verbals, passive constructions, auxiliaries, and attributive adjectives. Findings revealed (1) the median length of syntactic units was significantly greater in the  written language samples; (2) the proportion of syntactic units containing one or more dependent clauses was significantly greater in written samples; (3) oral samples did not show as high a frequency of gerunds, participles, attributive adjectives, passive constructions and modal and perfective auxiliaries; and (4) noun clauses, infinitives, and progressive auxiliaries were observed more often in spoken discourse.

The same phrases were presented within a prose context where recall was tested by the cloze procedure. In the first experiment adjectives were better cues, while in the second experiment nouns were. There was no cueing effect in the third experiment. The pattern of retrieval asymmetry shown for the adjective-noun order in the paired-associate context for experiments 1 and 2 corresponded to that occurring within prose. Experiment 4 suggested that the reversal in cueing effect between experiments 1 and 2 may be a result of imagery levels of  adjectives and nouns. Alternative reasons for superior adjective cueing within prose were discussed. (Author/LL)",

The teacher was asked to distribute a packet containing the test passages without any verbal assistance. The instructions asked the student to read the paragraph and then rewrite it in a better way without leaving out any of the information. Results indicated the ninth grade subjects rewrote the passages using longer T-units and clauses than did the eighth grade subjects.

This research is partially confirmed by a study of several mass media public relation efforts designed specifically to increase citizen recognition of the name of obscure candidates. Simple &quot;exposure&quot; political messages tested on a group of subjects yielded substantial increases in the recognition of the name used in the test and other positive results. Thus, campaigns in which obscure candidates attempt to win offices via extensive mass media advertisements for &quot;name recognition&quot; can expect a high degree of success. Also, the subjects' encounters with political advertisements stimulate them to seek  more information about the candidates, but increasing encounters with the messages result in much less information seeking. Mass media campaigns for &quot;exposure&quot; can be obviated, however, by party loyalty, strongly held prejudices, or poor advertising content. (CH)",

In relational communicational analysis, messages as transactions are emphasized; major theoretical concepts which emerge are symmetry, transitoriness, and complementarity of control. Within the context of a brief review of existing interaction analysis techniques, new measurement procedures can be developed which capture both the control and time-varying nature of dyadic interaction. The first step yields a code based on the grammatical format of each sequential utterance (from a speaker). The second step gives a translation of each message format into a &quot;control code.&quot; Control codes, when translated into&quot;transactional codes,&quot; reveal the nature of manipulative communicational exchanges. The methodology thus developed deals with communication in dyads. Further work is required in the case of triadic and larger communicational relationships. (Author/CH)",

        "description":"Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a method of examing communication in an organization by focusing on: (1) the complex interrelationships in human systems, particularly in communication systems; (2) interactions across subsystems and system boundaries; and (3) the need to select and &quot;prioritize&quot; channels which will eliminate noise in the system and maximize effectiveness. FTA provides a step-by-step description of possible failure events within a system and the interactions (the combination of potential occurrences) which could result in a predetermined undesirable event. The FTA technique begins with the description of the system as it exists and proceeds through identification and analysis of potential failures to final suggestions for system changes or modifications. The technique  focuses not only on how an organization is designed to operate but also on how it does operate in practice. (A series of diagrams is included in the description of the process.) (RN)",

They make the student aware of what he did say, but not of what he is saying at the moment. Interjecting comments and criticisms while a student is speaking assists the student in learning to adapt to adverse speaking situations and in overcoming initial nervousness. This technique is also intended to make the student immediately cognizant of flaws in the structure and organization of his speech. Caution must be exercised in employing this technique. \"Heckling\" or interrupting certain students results in a loss of concentration and even in antagonism toward the teacher from other class members.  Generally speaking, however, this technique assists teachers in developing better speakers. (EE)",

Over the past five years, Illinois State University, which currently has one of the largest elementary teacher education programs in the country, has developed a core curriculum which consists of: the arts (Core I), communication (Core II), and the natural and social sciences (Core III). Each core lasts one semester and in the fourth part of the program, students teach full-time under supervision. Art, music, drama, dance, child growth, and curriculum are the major areas of study included in Core I. The primary objective of Core I is to make future elementary teachers aware of the potential of the arts for developing students' self- and group-awareness. An  effective method of achieving this objective is to involve future elementary teachers in creative dramatics. In so doing, they become equipped to supervise, within the elementary school classroom, creative dramatics activities which are designed to sensitize students to their individual potentials and to encourage them to share their experiences in group situations.

Frequently, cinematographers are responsible for much of the artistic expression and inventiveness in films. Although determination of the extent of the cinematographer's contribution is difficult, it is possible to assess the frequency with which cameramen are credited for their contributions to award-winning films. A survey of 339 of the &quot;best&quot; feature films produced between 1930 and 1964 indicated that writers, directors, and editors were credited more frequently than cinematographers. It also indicated that a relatively small group of &quot;top&quot; cameramen were acknowledged as contributing to the &quot;best&quot; films of the period.  (CH)",

The station managements of WMBD in Peoria, Illinois, and of WCIA in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, chose not to broadcast the two &quot;Maude&quot; programs and thus demonstrated two aspects of communicational exchange--the censorship act was each station's declaration of its right to exercise its view of reality, and the act resulted in an increase of status for each station. The altercation which ensued between citizens and the station in Peoria raised the question of the moral right of a station management to censor program material, whereas the Champaign-Urbana controversy centered  upon WCIA's legal rights. In both cases, however, status was the real issue in the arguments. Thus, consideration of such censorship cases can give insight into both how a station management's view of reality can dominate mass media and the process by which groups and individuals gain status in communicational exchanges.

A recent study investigated the effects of eight forms of refutation against five major categories of argument: example, residues, dilemma, analogy, and cause. The refutation techniques included those five argumentative types plus attacks on evidence, attacks on reasoning, and \"turning the tables.\" Results of a survey to determine attitude change on statements relating to a controversial issue (government guarantee of a minimum annual income) indicated that: (1) argument by example is especially persuasive; (2) attack on reasoning, in  keeping with traditional theory, is also especially persuasive; and (3) attack on evidence is curiously unpersuasive. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of the type of initial argument and its effectiveness as refutation. In addition, arguments drawn from inductive reasoning appear to be most effectively refuted by arguments in the same category. (RN)",

Participants raised and explored some of the youth-oriented problems related to nutrition, identified some of the effective ways of working with youth and the adaptability of these programs to a variety of district problems, and discussed ways in which youth-oriented nutrition programs might possibly be initiated and financed. Specific presentations concern the values, life styles, eating habits, and health of youth today; adolescent growth and development; and responsibility for developing the dietary habits of youth. In addition,  ideas for nutrition education, programs, actions, and techniques are presented by Federal, school, industry, and voluntary agency representatives. (Author/MLF)",

The school's program for tension reduction, once critical levels of tension have been reached, is to introduce activities to create positive excitement that counter and reduce the tension.

Teachers pressed for a more active role in what previously had been considered an administrative function. For this investigation of Oregon educator attitudes toward collective negotiations and sanctions, scores were obtained from a sample population comprising subsets of male and female elementary and secondary teachers, and male and female elementary and secondary principals. Correlations were run to determine the relationship between scales of Progressivism and Traditionalism, to Collective Negotiations and Sanctions. Study results indicated that, generally speaking, respondents with  progressive viewpoints tended to favor collective negotiations, and vice versa; male secondary principals and female elementary teachers indicated no relationship between collective negotiations and progressivism; no significant relationship was shown to exist between collective negotiations and traditionalism (with the possible exception of male secondary teachers), and no significant relationship was found between sanctions and progressivism (with the possible exception of female secondary teachers.)

A 77-item questionnaire was sent to the principals as well as to the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade teachers under their supervision to elicit their opinions and observations. As a result, the author makes several recommendations for improved supervision, which principals and teachers in all schools might consider. For example, he feels that staff members should focus on cooperation, involvement, collaboration, and communication in their daily interaction; that principals should give teachers more responsibility and authority for making  decisions which directly affect teaching and learning; the threat of classroom visitations as a supervisory technique should be removed; demonstration teaching should be considered as a useful technique; and that principals should help teachers achieve a sense of worth and dignity in their work.

Results indicate that superintendents are divided in their attitudes about teacher militancy, but that the great majority are definitely perturbed by it.

In rank order, these purposes are (1) clinical supervision, whose central purposes are the improvement of instruction utilizing objective systematic feedback techniques and effective knowledge of group dynamics; (2) professional dialogue with staff in the planning of curriculum and the implementation of curricular programs; and (3) management functions. It is the author's contention that the impetus for change within education is strong enough to ultimately bring about the abolition of the building principalship. He advocates, therefore, that the educational profession should formulate guidelines for inservice education of career administrators, establish a  hierarchical order of function for the role of the principalship, develop a clearinghouse system for identification of innovative programs, and come to grips with the political realities of the movement within education to abolish or circumvent the principalship.

The decision was made by the Atlanta Board of Education to implement a middle-school program, and several new middle-school facilities have been planned and constructed. It became obvious that this shift in school organization would have significant effects on the nature of program offerings and the facilities required at both the elementary and secondary levels of school organization within the school system. The purpose of this study has been to determine the need for middle-school facilities throughout the school system and to make recommendations for housing the middle-school program.  Additionally, as the middle-school program is implemented, changes required for meeting the needs of lower elementary and high school education have also been recommended. This report is intended to provide the school staff and school board with information and recommendations to guide their decisions and actions regarding facilities development over the next decade.

A comparison of the traditional classroom with what is happening in the more \"open\" openrooms reveals that the roles of both teachers and students have altered. New roles require new norms to coordinate them and, although many of the new rules of the classroom may no longer apply, there are still rules for the student to learn while he is in the openroom. However, because of the greatly increased autonomy of the student, these new norms must be more general in what they specify. Instead of letting discussion of the open plan idea  degenerate into a classroom-versus-openrooms debate, the whole variety of learning situations that are possible in a school should be evaluated.

These programs also make it possible to offer teachers the type and duration of employment best suited to their individual needs and preferences. Year-round programs can be designed to ensure that all children in a family will be on vacation at the same time, thus enhancing family vacation options rather than restricting them. Another beneficial side effect of a year-round school program is the reduction of summer vacation \"people pressure.\"  (Author/MLF)",

However, the lines of responsibility are not that clear-cut, leading to a variety of problems involving school boards and administrators. In examining documents dealing with the board-administrator relationship, this review focuses on maintaining the harmonious relationship, contemporary issues and solutions, and the future. A common theme is that mutual respect, trust, and support between board members and superintendents are key elements in any successful educational organization. Some of the contemporary problems discussed include ways of changing the present school system, legal and social  accountability, imbalances of power, and collective negotiation. Predictions about the future, centering primarily on school boards, range from suggestions for revised functions to replacement by \"consensus organizations.\" Ten of the documents are available from the ERIC Document Reproduction Service.

One objective of this study was, therefore, to decrease, if possible, the heterogeneity of nomenclature attached to these positions through resolving the suggestions of administrative practitioners into a few titles, in best fit according to the conditions of employment. A second consideration of the study centers on the supervision of paraprofessionals, although State regulations mandate professional responsibility over paraprofessionals. Information was obtained from questionnaires sent to chief school administrators in districts where instructional paraprofessionals are  known to be part of the school staffs. Seven different conditions of paraprofessional work were described (e.g., works with only one teacher, works with two or more teachers, is a member of a team teaching unit, etc.) and administrators were requested to react to each condition even though the condition did not exist in their districts. Responses from the 268 participating administrators indicate that the most common condition of instructional paraprofessional employment is exclusively supervision, with paraprofessionals relieving teachers of duties involving pupil control in study halls, hallways, playgrounds, and at other points on the school campus where pupils congregate.

The author claims that the most important factor affecting these attitudes may be the school's failure to develop effective ways of carrying on continuous dialogue with its community. The author specifies that an educator should subject his community to a regular examination rather than assume that the community decisionmaking structure is a stabilized constant. A model for examining the influence structure in a community presents four major categories: a consensual elite structure, where few citizens participate and a small group rules; the competitive elite structure, characterized by two or more ideological groups attempting to rule, but where few citizens participate; a consensual mass power  system, implying general ideological unity with broad effective participation by a substantial number of citizens; and the competitive mass structure, analogous to the consensual mass but having some conflict because of the varying ideological base.

Most of the &quot;accountability&quot; literature today is characterized by a devotion to measurable ends, an implicit belief that the ends justify the means. The other half of the educational equation has to do with educational means, yet many people are ignoring the ethical, human questions which are involved. The United States Office of Education itself is fostering financial dependency among educational institutions by establishing conditional relationships (e.g., if the work is done then the funds are forthcoming.) Obviously, school people are responsible for what they do; and for how they teach, administer, and supervise in schools. However, holding one person or institution&quot;responsible&quot; is different from demanding responsibility for the deeds of another. (Author/WM)",

A curriculum might be defined, then, as a set of intended learnings. Three kinds of decisionmaking realms and three corresponding perspectives for inquiry make up the domain of curriculum. These realms involve political negotiations, curricular substance, and established practice. Such decisions are made at societal, institutional, and instructional levels in the hierarchy of schooling. To satisfy the different realms of decisionmaking, differing data sources must be brought into play in the search for tenable answers and solutions. These sources include funded knowledge, conventional wisdom, and the  ideological sources of theorists and researchers. It is because educational institutions tend to draw their data for decisionmaking from the safety of conventional wisdom that schools are conservatively oriented and that the most controversial and potent thrusts of innovation are blunted.

One such agency is the school study-development council, a group of local school systems working voluntarily in loose confederation for the purpose of solving defined educational problems that exist in the member schools. Their three most important activities are inservice training, cooperative research, and the sharing of information. Councils have had their greatest success in the dissemination of educational innovations, in making the school client system aware  of and interested in new ideas, thus helping them through the first two stages toward the actual adoption of innovations.

        "description":"To develop a dissemination strategy for optimal impact on the educational community and to establish a working relationship with State Education Agencies (SEA's), Research for Better Schools (RBS), in 1971, formed a nationwide network of schools as a proving ground for Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI). The network includes a partnership of SEA's and local education agencies that make possible a controlled IPI strategy and a demonstration of IPI programs to the educational community. In addition, network schools serve as training centers for administrators who wish to bring individualization to their districts. One of these schools, the Lake Park Elementary School, is the subject of this case study. The school enrolls 619 children and is located in an area peopled in  equal parts by farmers, skilled or semi-skilled factory workers, and upper middle class professionals. Desegregation mandates had previously spurred the school district towards efforts to assess needs, evaluate existing schools and classrooms, and assess the problems associated with the move from desegregation (physical placement of humans) to integration (equal opportunities.) This paper explores the 4-way partnership that resulted between the school, the county school district, the Georgia State Department, and RBS in implementing an IPI program at Lake Park.

These indicators include measures of literacy, school retention rates, and test results for college entrance board examinations. An indicator of need for additional training after conventional education is included in the selected list. Other measures of outcome center on education as a \"preparation for life\" and  analyze the effects of the instruction process on earnings, unemployment, and occupational pursuits. Still other measures, in a longer time frame, look at the process in terms of its feedback payoffs to future generations of learners. (Author/JF)",

According to the report, an accused is due notice of his shortcomings and an opportunity to appear and face his accusers. Further, the accused, in most instances, is entitled to counsel, to a fair and impartial hearing, and the right to appeal his case to other authority. (Author/JF)",

The time period is characterized by both unprecedented effort to produce change and slow change in the schools. The study asked how this could be. Talcott Parson's hierarchy of levels; Charles Perrow's notion of goals, technology, and structure; and Kirst and Walker's assumption that curriculum decisionmaking was &quot;political,&quot; were used to conceptualize and stabilize the data as curriculum development was traced through the time period. The study findings revealed that change occurred in small ways in individual classrooms -- by policy decision and by organizational &quot;drift.&quot;  Change and financial resources were found to be related. School system resources were used for &quot;maintenance&quot; of the system; few resources were left for innovation. The advent of federal funding (NDEA, Vocational Education Act of 1963) brought additional funds, which permitted the curriculum change that the Gary school system could not bring about with its own limited resources.

By field observation and interview, the author examined how alternative schools change the conventional patterns of hierarchy, formality, and the press to achieve; the assumptions students hold about the proper means and ends of education; and how any discrepancies between school demands and student assumptions are reflected in student behavior. The author challenges the assumption that alternative schools can establish socialization patterns oriented toward constructive social change merely by transforming the conventional institutional context. He asserts that socialization settings do not have uniform effects and that, if learning  environments are to be designed so as to be capable of nurturing students' sense of personal efficacy, the range of assumptions that students bring with them should be acknowledged. In addition, any conceptualization of an \"alternative\" socialization process needs to go beyond an either/or reaction to the status quo and address the relationship between the internal context of an alternative school and the larger society.

The federal role in education should be one of stimulation and leadership, rather than one of meddling in State affairs. Proposed new federal legislation, therefore, aims at the consolidation of several existing educational grant programs concerned primarily with education for the disadvantaged and handicapped children, and with vocational education and supporting services. Such consolidation should free States and localities from many restrictions that now inhibit their decisionmaking powers. In interpreting this and other educational legislation, the courts should bear in mind that the underlying  issues of public education in America are broadly social in nature, and that there are still many unknowns in the educational area. Such issues should be approached prudently and with caution. (Author/WM)",

In Lausanne, the concurrence of lengthening students' years in school with a rise in the school population created a need for 10 schools to be constructed between 1965 and 1975. Four architects agreed to collaborate to develop a rationalized system of building schools. Educators and architects actively participated in a study to define the spatial requirements, furniture, and equipment for, and the environmental needs of, modern teaching methods. The study resulted in an exhaustive brief  of the architectural, technical, and financial requirements that would be basic to all new Lausanne schools.

Initial identification of handicapped children is seen to be presently accomplished through three procedures -- census, screening, and referral. Information on assessment and placement is given by handicapping conditions under the following four categories: personnel involved in the evaluation (whether a psychologist is required), the types of data utilized in  making the placement (such as school history and testing), the placement process (often involving a placement committee, parental consent, and an appeal process), and placement review procedures. Information is given for the following handicapping conditions: blind, deaf, emotionally disturbed, gifted and talented, hard of hearing, homebound and hospitalized, learning disabled, mentally handicapped, (custodial, educable, and trainable), multiply handicapped, physically handicapped, and speech handicapped.

Another alternative is given to be the special district which concentrates on the delivery of a specific education service.

Procedures are explained for student referral and program admittance through interviews and criteria based grading. Included in the color coded program description are requirements for students' assessments with 20 preskill tests ranging in difficulty from a simple test of color discrimination and shape perception to tests with sheltered workshop standards, such as a packaging exerciseinvolving visual and verbal instructions and identification of two from three dimensional  representations. The unit on job sampling and simulated production is said to require students' integration of individual skills to complete 12 monitored and evaluated tests, such as cable clamp assembly or working cooperatively in assembling objects on a line. Given for the unit work program are directions, objectives, materials required, and evaluative procedures for five units in areas such as maid service or custodial training. Included are summaries of tests which are administered after retesting on preskill tests, and procedures for developing a formal evaluation report which is sent to vocational rehabilitation or institutional placement for the student's appropriate employment. Other considerations involve a token economy program after the job sampling phase, and results of  studies on reliability and validity of the tests.

An introduction to the papers gives an overview of behavior modification. The two papers of Part I present two approaches to stuttering therapy, one of which is based on operant conditioning and the other on two-factor learning theory. Part II provides a detailed account of an operant program and also an analysis of how one therapist scrutinized and described his own unique therapy in terms of learning theory. The two approaches are evaluated in three papers of Part III which consider the whole person in the modification of stuttering behavior; problems of definition, measurement, and analysis in behavioral approaches to stuttering; and the  question of how behavior modification can be integrated into psychotherapy; respectively. The final part consists of a commentary which notes differences among participants over definition, levels of awareness, and measurement. Also included is a glossary of behavior modification terms.

A therapy plan and other information is given for each of the three clients. Therapy is described week by week for each client individually as well as in group activities. Explained are therapy goals such as increased self understanding, the breaking of habit patterns, \"fluent stuttering\", the reduction of speech avoidance behaviors, and analysis by the client of  stuttering blocks. Significant changes in the attitudes, understanding, and behavior of the three stutterers is reported. Also noted is the reaction of the clinical fellows that the experience at the institute would greatly effect their work with stutterers and student clinicians. (DB)",

Considered is the difficult developmental stage in late childhood and early adolescence when children begin to assert their roles as individuals and often have no adult model other than the friendly disc jockey; and offered as a replacement for the contemporary media model are heroes in literature. The hero in literature is discussed in terms of folk literature and mythology, and outlined is a sample unit on Greek mythical heroes. Examined in relation to the Faust theme are legends, historical eras, and modern versions (such as \"Rosemary's Baby\"). Such aspects of the Prometheus theme as lack of understanding, the Promethean legend,  Prometheus as scientist, and as prototype are discussed. Portrayed in three case studies to show how schools influence adjustment of the gifted are students such as David, whose fifth grade teacher-rescuer recognized his need to learn in a manner different from his classmates and described him as \"a cat of another stripe who must learn to blend in with his surroundings, but only after his stripes have been recognized as valuable\". Under the teacher's management, David learned to temper his histrionics sufficiently to write, act a major role in, and manage many details for two musicals; and later, became a promising college student with potential for achievement as actor, producer, singer, or television performer.

Recommended for followup is a screening team's feedback of results to regular teachers for program planning or observation of children, to specialists for intermediate evaluation and decision, and to outside support systems, such as physicians or agencies. Support system mechanisms (such as inservice teacher workshops, specialist consultation, or resource rooms) are described, and considered are reasons for and approaches to program evaluation. (MC)",

In the first paper, research is cited to show that current educational programs do not adequately exploit children's potential, and that child centered programs which ignore family/community influence do not significantly influence children's adjustment and achievement. Recommended among supports for families is establishment of a National Institute on the Family, which might compile research, foster advocacy groups, or lobby for family agencies and programs. Described next is a language research/demonstration training program, in which training of 40 retarded children, 16- to 36-months-old, begins with primitive and moves in stages to complex language use, and parents are taught to train their  children. In the third paper, the author uses the Pennsylvania and other court cases to describe use of litigation for achieving access to education for all retarded children, for creating new forums, for raising new questions for public discourse, and for redressing grievances. Considered in the last paper are needs of incapacitated older adults, and of older retarded adults who are about to lose a parental figure or parental support. Suggested for serving the older population are a monitoring system to begin with younger handicapped persons and continue with lifelong followup, and a comprehensive protective service program in the community mental health center.

Described are researchers/teachers relationships, behavioral modification techniques taught to parents to reinforce their children's learning while at home, and program effectiveness. The etiologies of the 12 delayed children are said to include Down's syndrome, hydrocephalus, and brain injury. Classroom procedures, schedules (for two separate classes for younger and older children, four days per week), and activities (such as teacher giving directions which the child imitates with physical aid from  parent or other teacher who sits behind child), are discussed. Presented in a lattice schema are the five sequential general curriculum areas of behavioral control, motor development, imitation, discrimination and classification, and language training. It is said that the third year's focus will be on social and self-help skills. Emphasized are independent walking procedures and expressive vocabulary training. Reported in five research studies are an operant approach to assessing toddlers' hearing acuity, an evaluation of new assessment instruments in the areas of receptive and expressive vocabulary, a comparison of receptive vocabulary skills in delayed and nondelayed toddlers, evaluation of a modified fading procedure in discrimination learning of delayed children, and the reliability  and validity of a parental teaching style assessment scale.

It is said that students formerly in special classes have been integrated in many regular classrooms and that the trend is for only students below the educable level to continue in self contained classrooms. The responses are based on the following interview topics: personal data, child related difficulties with integration; teacher related difficulties with integration, the ideal person to help with integration, the ideal educational program, and university course content. Some of the responses indicate that teachers frequently mentioned  characteristics such as aggressiveness or social maladjustment as deterrents to appropriate functioning of special students in regular classrooms, and that teachers used behavioral modification techniques, and were enthusiastic about integration (provided supplementary support such as teacher teaming, and resource rooms continued). Other findings indicate that administrators preferred teachers with regular and special class experience to help with integration, whereas teachers preferred a crisis teacher knowledgeable about children's social-emotional difficulties; that both teachers and administrators liked a nongraded approach; and that administrators desired inclusion of two special education courses in university teacher programs, whereas teachers desired courses in remedial reading,  social-emotional problems, and educational programing.

Described for the first year of the program is formative evaluation of reading materials, all of which were presented by the computer. The second year is explained to have been devoted to converting from the CAI mode to computer managed instruction in which only periodic testing was done by computer while off-line instruction was provided by lesson booklets. The entire system of supplementary instruction is said to have been presented without the computer during the third year. Following are some  of the conclusions of the program: additional materials on word attack skills were found necessary, EMR students appeared to need even more repetition and drill than originally thought, significant gains were demonstrated by the 40 students for whom complete data were available, and students who took more time in responding to test items on the computer tended to demonstrate more gains in objectives passed on the posttest.

Evaluation is reported to have been by the collection and analysis of biographical, educational, and pretest data for both program participants and matched controls, as well  as by the analysis of data from advisor, teacher, and student rating scales; the Watson-Glaser Appraisal of Critical Thinking; and the student grade point average. The acquisition of skills and attitudes necessary for independent study is reported to have been strongly supported by the data, though the attainment of the critical thinking and the conceptual understanding objectives were not supported by the data.

The areas were textbook format, math and science, music notation, computer notation, and maps, charts, and diagrams. Problems in each of the areas were identified and defined by committees of experts.

From the analyses it was concluded that a massive, short-term research assault on all of the problems was not feasible. However, a large number of problems were found which could be resolved within three to four years. The basic strategy for resolving these problems was group judgment or consensus. The number of persons needed for the effort was three to four. An application  for a grant to study the problems was prepared. (Author)",

The guides are said to be based on a philosophy that demands society's acceptance of retarded and handicapped persons, and are designed to prepare personnel through preservice or inservice education to serve handicapped persons during and after integration into society. It is expected that a national, voluntary registration scheme for programs meeting minimum standards will be established which will enable certified graduates to move from province to province. Included in Level I are nine curriculum units which address the normalization  principle in services to the handicapped; identification, causation, and prevention of mental retardation; learning and development; behavioral management; observational techniques and report writing; human relations; planning for daily and social life; applied activities in recreation/leisure; and health maintenance and basic pharmacology. Eight curriculum units in Level II treat applications of the normalization principle, specialization areas (child development, residential, vocational, and community support services), learning and development, independent living skills, effective communication, teaching strategies, social psychology, and programing and behavioral management. Each unit usually contains components dealing with competencies, academic content, practical content,  resources, and films. Included are a glossary, and addresses of national and provincial associations for the mentally retarded. (For related information see EC 032 373). (MC)",

Detailed are findings from clinician completed questionnaires in regard to available space and physical structure factors which deter a child from hearing, seeing, or acquiring language in individual schools, mobile speech and hearing units. Some of the results given indicate that in 1969-1970, 1,259 of Florida's 1,854 schools served 32,523 children with therapy; that only 64 of 342 schools built after 1960 had facilities for language, speech, and hearing therapy; and that most clinicians used the library conference room or other inadequate areas, such as the custodian's storage area.  Appended are examples of the three questionnaires. Planning processes are described in terms of the planners and the format for writing specifications for instructional programs and ancillary services. Included are specifications for housing language, speech, and hearing programs in Florida's public schools; for a language, speech, and hearing facility serving 50,000 school age children with evaluations, diagnostic therapy, and inservice education; for facilities to house preschool programs for children with severe language disorders; and for mobile unit design. Typically included in a specification is a program description, and analyses of needs in relation to space, equipment, furniture, special considerations, and space relationships.

        "description":"Prescriptive teaching was reported to be the subject of an institute (August 1972) which showed teachers how to use a conceptual model of the learning system, how to help children develop self concept so as to overcome maladaptive behavior, and how to write educational procedures for individualized instruction. The conceptual model was described in terms of a road map for building skills in movement, vision, audition, language, communication and mathematics. The model also was used to show how a child collects information about his environment through eight modes (the five senses, feeling, saying, and moving), and processes the information through perceptual, conceptual, and cognitive integration for performance of specific activities. Suggested for teachers were six basic  prescriptive tools, such as observing the child in a learning situation, or analyzing tasks to determine behavioral objectives. Discussed were the child's external environment (a fight at home when the child got up was given as an example of cause for later disruptive behavior), the child's internal environment (such as hearing and seeing), learning centers, and task analysis (questions were posed in relation to each task). A case study of Tom, who was 13-years-old, appeared older, functioned at fourth grade level in mathematics, and frequently displayed anger, was discussed to show how the teacher could determine a child's needs (through vision tests or specific tasks), and help the child develop good self concept. Included is a \"progress pathway\" which contains approximately six to 35  prescriptive tasks for each of the areas of learning readiness; basic skills for learning; recall, language, thinking, and reading skills; mathematics; attitudes; and behavior.

One type involved amount of variation and repetition of exemplars; the other, strength of feedback. A researcher presented tasks to 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, simulating a computer graphic display. The stimuli involved two-dimensional vectors, and the subjects' responses were identifications of points in two-space. Responses were input to a computer and feedback provided to subjects, with subsequent graphic demonstration of correct responses. Criteria were: a) number of responses to reach two successive correct answers during learning; b) immediate post-test performance; and c) performance on a delayed post-test. Evaluation noted some  minor differences during learning, particularly with respect to response latency. No significant differences were noted on immediate post-tests, but delayed post-test data suggested an optimal level for both types of redundancy and also an interaction effect, which in turn suggests there is an optimal combination of the two types.

Starting in 1969 a three year Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III grant provided initial support: 1) for the selection and training of staff in the philosophy underlying individualized instruction; 2) for the development of learning activity packages (LAP) which allowed students to select topics and learning styles, to make individual commitments with teachers, and to participate in curriculum development and evaluation and the design of the systems needed to manage the LAPs in the classroom. By  1972 over 100 staff were trained and 90% of the basic curriculum relied upon LAPs. Evaluation showed that the project successfully developed positive student attitudes toward self, teachers, education, and school. Results from the Test of Academic Progress (TAP) indicated that an individualized program based upon LAPs maintained a level of achievement comparable to that of other schools in the district.

However, since recovery from interference depended on the nature of the intervening information received by the subject, it seemed to follow that the memory code was subject to task demands and under the subject's control. Other data showed that proactive interference depended partly on long-term processes  and was due to retrieval difficulties. Some of the experiments were preliminary attempts to develop techniques for studying the attributes of memory, such as by testing the subject for his memory of particular properties of the stimulus, for example, the modality in which it was presented.

        "description":"Despite the fact that the television industry has made some progress away from its totally white orientation, the industry as a whole still has a long way to go before it can be said to afford fair treatment to blacks. More blacks must gain access to the centers of power--such as the Federal Communications Commission--from which change emanates, and the networks must provide greatly improved opportunities for minority employment in responsible positions. Secondly, television, through its entertainment programing and its function as a new medium, must present a more accurate picture of grassroots black America in order to help blacks build better self-images and to provide whites with a better understanding of blacks. Finally, Congress must begin to use its power, particularly  through the authorization of funds for public television, in ways which will encourage attention to the needs and accomplishments of black Americans.

The BC argued that they were entitled to time balance coverage given to the President, based upon; 1) The Constitution's requirement of a balance of separate powers; 2) the FCC's fairness doctrine; 3) the right to free speech; and 4) the public interest. The networks replied they were entitled to control controversial programing, that they presented opposing views, and that the fairness doctrine guaranteed presentation of opposing viewpoints, not the appearance of particular individuals. The FCC  affirmed the network's discretionary powers, concurred that the fairness doctrine was issue-oriented and did not give access rights to individuals, and ruled that separation of powers did not imply free access to broadcast time for Congressmen. No ruling was made on the free speech issue since it was being argued in another case before the Supreme Court. (LB)",

The discussion is intended to stimulate thought about an instructional system as a computer-assisted instructional (CAI) test-bed and to point out some noteworthy laboratory research results, particularly in cognitive psychology. Following this, parts of CAI projects underway at the Behavioral Technology Laboratories are described in relation to instructional system elements to give an overview of this research. Among these is work on computer graphics to: 1) simulate front-panel topography and functional organization of circuits; 2) facilitate interpretation of relative motion; and 3) create visual analogies for abstract concepts and processes to serve as the basis for  students to develop their own internal representations. Other projects involve work on methods for recording cortical evoked potentials and correlating them with learning and memory processes, development of a dynamic programing model for adaptive control of problem-solving types of CAI, and work on three-dimensional mock-ups of electronic equipment to be placed on-line with a CAI system.

It sought: 1) to identify instructional objectives for various curricula and grade levels; 2) to develop a pool of test items to measure attainment of objectives; 3) to design a computer system for the storage and retrieval of items; 4) to conduct in-service teacher training for system usage; 5) to improve instruction in the participating schools; and 6) to disseminate information about the project. More than 32,000 instructional objectives and test items were developed, stored in a computer system on magnetic tape, and made available to teachers. More than 400 teachers were familiarized with the system.  Finally, an inexpensive and simple telephone-mail communication system was devised. Participating students showed marked academic achievement. The system was found to need a complete sets of materials for continuous usage to allow faster selection, communication, and retrieval of material, and teachers needed to gain user experience. In addition, less specific objectives for group instruction should be developed, and the appropriateness of test items for particular objectives must be validated.

Researchers postulated requirements for a learning system, developed a self-instructional system based on them, and implemented a pilot system. The system, Audiographic Learning Facility (ALF), consists of a Memory for storing and transmitting materials to learners, guided by a Preceptor. The learner exercises on-line control and other control by interposing a human tutor between himself and Preceptor. Scheduled and on-demand modes are available to groups or individuals. The semiotic content of Memory has been defined, a model of the self-instructional process developed, units of learning materials specified, Preceptor elements  identified, and a physical facility implemented. Ithas been found that: 1) the learning units are superior to live instruction; 2) an index to structure and content can be devised; 3) self-diagnosis testing and revision are feasible; 4) the system is economical; and 5) students and teacher reaction is favorable. Given this, one can perceive a self-instructional system involving a vendor supplying learning systems, a tutor guiding learners, and a learner who interacts with the vendor's system. (LB)",

This paper examines the problems inherent in providing CAI to scattered groups so that accurate estimates of the costs of different technologies (including satellites) which could deliver CAI to dispersed populations can be made and so that, on the basis of these costs, educators can make decisions about the allocation of their resources. The paper first outlines a CAI system capable of reaching dispersed populations without excessive costs (i.e., the system requires only 110 bits per second communications capability for each student terminal). This makes the service economically feasible. Next, models of several communications alternatives for the  system are provided. The results of this modeling constitute approximate minimum cost communication designs for many configurations of population dispersal. Finally, some basic economic trade-offs and implementation alternatives are described which are relevant to educators who must decide whether or not to use CAI for certain student populations.

In the new method, certain initial conditions are established randomly by the computer program and the student generates data to ascertain the unknown quantity, just as if he were measuring on a real system. The procedure is as follows: 1) The computer randomly generates a system parameter which the student must evaluate. The value is stored unrevealed to the  student. 2) The computer generates data based upon the unknown constant, student determined input values, and the prepared simulation program. 3) The student uses the data to determine the unknown. 4) Finally, the student compares his derived value with the stored value.

        "description":"An audiotutorial approach to problem-solving in college chemistry relying upon audio tapes is available. The program is designed to increase the teacher's effectiveness by providing individualized attention to student difficulties related to problem-solving. Problem solutions are recorded on audio tapes (designed for use with Sony TC-160 cassettes or Sony TC-630 reels) and accompanying notes presenting visual and written material are prepared. The following topics are covered: units and conversion factors, weights, equations and stoichiometry, reactions, solutions, gases, equilibrium, solubility product calculations, acids and bases, ionic solutions, energetics, thermodynamics, galvanic cells and electrodes, dynamics, kinetics, nuclear chemistry, and radioactivity. The individual  units are arbitrarily arranged but within units there is an ascending order of problem complexity and the units are structured to teach chemistry rather than problem-solving per se. These units are not designed as a priori introductions to problem solutions; students are first expected to do required reading and attempt to solve problems on their own, using the tapes for review and for tutorial assistance on troublesome matters.

Computers are heavily utilized, removing the need for mathematics prerequisites and clearing the way for the examination of relatively sophisticated problems. Synthesizers are employed to translate formulae into sounds and to create opportunities for broad experimentation in music theory, perception, and composition. Both techniques open up possibilities for independent study by students interested in programing, recording techniques, analysis of musical instruments, digital  and analog electronics, computer-based composition, the aesthetics of Lissajous patterns, and other topics.

        "description":"Two evaluative efforts sought to assess the educational impact of computer applications in the social science curriculum. Questionnaires were administered to groups of students: 1) who either had just finished a section of a Principles of Sociology course at Oberlin College which dealt with computer-based research techniques in the social sciences; or 2) who had taken the section from one to three semesters earlier. The majority of both groups regarded the computer research material positively and felt it should be retained in the course. The skills learned were put to use in this and other courses, and the research curriculum increased the students' understanding of empirical literature. Responses to the questionnaires indicated that the students needed greater exposure to the  discipline in order to handle data competently, that such exposure should be coupled with practical experience in empirical research projects, and that ways need to be developed to utilize in upper level courses the skills learned in the introductory course. Nevertheless, the overall conclusion was that the computer-based research curriculum was an important and well-received component of an introductory sociology course. (Author/LB)",

First, there is an educator on every station's staff. Five hundred series a year, involving 4000 various programs, are offered, and audiences are large and educational efforts still growing. Second, there is a partnership between education and broadcasting. Teachers work with stations and stations cooperate with teacher training institutions and Teachers' Centers. Third, local programing dominates. The School Broadcasting Council for the United Kingdom vests responsibility for programing in Local Education Panels; local needs are assessed and programs directed at them. Fourth, benefits to the classroom derive from  bringing voices from the community to students, by allowing children to express their opinions on familiar topics, and by showing students the outside world. Fifth, adult education is served because students are attracted to programs of which they were previously unaware. All in all, the BBC Local Radio effort helps technology to serve eduation. It is accessible to the public, blurs the distinction between producer and user, and fosters the belief that radio is a facility to be used by the community. (PB)",

These are: 1) content and instructional strategy are independent; 2) most courses involve two types of content--concepts and operations; 3) two levels of abstraction are involved--generalities and instances; 4) four levels of behavior are most common--discriminated recall, classification, rule using, and rule finding; and 5) instructional strategies should focus upon rule using and rule finding, based on mastery models derived from needs and goals. Task analysis consists of content analysis and instructional analysis. Content analysis requires that the analyst: 1) identify and define the concepts in an area; 2) determine and specify the change operations used to relate them; 3)  symbolically represent each role; and 4) identify instances for concepts and rules. Instructional analysis should recognize that higher education stresses cognitive transfer behavior and should order content to achieve such behaviors. Four steps are needed: 1) the identification of needs and goals; 2) the specification of a mastery model; 3) the specification of rule using and rule finding situations; and 4) the sequencing of required concepts and operations from the content network.

It sought to improve their reading ability so they could read and understand new vocabulary words with 80% accuracy, read with increased expression and fluency, comprehend new content and, by transfer, to produce improvement in their language arts and math abilities. One hundred and sixty-five lessons were developed, running from the primer to third-grade levels. The students listened to tapes and watched filmstrips which were prepared by teachers and which introduced new vocabulary. Next they heard a story read on tape, following along in their text. Then, new words were reviewed, followed by worksheet activities and a supplementary story on tape. Pupils then read the  stories they previously heard onto audio tapes, which were then evaluated by teachers. Final evaluation indicated the objectives were achieved. Post-testing with the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the Lorge-Thorndike I.Q. Test showed an average gain in I.Q. scores of 17.43 points and the following average gains in achievement (expressed in years of gain): Word Knowledge 1.3, Word Discrimination 1.2, Reading Comprehension 1.9, Spelling 1.7, Language 2.9, Arithmetic Computation 1.9, and Arithmetic Problem Solving 1.5.

        "description":"During the present decade cable television (CATV) systems will be franchised in most metropolitan areas of the nation. Previously, CATV has mainly transmitted over-the-air broadcast signals to small communities, but in the urban setting the capabilities of wideband cable (e.g., 30 channels per cable) can be expanded and applied to new communication needs. First, however, CATV must outgrow its identity as a retransmitter and become the medium for delivering a wide range of broadband communications services. Linked with computers, interactive cable systems can serve social, cultural, civic, education, governmental, business and commercial interests. The utility and importance of interactive CATV systems stem from the following characteristics: 1) they are individualized and respond  instantly, privately, and economically to the user's needs; 2) they are computerized, offering search and calculation capabilities otherwise not available; 3) they provide unlimited points of entry and delivery of information, in addition to controlled storage, access, and retrieval; and 4) they are multimedia, encompassing video, audio, graphics, pictures, and alphanumeric text, and offer the potential of a common carrier between people.

SPATS simplifies the problem of experimentally creating and analyzing a variety of populations and of selecting and analyzing different kinds of random samples, together with individual data and summary statistics. SPATS is also used by students to carry out statistical experiments to prove theorems, similar to experiments used in chemistry to prove Boyle's and Charles' laws. Although experience with this application of computers is limited, results to date indicate that computer assisted statistical experiments will be a major breakthrough in the process of providing students with a  real understanding of basic statistical principles and theorems. Research is continuing on the problem of sharpening and testing the tools of SPATS so as to make them more feasible for undergraduate classroom use. (Author/PB)",

CLEF is intended for students at all levels of proficiency and provides an opportunity for flexible, self-directed study. These CAI programs in music theory, fundamentals, and Greek theory are collateral to coursework, are usually recommended rather than required, are available to all students, and are organized to permit the student to take what he wants when he desires it. Future  developments may permit CAI programs to teach harmonization, voice leading, cadence formulae, and compositional concepts; in addition, scores may be displayed, problem solving will be possible with APL, and electronic music can be studied using a FORTRAN-based program. To maximize CAI contributions, however, it will be necessary to overcome the assumptions that CAI must be programed instruction (which, additionally, is &quot;friendly&quot; to students), and that the computer is going to replace the teacher.

In addition to providing training for students interested in computer-related careers, the department, by offering courses for non-majors in the field, can broaden the perspective of the student by informing him about the computer, its functions, and its social significance. Another function of the department is to integrate the computer into other disciplines so that these fields may use it for information storage and retrieval, simulation, and computation. Computer-assisted instructional programs and user-oriented program libraries are two other services which the computer science staff can provide.  Finally, the department can serve as the focal point around which a critical mass of computer oriented people from other disciplines can meet to develop interdisciplinary programs. To accomplish all this, the small college will most likely have to join a computer network in order to be able to afford the advantages of large machines. (PB)",

The second and third sections seek instances in other contexts and apply them in concrete situations. Initially, the course will be  taught at the elementary, secondary, and graduate school levels to groups of about 15 students, for two 2-hour periods a week. Qualitative evaluation will be gathered from student feedback, protocol analysis, and observation; quantitative assessment will be deferred until later.

The system first administers a diagnostic test in arithmetic which locates the individual's weaknesses and prescribes modules directed at them; students pass through the modules and are post-tested on each. The process is repeated for algebra. Each module consists of a learning packet with: a description of the material to be learned a pre-test with answers, learning objectives and activities to reach them, a video-taped lecture, notes and  supplementary materials, and a post-test. Since the tapes are on call, the student can schedule himself, proceed at his own pace, repeat material when necessary, and concentrate on his weakness. Instructors are freed from classroom lectures, and are able to provide individual attention to students. In addition, the learning packets are easily developed and can be made available to other institutions. Due to these advantages, this mode of instruction should be widely adopted. (PB)",

Subject matter is increasingly being prepared for a  random-access information retrieval system known as the Program Yielding Rapid Access Major Information Devices (PYRAMID). PYRAMID consists of a series of audio and visual storage and playback systems and a mini-computer control unit. The computerized Surveillance System keeps a master file on each student, recording his completion of learning package activities, evaluating what he has learned, and providing daily and weekly printouts on each individual's progress. Weekly meetings between a student and his advisor allow professors to monitor student progress and provide help as needed. (PB)",

        "description":"An evaluation of the videotapes produced by the film/media workshop, held in the South Bronx area of New York City in the summer of 1972, was conducted. The workshop sought to broaden the communication skills and improve the self-concepts and aspirations of educationally and emotionally deprived black and Puerto Rican youngsters. Three groups of students were taught to make tapes; two tapes of each group were evaluated by 20 raters on film technique, the communication of useful content, and the generation of new ideas and feelings. The quality of film techniques was rated highest, followed by content value and the communication of ideas. This was regarded as logical since technical skills are learned more readily than the abstract ability of how to convey feelings, ideas, and  facts. Inter-film, inter-group and intra-group differences in quality were noted, perhaps due to the individual topics selected. It was concluded that the overall project achieved its basic goals. (PB)",

To test the effectiveness of an audio-tutorial system designed to provide instruction in information retrieval and selection through actual search problems, 60 students in the 6th grade were divided into two groups; one group used the system, the other did not. The differences between these two groups were assessed. Results showed that those students who had participated in the system had more favorable attitudes toward the library and did better on a subsequent  posttest of their library searching skills.

Since the focus is limited to teaching and learning situations involving information transmission, audiovisual devices used to provide aesthetic and affective experiences are excluded. Nine chapters deal with: 1) current conceptions of the role of audiovisual devices in learning; 2) the implications of research on audiovisual devices for the design of learning situations; 3) the relative efficiency of auditory and visual transmissions  of information and studies of multi-modality transmission; 4) the mechanics of the transmission of information in the central nervous system; 5) the perceptual system as a single channel system; 6) channel switching; 7) concept learning; 8) attention; and 9) a model for information transmission by means of audiovisual materials.

The first involves language standardization and deciding what form of the language will be taught. The criteria of understanding and communication are involved and such features as pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, punctuation, syllabification, and grammar have varying degrees of importance with respect to these criteria. The second basic issue is the relationship between the national language and the regional language. Should the national language be taught as a first language or as a second language? If the regional language is quite similar to the national language, the differences between the two might be underestimated or ignored: there is a risk that  instruction in the national language may be regarded as merely a process of correcting usage in the regional language.

Defining dissimilation as the process which occurs when twosegments in the same word share the same phonetic features and one of the segments, usually the second of the pair, causes the other to either change one or more of its phonetic features or to be deleted, the author cites several examples of phonetic and morphophonemic dissimilation.

The role of logic is diminished according to such a theory because inference has no real logical content. Meaning must be studied with respect to the actual usage of the speaker. Linguistics must encompass a procedure for making explicit the information that is implicit in certain sentences, and it must allow for the possibility of mistakes and mistaken inferences in speech. Linguistic theory must deal with the way humans use language and the facts of language use. (VM)",

Applying Piaget's and other psychologists' ideas concerning conceptual schemata and cognitive development, and Halliday's (1970) method for analyzing meaning in language to the taped utterances of seven children, the author notes patterns in the developing use of clause types by the children. The author suggests, having cited parallels between  cognitive development and language development, that what is required is a detailed investigation of the strategies that children employ in their attempts to comprehend and convey the meaning intentions that are coded in speech.

Curriculum designed by and for the various white ethnic cultures very seldom prepares black students to handle issues and to relate effectively to members of the black community. Methods, textbooks, and materials are still overwhelmingly \"white\" in spite of studies in black heritage. Black students on white campuses also face the difficulty of being evaluated fairly for their work. Standards of grading are either lowered or raised to the detriment of the black students. White institutions have made little attempt to provide an adequate program for transition and adjustment into the white university world for black students. Counseling services neither understand nor  are sensitive to the needs of blacks on campus. Black students should be apprised of the situation at white colleges as it really is, and decide which institution is best for them--a black institution that may be having survival problems, or a white institution where blacks must undertake the responsibility of evolving the institution into a multiracial, pluralistic academic community.

The  survey instrument was a questionnaire sent to a sample group of 302 institutions offering graduate degrees. From the data provided, 153 responses could be calculated. Results include: (1) between 80 and 110 of the institutions have specifically designed policies or procedures aimed at meeting the needs of minority/disadvantaged students at the graduate level; (2) most activities for minority/disadvantaged students have taken place at the undergraduate level; and (3) there is little coordination between departments and graduate admissions to attract minority/disadvantaged students.

        "description":"The most commonly-used procedure in selective college admissions involves selecting students on the basis of predicted college grades computed from the regression of college grades on test scores and high school grades. Minority students have usually fared poorly in the selective admissions process and, consequently, the possibility of bias in selective admission procedures is apparent. The authors examine the six different ideas of bias in selection, analyze data from racial-ethnic minority students and majority students from 35 colleges, and discuss the implications of their study. The results indicate that models of bias with theoretical differences yield practical differences when applied to selective college admissions. The different value judgments the models enforce is of  great importance to those implementing selection procedure since the choice of procedure in most cases dramatically affects the judgments of fairness or bias. College admissions personnel should give consideration to the relation of selection procedures to the values and goals of their colleges. (Author/PG)",

Recommendations suggest: (1) that EPDA continue to support institute programs to provide training, (2) that the Office of Education consider fellowship aid upon actual subsequent employment in relevant roles in higher education, (3) that EPDA program offices gather and process evaluative data in a more effective and economical manner than in the past, and (4) that the Office of Education expand its existing program of manpower-projection modeling.

Two major types of alternatives are presented to the typical departmental organization: (1) replacing departments with functional organizations, and (2) adding other structures to the typical college that combine departments in terms of variables such as their resource utilization, staffing patterns, instructional, missions, etc.  (Author)",

The characteristics of the delivery system implemented to transmit the instruction are of primary consideration in the design of such programs, since these characteristics interact in delimiting student population, instructional methods, and program goals. This paper investigates the feasibility of various kinds of instructional delivery systems, with specific reference to the effectiveness of four different systems currently being pilot-tested at the University of Pittsburgh.

The first section on teaching addresses itself to the broad-gauged consideration of teaching, including such topics as innovation, the modern student, and learning theories. The fifteen papers in section two speak in specifics about curricular and course design and instructional techniques. The third section contains papers presented at a conference titled &quot;Faculty Development: Evaluating  Teaching&quot; sponsored by the ITG. The major goal of these papers was to consider and define the parameters of evaluating classroom instruction for the improvement of learning and for the professional advancement of the faculty.

In an effort to shed some light on the problems involved, five questions are posed and answers attempted. These questions are: (1) Is it constitutionally permissible for a state to charge higher tuition for nonresidents than for residents? (2) Can a state have an arbitrary period of nonresidency? (3) What of a provision that a student can obtain residency classification only by becoming a nonstudent for a period of time? (4) What of a provision that a student, once classified as a nonresident, can never gain residency classification? (5) Assuming that a state can classify according to residency, what factors can be  considered in making that determination? The author concludes that the classification of resident and nonresident must be based upon some logical criteria; the classification cannot be arbitrary. (Author/MJM)",

As there is no alternative to further increases in aid to higher education from the Federal government, higher education institutions must take note of the leverage this will provide to the government. Since many values in higher education are dependent upon institutional autonomy (academic freedom, quality, and diversity), institutions must identify their goals upon which they will stand without compromise to protect their autonomy. Institutions must protect their principles realistically against all sources of funds. An additional threat to institutional goals and priorities may be the establishment of a national department of education that could subordinate  education to the State. (Author/PG)",

Ultimate goals were to design ways in which relations between universities and their communities may be enriched. UUIP studied activities in five representative areas: Communications, Minority and Community Services, Campus Development, Long-Range Community Goals, and University Governance for Community Relations. The goal of Communications was to explore the perceptions of the University held by its various publics and to suggest ways to communicate a more realistic impression. In Minority and Community Services, four projects were chosen and each project was to publish analyses of the interactions among the university, the  community, and the target group. In Campus Development, UUIP researchers attempted to identify the consequences of campus expansion. The aim of Long-Range Community Goals was to establish a reliable system for identifying the community's long-range goals, and the University's relation to these goals. In University Governance for Community Relations, data from the other four efforts were integrated to make recommendations on ways of improving the University's community relations. Major conclusions cover six basic issues: (1) the service dimension; (2) models of institutions; (3) internal organization; (4) open access and mass education; (5) collaboration and community/constituencies; and (6) academic excellence and the urban dimension.

The return to investments in higher education for a sample of individuals is estimated with specific cost data for each college attended by the respondents. Results show that the variation in investment costs among colleges is an important determinant of earnings. In addition, the estimated rates of return to schooling are lower when all costs are considered, than when years of schooling is used as a proxy for all investment costs. This supports the hypothesis that students with higher earning potential invest more per year of school. Finally, large differences in rates of returns on direct and indirect components of investment are observed.  (Author/MJM)",

The recreational facilities were assessed according to the use and satisfaction of facilities as stated by the students surveyed in a space facilities questionnaire, perceived needs as stated by the students, and discrepancies between existing facilities and the perceived needs. Study findings indicate: (1) a need for additional recreational space in the form of simple decentralized recreational rooms close to the various hubs of commuting student educational activities; (2) a need for improved campus communications regarding recreational organizations and events; (3) an increasing importance of indoor recreational activities with the onset of winter; and (4) the need for increased  recognition of the importance of recreational facilities.

The pattern of employment places most men in three professional ranks and over half in the top two tenured ranks alone, while less than one quarter of the women are in tenured ranks. The survey also showed a considered difference between the patterns of employment for single and for married women. Over one-third of the single women but less than one-sixth of the married women are in the tenured ranks. In most of the Illinois institutions the proportion of women either remained the same or dropped from 1970-71 to 1971-1972.

The effects of the university campus on the neighboring community and the ways in which the two interact must both be considered aspects of institutional form. Institutional form in this study is taken to mean not only the layout of buildings, but also the spatial distribution of university activities. Volume one contains a survey of the experiences of 102 urban universities with their surrounding communities. The survey provided evidence that the two factors that contribute the most university-community tension are size of the university and the city, and the distribution of the activities  in the university district of the city. The second part contains a detailed investigation of the experiences of Boston University, Temple University, and the University of Cincinnati. It was discovered that in each university tension resulted from campus expansion. Appendices include the questionnaire and survey samples, case study data sources, and the bibliography.

Section three deals with the financing of the increased costs of higher education, with increased taxation seen as the only alternative financial resource. The policy issues that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts faces as it considers the share of higher education costs to be provided are treated in section four. The mechanisms that the state should use in controlling higher  education and increasing accountability concern section five, and section six outlines equal access and its impact on institutional finance.

(2) How does the student aid program in Massachusetts compare with programs in other states? (3) What policy changes, if any, should Massachusetts make in its student aid program during the next five to ten years? (4) What should the state do this year with respect to student aid, especially student loans, that is not already being done? Student aid needs in Massachusetts are not efficiently provided for. The General Scholarship Program is funded at such a low level that only students in the most dire financial straits are supported. Massachusetts is far below the leading states in per capita  expenditure on student aid and in percentage of funds provided for administration of these programs. Recommendations for the improvement in student aid in Massachusetts include: (1) establishment of state-funded loan programs for high risk students facing access problems in getting loans; (2) establishment of a state run loan agency; (3) expansion of the scholarship program to provide greater access; and (4) careful determination on the appropriation for the scholarship program for fiscal year 1974.

Policy may take the form of legislative authorization, supported by appropriations, to establish new public institutions or programs. Policy is also made through decisions on matters such as admissions or degree requirements in public institutions. The effects of state policy are related not only to the constraints imposed and the options favored, but to the clarity of intent, the mechanism through which policy is interpreted and implemented, and the consistency of  application. Following an overview, this report discusses: state educational policy ambiguities, postsecondary education needs, economic needs of society, higher education planning, planning alternatives, coordination provisions, and budgeting as an instrument of coordination.

One barrier to minority student access is the location of the state colleges and community colleges, most of which are removed from urban centers where minority populations are concentrated. However extra effort, outreach programs, better communications, and more stringent efforts to work with high schools to improve motivation and preparation could be more important than location in giving access to minority students. The barriers that need to be eliminated to achieve access for minority students include: (1) inadequate preparation at the primary and secondary level; (2) need for special programs and supportive services to compensate for such  deficiencies; (3) lack of adequate financial means to attend college; and (4) a discouraging atmosphere for minority students at institutions of higher education. Recommendations include: (1) establishment of a Commission on Minority Access to Higher Education; (2) development of community and state colleges into access/entry points for minority students; (3) minority students should receive 40-50% of scholarship resources; and (4) support for special programs to assist minority students in preparation for college.

The original focus of the inquiry was on the Massachusetts Constitution, especially its unique Amendment 46. Amendment 46 suggests public &quot;order and superintendence&quot; of institutions receiving state aid. It bars aid for denominational schools even if under public control and for all institutions that are not both publicly &quot;owned&quot; and under the exclusive control of public officers. Also, the Amendment bars aid to schools &quot;wherein any denominational doctrine is inculcated.&quot; Thestudy showed, however, that Amendment 46 is, for a provision of law, relatively clear and  relatively well understood. It is also one-third of the way to being amended in a way that would virtually affect the subjects under view. The study also showed that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is likely to play a more important role in determining the permissibility of future Massachusetts programs than the amended Article 46. Therefore, the second part of this report is directed toward the First Amendment issues. (Author)",

Programs were selected for study mainly on the basis of size and national visibility. Results include: (1) In 1972-73 about 80% of the nation's most prestigious fellowships and awards will go to men. In some of the most competitive programs  (Guggenheim Fellowships and White House Fellows) over 90% will be held by men.

Given the significance of private gift support, it is important that all those who are concerned in the financing of higher education understand the amount, patterns, and characteristics of private philanthropy. The survey questionnaire requested 460 institutions to: (1) classify gift transactions as to more or less than $5,000; (2) classify gift transactions (cash, securities, real estate, or other property); and (3) classify bequests and deferred gifts transactions by size and form of gift received. Highlights of the survey include: (1) The total voluntary support of colleges and universities in 1970-71 is estimated at $1,860 billion. (2) All of the increase in total  support was due to increased giving by alumni and nonalumni individuals. (3) Business corporations reduced their support 5.7% in 1970-71, primarily because of lower profits. (4) The public colleges and universities reported 12.2% more support in 1970-71 than in 1969. (5) Private, 4-year institutions reported only 1.9% more support in 1970-71 than in 1969-70.

In the analysis, students are differentiated as to type and as to part-time versus full-time. It is assumed that the production and cost relationships are dependent on other measurable characteristics of the institutions; therefore, several additional variables, such as institutional quality and program mix, are included in the model. Also, separate analyses are performed for each type of institution (public and private universities, public and private comprehensive colleges, and private liberal arts colleges). The  empirical results generated by this study indicate that the frontier average and marginal relationships between the institutional input and enrollment variables are complex functions of input structures. enrollment mixes, and several institutional characteristics. This type of economic behavior is discouraging for national policy analysis, since it implies that no simple set of production relationships applies to all institutions. In addition, the results illustrate that the frontier production and cost relationships are not neutral, linear transformations of the average production behavior.

A close examination of the Ph.D. curricula of the English, Economics, and Chemistry departments at Berkeley, chosen as representative of the extremes of departmental behavior, demonstrates that requirements do differ substantially and in a way designed to affect Ph.D. production. Interviews with the doctoral students and faculty give a picture of the changes in curriculum in the last twenty years and the attitudes of both groups regarding factors perceived as affecting time to degree and attrition. The concluding section contains recommendations for university policy suggested by economic analysis. Emphasis is placed on shifts away from input measures, such as enrollment  and student credits, toward use of output measures, such as number of degrees produced. It is suggested that graduate enrollment quotas should be reduced for those departments showing excessive attrition, allocating the positions released to departments indicating a willingness to produce and an ability to place more Ph.D.'s. It is recommended that applicants to doctoral programs be provided with detailed information on the probability of earning the Ph.D., mean time to degree, student support, and recent placement experience of the department.

        "description":"This report analyzes departmental variations in time to degree and attrition in Ph.D. programs at Berkeley. An alternative hypothesis, the Ph.D. production function, is examined by cross-section econometric analysis of 28 departments. The inputs included in the production function were student variables--quality and percent males; faculty variables--quality and number; and stipend support variables--number of T.A.'s, R.A.'s and fellowships. Estimates are given for the relative importance of each variable in explaining length of time to degree and attrition. The author argues that fellowships and research assistantships reflect the external market demand for Ph.D.'s, while teaching assistantships reflect the university's internal demand for instructional support. The production  function and behavioral hypotheses are integrated by relating departmental differences in resources to an index of excess demand for Ph.D.'s by field. The author suggests that the production function hypothesis may be misleading, for increased resources unaccompanied by increased market demand may not lead to increased Ph.D. production. The paper concludes with an examination of the national production of new Ph.D.'s during the period 1947-1948 to 1967-68, focusing on Berkeley's relation to total supply. (Author)",

The purpose of this investigation is to address some of the major policy questions facing these schools and to provide a basic framework for comparable analyses in other institutions. The paper begins by presenting the formal organization of the Schools and identifying who makes what decisions. Then it proceeds to discuss some concepts of decision theory which regard an organization from the points of view of the decision makers. It then examines several decision problems in an attempt to identify the decision makers' information needs. Any research activities as well as faculty promotion processes are explicitly  excluded. The last chapter attempts to look at the Schools from the point of view of the Dean. Thus, some of the interdependencies that exist between the degree programs and the consequences of some policy questions of current interest are examined. (Author)",

The implication is that all loan financing for which the repayment is concentrated in the earlier years of working life has some deterrent effect upon college attendance because the net payoff is concentrated in the later part of working life. Since short amortization periods impose heavy burdens of cash outflows on the student and since expectations are not always correct, the author urges that loan financing of higher education be tempered by spreading risks and basing repayment on contingent income or providing for some kind of forgiveness arrangement to compensate insofar as possible for the following considerations: (1)  pessimistic future income forecasts; (2) probabilistic events such as illness and disability; (3) the choice of socially valuable but low-income occupations at the time of the occupational decision after college is completed (and this might include the choice of child-bearing and child-rearing for women); and (4) the presence of high discount rates among some students.

These different uses of cost analysis are discussed briefly. The author then discusses four important cost measurement issues: (1) what resources are being absorbed? (2) how does resources use vary with changes in the volume of activity? (3) is the pattern of resource use efficient? and (4) what  is the trend over time?

        "description":"The paper discusses alternative forms of financing for postsecondary education. Most will agree that higher education is too costly to leave to the natural devices of the marketplace. The basic fiscal alternatives are: (1) to privatize the offerings of educational services and the decision to buy them; (2) to make the offering of educational services a nongovernmental function organized and offered entirely by non-profit (and possibly profit-making) corporations; and (3) to provide tax support for institutional operations and whatever degree of subsidy to the other cost of attendance may be felt necessary on public policy grounds. Each of these basic alternatives has implications for the numbers of students from each segment of society who would obtain education beyond high  school, the mode of operation of educational institutions, the extent of public policy control and responsiveness to perceived public policy needs, and the incidence of cost. In short, the author argues that the fiscal pattern that should be chosen depends on one's view of what individuals and society seek to accomplish via higher education. Some specific objectives for California higher education are discussed. (Author)",

The author reviewed the literature and the parameters of the current situation of an apparent surplus, and admits that there is no unanimity on what remedial policies the Federal Government should follow. It is suggested that long-range national manpower planning must take a very broad view both of national economic and social objectives and of alternative productive technologies and that such planning must take into account the implications for both in terms of requisite manpower. The issue  of manpower supply and demand should be viewed from the perspective of formulation of more comprehensive, even if they be crude, national objectives, and from these deduce intermediate goals.

The primary output of this process is an increase in the student's stock of knowledge and skill, and the inputs to the process including the student's time (the productivity of which depends upon a previously acquired stock of human capital), the time of instructors, and a variety of forms of capital equipment which augment the instructional process. In order to examine the usefulness of this view, this paper attempts to estimate the relationship between specific measures of the output of the educational process at the college level and proxies for each of the dimensions of input specified above. These estimates are derived by  postulating rather simple functional relationships between these input and output measures--and using multiple regression analysis to estimate the parameters of these functions. In estimating these parameters, data is used describing the inputs and outputs of the college experience for a large sample of students entering college in 1960. A 26-item bibliography is included.

In an attempt to address the most important and difficult decisions facing managers of higher education, the majority of the analytical models that have been recently developed have focused upon the operating or capital budgets of the institution. The larger models have attempted to be comprehensive in dealing with all the expenditure components of the institution while a number of specialized models have addressed specific components of the institution in greater depth. This paper classifies the structure and scope of the models reviewed in seven major categories: (1) the function or purpose of the model; (2) the theoretical  foundation for the particular formulation; (3) the mathematical techniques used; (4) the subject or subjects of the model; (5) the sources of data; (6) the previous and current uses of the model; and (7) the operational status of the model. After defining these terms, the paper presents a structural comparison along these major dimensions in tabular form to facilitate an evaluation of these analytical models. The major distinguishing characteristics of each model are then discussed.

Because money costs of programs in higher education are easier to identify than benefits, a successful effort of this kind is a prerequisite to determining whether such a departure is worthwhile. Part one presents an economist's view of undergraduate education. Several of the possible outputs of higher education are described for the purpose of measuring the extent to which the structure of the Santa Cruz campus facilitates their production. Part two then reviews some major criticisms of structuralist reform. Part three looks at the organization and substance of undergraduate  educational programs to see whether, in a collegiate university, significant educational programs can be mounted which are unlikely to arise elsewhere. Part four describes the collegiate structure of the Santa Cruz campus, beginning with a description of how decisions are made and closing with a set of hypotheses about the characteristics of Santa Cruz graduates. This is followed by an evaluation of the collegiate structure and with a specification and measurement of the benefits resulting from it.

        "description":"The movement and location patterns of recent medical school graduates is analyzed within the context of overall demographic, social and economic changes occurring within the U.S. Special emphasis is given to the role of medical training institutions and State financing policies of medical schools. Estimates are provided of the number of physicians locating in a state as a result of a unilateral increase in that State's public medical school graduates. The author concludes that physician movements are similar in many ways to the overall white male migration within the U.S. The analysis of the biographic history of eleven years of medical school graduates showed that the relationship between place of practice and certain institutional factors is more complex than is commonly  believed. A quantitative model is generated to test theories about factors affecting physician migration. This model is then used to estimate the effect of alternative State and national policies to effect physician migration. A bibliography is included. (Author)",

A conceptual framework is provided as a method for analyzing three types of choices facing university decisionmakers. These choices concern: (1) the relative size of various educational programs by level and discipline; (2) the relative emphasis of instruction and research; and (3) the amount of support capital for administrative and service functions. Chapter two contains definitions of capital and depreciation and provides a conceptual approach to the measurement of capital costs. A theory is developed and applied in a descriptive analysis of measures of capital stock and capital costs based on the Irvine campus of the University  of California. (Author/MJM)",

The mathematical structure of an academic faculty is described by a linear dynamic model whose parameters were estimated from actual data by two different techniques. The principal characteristics of the faculty system considered are: (1) linear system propagation; (2) a convex preference function to rank the relative values of varying the states of the system; and (3) four state variables and four control variables including the stocks and flows of (a) full professors, (b) associate professors, (c) assistant professors, and (d) instructors. The specific approach adopted for this investigation assumes that the promotion policies and  attrition rates of faculty members are relatively fixed over the short run and the only variables left open to achieve a desired faculty structure are the institutional hiring policies. Under these conditions, the optimal open loop faculty hiring paths are calculated and their sensitivity is investigated. The study concludes by investigating and evaluating several solution procedures. (Author)",

The author proposes some standard terminology and introduces in a relatively unstructured way some ideas which may stimulate more systematic and critical thinking on the problem of measures of outputs and objectives. The attention of the paper is confined to the question of measures for the instructional process. Definitions of the concepts of effectiveness, outputs, benefits and efficiency and value-added are posted. They, using these definitions, the author describes an analytic comparison system for measuring instructional efficiency. First, he examines the question of total costs and total benefits which result from instruction in a particular field in a given  institution among degree programs at various levels. He then postulates an second level of comparison concerning degree work at a given level within a given institution but covering different fields. Analysis of this sort might reveal a determinable relationship between resources invested and quality of output. The form of this relationship would be of considerable interest in that institutions would have some rough idea of the cost of changing their output quality indices. (Author)",

With this objective in mind, this study develops a freshman admissions planning model which classifies high school graduates by financial aid needed, verbal aptitude, and sex. This admissions model is used to illustrate policy alternatives with exemplary information from Ohio Wesleyan University. The market segmentation framework furnishes a unified approach to evaluate trade-offs between alternate policy strategies for tuition, financial aid, and admit/not-admit decisions. The inclusion of short-run recruitment decisions and the integration of the segmentation model  with present resource planning models are natural extensions of this research. Futhermore, this segmentation model is useful in studying many national higher education problems of student access in addition to admission planning for individual colleges. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper presents the conceptual development and application of a new interactive approach for multicriterion optimization to the aggregate operating problem of an academic department. This approach provides a mechanism for assisting an administrator in determing resource allocation decisions and only requires local trade-off and preference information about his objectives and values. This interactive approach is described in the context of a specific mathematical programming algorithm (the Frank-Wolfe method). The mathematical model of the operations of an academic department is then detailed. A numerical example of the use of this model coupled with the interaction procedure is provided. This example is taken from actual experience with a pilot implementation of the approach  for the Graduate School of Management at UCLA, where the authors are attempting to install it as a permanent decisionmaking model. The authors conclude that the approach used here will permit the successful treatment of many other problems in higher education not previously considered amenable to solution via mathematical programming due to the multiciplicity of criteria.

The purpose of the questionnaire was to find out their experiences and their opinions about what had been taking place. A summary of the results included: (1) Only a small minority favored the tactic of the demonstrators; a majority favor some of their major stated goals, and advocate wide extension of faculty, student, and neighborhood resident participation in university policymaking. (2) The great majority of students and faculty believe that the police action involved excessive police violence,  although opinions vary about how widespread the violence was. (3) The effect of the police action was to increase acceptance of the sit-in demonstrations as justified by the small majority to a somewhat larger minority of both faculty and students. (4) The administration is widely criticized for not negotiating further, but there is widespread mistrust of the demonstrations' leaders. (5) The crisis greatly increased communications within the university. (Author)",

A copy of the nonteaching employee handbook or policy statement in effect for the 1972-73 academic year was requested from 103 public and private universities. Eighty-four replies were received. A broad range of opportunities for employees was found in the handbooks. The investigators followed a guideline whereby they differentiated between a benefit and an opportunity. If a service or opportunity was made available to an employee free, or at a rate less than  that available to the general public, it was not designated as a fringe benefit. The various benefits were placed into four major economic classifications: retirement, leave, insurance, and other economic benefits. The main purpose of this research was to ascertain the range, alternatives, and norms of the four major economic considerations.

        "description":"The preferences of students for the learning environments and roles they must assume under two divergent instructional models--traditional group-oriented instruction and the self-instructional models--were examined. The study was conducted in two phases; Phase I focused on answering the questions concerning the convergence or divergence of student preference and the relationship of student characteristics to instructional choice; and Phase II undertook the investigation of student preferences for specific characteristics of each instructional model. Five descriptions for each instructional model were presented to two student samples at Harford Community College--219 freshmen and sophomores and 158 first-time freshmen--in Phase I. The model descriptions were modified for Phase II  to produce a forced-choice questionnaire, containing eight pairs of statement describing comparable characteristics of each model, which was administered to four classes at four community colleges, a total sample of 384 students. The results of Phase I indicated that the students' preferences for instructional models divided the sample into two nearly equal groups. No significant relationship was found for age, sex, quality point index, major, grade expected, or self-rating of ability. The most prominent reason given for selecting the self-instructional model was the self-pacing characteristic, and that for the traditional model was the group emphasis. Phase II results showed that for seven of the eight pairs of characteristics, the students preferred the self-instructional model  characteristics. Tables provide the study data. (DB)",

Students enrolled in the same reading course served as tutors and tutees in the classroom. The peer tutors were second-semester students and the tutees were first-semester students. Weekly in-service training meetings were conducted for the tutors who were paid to attend in addition to being paid for two hours per week of tutoring. All groups made gains in reading as well as self-concept. The greatest gains were made by the Spring tutors who had been tutees and by their tutees who had the advantage of the &quot;experienced&quot; tutors. Over a period of two semesters the tutees-who-became-tutors gained 34 percentiles on  the Sequential Test of Educational Progress-Reading and 15 points on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. Students made better reading and self-concept gains in the role of teacher than in the role of student. Students receiving instruction from experienced tutors made slightly better gains than students paired with inexperienced tutors. (Author)",

Research was conducted to produce a management system and procedures training model with resource materials to serve as an operational guide for a continuing program to develop professional management skills in occupational education leaders. During the initial year of the study, 18 occupational education leaders received training in producing comprehensive system plans for accomplishing practical projects compatible with state and local priority needs. Instruction was provided by  a panel of university management specialists and independent consultants, and emphasized product development rather than theoretical training. The consulting team focused upon system approach concepts of product development, with the participants' skill development as a spin-off. A continuous and objective assessment of participant feedback reflected the program's initial success. Through data collection, it was found that the project participants rated the consultant team highly. Management functions were accomplished, and the project met its objective of producing 15 skilled occupational education leaders. (Author/DB)",

Present training requirements for marine technology were established, and a needs assessment model resulted. Results of the study showed: (1) marine technology instructors have fallen behind in their perceptions of the skills required by marine technicians and those skills found to be necessary in actual job situations; (2) the term &quot;marine technician&quot; is not  understood by industry; (3) existing occupations programs can be augmented to serve marine technology requirements with the specific addition of a unit on marine applications; (4) continuing liaison between educational institutions and industry should be maintained; (5) subject matter, instructional methods, and length of course should be adapted to student/job requirements; (6) students should be told of job scarcity, alternative job choices, and the advantages of acquiring general skills that are applicable to particular marine jobs; and (7) counseling in the colleges should be strengthened to inform students of limited job openings, and to urge marine technology students to consider alternative jobs.

Contractual arrangements for the six institutions that had paraprofessionals varied. The educational  preparation of the paraprofessionals ranged from a currently enrolled student to one who had completed a Master's Degree in higher education and counseling. In a similar survey of 23 Deans of Instruction of community colleges, there were significantly more paraprofessionals reported to be performing functions in the instructional programs, ranging from a high of 23 in the system to 1. It appeared that a majority of the paraprofessional positions were held by work-study students or students hired through some type of institutional fund.

Following a review of studies made by other researchers, data collected in three different locations in the summer of 1973 are presented and discussed. The study population was comprised of 57 instructors from a small college in southern California, 19 instructors from nine colleges in an eastern state, and 146 instructors from a larger college in northern California. The three groups of instructors were asked to respond to questions on satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The responses showed that more than two-thirds of the California faculties and more than a half of the Eastern faculties revealed that their gaining satisfaction was related in some way to their  students. Only about one-third of the instructors suggested that dissatisfaction was related to their students. The results suggest that interaction with students should be the chief intrinsic motivation. Thus, satisfaction can best be enhanced by removing obstacles to this interaction. This can be accomplished by providing for smaller classes, allocating aides to assist instructors with routine management chores, and providing economic security so that they are freed from concern in this area.

It is suggested that the core curriculum be six intra-disciplinary packages covering Behavioral Sciences, Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, Language Arts, and Humanistic Studies. Each semester, students would be expected to take one or two of these general education approaches to interrelated knowledge and to the overriding societal issues. All students would have concurrent or prior enrollment in a generic course along with enrollment in one, or possibly several, discipline courses. The generic course would attempt to extract the common principles and basic concepts of its respective disciplines, and would attempt to interrelate the disciplines  within each category of knowledge, as well as extract the implications each field has for the societal threats to survival, e.g., population, nuclear war, national sovereignty, ecology, alienation, etc. The generic course would carry one unit of credit. The discipline courses would be traditional in that they would cover the essential and specific knowledge of the various disciplines, and would be innovative in that they would be heavily oriented toward individual and societal implications. Further, each discipline course would devote one hour of three to that which would be both supplementary and individualized. The discipline course would carry three units of credit. The intent of the curricular model is to bring the world in all its complexities to the minds of the students and to help  them educate themselves to cope with its threats and enjoy its pleasures.

        "description":"The Developmental Studies Division of Thomas Nelson Community College provides developmental verbal and mathematics courses to enable inadequately prepared students to obtain the necessary knowledge and basic skills for entry into an associate degree program. A study was conducted to determine if those students who complete the objectives of the developmental courses can successfully compete with regular students in beginning credit English and mathematics courses and in grade point average. Analysis of the data revealed that five of the post-developmental groups performed above the acceptable level of 2.000, but two of the groups did not. Students who scored low on the Comparative Guidance and Placement test in both verbal skills and reading seemed to perform unsatisfactorily  after completing Developmental Studies; standards for students in the developmental program were not as high as those of instructors teaching credit courses. Developmental students performed as well as regular students only in one beginning English course and one beginning math course. The mean GPA of post-developmental students in five beginning credit courses was lower than the mean GPA of regular students in the same courses. The number of hours completed by a student was a function of his GPA. Greater success in terms of GPA was evidenced by those who completed Verbal Studies alone than by any other sample group studied.

Selection of students was based on achievement test scores in English, math and physical science and on interest. Questionnaires dealing with the academic classroom situation and the orientation classroom situation were administered at the end of the fall term, 1972, to Core and non-core students, counseling faculty and teaching faculty. Items to which responses differed significantly for the two groups of students dealt with feelings of involvement in school or satisfaction with the school situation, feelings regarding the nature of the interpersonal  interactions experienced while at college, and feelings regarding the structure of the classroom in terms of small-group interactions. Core students reported much more satisfaction with their college experience thus far than did non-Core students. Qualitative comparisons were also made between responses of the various groups. Core faculty and students approved of the structure of the Core as a method of facilitating effective students and learning and adding to students' satisfaction and involvement. (KM)",

        "description":"To explore the possibility of utilizing paraprofessionals in the Department of Counseling at Prince George's Community College, two surveys were conducted. For the first, a questionnaire was mailed to 36 schools nationwide which were believed to be using paraprofessionals in their Student personnel programs. The 22 schools responding (61%) indicated that virtually all use peers and/or paraprofessionals for certain student affairs functions. Nineteen use paraprofessionals to perform the 6 counseling functions performed by professionals at PGCC. Nine of the 15 schools reporting the use of paraprofessionals other than peers preferred their own graduates, and 8 required an A. A. degree. Eleven of the 19 reported a salary range of $5,000 to $7,000, and 8 reported a range of $7,000 to  $9,000. A second survey was conducted, of individual counselors, to predict probable utilization of paraprofessionals at PGCC. Results showed that: (1) counselors could increase their professional activities by 45% if paraprofessionals were employed; and (2) 15 counselors are needed to perform the counselors' present duties, while 14 would be needed in the future for strictly professional functions. Recommendations included: (1) maintaining a counselor/student ratio no less than 1:600; (2) employ five paraprofessionals and maintain the current number of professionals; (3) maintain a professional/paraprofessional ratio of 2:1; and (4) upgrade counselor's role to Student Development Specialist.

The study was undertaken for the purpose of gathering decision-making information prior to the establishment of a medical library network in Ontario. The medical network as envisioned by the Committee would fulfill three functions: (1) Allow a health worker to ask a single query to set the whole retrieval function into operation, (2) Integrate, where possible, special collections and services within the province into the system, and (3) Have, as central resource, federal health library services, which would provide  access to MEDLARS and other international information resources. The constantly changing nature of health care patterns makes it imperative that good library service be available to all people involved, either directly or indirectly, in the care of patients. The proposed information network would aim to provide quick and effective service to all health personnel in the province of Ontario. The network would comprise three levels of responsibility: the primary contact library, the health resource library, and the central resource. (Author/SJ)",

The Committee's activities are based on the premise that graduate work requires specialization among universities, cooperative arrangements and comprehensive planning. Consultants are asked to make recommendations on programs to be offered in Ontario, desirable annual enrolments, the ranges of enrolment distribution among universities, the division of responsibility for programs among universities, and the desirable extent of collaboration with  related disciplines.

Freshmen entering CWSC in the fall quarter 1971/1972 who were (1) graduates of Washington state secondary schools in the spring of 1971; and who were (2) enrolled in English 101 course, did not possess the selected library skills at the fiftieth percentile or better as measured by the test, &quot;A library orientation test for college freshmen,&quot; by Ethel M.

In addition, modern video recording offers low cost, high capacity storage so that information could be stored in a convenient, easily retrieved form. The limiting factor to the usefulness of such a system is its resolution. Since an information system needs to display text, the textual resolution of a video system is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally and the results compared. The techniques for recording video signals are outlined and the problems involved in storing information in single pictures is discussed. The cost of video storage is analyzed and the figures compared with other storage techniques. Video tape has a  slightly higher cost per single frame than microform techniques. Methods of indexing the information and of controlling a video system are outlined and the nature of a video network is described. The applications of a video system to information retrieval are discussed. The resolution capability of currently available equipment represents a fairly severe limitation to the design of an information retrieval system using video techniques. With improvements in the technology it is possible that more general information retrieval systems could usefully exploit the technique. (Author)",

        "description":"The San Mateo Educational Resources Center (SMERC) has, since 1969, been operating an educational information and dissemination center, providing &quot;Research in Education&quot; (RIE), &quot;Current Index to Journals in Education&quot; (CIJE), periodical, book, and locally collected fugitive materials for educators within San Mateo County and other counties, institutions, professional associations, and similar agencies throughout California and the Western region. In 1971, the U. S. Office of Education (and latterly, the National Institute of Education) granted funds to SMERC to develop satellite information centers in the Northern, Southern, and Central Valley regions of California; to improve the acquisitions program of the Center; to improve search services to clientele primarily through  developing computer access to RIE and CIJE; and to develop bases for continuing evaluation of the Center's services. In addition, a small grant was made for purposes of training others in information service operation. As a result of this grant, SMERC is to serve as a model for other states and regions wishing to establish educational information systems. This is the final report of the California Integrated Network of Educational Information Services Project, as the grant was referred to in its original proposal. As such it covers activities from July 1, 1971 to June 30, 1973. (Author/SJ)",

The primary purpose of the program was to provide a means through which pertinent, validated information could be made accessible in usable form to assist educators in making better educational decisions. The program was administered by a staff of six, two of whom were assigned to two intermediate education district offices. The program provided a computer-based information center using &quot;Research in Education&quot; (RIE) and &quot;Current Index to Journals in Education&quot; (CIJE) files of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) files as the primary source of documents. State library resources and the services of the Northern Colorado Educational Board of Cooperative Services were used extensively during the initial year  of operation. It took a full year to accumulate adequate resources and establish procedures which approached full-scale operations. The number of requests processed by the center gradually increased from 13 in October 1970 to 146 in September 1971. By May 1972, the number of intermediate education districts with extension agents had increased from two to twenty. An extensive evaluation of the pilot program is available as ED 065 739 and 065 740. (Author/SJ)",

DeProspo's primary purpose is to suggest some of the reasons which lead to the conclusion that much of the research effort in librarianship, the objective of which has been to influence library policy, has been ineffectual. The practicing librarian, who has participated in assisting the library researcher, has probably benefited the least. The library researcher must learn to communicate with the library policymaker on some equal basis. If he continues to talk only to himself or to other researchers, research efforts are not likely to contribute toward the solutions of some of the pressing and growing problems confronting the library. This paper is  not directed exclusively at those actively engaged in conducting research. The target group includes the library policymaker who has successfully withstood efforts by the researcher to influence his approaches to \"business as usual.\" An objective of the paper is to suggest some of the reasons for the distrust of the librarian of the library researcher and some of the steps which might reduce that distrust.

Three sources of research were examined in order to estimate whether each had enough potential or available material each year to fill a new journal equivalent to the average-sized journal. The three sources were (1) Educational Resources Information Center/Clearinghouse on Library and Information Sciences (ERIC/CLIS), (2) rejected but publishable material, and (3) \"LIST,\"\"Library and Information Science  Today.\" The first, ERIC/CLIS, suggests that almost enough material is available, the second rejected but published barely enough to fill a new journal, and the third, \"LIST,\" that there is ample potential if the articles are written.

Thus the scope of the study is to collect and describe information about the opinions, attitudes and practices of librarians presumed to be interested in research. Decisions in two basic areas were the first steps in the design process. One decision point was specification of the population from which the sample would be drawn (i.e., who are the likely consumer?). Two target populations were selected. One was the membership of the Library Research Round Table (LRRT) which was thought to  be a self-selected group of persons interested in research. The other was the membership of the American Library Association (ALA) Library Education Division (LED). A second decision point was clarification of what was meant by the term needs. The authors collected data that described the interests or primary activities of the sample and then used the data to arrive at implied needs. Additionally, it was decided that the survey data should provide insight as to feasibility of a journal of library research, rather than the need for such a journal.

Going back to 1896, it was another of the innovations of Melvil Dewey. This report describes the present state of library service to the blind and visually handicapped in New York State, examines the environment in which it functions, and recommends further improvements through State legislation and the cooperative efforts of libraries and other public and private agencies. Its purpose is to inform and stimulate discussion among interested parties so that a more comprehensive program for this group of readers can be developed at the State, regional, and local levels. To realize  this objective, careful planning and additional funding will be needed. The conclusions and recommendations proceed from data and insights gained from reports and statistics provided by a number of agencies; from study of plans and programs of other states which appear to be taking or planning significant steps in this area; from a review of the important literature on the subject; from visits to agencies involved in work with the visually and physically handicapped; and from conversations with people who are themselves so handicapped.

As librarians who are dealing with an increasingly serious problem of supplying information to an awakening clientele, the urgencies for this particular kind of information and the provision of services attending it did not conceal the fact that this was another kind of basic public library service that could be dealt with by using established library methods. Public librarians have in the past on many occasions responded to the public's need to know. The examples  provided in this Institute of successful environmental information programs already in operation are models for action in other communities. It was made evident that the public library can rise to this challenge. This guide to the field of environmental information programs for public libraries contains these chapters: The public library and environmental information services, The selection of environmental information materials, The organization of environmental information materials, The public library and the environmental information program, and the public library's environmental information program and social responsibility.

All of the organizations listed are private, nation-wide, citizen action environmental groups. Wide latitude was allowed in the designation of particular groups as environmental groups. This guide has been prepared primarily for the public  librarian, but it may be useful to other librarians and interested citizens. The public librarian receives frequent queries from patrons about environmental groups (both national and local) dealing with their history, programs and activities, existence of nearby chapters, membership requirements, and publications. For answers to these questions and for proper referral, this compilation will hopefully prove to be a valuable reference.

These candid reviews of environment films have as a central theme the affective use of film as a medium. As a former science teacher, the author has been repeatedly disappointed in discovering upon preview that films described in non-commital terms and ordered for class use on the basis of content could be so dull. Because what we think we perceive is based on our individual prior experiences, the author's views may be substantially different from those of other viewers. This basic subjectivity has been tempered by the use of these criteria against which each film has been judged: (1) Is film as a communications medium used to its best advantage in presenting the  content? (2) Is the presentation entertaining? (3) Is the subject appropriate to environmental education? (4) Is the information conveyed biased or balanced?

The present study was designed to examine the sources of difficulty that children have in making inferences and to investigate the crucial factors in the Bryant and Trabasso procedure that contributed to its success. The following three experiments were conducted: (1) replication of Bryant and Trabasso, (2) traditional approach using only one comparative dimension (longer), and (3) both comparative questions asked across pairs rather than within each pair. Results of initial training indicated  that in traditional studies failure to make transitive inferences was not necessarily due to inability to infer, but inability to encode comparative relations. Retraining with verbal and visual feedback was undertaken, and the information processing demands of each experiment were analyzed. It was concluded that children need to be cued to both dimensions to make inferences and that the information processing demands are generally the crucial determinants of children's success or failure.

The procedures used by the mother in the home environment included role playing, modeling and giving the child verbal praise. Between formal training sessions with the paraprofessionals, the mothers practiced a previously learned skill with their children. Study findings of the children's question-asking response data indicate that the mothers, after having training in socialization skills, significantly increased their children's performance on the question-asking tasks over performance attributable to direct modeling instruction by the experimenter. A later factor analysis suggests that well planned instruction, targeted on  specific skills, may be effective regardless of a child's general level of past achievement in academic subjects. A list of the paraprofessional training objectives, a table of parent training lessons and goals, achievement test data, and factor questionnaires are also included. (ST)",

This study compares the performances of eight reflective and eight impulsive children (based on results of the Kansas Reflection-Impulsivity Scale) on a forced-choice recognition memory task. Subjects were black children attending an experimental inner-city preschool. The recognition memory task was divided into four experimental conditions of varying difficulty because of varying degrees of similarity between the correct and incorrect stimuli. It was  hypothesized that the reflective children would perform significantly better in all four conditions. Results supported the hypothesis, and it was concluded that the tendency to perform detailed visual feature analysis is a major component of the cognitive-perceptual basis that underlies the R-I dimension.

Target group children were predominantly from Spanish-speaking backgrounds and were selected as participants using guideline requirements of language, background, income of parents, and residence. The goal of the BECP is to demonstrate that early childhood bilingual education intervention will facilitate the learning of two languages (English and Spanish) simultaneously in a responsive environment designed to enhance the child's cognitive, affective, and psychomotor development. Specific objectives were developed for the program components: instruction, staff development, materials development,  and community-parental involvement. The evaluation design for the instructional component was within a framework of a pretest-posttest design without a control group. Abilities measured were: language development in English and Spanish, school readiness, and subjective evaluation of self-concept. Findings indicated that the students made significant gains in language ability in English and in Spanish, and in general school readiness. The children developed and maintained a positive self-image and developed substantially in various dimensions of personality growth. It was concluded that BECP functioned as planned for the target group. (Author/ST)",

Four areas of study investigated in this review which support the above hypothesis are concerned with: (1) comparative school entry ages: early entrants are less stable, less motivated, and more anxious than later entrants; (2) parental attitudes and deprivation: the more parent-child interaction, the faster the child develops social and language skills; (3) neurophysiology and cognition: the critical stages of a child's intellectual and physical development should not be rushed; and (4) affective development: emotional  development is impaired when a child leaves home to enter school at a very early age.

The program's objectives were to (1) develop coordinated agency efforts to provide on-site medical, welfare, educational, recreational, and mental health services; (2) help families develop coping skills for the period of relocation, including the eventual move to permanent housing; (3) study the effects of trauma on children and families and provide mental health crisis intervention; and (4) determine special needs that might require new approaches. Interested community groups, public and  volunteer agencies, and the hotel families operate the program. A day care center staff works with preschoolers and parents to prevent potential developmental damage to traumatized children. Common responses of the children and their parents (fantasies and behavior patterns) are noted and discussed in terms of the effects of separation from familiar objects and surroundings. It is concluded that the on-site program has been initially successful in alleviating distress and preventing further deterioration. (DP)",

A synthesis of the two approaches provides a multiple view of self-conceptual behavior, in which self-concept is considered a social psychological concept subject to variation across time and situations. This study dealt with fifth- and sixth-graders' verbalizations about their abilities and competencies associated with their roles as students. Self-report categories consisted of nine variables derived from the behavioral modification and symbolic interactional treatments of parental control. Child-parent pairs (N=120) from four communities served as subjects. Children's self-conceptualizations were assessed using  the Michigan State Self Concept of Abilities Scale; parental behavior was assessed directly through interviews. Analysis of results indicated further empirical support for the notion that parents' evaluations are crucial in shaping children's self-conceptualizing behaviors with regard to their competence as students. The magnitude of all measured associations, however, was moderate to weak. Discussion of results concerned strategies to increase parental effectiveness in positively affecting children's academic attitudes and behavior. (DP)",

Methods of  teaching parents include the observation of models of adult-child interaction styles, and parent participation in discussions and demonstrations on the management of children in a variety of situations.

The High-Scope Curriculum, based on Piagetian theory and concerned with creating opportunities for maximal cognitive development, is presented as a viable educational approach. The curriculum  incorporates Piaget's positions on action, representation, and language. It is prepared for teachers who are trained to put into action a theoretically-based program with broad developmental goals.

Results contradict some of the rationale behind the current liberalized abortion arguments by showing that initially unwanted children are loved as much by their mothers as initially wanted children.

At the time of the interview, no differences were apparent between the two polar groups of mothers along the dimension of expressed love for the child.

The description attempted to make clear that the definition of an invariant sequence of stages implies a logical order among the stages, that is, that Stage 2 must imply Stage 1 but must not imply Stage 3. Such logical order within a stage and between stages implies that the stages themselves involve logical social operations or social relations.

Programs should be judged on criteria such as responsiveness to clients--the children, parents, and communities they serve. Teachers trained in observational and evaluative techniques should conduct ongoing assessment of children. The importance of teacher self-evaluation to examine effectiveness is discussed in relation to the emotional climate of the program as established by administrators. Summative evaluation, which assesses the overall worth of a program at an end point, is distinguished from formative evaluation, which focuses on strengths and weaknesses of the program and leads to strategies for improvement. The latter type of  assessment is recommended for education, using feedback from parents, other teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals, the children, and the community. The implementation of formative evaluation procedures would affect the nature of accountability for program success or failure. (DP)",

This evaluative report of a 2-year demonstration preschool, modeled on the British Infant School, describes the open classroom arrangement and its effect on the center's children, teachers, and student teachers. A major objective of the program was to create an atmosphere in which teachers could experiment without fear of failure, could learn from one another, and promote their own growth. The Center educated student teachers and aides from State universities and colleges. Dissemination services included workshops, courses, conferences, the establishment of a library (whose resources were available to teachers in nine counties), and monthly  meetings for parents.

In this activity book for teachers of young children, the need for independence and creativity in modern society is discussed as an antidote for the conformity and depersonalization characteristic of our culture. Teacher flexibility and acceptance of children are noted as the crucial determinants of a classroom atmosphere that promotes creativity. The teacher concerned with creativity attempts to set up problem situations for the children for which there is no one correct response, so that students can independently try out different solutions. The manual is divided into 11 sections, each of which suggests activities to stimulate abilities that a creative individual might possess:  (1) sensitivity to problems, (2) fluency of ideas, (3) fluency of associations, (4) flexibility, (5) originality, (6) redefinition or ability to arrange, (7) elaboration, (8) sensory awareness, (9) divergent thinking, (10) independence in thinking and judgment, and (11) imaginative activities. Classroom activities designed to enhance each of these abilities are included for each section. (DP)",

The experimental group consisted of 34 children, who participated in 33 sessions (one 20- to 30-minute session per day) over an 11-week period. Activities focused on enhancement of the physical, intellectual, emotional, and social self. The control group consisted of 18 children. Results indicated the experimental group did show more significant changes in self-concept scores than the control group. Parallels were observed between significant  self-concept scale changes in the experimental group and certain specific self-concept enhancement activities. Teachers' ratings and children's self-reports indicated very significant increases on the factor scales of happiness, sociability, sharing, less fear of things and people, independence, self-confidence, and sensitivity to others. The control group showed only a significant increase in self-awareness. This study has underscored the need for self-concept enhancement programs as a crucial aspect of preschool experience. (DP)",

The speech of 69 black, lower-class and 30 white, middle-class 4 1/2-year olds was compared. Speech samples were elicited through semistructured picture interviews, which were tape recorded. Two types of syntactic units, verb-complement units and noun phrases, were selected for analysis. Each unit was coded with respect to features describing internal structure, grammatical function, and context in the interview. Coding reliability was reported to be at least 90% accurate in all cases. Results indicated that the total number of units produced by an average subject was quite similar for  both groups. Elaborative elements added to a verb-complement (expansion units) were analyzed, and there was virtually no difference (in relative frequency) between the two groups. Expanded units were further studied for nine variables, only three of which were significantly different between groups, with one difference favoring the lower-class children. Deletions of basic constituents of sentences were analyzed, and the data showed little or no relationship to the elaboration deficit hypothesis. It was concluded that this hypothesis is not empirically supported. (DP)",

Children were randomly assigned to a consequence- or intentions-focused rationale with an object or person orientation in a 2x3x2 factorial design. The following predictions were made: (1) a rationale will be more effective in reducing deviation in girls, (2) deviation will decrease across age for the intentions rationale, (3) person-oriented rationales versus object orientation will increase in effectiveness with age, (4) person-oriented rationales will be more effective with girls than boys, and (5) children who are more mature in moral judgment will  be less deviant. Results indicate that for all measures girls were less deviant than boys; age significantly increased latency to first deviation when the rationale focused on intentions but not consequences; person-oriented rationales tended to increase in effectiveness (that is, latency to first deviation was longer) with increasing age for boys but not girls, and children who scored high on the moral realism measure were less deviant. Content of the reasoning seemed to be a major factor in the relationship between the child's level of moral judgment and moral behavior. (ST)",

The Teacher Observation Scale was developed, based on 4 months' observation of 4th-grade classrooms and was tested for inter-observer reliability in 96 observation sessions. Two classrooms were selected and an extreme groups approach was used. Class A was designated as cognitively oriented; Class B, socially oriented (based on the principal's judgment of teacher behavior and classroom structure, and  teachers' descriptions of their goals. Teacher A was expected to encourage helping behavior; Teacher B was expected to be less likely to do so. The Learning Environment Inventory for Young Children was administered to determine students' environmental perceptions. It was predicted that Class A students would show more altruistic behavior than Class B students. The Observation Scale, applied to both classes, varied in the predicted direction on teacher dimensions. Analyses of children's perceptions and behavior provided preliminary positive results.

Included are an overview of experimental programs concerned with cognitive development and school achievement, a review of the Head Start literature, and a tentative comparison of the relative effectiveness of  different approaches to early experience derived from the Planned Variation Study. (3) Continuity of human development is vital to maximize program effects. Methods are suggested that might provide continuity between preschool and primary school experiences.

The sample was composed of 11 institutions centralized in decision-making structures, and eight decentralized institutions. Staffs completed questionnaires on childrearing philosophy and community orientation. Children were tested using the Lorge-Thorndike IQ Test Verbal Abilities Battery. Also measured was the children's sense of self-direction and their perceived  levels of task and social relations skills. Results showed no clear relationship between staff orientation and the types of decision-making structures within which they operate. Analysis reveals, however, that child performance scores fluctuate more frequently in concert with fluctuations in staff orientation scores in decentralized institutions than in centralized institutions. Also, the number of associations between staff orientations and child performance levels increases the longer a child resides in a decentralized institution. (ST)",

The feedback condition incorporated daily information about the accuracy of the self-observations, and discrimination training involved a detailed training session in which modeling and videotape exercises were used to teach self-observation skills. First, positive verbal behavior was observed, then positive nonverbal behavior. The results led to two major conclusions: (1) The accuracy of a subject's self-observations can be substantially increased through feedback and discrimination training; and (2) the act of  self-observing tends to alter the frequency of the behavior being observed. Implications for behavioral self-management programs and teacher training are discussed. (DP)",

Topics include discussion of attitudes and emotional reactions important for parents and teachers of blind children, and optimal development in regard to early motor behavior and emotional and social needs. Common areas of parental concern such as discipline and expectations are reviewed. The results and educational implications of a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study of children blind from birth, are reported. Three levels of problems in the blind (organic, perceptual, and emotional) are differentiated, and conceptual behavior is compared for children who are born blind and those who lose sight at early ages. The collection includes poems and a glossary of terms relating to blindness.  Discussion of the nature of the handicap has sections dealing with historical, etiological, and medical perspectives. There is an illustrated section describing physiological aspects of vision, so that different impairments can be better understood. A final article reviews play activities that are beneficial for young blind children. (DP)",

In 1966, 907 families were reinterviewed by place of residence. The hypothesis assumed in this analysis was that anomia and success are inversely related. Both anomia and success were measured by scaling devices. It was found that over one-fourth of the male heads of households scored in 1966 were highly anomic; that for all families the independent variables significantly associated with anomia were level of education, complete nuclear family, number of persons perhousehold, unpaved home access road, non-ownership of home, lengthy residence in the same home, male head held 2 or more jobs between 1960 and 1966,  no formal leadership role activities, and annual family income of $4,000 or less; that although many husbands and wives exhibited high anomic tendencies, these characteristics did not appear to have been paired relationships; that success attributes were generally the direct opposite of those related to anomia; and that anomia and success have an inverse correlative relationship.

The effects of the bilingual program on the self-image and social interaction of the child were evaluated by self-rating scales administered  orally and recorded by the teacher aide on a pretest and posttest basis. Findings showed that the children in the bilingual program made greater progress; both groups of children had a high self-esteem at the beginning of the year but as they grew older their self-concept lowered; there was no significant difference in their social interaction; and the bilingual group responded more rapidly in both English and Spanish.

As a result of the low level of funding of these programs, it was administratively determined by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that hospital costs would not be covered by the Migrant Health Program and inadequate funding has made it difficult to provide services that are essential to a comprehensive care facility. It was found that 4 areas need legislative attention: the inadequacy of the funding level, the need for earmarked hospital funds, the need to reaffirm  Congressional commitment to consumer participation, and the need to develop a strategy for integrating migrant workers into a larger health care delivery system if such should develop.

The feelings of alienation were analyzed by the degree of powerlessness, normlessness, self-estrangement, and isolation expressed or implied. The barrio residents were interviewed by Mexican American college students. Interviews were taped in Spanish. Interviews revealed persistent and recurring themes of discrimination, futility, stereotyping by the larger system, and the bewilderment and isolation of the Spanish speaking children in Anglo dominated schools. The findings supported the assertion that many barrio residents feel powerless to do much about a felt lack of social  mobility and economic opportunity and exhibit a degree of confusion about the expectations of the larger society.

Included are brief reports on some of the innovative approaches to education--i.e., individualization and open classrooms--in Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools. It delineates the broad parameters of the BIA's efforts in school operation, assistance to Indian college students, adult education, and cooperation with public schools enrolling Idian students. It gives information on the important movement of the past few years toward increased Indian participation in their education programs. It is felt that this booklet indicates the determination, on the part of the Indian people, the BIA, President Nixon, Congress, and people of the United States to keep these promises so  that the 70's will be a period of educational growth and progress for American Indians.

The Piedmont Region was defined as counties where the western/northern boundary is fixed by the Appalachian Mountains and the eastern/southern boundary by the coastal plains region. All male and female household heads 17 years of age and older living in the area were interviewed. Data were collected during July 1971 by 1,500 telephone interviews conducted from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. to obtain an equal number of males and females. Respondents were asked to think about activities engaged in when not on a regular job and to name the one activity considered the most enjoyable. Activities were grouped by  non-sports and attended sports/outdoor activities. Findings showed that residence is a significant variable in choosing a favorite leisure activity but not in the ranking of these choices; urban adults have a wider variety of choices than non-metropolitan adults; mass forms of leisure activities are not favorites of Piedmont adults in towns or cities; and Piedmont adults prefer sports and outdoor activities to watching others play.

Findings showed no significant differences in the perceptions of the functions between aides and administrators and aides and teachers, but significant differences between teachers and administrators as to the bilingual and professional development functions; and between jury members and administrators, teachers, and aides as to the monitorial, school-community, bilingual, and professional development functions.

In 1966 the 3 counties contained 13 segregated black high schools, 9 segregated white high schools and 1 desegregated high school. In 1968 there were only 3 white schools and 5 black schools still segregated. The design of the research was characterized as an accidental quasi-experiment because several but not all the conditions necessary for rigorous field experimentation were present. The major finding was that the desegregation experience in the  youth panel had a negligible effect on the formation of measured mobility-linked attitudes. (PS)",

Major objectives were to: identify special needs in education, health, safety, and social welfare in each center; provide information about basic components which would be useful in developing programs to meet the migrant child's need and the accepted standards of day care; design a program for training personnel; and plan a summer model day care program integrating health, education, nutrition, and social welfare services. Eleven day care centers and 6 preschool centers were  used. Visits to these centers and interviews with personnel such as directors, teachers, cooks, nurses, and volunteers were conducted. A survey evaluation instrument was used to systematize the interviews. Findings showed that any favorable results from these programs depend on the basic components, the quality of all adults involved with each component, and the need for extensive and intensive training of the professional and paraprofessional personnel.

In keeping with its concern with helping individuals to discover their career needs, assess their vocational potentialities, implement vocational plans of action, develop their life purposes with alternatives, and realize their career goal, this career education plan proposes the implementation of developmental programs at  four levels. By level, those component programs are: (1) career and self awareness (at the elementary level), (2) career orientation exploration (at the middle school level), (3) formulation of career plans (at the early high school level), and (4) career preparation and training (at the later high school level). Career alternatives are to be emphasized at all levels. Included are: (1) suggested activities for implementing the plans, (2) announcements of books and audiovisual materials with addresses of information sources listed, and (3) a list of suggested equipment for career centers.

Students who elect to participate in the program select their own work areas, manage their own shop activities, keep their own records, instruct themselves in procedures and equipment usage, and judge their own performance and abilities. The instructor provides guidance but the  student is the director of his experiences. A notebook system is an essential feature of the program, providing operational guidance for students and also forms on which students maintain their own attendance and performance records. Evaluations of the 1970-71 and 1971-72 program operational years are included.

Programmatic concerns assessed were: (1) budgeting and fundings, (2) secondary area vocational centers, especially those in the Chicago area, (3) the State's evaluation system, (4) programs in occupational and career education and programs for the handicapped, (5) research and curriculum development efforts, (6) minority staffing, (7) private vocational schools, (8) professional development and certification, (9) the status of women within the state. Data were obtained from observations and discussions with lay people and educational personnel, previous studies by the Council, and feedback from  federal, state, and local vocational education agencies. Findings revealed that: (1) Over 650 independent local school districts operate programs by their own guidelines, (2) A lack of accountability in fund appropriations exist, (3) Career Education in the elementary schools continues to be very strong, (4) Most vocational programs are not well equipped to service the handicapped, (5) The degree of certification among vocational teachers tends to be questionable, and (6) There exist inequities in minority staffing and female enrollment in vocational programs.

Specific objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of program aides in extension education in developing further the capacity of small-farm operators to take advantage of income opportunities available to them, and to identify activities performed by county extension staffs in support of program aides which could influence the socioeconomic development of small-farm operators in the pilot program. It was concluded that program aides helped to strengthen perceptions of most participants in the program and also played a major role in helping applicants apply for home improvement loans. The program was  primarily production-oriented and increases in farm incomes for participants in four counties were much more than the added program cost in those counties. However, in some other counties little progress could be made. Recommendations for program improvements are included in this interim evaluation. (MF)",

Intended to facilitate data gathering, improve the quality of analysis, and provide suggestions for identifying community needs, the handbook attempts to break down the mass of available census data into usable patterns. Information on population by race, ethnic group, sex, and age, selected target groups, educational attainment, employment status, income level, and occupational are provided in simple tables. A minimum data table gives the planner most of the information necessary to begin area comparisons. The \"Manpower Indicators\" section of the handbook contains several suggested tabulations which include national figures  as well as sources for state figures. Other aids to the use of the census data are included with a comment sheet for feedback from users of the handbook. (KH)",

Specific objectives were: (1) to determine who among the 1957 high-school graduates had ever farmed and were actually farming in 1968; (2) to determine the similarities and differences of those who stayed in farming and of those who did not in relation to 19 characteristics; and (3) to determine the progress made while farming. During the Fall of 1956, 764 male high-school seniors, including 346 who were farm reared or whose father was involved in farming, were selected for the study. All of the group who had indicated that their present occupation was farming or that they had farmed at some time in the years following high-school graduation  were surveyed through mail questionnaires and telephone interviews. This report provides the study data resulting from a comparison of those presently farming and those who terminated. The comparison is made on the basis of education, youth club membership, job responsibilities, capital investment in home farm, background information, methods used to enter farming, capital accumulation, control of capital, tenure in farming, extent of involvement, use of credit, participation in continuning education, progress made while farming, involvement in farm organizations, approved practices followed, farming status achieved, capital investment and income, future plans, and why men quit farming.

Data were obtained by personal interviews with 1,413 sample household heads residing in the rural parts of the Ozarks region of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The findings indicate that the morale of the poor was lower than that of the nonpoor. The rural poor apparently did not use organizational resources to attempt to alter their lives, especially in terms of formal group membership. The findings also indicate that the adult poor wanted their children to improve themselves. Fewer of the migrant children of the lower-income than of the upper-income household heads held high occupational status just prior to migration, just after migration, or at the time  of the interview. Other findings point to the perpetuation of rural proverty from one generation to another. In terms of occupational status differences between generations, the impoverished household heads, when compared with their fathers, gained virtually no ground, while the non-impoverished household heads gained considerable ground. The migration of youth did not necessarily mean an improvement in occupational status; in fact, in contrast to the migrant children of upper-income household heads, the migrant children of lower-income household heads lost occupational status ground after migrating from the community in which they were reared. The findings indicate that the vast majority of sons of lower-income fathers actually attained an occupational status which was higher in prestige  than the most prestigeous occupational position of their father.

Survey data were collected from individuals before they entered active duty, and annually, through five years of active military service. The scores designed to predict career status were determined from each individual's yearly survey responses. Generally, the relationship between career status and the scores based on responses prior to commissioning were quite low; however, there was a definite increase in prediction after the subjects experienced active duty. The largest increase in predictability occurred during the first two years of active duty. This seems  to indicate a plateau in the subject's attitude toward the military career. Offer of Air Force opportunities such as education, training, and Regular commissions might be more effective at this point than at the time of commissioning. In addition, from an economical standpoint, the Air Force might realize considerable savings in training costs by sending those junior officers most likely to remain on active duty to the more expensive educational and training programs. The Career Intent Score was the measurement device most predictive of future career status, although correlations were only moderate. (Author/DB)",

Specific objectives of the study were to document farmers' listening and viewing habits with regard to broadcast market news reports, to determine the kinds of market information farmers want from broadcast market reports, to rate the importance of mass media and personal sources of market information in making marketing decisions, to determine the usefulness of broadcast  information in making various kinds of marketing and production decisions, and to measure farmers' understanding and knowledge of terms used in broadcast market news reports. The study data were obtained by personal interviews with 475 farmers. The findings of the study show that Wisconsin farmers have ready access to broadcast market price reports and other sources of market news information. The farmers cited radio as their single most valuable source of market news. The study found widespread misunderstanding of the USDA terms used in broadcast market reports. (DB)",

Data indicate that both objectives were achieved with the first groups of officers. Trained officers were able to identify specific behaviors with which to work and, under supervision, were able to implement behavior modification projects. When  systematically observed on their jobs, trained officers interacted more frequently and positively with inmates than non-trained officers. Inmate evaluators listed trained officers as increasing in general caliber, being less punitive and more concerned with the inmates' welfare. (Author)",

A process approach to supervision which is emerging in the literature is presented. This approach combines the leadership dimensions of consideration and initiating structure with the path-goal theory of motivation. Data collected among supervisors and subordinates in a manufacturing plant for an exploratory study testing assumptions about the psychological meaning of these dimensions in terms of a path-goal theory  are presented. It is suggested that the current assumptions underlying the process approach to supervision are too simplistic and an argument is made for the need to construct validation of the leadership concept. A conceptual framework which integrates supervision with Valence/Instrumentality/Expectancy theory of worker motivation, influence and power is outlined. Emphasis is put on the construction of a theoretical network within which the questions of the leadership and supervision process should be examined. (Author)",

An overview of development of adult education since 1945 is presented, and university and college training programs are described. The need for closer ties between training and research is emphasized. Such research is conducted by the following institutions:  Institute of Public Education, Division of Popular Education, Department of Research and Documentation, Theoretical Department, and Department of Adult Education. Conclusions are that the post-war development of adult education in Hungary was significantly influenced by the far-reaching social, political-ideological and economic changes which transformed the state and its economic structure and changed the composition of society.

A technique is then developed for assessing the differential capabilities of incumbents for successfully discharging responsibilities at different levels of an organization; and for ensuring that the growth in their capacity to shoulder responsibility is continually taken into account. Examples are given of how the methods described have been used in managerial manpower planning, for preventing the loss of key managers, providing for management succession and  filling vacancies from within and outside the organization.

The data on education and training are given by characteristics of administrators (age, employment status, length of employment as an administrator, and services performed). Survey results show that the median number of years of education for the estimated 18,390 nursing and personal care home administrators in the conterminous United States, June-August 1969, was 13.1 years; nearly 80% had completed at least 12th grade, with 51% having 1 year or more of junior college, nursing school, or college. Twenty-eight percent of the  administrators held one or both associate's and bachelor's degrees; the master's and/or doctor's degree was held by 4%. A course in nursing home administration had been taken by 35% of the administrators, the modal number of courses taken being one. Other than formal training, 39% had received on-the-job training, and 23% had received other training or education in nursing home administration. Numerous tables provide the survey data, and nine figures illustrate the data. The three appendixes to the report are: I. Technical Notes on Methods; II.

Information relating to 15 program areas were collected by interviewing Extension Directors, State Program Leaders, and Inner City Supervisors in the following cities: Hartford, Connecticut; South Providence, Rhode Island; Syracuse and New York City, N.Y., Baltimore City, Maryland; Washington, D.C., Camden and Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Boston. The data obtained demonstrated that a wide range of informal educational  programs are being conducted within the inner cities by the Cooperative Extension Service. The focus of these programs is on locally identified needs of people. The study also shows a wide variation in the organizational structure, staffing patterns, funding arrangements, program structure, and the development of local support. It also points up the need for a close examination of Extension's current approaches to inner-city programs. The three interview outlines used in the study are provided. (DB)",

The 1969 Legislature made the Community College System responsible for virtually all adult education in the state.

        "description":"Several works have suggested that life proceeds in a pattern of developmental stages characterized by expansion during the early adult years and restriction, or withdrawal, after middle age. Postulating that self-concept might also be expected to reflect this curvilinear pattern of life stages, the author explored differences in adult self-concept measures across age levels. This study assesses the self-concepts of a cross-sectional sample of 500 adults in five age groups, using the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and Forms A and B of the 16 PF Personality Factor Questionnaire. The results support a general life-stages model of change, but the pattern is not a uniform expansion-restriction one for all factors. The self-concept changes suggest a complex pattern which may be, in part,  a function of socioeconomic status, age, and social roles. Wide variability is probably attributable to individual differences. The feelings a person reports about himself tend to become more positive with age, with crisis periods experienced in the 30's and 50's. Socioeconomic status affects reported self-concept feelings and apparently masks some areas of concern. How one views himself may be as dependent upon how one perceives his role in life as upon his age. (Author/NMF)",

The experimental variable was the presence or absence of instructions to form a verbal mediation between PA elements (nouns). A significant four-factor interaction (IM x Sex x Ability x Trials) was found along with one significant three-factor interaction and several two-factor interactions. There were significant main effects for Sex, Ability, and Trials. Simpler analyses were performed separately for boys and girls, each yielding  significant three-factor interactions (IM x Ability x Trials). Additional subanalyses indicated that IM and Ability interact in a complex and different manner for boys and girls.

Twenty-five per cent of  the women withdrew prior to completion of the course. Data on 59 rehabilitated clients show 41 per cent placed in the competitive labor market and 59 per cent placed as homemakers or unpaid family workers.

A referent is a construct standing for a set or category of social objects, ideas, or behaviors that is the focus of an attitude. Attitudes and values are belief systems. Beliefs are enduring cognitions about referents; beliefs reflect the value and attitude systems to which they are related. An attitude is an enduring emotional, motivational, perceptual and cognitive organization of beliefs about referents, or sets of referents, that predispose individuals to behave positively or negatively toward the referents. A value is an organization of beliefs about abstract referents; values set judgments of \"goodness\" or \"badness\" on the referents and imply preferences for norms and standards of  behavior. Referents are differentially criterial to different sets of individuals, depending on their personal orientations. While great progress has been made in the measurement of attitudes, little apparent interest exists in the measurement of values. The author sees the definition of values and the distinction between attitudes and values as necessary for furthering the progress of value research. (Author/NMF)",

        "description":"The Self-Directed Search for Educational and Vocational Planning (SDS) is a self-scoring, self-administering instrument designed by John L. Holland, author of the Vocational Reference Inventory. Preliminary use of the SDS led to the speculation that some people were very dissatisfied with their results and others were quite pleased. Of the 4,631 incoming freshmen at the University of Maryland who completed the SDS 485 were extremely satisfied and 343 were extremely dissatisfied with their results. The codes for these groups were compared using chi-square and t. Results indicated that a greater percent of those dissatisfied did not obtain codes with a corresponding occupation listed in the SDS booklet. Also the satisfied group received more Artistic and Investigative codes while  the dissatisfied group received more Conventional codes. The possibility that the SDS favors people from upper socioeconomic levels and implications of the results were discussed. (Author)",

This paper uses the Ford Training and Placement Program as a specific means of illustrating: (1) the reasons for adopting a transactional process; (2) the characteristics and effects of the process; and (3) considerations for making it successful. The study investigates such characteristics of the transactional style as: (1) structures based on the concept of parity; (2) roles defined as interfaces between groups; and (3) the prevailing process of negotiation. The report cites organizational constraints, the need of a new vehicle for feedback and change, and the value of  the method itself as reasons to develop a transactional style of organizational process.

The second section develops the Dewey model in terms of inquiry and experience, while the third section deals with its implications for the curriculum. The report emphasizes the following curricular principles: (1) the field of study should be explored from the viewpoint of its practical problems and operations; (2) the students'  own habits of inquiry and decision making should be explored, developed, and transformed; (3) students should be given areas in which they can exercise power, responsibility, and choice; and (4) the curriculum pattern should encourage pluralism and alternatives.

Rehabilitation leaders were unanimous in anticipating that the 1980 counselor would work with a broader range of clients, particularly the disadvantaged, that there would be less restriction upon client selection, and that the counselor would work not only with clients who are physically handicapped but also with those who have all kinds of adjustment problems. In the future, rehabilitation counselors will need to cope with these developments:  (1) the reordering of national priorities; (2) the impact of the current manpower shortage on rehabilitation services; and (3) the calls for greater accountability on the part of counselors and agencies.

        "description":"As a situational precursor of embarrassment, this study required college freshmen to answer either innocuous or body image questions asked by an opposite sex confederate, who was gazing directly into their eyes. College freshmen were chosen because they are in the process of assimilating physical changes and new roles apart from the familiar social milieu of home and because they have already evidenced concern about their body images and how they present themselves to the opposite sex. Hypotheses tested were: (1) the behaviors correlated with embarrassment would indicate an adjustive coping response; (2) low self-concept subjects would show more embarrassment than high self-concept subjects; and (3) subjects would show more embarrassment to questions about those body parts with  which they were dissatisfied and rated as being of subjective importance. Raters took behavioral measures behind a one-way mirror, while a third rater measured response time. Ratings indicated that response latency, response time, fidgeting, eye contact, redness, and laughter were embarrassment-producing measures and were the most reliable assessors of the emotion. Hypotheses (2) and (3) were not supported. (Author/LAA)",

Data collected from the pupils included: ability and achievement test scores; an index ranking the pupil as an under-, average- or over-achiever; teacher rating questionnaires; and children's questionnaire. Although study results identify a number of home background factors relating to achievement status and  socio-economic background, the authors feel that future studies ought to explore the influence of peer groups, the &quot;caretaker&quot; versus &quot;learning environment&quot; of different homes, and the ways in which parental occupations and educational aspirations and expectations are communicated to the child.

The report concludes that while school districts can neither control nor alter the race, sex, or social status or their pupils, they can exert some control over the racial and socioeconomic compositions of elementary school buildings and over the selection of teachers, the amount and quality of resources in a building, and the types of programs offered. The implications are that the process of desegregation may have begun, but the process of integration has yet to begin and that socioeconomic status  is as significant a variable for black children as it has been found to be for white children.

Many adolescents run away primarily to escape from home, to experiment with their own autonomy, or to manipulate their parents into effecting changes which would make the relationship more satisfactory. Through planning, implementing, and interpreting this preliminary study, the community has benefited in the following areas: (1) operational and training procedures in the police department have been systematized and  upgraded; (2) interagency cooperation has been promoted; and (3) service for adolescents and their families has been improved.

Implicit in the publication is the recognition that in the vast majority of children with delays or distortions in personality development, the manifestations are evident but not yet deeply embedded by the time they get to school. The author provides the reader with a picture of what the educator can contribute to the mental health of a child, concurring with the concept of the inseparability of all forces influencing the development of the child. This volume outlines, for the teachers, areas of involvement where they can be participants in providing a corrective  emotional experience for children with mental health problems. Teachers can also enhance their teaching effectiveness by giving attention to the weaknesses in ego development which are apparent. Such help can then lead to improvement in learning as well as personality functioning. (Author/SES)",

This study collected data, in four phases, on 192 aggressive-descriptive youngsters and 192 prosocial youngsters and their families from 1961 to 1972 in an effort to predict the probability of law contacts and juvenile court appearances for each child, his social adjustment as rated by teachers, rank in high school graduating class, and academic performance. The best  predictors were IQ, social adjustment, scores on the Behavior Problems Checklist and the Glueck Scale, teacher grades, sex, and school performance. Study results indicate that longrange predictions of delinquency and related conditions can be made quite accurately using multivariate analyses. Such predictions can be useful in identifying youngsters having high probability of becoming delinquent, and those particular variables for which remedial assistance may be needed. (Author/NMF)",

The distances generated by subjects' placement of their cushions served as the main dependent variable. The predominant seating pattern was a semicircular arrangement of the subjects relative to the moderator. The interaction distances chosen were within Hall's (1966) personal and social zones. In Experiment II an attempt was made to influence where subjects sat by including in the group a confederate who always sat down first either very near or far from the moderator. Results showed that subjects attempted to accommodate  both the moderator and the confederate in choosing their seating positions. When the confederate sat far way from the moderator, two distinct types of seating patterns emerged, but both seemed functionally equivalent in terms of orientation and distance accommodation to the moderator and confederate.

        "description":"A human relations laboratory for junior high school personnel was conducted as an in-service offering by two counselors. The purpose of the laboratory was to develop in the participants an appreciation of, and a capacity to perform, three primary learning tasks: (1) generation of valid and useful information; (2) organization of choices emanating from the information and put them into action; and (3) maintainance of effectiveness through internal commitment to implementation. Each participant was carefully assessed at several points during the process to determine whether or not change occurred. Results showed marked improvement on the part of most of the participants in taking a variety of leadership roles, i.e., those involving systems modification in their own buildings. In  addition, some of the participants experienced a heightened state of awareness in their own lives and began to think about how they affected other people, including students and staff. No members seemed to have suffered ill effects from involvement in the laboratory experience. Other labs of this type have been planned. (Author/NMF)",

The publication is based on the premise that availability of dental care services does not necessarily insure utilization of these programs unless the individual recipient, the family, and the community have an awareness of the importance of oral health. To upgrade dental care programs, educational services must be made available to every child as well as to the adults who influence his learning. The educational objectives in this guide are expressed as teaching targets--what the child and his parent must do to achieve life-long dental health.  The guide also includes suggested audio-visual materials and activities to enhance an educational program. (Author/SES)",

The research, conducted at Fort Knox, Kentucky, consisted of a survey on drug usage and related attitudes administered to Army personnel, and a review of civilian drug education programs resulting in suggestions for a model program, and a search of psychological literature on attitude change. Data and information obtained from these three sources formed the framework on which a set of eighteen guidelines for use in designing and implementing drug education programs was developed. Findings indicated some approaches currently used in civilian programs could be useful in military drug education programs.  Continuing concern over the nontherapeutic use of drugs in the Army is reflected in Army regulations directing that drug education efforts be made. The guidelines presented in this report, while primarily developed for the use of those concerned with implementation of drug education programs in the Army, are equally applicable for use in civilian programs.

The authors believe that the full potential of health education can be realized only when school, home and community programs are interrelated. This volume serves as a source book for teachers, a text for teacher educators, and a reference tool for others in professions related to the school health field. With a companion volume, (\"School Health Services and Healthful School Living\", 1953, 1957), this book: (1) offers a comprehensive view of the school health program--education, service, and environment; (2) reviews the progress and problems of health education, with attention to its scope and scientific bases; and (3) discusses the health characteristics of  children and adolescents along with attitudes and behavioral changes. The publication places emphasis on curriculum development and health education at various levels of schooling from kindergarten through college and adult education, and offers suggestions for instructional materials and resources.

He cites two types of problems: technological or instrumental problems of methodology and measurement, and evaluation process into technological versus value aspects and, in preparation for program evaluation, cites the need for the simultaneous consideration of both technological and value aspects. Besides the issues of incredibility and confidence, there are the following difficulties in program evaluation: (1) there is \"no one way\" to perform evaluation; (2) there is no generic logical structure that will assure a \"right method of choice\"; (3) evaluation ultimately  becomes judgment as long as there is no ultimate ordering of priorities; and (4) the critical element in evaluation is who has the right to decide.

The awarding of dean's list recognition should improve students' self evaluations relative to others, provide a social climate supportive of intellectual accomplishment, and enhance the academic performance of its recipients in subsequent terms. The present research assessed the effects of dean's list recognition on academic achievement using regression discontinuity analyses of student transcript data. Students who received dean's list recognition earned significantly more grade points and higher grade point average in subsequent terms than expected by extrapolation from the performance of non-dean's-list students. The present  findings do indicate that the dean's list award can effectively reinforce academic achievement, at least for those students earning grade point averages just above the 3.5 cutting point.

The \"cold\" divergent cognitive style was found to be a controlled, problem-solving approach to stimuli, whereas the \"hot\" divergent cognitive style was a freer, more impulsive response to stimuli involving more emotion. The results show that the cold divergent variable of verbal originality is significantly characteristic of the overachieving group; however, the variables of fluency and flexibility do not differentiate the groups. There was no significant difference between the overachieving group and the normal achieving group on hot divergent cognitive style. Convergent abilities were found to have little predictive  power for divergent abilities at any level. Data sheets are appended. (Author/LAA)",

A person was considered a drop-out if he admittedly no longer used any or all the drugs in the following categories: marijuana, hallucinogens, speed, downers, and inhalants. A purposive sample was drawn to capture as many people fitting this criterion as possible. Two hundred and fifty non-institutionalized subjects were contacted and interviewed. Some major quitting contingencies which appear to act across all drug categories are: the early or late occurrence of bad mental or physical experiences on drugs, geographic mobility away from the drug scene, the gradual development of meditation as a substitute for drug use, an abrupt conversion to Christianity at the height of one's career,  negative social pressure from significant or more generalized others, and the widespread tendency to \"burn out\" or simply lose interest after long term use of street drugs. Patterns specific to each type of drug are also discussed. (Author/NMF)",

Evaluation instruments were objective in design or were forms of standardized measurements; an evaluation of program objectives was made yearly, and a  final evaluation summary is included in this document.

A ten-week seminar, attended by 49 university student subjects, was evaluated, before and after, with the Vocational Development Inventory (VDI), the Career Activities Survey (CAS, an information seeking checklist), and the Career Assessment Form (CAF, a choice-decidedness index). Seminar objectives are stated and descriptions of various seminar sessions are included. Although significant differences were found on all three instruments and results suggest significant gains for those students participating in the seminar, the author points out that the results should be interpreted with caution since a control group was not utilized. The author  further suggests that the CAS may, itself, be a treatment and that movement in the direction of &quot;less decided&quot; on the CAF may also represent growth. References are included.

The questionnaire was administered to 48 black male and 72 black female seniors at a predominantly black metropolitan area high school. Results indicate that although all black targets are more uniformly viewed than white men or women, black male targets are less positively viewed than black female targets. However, black male respondents' self-perception was found to be equally positive to that of  black females. Data support the contention that the black family structure, devised to cope with a dominant, antagonistic white society, has produced an alteration in sex roles vis a vis the white subculture.

Through courses emphasizing the institutional aspects of the school, program evaluation, and intervention strategies for change, and through a year's internship stressing human relations and self-assessment skills, students learn to maintain credibility with the client system and professional associates while fulfilling the accountability function. In seminars, social work students learn to use recordings, communication, and evaluation to achieve accountability.

The report examines the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as an organization, its judicial and prejudicial procedures, its use of detention, and its transfer of offenders to the adult criminal justice system. In conclusion, the report finds that, although the battle for procedural reform of the juvenile court has basically been won, nothing in the procedural revolution will: (1) keep runaways out of the institutions; (2) renovate uninhabitable housing which gives birth to so many juvenile problems; or (3) persuade parents to stop filing complaints of  ungovernability on their children. The juvenile courts will continue to serve as the public repository of the private sector's failures. The need now is to examine seriously those conditions that produce a system that is not only unjust, but unsuccessful. (Author/LAA)",

The activities utilized for this program consist of various role playing situations, group fantasies, small group feedback opportunities, a \"careergram\" measuring participants' consideration of unconventional (for females) occupations, and a discussion of the pervasive myths  regarding women's work habits. The formal and informal assessments of this program and concrete suggestions for implemeting career counseling programs for high school women will be presented. (Author/LAA)",

In addition, comparisons were made between the two counseling treatments on the basis of the student's assessment of his counseling experience. The investigation was designed to provide answers to the following questions: (1) Are the treatments equally effective in facilitating male and female university students' career development? (2) Are the experimental guidance and individual counseling treatments equally effective in terms of student ratings? The experimental treatment utilized an independent assignment, a large group meeting, and small group counseling sessions to  discuss decision making, values, interests, behavioral traits, and social influences. Results indicated that freshmen and sophomore university students participating in the experimental guidance treatment advanced further in their stage of career development than students participating in the individual counseling treatment.

Each of 25 Head Start children was paired with a non-Head Start child of the same reace, sex, age, socioeconomic status, date of school entrance, kindergarten experience, promotion record, and type of school. The second part of the study involved a three year followup assessment of intelligence test scores of children who had attended Head Start before entry into school. The conclusions was reached that Project Head Start had been effective in preparing children for later reading achievement, as determined by the word meaning subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test. The durability of this effect was demonstrated over a three year span.  Intelligence, as measured by the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, improved during the longitudinal study, but the preschool program could not be given credit for the positive change. The author recommends continued longitudinal research in preschool compensatory education. (Author/WR)",

Eighty-five boys and 67 girls in the second grade and 25 boys and 14 girls in learning disability group clinics in grades two to six participated in the program. The students were given tape-recorded lessons twice a week. The lessons were given free field by the teachers in the second grade classrooms to the entire class at one time. In the learning disability groups, children took the lessons in groups of two to six in listening centers. A total of 39 lessons and four Interim Review Tests, also tape-rocorded, were given over a six-month period. Children in the  learning disability groups could take the lessons over until they mastered them before taking the Interim Review Tests. The Gilmore Oral Reading Test, a tape-recorded criterion-referenced listening test, the Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Test, and the Short Form Test of Academic Ability were used to assess progress. The results indicated that criterion levels were reached on three of the four Interim Review Tests. The students made significant pre-post test gains on most of the variables, but replication of the study for a third year was suggested. (WR)",

Twenty first grade black children were invited to select one or more picture books from a display and tell stories suggested by the illustrations. These stories served as the data base from which the language of books normally used as reading texts (\"Now We Read,\"\"In the City,\" and \"Ready to Roll\") was analyzed. Results indicated poor correspondences between words used in beginning reading instructional materials and those which are familiar to beginning readers. Clearly the  children's oral language is more complex than that used in the books. Furthermore, the children were not consistently speakers of Black English--many of them produced Standard English equivalents for the dialect forms which have been reported by linguistics., suggesting that dialect by itself is not likely to present serious difficulties in beginning reading instruction.

The results disprove the speculation that difficulty increases from beginning to end in many children's books. The study also compared the four readability estimates; correlations varied from high to negative. (2) In a 1973 study, Alden J. Moe investigated the readability of selected Newbery Award Books. Fry, Gunning, and Lorge formulas were used but did not provide the  same grade level estimates when applied to a single sample. (3) Also in 1973, Norman Felsenthal analyzed the readability and specialized vocabulary of nine selected U. S. history texts in grades 5, 8, and 11 using Flesch, Fry, and Lorge formulas.

This study examines the reading process of 94 subjects with proficiency levels ranging from low second grade to high tenth grade using the Goodman Taxonomy of Reading Miscues. The analysis showed reading at all levels to be consistent with the Goodman model of reading. Low proficiency readers are using the same process as high proficiency readers but less well. They are less efficient because they use more graphic, syntactic, and semantic information than they need; they have less productive strategies for using this information; and they lose more of the potential meaning. The analysis revealed no hierarchy of  skills in reading development. Beyond the very lowest levels, no notable differences in handling graphic cues exist. Differences in ability to handle complex syntax disappear among readers of moderate to high proficiency. The single consistent difference between groups at successive proficiency levels is in their ability to comprehend what they read. The best indicator of reading proficiency is the percent of miscues semantically acceptable before correction. (Author/TO)",

Many of their problems, concerns, and needs are reflected through and can be observed in books; among these are parent relationships, the search for a belief or purpose in life, the unknown, the bizarre and supernatural, the occult, religion, the Jesus revolution, self-expression, ethnic identity and human dignity, rock music, drugs, women's struggles, and sex. The youth of today don't hesitate to question values. Books are needed which are designed for young adult readers--books that can answer the many needs of today's teenagers.

Most of the nineteen students had scored below or near the tenth percentile of the MacMillan Readiness Test. Four behavioral objectives were written for the students in the areas of space, quantity, time, and basic concepts. The teacher worked daily with the students in groups of four using the &quot;Flex-Ed&quot; program. Following formal instruction in the group, individual students practiced at their own pace with the &quot;Flex-Ed&quot; materials. The Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, Form A, was administered in October and again in May to obtain pre- and post-test measures. The results indicated that the experimental group of nineteen students performed better than the control  group. The experimental group's growth, however, was far short of expectations when the mean gain score of 8.6 was considered. It was recommended that fundamental concepts could be better developed with the use of resources such as the &quot;Flex-Ed&quot; curricular materials. (WR)",

(1) An exemplary program for the diagnosis of reading disabilities was established. Project area schools referred reading disability cases to the clinic on a rotating basis. Parents, school administrators, and teachers were involved in the referral procedures. Case study reports were prepared and forwarded to the principal of the referring school, and parents were notified by the clinic to make arrangements for discussing the report. (2) Remedial services were provided by members of the clinic. For an eight-week period during the  summer, special remedial classes were organized. (3) In-service activities were planned according to the indicated needs of the project area schools.

The major purpose of these investigations was to test some of the German theories on dyslexia, especially regarding visual perceptual problems, spatial orientation, and dominance factors. The dyslexic child, as defined in Germany and used in this study, is a child with reading and writing disabilities who possesses normal intelligence. Children with and without reading and writing problems were matched according to IQ, sex, age, grade level, and occupation of father, and were then compared in visual perception, dominance factors, and spatial orientation. Dyslexic children were found to be inferior in articulation, auditory discrimination, and vocabulary, but they did not differ  in grammatical structure of oral language and in concept formation. The interpretation of findings suggests that home variables and early parent-child interactions bear relevance for reading and writing problems. Remedial education considering specific personality traits of dyslexia, such as non-directive play therapy, was found to be successful. (WR)",

More than half of this low reader sample had scored more than a year below expected grade level on two or more aptitudes. Word recognition measures were administered after four months of sight word instruction and again after an additional four months of intensive phonic instruction. Correlations of aptitude and word recognition scores after sight word instruction were compared with correlations of aptitude and word recognition scores after phonic instruction. The results indicated that visual aptitudes were not more highly correlated with achievement after sight word instruction, nor were auditory aptitudes more highly correlated after phonic instruction.  Blending, Auditory Closure, and WISC Coding were consistently related to achievement for both kinds of instruction. All the children learned to decode before the end of eight months of experimental instruction. (Author/WR)",

This procedure allowed for a preliminary assessment of the temporal parameters of visual imagination. The results delineate a number of visual image phenomena: (1) visual image sequencing and formation is guided by implicit speech when long unpronounceable letter strings are used; (2) when short pronounceable words are used, the entire string can be simultaneously represented in visual imagination, and implicit verbal control is required; (3) the capacity of the visual image system is very limited--between three to five letters for short easily pronounceable letter  strings; and (4) visual image and visual percept representations of words are comparable for very short pronounceable letter strings, but as the length of the string increases visual image capacity for simultaneous representation is soon exceeded.

Conclusions based on the results of the study included: (1) Children use figures of speech (both novel and frozen) in their compositions as early as the third grade, and novel usage seems to decrease over grade  level. (2) The experimental program using \"Making It Strange\" increased the frequency of occurrence of novel figurative usage in the children exposed to this series of compared to their initial output, and as compared to the control groups. Exposure to this series, however, had no effect on the production of frozen figures of speech. (3) There is a strong relationship between frozen figures and length of composition, thereby suggesting that frozen figures might be considered simply as learned vocabulary items. (HOD)",

The theory centers on \"man the creator\" in the broadest sense: on the conscious and nonconscious productive processes by which man makes his history and continually recreate himself and his environment. The relations between creation and the consciousness of creation and between creativity and the consciousness of creativity and the interplay between the works of creative individuals and their  environments are explored in a theory which, because the very essence of this interplay is continual change, has to be both dynamic and historical, with a focus on changing attitudes toward creation and on the interrelated factor of changing styles.

An organization for Supranational Communication Research, located on each of the continents, could act as a clearinghouse and patron for world-wide communication study. That is, in order to guide the emergence of a world culture, it is essential to ascertain the effects, processes, patterns, and dysfunctions of mass communication in all possible supranational and supracultural settings and on a global scale. It is therefore imperative to establish supranational communication study centers. Such coordinated work could investigate primary problems, act as a nerve center for studies in other locations, and design principal programs in theory,  general systems research, model- and systems-building, and applied research.

Within each class the program provides for the placement of students in a group appropriate to their academic achievement and readiness. Each quarter is broken down into units on grammar, writing, speaking and listening, and reading and literature, with  performance objectives listed under each.

Coverage by slum papers and coverage by elite papers in Greater Delhi, India, were then compared. Findings indicated that slum newspapers gave more attention to immediate relief for the extremely destitute, to economic questions affecting their survival, to a topic officially designated as urgent to their continued survival (family  planning), and to small, local projects and concerns. The elite newspapers, on the other hand, gave more attention to preservation of existing institutions and to cosmopolitan issues and concerns. (Author/HOD)",

In a design employing syntax, probability, grade, and sex as factors, probability and syntax were found significant both as main effects and in their interaction. Probability had little effect on the comprehension of active sentences, but strongly affected comprehension of passive sentences. First graders responded correctly more often than kindergartners; the difference was greatest on improbable sentences, with improbable passive sentences the most difficult. Sex differences were not found. The greater difficulty in comprehending less familiar sentences when syntactic form is not supported by  semantic content suggests that the semantic component of grammar may play an important role in the child's acquisition of syntactic comprehension.

McGovern's television programing concentrated on a few issues in detail and stressed the candidate's personal qualities. Viewer response to Nixon commercials was neutral. Reaction to McGovern's media campaign was positive on the issues, but his personal qualities did not excite the viewers.

American courts have consistently denied an evidentiary privilege for newsmen under common law. Even with the shift in emphasis to the enactment of state statutes to provide a shield for newsmen, courts have generally upheld the precedent rulings. This controversy can be satisfactorily resolved if Congress will define public policy provisions of the First Amendment by enacting a definitive statute that safeguards the unrestricted flow of information and inhibits use of the subpoena to force disclosure by  newsmen of their sources and information.

In June and July 1972, structured interviews were held with a total of 69 administrators (47 from the Philippines and 22 from Malaysia). Results of the survey indicated that administrators characteristically send out more information than they receive. In addition, administrators perceive the initiation of communication as a principle means of defining status. Administrators generally prefer the &quot;one-to-one conference&quot; to other  channels of communication. A concern of administrators is that decision making should reflect democratic principles.

In an overview examining the history of violence in broadcasting, she traces and discusses the concern expressed by some broadcasters, the FCC, and Congress. As early as 1934 the FCC found \"blood and thunder\" children's radio programs contrary to the public interest. Congressional concern has been activated since 1954. The findings of various committees and commissions indicating a causal relationship between television violence and aggressive anti-social child behavior, however, have been  repeatedly dismissed by the broadcast industry as inconclusive. The author concludes that failure of the broadcast industry to self-regulate the violent content of children's programs points to a need for immediate remedial action. (RN)",

Rhetorical criticism, to be useful, must perform a unique function for society as well as for the speech communication discipline. Some distinction must be made between those critical acts designed for a social function and those intended to contribute to rhetorical theory. The foundation of rhetorical theory lies in Herbert Wichelns' belief that rhetorical criticism, rather than being concerned with permanence, beauty, or effects as such, regards rhetorical acts as symbolic acts; the purpose of rhetorical criticism is to discover and  explain the symbolic processes available to human beings as revealed in these acts.

One method is to provide information to and maintain contacts with other members of the faculty, as well as with community organizations. In addition to contest debate activities, the forensics director can encourage his students to participate in oral interpretation, public speaking, parliamentary procedure, and discussion activities in English and other classes and before community groups.

The problem with interpersonal relationships among the people themselves involves differences in language usage, especially among low-income groups.

The use of \"spread tactics\" (attempting to cover more issues numerically than the affirmative will have time to answer in a five-minute rebuttal) is perceived as helpful by the average negative team but is harmful to debate as an activity.

The use of reading scores as the determinant for placing SEEK students in speech courses, however, has proven inaccurate and invalid.

The coding strategies served as \"facilitators\" of the human perceptual process to permit an accurage placement of the patients into two groups--normal and diseased. Geometrical designs  successfully functioned as \"codes\" for a variety of body chemistry states.

Both theories suggest general guidelines that are difficult to apply to specific speech situations. In view of the problem inherent in teaching speech ethics with either of these orientations, the student should be encouraged to develop his own standards of ethical speaking.

The reorganization is taking place with the hope that with three &quot;little schools&quot;, each with its own faculty team, a greater focus can be placed on the individual. The document begins by discussing the program rationale, the advantages of the three subschools over one unified school and the organization of a typical subschool. The document then discusses the 7th, 8th, and 9th grade curriculums and the methodology that will be used in teaching. Among the methods discussed are team teaching, inductive learning, and the inquiry method. Also considered in the document are the roles of the teacher and the counselor, scheduling,  organizations and activities, student involvement, community involvement, program orientation, student discipline; and evaluation of the program, curriculum, students, and faculty.

Unique needs and interests have been placed second to &quot;the common needs of all.&quot; Such educational programs are now being challenged by those who see a dehumanizing trend in current practices. In the new curriculums, primary emphasis is on satisfying the needs of each unique individual. This review presents some of the considerations involved in implementing new curriculums. There is no necessary contradiction between humaneness on the one hand, and systems approaches and technology on the other. This review, therefore, looks first at the need for carefully planned change programs, relating them specifically to the humanization of curriculums, and then it examines the place of formative,  process, and summative evaluations in these programs. The concluding section presents some practical materials for the actual process of implementing new curriculums in schools. (Author)",

The report provides assumptions underlying the research, describes alternative extended school year plans considered by the district -- a quarter plan, a trimester plan, and the Act 80-Gemini 220 plan. The Gemini plan, which was chosen by the researchers as superior to the other alternatives, employs a twin daily student schedule for two separate groups of students within the framework of a 220-day school calendar. The research  findings reveal in part that some extended school designs (schedules and calendars) have the potential of maximizing the use of existing educational facilities, the only feasible year-round school plans yet developed involve all pupils attending school for an extended school year and the acceleration of pupils to reduce enrollment, and the extended school year concept will not solve a district's building problems unless the district is static or growing slowly enough to constitute no problem.

This book aims at helping administrators become acquainted with the broad dimensions of the accountability problem, showing them some of the ongoing alternatives as well as those being developed, and pointing out the pitfalls to be avoided and the guidelines to be observed in striving for greater accountability. The author first discusses educational change and the role of the educational administrator in the change process. He considers the concept of accountability, the transitions taking place in its meaning, and the development of accountability in education. In an effort to assist administrators in developing  an educationally accountable program for their schools, the author then provides a model which offers many options in the type of accountability program that can be selected. He concludes with some advice on how to publicly present educationally accountable programs. The handbook also contains a list of the names and addresses of persons and/or districts involved in educational accountability and detailed footnotes.

The authors first discuss the conceptual framework for the study and then present the four hypotheses which were developed and tested: that principals with high representative rule administration behavior will have a staff with low militancy and will be perceived as having high leadership, and that principals with high punishment-centered rule administration behavior will have a staff with high militancy and will be perceived as having low leadership. The sample consisted of 15 senior high school teachers from each of 24 high  schools. The presentation includes descriptions of the instruments used to measure militancy, leadership, and rule administration; the design of the hypotheses tested; and the test results. The document concludes with a discussion of the results and their implications, and makes recommendations to high school principals for rule administration. (Author/DN)",

At each stage of development, the user can check his progress by means of a feedback process. The module is organized to assist the administrator in designing and reacting simultaneously to the designs of others. The longrange or terminal module objective calls for  a program that results in 50 percent of an administrator's teachers demonstrating a positive attitude toward the use of volunteers by voluntarily requesting, planning for, and supervising a school volunteer. Successful participation in the module activities should produce administrative competencies in identifying the need and designing the specifications for a school volunteer program, developing a strategy for utilizing volunteer services, and assessing the effectiveness of the strategy employed according to minimum specified criteria.

Collective perceptions of 5th and 6th grade students were obtained on Sinclair and Sadker's Elementary School Environment Survey for educational environment variables of Alienation, Humanism, Autonomy, Morale, Opportunism, and Resources. Usable responses were obtained from 4,105 students and 627 teachers in 36 Massachusetts and Pennsylvania elementary schools. The  overall relationship between the behaviors of the school principal and his teachers and the educational environment of sampled schools was tested by means of canonical correlation. Bivariate relationships between teacher-principal variables, educational environment variables, and demographic data variables were tested by the computation of Pearson product-moment correlations. The results of the study support the contention that the behavior of teachers and principals is significantly related to selected components of the educational environment. (Author/DN)",

With a case study demonstrating the implications of the negotiation process for the role of the school principal, the author examines the experiences of principals in New York City where one recently stated goal of the AFT is that of the elimination of the school principalship and all supervisory positions. The author contends that the  inference to be drawn in this case is that principals need to develop a strategy for utilizing the negotiation process advantageously for the sake of their very survival. The author feels that to succeed in educational management in coming years, principals must adopt a creative approach and a new awareness of and skills in human relations. (Author/WM)",

It attempts to identify the levels of agreement within each of these populations regarding the principal's role in decisionmaking, ascertain the extent to which principals are accurate in their perceptions of the views of others, determine the extent of accuracy of the perceptions of others for the views of principals, and summarize the role of the school principal in decisionmaking according to consensus regarding specific behaviors presented in a role norm inventory. The author concludes that principals, superintendents, and board members are not yet willing to  involve teachers in the decisionmaking role of the principal, even though teachers may want to be involved.

        "description":"Survey feedback and problem solving processes can be applied to increase the effectiveness of task-oriented structural approaches to educational organization development. One such approach involves the superimposition of complementary collective decision structures over the existing authority decision framework of the school. Collective decision structures potentially increase organizational flexibility and adaptability by providing for problem identification, solution generation, and change initiation at the faculty level. Survey feedback acts to initiate collective decision processes by providing an objective base for problem and need identification. Task-oriented problem solving sessions provide for problem analysis and solution generation; the collective decision  configuration facilities innovation legitimation and implementation. This paper presents a theoretical model for survey feedback-problem solving-collective decision interventions on education systems. Factors hypothesized to account for the effectiveness of collective decision processes are noted and the proposed change-supporting structure is analyzed in terms of primary structural dimensions.

The study reported here used as its samples the Canadian Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the Australian States of Queensland and Victoria. Specifically, the study was designed to compare the Canadian provinces with the Australian States as regards the percentages of numbers and salaries of staff employed in administrative and support functions; and to compare the organizational structures of Australian departments of education with those of large Canadian school districts. The study was guided by the hypothesis that the decentralized Canadian provincial systems of education would have higher  percentages of both administrative and support staff at the out-of-school operational level. The results clearly show that the school district type of operation, as currently in vogue in Alberta and British Columbia, employs higher proportions of out-of-school administrative and support staffs than does the centralized operation as typified by Queensland and Victoria. The document includes information on the research methodology employed; the numbers and salaries of staff in the sample; and the staffing and salary ratios for the administrative, support, noninstructional, and instructional school staffs.

The paper treats of the SIGGS Theory, educational research, and of the SIGGS Theory as a model for educational research. The SIGGS Theory provides characterizations of a general system beyond those developed prior to SIGGS' introduction. &quot;SIGGS&quot; indicates that these additional characterizations arise from the incorporation of set theory (S), information theory (I), and graph theory (G) into general systems theory (GS). Educational research is analyzed to be theoretical, qualitative, and performative. Moreover, theoretical research is found to be nonempirical (philosophical) as well as empirical (scientific and praxiological), and to operate by the rules of retroduction and deduction to  produce theory about the teaching-learning process as well as by the rules of induction to relate such theory to teaching-learning states of affairs. SIGGS is shown to be a model for educational research, for through it the kinds of elements in the teaching-learning process and their relations could be set forth. Information theoretic notions provide a framework for categorizing the elements, and, along with graph theory, their interactive aspects. (Author)",

        "description":"The main body of this document consists of three presentations given at a conference on the management of change. The conference provided each participant the opportunity to formulate, plan, and implement desired change at particular institutions in a more sophisticated fashion. In the first presentation, three conceptual models of executive behavior and decisionmaking in a complex organization are discussed -- i.e., the rational approach, the political approach, and the organizational structure and processes approach. A variety of case studies illustrate these models. The second presentation reviews the research-development-diffusion, social interaction, and problem-solver perspectives employed by most authors in the field of dissemination and utilization of knowledge for the  purposes of change. The authors explain how these three perspectives can be brought together in a \"linkage model,\" describe the general factors which contribute most to dissemination and utilization, and discuss the implications of these factors for the practitioner. The last presentation analyzes and criticizes four major change theory models: the mechanical, the systems, the organizational analysis, and the anthropological. (Author/DN)",

The paper considers the higher costs of educational inputs in urban areas; the economic status of the population as between urban, suburban, and rural areas; the problem of municipal overburden; the additional educational needs of urban children; and fiscal capacity. Numerous tables throughout the paper outline the problem on a city-by-city basis. The document concludes with some recommendations for creating an adequate mechanism for the financing of education.

The impact of this political relatedness compared with other classes of influences on four school expenditures variables is investigated with multivariate techniques. In statistical explanation, political relatedness places second after environment. This finding is discussed in terms of understandings of influences on school policy and the need to investigate contemporary institutional structures as the outcome of historically antagonistic relations between classes in large cities.

He next looks at  the school system of tomorrow, which he sees as an educational system so different that it defies comparison to what we know as an educational system today.

The authors first examine the growth of education in the 60s and the consequences for the 70s. Included are data on educational enrollment and expenditure patterns in the 1960s, characteristics of Canadian school teachers, capital expenditures of schools, operating expenditures per pupil in relation to GNP, and projections for future expenditures in the 1970s. Various efficiency and equity goals in the financing of education are then considered. Within the framework of efficiency in  resource allocation, the authors consider the methods of determining the resources designated for education, the allocation of these resources among different levels of education and at a particular level, the level of public support of education, the cost effectiveness of education, and the benefits of education between the public and private sectors. To point up equity goals, the authors then discuss equal educational opportunity, education and income distribution, the division of the tax burden among communities, and decentralization and the willingness to pay taxes.

The first section concludes with an examination of the attitudes toward various structures for education and the decisionmaking process in education. The second section of the  document identifies and examines the principles underlying the procedures and mechanisms for satisfying the educational demand in general, and the means of exploring alternative ways of restructuring educational finance to better achieve the ideals previously identified. The conflict between decentralization and centralization in the financing of education is discussed, and the case for public support of education is considered.

EMR population findings show that many of the 224 EMR students have language deficiencies, and that most cluster at 11 and 15 years of age; recommended are early intervention, language programs, and revised secondary curriculums. Data show that the average EMR teacher is married, is confident about providing good relationships, is not confident about curriculum planning and implementing, and is perceived by other teachers as a baby sitter; recommended is more inservice teacher training in classroom techniques, and more teacher action in professional organizations. Job opportunities exist for EMR persons who work independently and  remember procedures; recommended are teacher contact with employers, and more vocational training. Few differences are found between EMR and regular classes, and thus few problems preclude integration; recommended are more academic courses for EMR students, and secondary curriculum improvement. Classroom environment assessment shows traditional audiovisual material use, and physical arrangement; minuscule physical development material use, and some language program use; and recommended is the curriculum specialist's attention. Administrative support findings show EMR teachers sharing all teachers' roles and budgets; while the support services of schools and local agencies appear adequate. An index comprising half the document gives data for all assessment phases and includes a summary  list of job possibilities. (For related information see EC 052 197). (MC)",

Objectives of the program were measured improvement in social and emotional development, cognitive development, hobby skill development, and physical fitness. Evaluation consisted of observation, interviews with teachers, and objective pretesting and posttesting. Each of the five centers (one in each borough) divided children into four classes by ability level. The program involved experiences with drama, jewelry making, physical education, and photography. The evaluation concluded that quality of staff services was high, that physical facilities and supplies were adequate to good, that the children enjoyed the program, and that  significant gains were achieved in all program areas except physical fitness. It was recommended that the program be continued and extended, that more experiences in sports be provided, that a Spanish speaking teacher or aide be employed at each center, and that a more relevant test of motor skills be applied.

Major advantages of the model are given to be that of providing for several research activities which focus on one common problem, reducing the duplication of research effort, providing greater efficiency in use of research personnel and resources, allowing for the use of common measurement units and data analysis to facilitate the comparison of data from all the research activities, and being able to conduct a number of projects concurrently. It is thought that the utilization of the model would yield information on a common research problem in less time than it would take to conduct a series of individual research projects. Application of the model would involve the setting of  general and specific objectives, a project coordinator, several research teams each working on specific but related studies, field testing in schools and institutions, and dissemination of findings to the public.

A developmental progression from simple recognition through reconstruction was observed in both normal and EMR children, though younger EMR children performed better on the representational tasks than on the concrete tasks. Implication for the training of young EMR children included the presentation of tasks in steps from recognition to reconstruction, the designing of tasks to  minimize the effects of poor motor coordination, the provision of practice with both concrete and representational materials, and the use of a game format to increase motivation.

The test of 17 items involved the dimensions of size, shape, and color at four steps of skill attainment (recognition, discrimination, recall, reconstruction). Performance patterns of EMR Ss and normal kindergarten Ss were similar, thought EMR Ss performed at a lower level on all tasks other than recall and discrimination of printed words. Structured tasks appeared to be easier for the retarded learner than nonstructured tasks. Implications for the training of EMR children were that the issue of concrete versus pictorial materials may be less critical than the degree of  structure inherent in the task, that the difficulty of discrimination and reconstruction tasks is increased when similar letters are presented together, and that the sequential progression from recognition through reconstruction does not hold consistently for abstract level tasks.

        "description":"Presented in the monograph are current or proposed methods for screening and assessing children, from birth to 5 years of age, who have diverse developmental disorders or who are at risk, and whose mental and physical development will benefit from early identification and intervention. Considered in relation to general screening are a screening analogy; physical, envirnomental, and cultural factors; at risk registers and populations; and societal, ethnic, ethical, and legal aspects. Described are the physical factors involved in streamlining physical examinations and laboratory procedures, genetics and amniocentesis, biochemical and metabolic indicators, nutrition, gestational age, at risk indicators, vision screening, hearing, neurological screening, and abused or battered  children. Examined among intellectual and cognitive factors are the infant's attention to discrepancies, ordinal scales of cognitive development, and aspects of assessing infants' intelligence and predicting later cognitive development. Language factors discussed include receptive language development, diagnostic significance of an infant's cry, expressive development, language tests and scales, and interdisciplinary screening. Examined among social and emotional factors are mother-infant attachment dynamics, social adaptation ratings, childhood psychosis prediction, and functional analysis for intervention. Some of the comprehensive developmental screening systems described involve early identification and intervention, screening as part of a total service system, multifactorial  preschool development screening, and manpower consideration.

        "description":"The paper reviews studies showing positive and negative effects of maternal tutoring on retarded and potentially retarded infants and children. Results of one of the studies reviewed, on the effects of mother-child interaction on exploratory behavior of Down's syndrome infants (1 1/2 to 3 years of age), indicate that normal and retarded children spend more time exploring objects when the mother is interactive than when she is neutral. Results of a Project EDGE study reveal that Down's syndrome children, 2 1/2-years-old, previously tutored for 18 months, could identify more curriculum and noncurriculum objects than nontutored mongoloid children. A conclusion based on the research reviewed suggests that maternal tutoring is effective in promoting receptive language development and  exploratory behavior. Negative effects considered are mother discomfort in the tutoring role and overzealousness or overstimulation, which may be deleterious to intellectual development. Cited are studies to show that quiet, intimate mother-child interactions relate positively and consistently to the child's intellectual development, that use of a training hierarchy permits a child to assert his own problem solving ability, and that arrangement of appropriate tasks and materials maximizes the child's chance for mastery.

Learning theory classifies stimulus events that cause a child to develop a body of verbal behavior and suggests ways of organizing thearapy. The interpersonal approach emphasizes speaker-listener interaction and indicates methods for modeling communication disorders. Psycholinguistics is promising for the identification of behavioral units in both learning theory and the interpersonal approach. Greater understanding of children's delayed language problems may be obtained through attention to the intersecting points of the three approaches, as linguistics can identify what is or is not learned, learning theory  emphasizes how learning occurs, and interpersonal orientation encompasses the learning situation.

Emphasized are learning processes and learning strategies in the daily instructional skills related to reading, arithmetic, functional vocabulary acquisition, and strategy training. Inservice training is reported as continuous, with instruction in the classroom led by five previously trained teachers. Described are instructional objectives, specific instructional approaches, and evaluation procedures (such as Stanford Achievement Tests, staff developed tests, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test). Reported are results which show that children who  completed 5 of 6 weeks achieved a gain of 1.57 months in reading, 1.98 months in arithmetic, and 4 months in vocabulary. Findings also describe most of the children as able to discover meaningful relations between categorically presented materials and a significant increase in percentage of children who used their grouping skills with good use of memory (mnemonic effect). The discussion centers on fallout from the program, such as procedures for integrating a processing approach to learning with curricular materials, effects of training children to generate stories and/or pictures for associating noncategorized stimuli, and new approaches to research and development.

Language handicaps as an obstacle to development of the child's academic, intellectual, and social potential are examined; as is parental need for supportive guidance. Discussed are studies which show effectiveness of oral and neo-oral (Rochester) communications methods in preschool programs in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Investigations are reviewed which show that deaf children of deaf parents achieve greater academic success than deaf children of hearing parents, although the point is made that use of manual communication in preschool programs might not produce similar success. Discussed in relation to the issue of early  intervention are preschool programs emphasing either socialization or cognitive development. Unimodal and bimodal stimulation are considered, and questioned is the optimum stimulation to be prescribed for a newly diagnosed hearing handicapped child. Cited are medical advances (such as near elimination of children's post-lingual hearing loss), and technological advances (improved hearing aids and audiovisual materials); and education's failure to produce new contributions. It is thought that the oral/manual controversy might be eliminated by applying the concept of individualized needs and instruction. (MC)",

        "description":"Presented are issues, background information, and a definition pertaining to manual communication, and explored are aspects of language development in aurally handicapped children. Proposed is a functional definition of American Sign Language, with High(H) (a system that accommodates itself to English, such as manual English) and Low (L) (a system possessing its own rules, such as Native Sign Language) variants. Discussed in relation to communications systems for the deaf are Bernstein's concepts of sociolinguistic codes and classes. Contrasted with language development in deaf children of deaf parents is language development in deaf children of hearing parents, and suggested for children of deaf parents is the learning of a dialect of American Sign Language as a first language,  and, later, the learning of a more formal American dialect as a second language. Examined are problems of teachers and parents in developing sign language proficiency, and recommended are such alternatives as a home training program for deaf infants and parents, managed by an education specialist and taught by deaf adults, teacher training by deaf adults, or classroom instruction involving team teacheing with a deaf teacher, a hearing teacher, and a speech therapist. Briefly discussed are benefits and practical limitations of research as an agent of change. (MC)",

Background information consists in such aspects of accountability as systematic planning, assessing, and refining educational programs based on goals for the students; and a description of the project. The model is described as having two program phases: planning and development involves establishment of program goals, with participation of the lay community and professional educators; and specification of behavioral objectives includes three competency areas (social, academic, and occupational). One aspect of program operation is described as preliminary  assessment of students' behavior in competency areas, which are subdivided into components (such as math), clusters (such as money concepts) and modules (with prescribed requirements for each cluster). The other aspect of program operation is described as formal assessment of students' behavior which is based on prior assessment and interim performance, and requires teacher selection of instructional approaches, implementation of strategies, and strategy evaluation. Presented are implementation strategies for planning, developing, and operating a program using the model; and operational suggestions (such as soliciting parental and community concerns, and the need for inservice teacher training). Provided in appendixes are behavioral objectives and their subsets, and assessment forms.  (MC)",

        "description":"The study, with 52 preservice special education teachers, focused on effects of two types of teacher manual design and two levels of material complexity on comprehension of instructional materials utilization. Two materials were selected from an instructional materials collection for less complex material and for more complex material, respectively. Professionally prepared teacher manuals for the materials were redesigned resulting in two versions of each, so that one version was illustrated, and incorporated such features as double spacing, indented paragraphs, and discrete sections, whereas the other was unillustrated, single spaced and had no indentations. The 52 teachers, in two groups, examined the materials and the two versions of the teacher manuals, and completed a  comprehension questionnaire containing 16 and 18 items, respectively. Results indicated that superficial teacher guide characteristics aimed at enhancing readability were not a factor in conveying information to the users, and that the structural characteristic of complexity influenced the teachers' comprehension, as they achieved higher comprehension scores for the complex material. One conclusion drawn is that research on generic characteristics of instructional materials should be considered in conjunction with the more commonly conducted materials' evaluation studies.

Student participation was high on the first five days, but lower on the final two. Three-quarters of the classes had initial difficulty in following directions, but improvement occurred later. Teacher participation ranged widely from total withdrawal to major modification of the game. Teachers who attended pre-game workshops rated them highly. They also felt that students achieved the objectives of the game and said they would  recommend &quot;Moonvigil&quot; to their teaching colleagues and play the game again. Teachers did express concern about the low level of students' television listening and group interaction skills and also recommended that the pre-game workshops be expanded and made mandatory.

In order to function effectively as such they must understand the methodological aspects of radio, film, and television at the levels of techniques, design, and policy. A system approach to the media which includes consideration of economic, ideological, socio-cultural, political, demographic and technological factors in conjunction with learner traits and objectives and instructional characteristics is the most useful organizing principle. In order to effect social change, media personnel must learn their tools, understand the  media, focus on the message, produce their own programs, maintain pluralism, remain close to the culture, administer programs carefully, and follow up messages with social action. Researchers should concentrate upon reading available research, achieving efficient division of labor, and giving priority to research on the impact of media upon social behavior. Given all this, the mass media will be powerful tools for adult education. (PB)",

First, not only has television grown to the point where only 2% of American homes receive fewer than three channels, it has also grown in public esteem. It has become the number one source of news and the most credible and frequently used medium. In 1972 the public regarded it as the best source of election news and as the institution which had been most successful in operating in periods of social change. It was felt that its news coverage was fair, its handing of controversial matters adequate, and the balance of its programing proper, although many wished to see an increase of serious cultural programing. The public indicated its reluctance to see more governmental control and  about 75% of the people opposed pay television. The majority felt that reruns were frequent, but not overly so, and most believed that commercials were both helpful to them and a fair way to finance television programing. (PB)",

In one, a student group viewed films about the Netsilik Indians, one read literature, and two did both. The group receiving both treatments scored significantly higher on tests designed to measure cognitive knowledge of the topic under consideration. In the second experiment, one group read assigned literature about the Yanomamo tribe while another read the same material and viewed films. Post-experimental essays revealed that the group which received the combined instruction had the greater knowledge of facts, but also  that, contrary to expectations, viewing the films did not change student attitudes toward primitive societies as much as it reinforced their previous stereotypes about those societies. Thus, it was concluded that the combination of films plus reading was effective in increasing factual knowledge, but that the films did not change student attitudes in the desired direction--i.e., toward a less enthnocentric point of view.

The Unipac is defined as a lesson plan for learners, a self-contained set of teaching-learning materials designed to teach any single topic; it is structured for individual use and aids the development of a continuous progress school program. Its overall purpose is to motivate students to initiate their own objectives and learning activities. In addition, the guidebook provides a rationale for Unipac use and shows how it differs from traditional approaches since it is student-oriented and focused on behavioral objectives.

Against a background which includes: 1) technological asymmetry in which hardware development races ahead of software development and in which technology is not fully integrated into the overall educational matrix; and 2) an educational crisis in the developing world due to scarce resources, rising community expectations, and skyrocketing enrollments, the question of what the new technology has to offer is posed. The report treats some challenges of modern education, the concept of educational  technology and some approaches to it, and the various media forms. It then discusses educational technology in action, giving examples from El Salvador, Niger, American Samoa, the Ivory Coast, Great Britain, Spain and Brazil. It closes with a discussion of some issues related to technological implementation and of the prospects for the future. (PB)",

The program took advantage of a CAI's ability to store, evaluate, and feedback information, to engage student interest, and to individualize instruction. It used an IBM 1500 computer with Coursewriter II language and had a student display screen, keyboard, light-pen, random-access audio and image projectors, and playback-record capacity. The program obtained  biographical information from students and directed them through a series of instructional units, criterion checks, and tests. Formative and tentative summative evaluations of student interests and learning demonstrated the capability of the system to offer them a useful reading program. (PB)",

        "description":"Research investigated the feasibility of a diagnostic media test system. Two distinct tests were developed for sixth grade and university populations, each having: 1) a main phase with three specific teaching sequences, one for each media form; 2) test items for each teaching sequence; and 3) a validation phase with one teaching sequence translated into each of the media forms and with questions corresponding to this sequence. Main phase test scores generated individual media effectiveness profiles; in retesting, each student took the validation test in the media form which his profile indicated as most effective. High positive correlations resulted. For university students, slides/tapes and tests were more effective than audio tapes, whereas for sixth graders programed  instruction was best. The investigation showed the model was feasible and generalizable, that either the tests often did not discriminate well or that for many individuals there was little difference between the effectiveness of some media forms, and that teachers can produce media diagnostic tests. Further research was suggested for the affective and psychomotor domains, to determine if time and experience influence profile validity, and to see if practice or instruction affects individual profiles.

An experimental group heard lessons on reading readiness, auditory perception, phonics, and reading skills, in addition to having regular instruction from the teacher. The control group received only regular instruction. It was hypothesized that the former would demonstrate greater gains in knowledge of rhyming words and initial sounds, would have greater word knowledge and word discrimination skills, and would show greater composite reading skills. Post-test data did not support any of the hypotheses. It was possible that the objectives were overly ambitious and that the individual differences between  subjects were not accounted for completely by the differences in individual test scores. It appeared that further study should investigate the impact of the individual's cultural background upon his ability to read. The use of audio tapes did, however, improve students' listening skills and help to maintain order in the classroom. (PB)",

The purposes were to implement an adaptive instructional system which would teach children the basic psychological processes relevant to 1st grade reading and math achievement and which would accommodate individual differences among learners. Over a five year period researchers collected I.Q. data from the Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test and achievement data from the Stanford Achievement Test. The data indicated that, over time, the reading and math achievement scores of 1st graders rose significantly, while I.Q.s remained constant. Also, fewer children achieved below grade level and the percentage of variance in achievement scores explained by I. Q.  scores dropped greatly. Thus, it was concluded that the adaptive instructional program increased achievement and lowered the predictive validity of I. Q. scores. It remained to be determined exactly which specific aspects of the innovative program contributed most to the maximization of the educational outcome. (Author/PB)",

As a first step, a 1969 summer inservice workshop was held at which one or more administrators and two teachers from each of 13 schools were trained in the process of individualizing instruction through writing Learning Activity Packages (LAP). They developed skills in writing behavioral objectives, test items, diagnoses, etc., and then, in turn, trained over 300 staff members in their respective schools. Seventy LAPs were developed, and there were over 10,000 individual requests for their use at participating schools. Evaluation showed the workshops were effective means of  training staff, that student academic achievement was better when LAPs were used, and that student and teacher attitudes toward LAPs were positive. Thirteen neighboring districts have since adopted the LAP method and information about the plan has been disseminated widely across the county. (PB)",

Then, individualized reading, mathematics, and science programs were identified and secured, followed by the training of teachers and support personnel. Next, evaluation procedures were devised and, finally, funding was secured from an ESEA Title III grant to support the project. Posttest data indicated that students who were in the IPI program for at least three years achieved  significantly better than those who were not similarly exposed. Teacher attitudes toward the program were generally favorable. It was also found that there were fewer student disciplinary problems, that emotionally disturbed children worked well in the program, and that student attitudes, self-motivation, and independence improved.

Comparison of the results obtained from pre- and post-testing indicated that students receiving therapy utilizing video tapes  did not improve significantly more than those receiving the traditional therapy. However, the parents of these students, their classroom teachers, and the speech therapists did profit from introduction of the video taping approach, largely due to the in-service training which was an integral part of the project.

It shows how GES, based upon the assumption that all youngsters want to communicate, employs a television mini-studio and an eight step process to motivate students to develop reading and other communication skills. It reviews the fundamental activities necessary for the implementation of GES, beginning with investigations by administrators and teachers, followed by faculty and parent meetings, contracting for hardware, identification of criteria, selection of participants, inservice staff training, and program scheduling. Classroom procedures such as logistics  and orientation are covered and information is given on the process whereby students: 1) pick a topic; 2) research it; 3) prepare graphics; 4) write a script; 5) practice reading it; 6) tape a run-through; 7) evaluate the topic; and 8) record a final tape.

Instruction regarding a modified Gallagher and Aschner questioning category system was presented to the experimental group via video tape, handouts, and discussion; the control group received no video taped instruction. Student teacher questioning behavior was audio taped and their students wrote questions. All questions were categorized and the resultant proportional values analyzed by chi square and Fisher's exact probability test. Results indicated that: (1) the perceptual model was not  significantly more effective; (2) students modeled their student teachers; and (3) an impact was made by both methods of instruction on the questioning behavior of student teachers. Additional research was proposed to determine if these results hold in all disciplines and over long periods of time, and to learn if changes in the cognitive level of questions occur. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"New approaches are needed if educators are to deal successfully with the problem of teaching children to learn to read words well. Interesting questions come to the fore if those who seek solutions to this difficulty regard the reading of words as a subset of the wider problem of reading the class of visual signs in general, which includes (1) actions signs such as body language, and (2) object signs, as well as (3) symbols (such as words). As research deepens, it seems certain that ways to offer children learning experiences better suited to their needs must lie in the reservoir of visual language they have acquired. That a child thinks nonverbally, and can express himself well visually through cartoons, visual abstractions, pictures, etc., should be reason enough to give him  this kind of opportunity to build his conceptual and interpretive skills. After that, adults can base efforts to improve his skill at reading aloud upon a better developed capacity for handling visual signs in communication. (Author/PB)",

AAT graduates were compared with graduates of comparable Airmen Basic Resident courses and Career Development Courses by Aptitude Group design. Evaluation criteria included a job specific performance test, an apprentice knowledge test, and supervisor's ratings. Results indicated superior scores for the AAT graduates on all three. AAT reduced the dependence on reading skills, and this, combined with the  self-paced and audiovisual features, aided training of low aptitude trainees without penalizing those of higher aptitude. Trainee manhour requirements were lowered 30% and supervisory manhours 70%. Lastly instructors preferred the AAT courses and easily integrated them into training programs. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"Research constructed a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutor which could transmit problem solving heuristics, choose examples, handle examples from a range of students, and learn superior student heuristics. Using a student subject model and tutorial strategy, an experiment was conducted with 284 problems. Subject response data indicated the information updating and student learning models could be considered separately since response discontinuities were related to instances of entering failure states. Students made 0.101 fewer additional steps per problem worked than the tutor and 0.011 fewer failures per problem step. Students improved 25% of the solutions and the tutor acquired some novel solutions. The research clarified the definition of a tutor in CAI, established a  methodology for problem solving heuristics, defined and supported a model of how student heuristics change after failure, implemented a scheme for tutor improvement, and combined the results of research in symbolic integration and algebraic simplification for use in CAI. Future research should investigate the role of failure in strategy changes, convergence in problem solving, quantitative measures in CAI tutoring, and tutors for other subjects. (LB)",

Namely, specialized collections were not efficiently built and shared, faculties exhibited jealousy rather than cooperation, administrative demands on staff did not decrease, library staffs were not included in the overall policy making phase for the consortia, and consortia directors did not communicate well with library staffs. On the positive side, where there was interlibrary cooperation, materials were exchanged, new courses based upon exchanged materials developed, and uniform circulation systems developed and these  encouraged similar uniformities in other academic areas. Also, library orientation courses for students in the consortia were offered, workshops for library staffs were held, some joint acquisitions were made, and communications between librarians improved.

The COBOL, Coursewriter II, and FORTRAN languages were used, respectively, in the three phases. Evaluation showed that from 80% to 90% of the students completed all units and earned a grade of &quot;A&quot;, as compared to 22% when non-individualized approaches were used with the instructors responsible for clerical tasks and test generation. Student reactions were overwhelmingly favorable, and students  were able to proceed at their own individual paces.

A CDC-6600/6400 computer was used, along with FORTRAN and the DYFLO dynamic simulation routine, A simulation subrouting was prepared for pieces of process equipment, and homework modules containing information and procedures to be learned were  assigned. Objectives of the modules were the transmission of facts and the development of operating experience including concepts such as start-up, shut-down, control, and process parameter sensitivity. Students were favorably oriented toward the material taught and to the computer as an instructional adjunct, and they absorbed factual matter well. However, successful operating experience was not achieved to the desired degree. (Author/PB)",

Chemistry teachers looked to computer assisted instruction (CAI) to improve instruction because CAI effectively dealt with chemical concepts and their practical application and with the wide range of students found in freshman chemistry. Initial CAI short courses failed after the novelty wore off, but an effective CAI problem tutorial--CHEMEX--was designed. Students used it because it met their specific individual needs. A later program--ALCHEM--which consisted of interactive exercises on various chemical principles was less well received by the students, apparently because they did not perceive the usefulness of the exercises.  The newest program, a fully individualized CAI course with specific learning objectives for each unit, has been well received by the students and eliminated student failures during its initial semester. In summary, the success of CAI appears to be related as much to the degree of individualization and attention to their needs as perceived by the students as to the quality of the programs themselves.

Mark-sense IBM cards are marked by students and punched by the mark-sense machine; the computer program then analyzes the cards, draws vectors and issues a numerical printout to indicate the social structure of the group. The chief advantage is that the student teacher is spared the tedious task of tabulation, but is provided with information about social relations in the class he teaches. Such information can be used to determine class assignments, promote worthwhile interaction, and improve the overall learning climate. It can also be useful as an indicator of maladjustment, as a group therapy,  as a variable in innovative educational programs, and as a determinant of optimum teaching styles. The CPS should also be helpful to psychologists, sociologists, and the military, business, and other groups where interaction is important. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"A newly developed instructional system for introductory college geography links the computer with the geographer's most traditional and essential tool--the thematic map. The use of the computer overcomes the logistical and mechanical problems associated with the teaching of thematic mapping to large groups and helps the students to focus upon the cardinal issues of decision making. The instructional system consists of a series of modules (data banks, mapping programs, and a transgeneration program) linked by a main program. The data banks contain dey variables for a geographic area and data packages needed to contruct symbol, choropleth, and isopleth maps. CMAP and SYMAP are the mapping programs. The transgeneration program uses the same approach as the Biomedical (BMD) system. A  Burroughs B-3500 computer is used. Students select a theme and variables and input data to the computer. Individual student information is stored on a disc until maps for the entire class are ready to be run at one time. Interviews with students and examination performance indicate the system is successful. (PB)",

Following opening statements by Senators Pastore and Baker, texts of the Senate bills S.1090 and S.1228 are published. The former sought to amend the Communications Act of 1934, to extend certain authorizations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and for certain construction grants for noncommercial educational television and radio broadcasting facilities, and for other purposes. The purpose of the latter was to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1974 for CPB. In addition, testimony from witnesses is recorded, along with additional information received from other individuals not present at the hearings. The report concludes with an evaluation of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) programing  by program managers, with PBS budgets and with PBS programing evaluation reports for the years 1971-72 and 1972-73.

The two basic assumptions of the author's theory are: first, that the meaning of cases reflects primarily the relation of substantives to the action indicated by verbs (any relevance to syntax is secondary), and second, that all values of semantic variables (items within a paradigm) are subordinated to certain unifying principles and consequently are more or less homogeneous. Because of these two assumptions, the author maintains that the case system of Contemporary Standard Russian can be described as an orthogonal paradigm where each term is defined by one value of each dimension  and all possible combinations of values are represented. The author summarized his observations on the primary semantic functions of Russian cases and includes the theories of several other linguists for comparison. A chart illustrating the author's orthogonal analysis of the Russian case system is provided. (Author/VM)",

In the first part, the 1970 figures for enrollments in foreign languages in public secondary schools are examined. The overall decline of -1.5% reflects a decrease in Course I enrollments but an increase in enrollments for Courses II-VI; this is interpreted in light of changing requirements. In the second part, the author provides an explanation of the dropout rate based on recent attrition studies. These point to several causes of foreign language attrition: (1) loss of interest, (2) requirements completed, (3) poor grades, (4) next level too hard, (5) scheduling difficulties, and (6) boring, irrelevant classes.

On the other side, the Creolists contend that Black English can be traced to pidgin and creole-based systems originating in coastal West African languages; the deep structural differences in Black English represent underlying vestiges of its West African origin. These two viewpoints are considered in their analysis of the verb system of Black English, specifically with respect to the verb \"be\" and to  verb agreement and aspect.

Educational Testing Service research on institutional goals is reviewed and six conclusions are presented: (1) colleges intending to redefine goals must first consider whether or not it indeed has the power to define its own directions and then to act in pursuance of new understandings; (2) institutional goal determination, has two end products: identification of goals and establishment of  priorities among goals; (3) the responsibility for setting the goal determination lies with the chief campus administrator; (4) institutional goals would profitably be conceived in two categories, outcome goals and support goals; (5) the mechanics of institutional goal determination might well involve both a committee-like task group and some form of opinion or value survey; and (6) it is essential that colleges articulate their goals.

        "description":"Two experiments tested the general question of whether a more \"natural\" artificial light (Vita-Lite) would have any different effects on classroom behavior and the ability to study than would a traditional (cool-white) light source. Fifty-nine undergraduates took part in the first experiment that utilized an 8-week counterbalanced design. Videotapes of classroom behavior and post-seminar questionnaires indicated no significant differences in variables dealing with classroom interaction, seminar effectiveness and mood. A follow-up questionnaire did show however, that upon direct appraisal, the Vita-Lite was perceived as stronger, more stimulating, brighter and more harsh than the cool-white light source that was considered softer and more relaxing. Using a similar research design,  a second experiment showed that on physiological measures, most subjects showed less fatigue after a study session under the Vita-Lite than under the cool-white light. No significant differences in subjective estimates of fatigue were identified. A newly designed graphic technique was used to illustrate and support the data analysis and implications were drawn about the use of environmental information by educators and designers. A 26-item bibliography and appendices of related material are included. (Author)",

The institutions were: Cerritos College, New York University, Northwestern University, and the University of California at Los Angeles. Measures of &quot;success&quot; in school and of postgraduate performance were collected from each of the subjects. These criteria were then related to the screening battery and other selected demographic variables. Included in the battery were measures of intellectual ability, mechanical aptitude, and emotional stability. Step-wise multiple regression analyses were conducted with the criterion  measures from school and postgraduate performance. Results indicated that different sets of predictors and attributes were significant at each of the institutions, and that the attributes needed for &quot;success&quot; in school differed in certain respects from those needed for postgraduate &quot;success.&quot; In general, depending upon the criteria used, a high degree of precision can be achieved in predicting &quot;success&quot; in orthotic-prosthetic education.

Similarly, institutions are able to receive applicants in order to fill otherwise empty spaces in their student bodies. In the current survey, 447 institutions were polled; of this number 256 responded (57.6%). Responding institutions reported 129,778 openings, in terms of actual numerical estimates. It is necessary to remember that this final total, as well as the totals given for individual states, will represent minimum openings only. The trend toward \"open  admissions\" policies is increasing among western colleges and universities. In the current survey, 81 two- and four-year schools indicated that they employ such a policy with respect to enrollment. We were able to assign numerical estimates toward arriving at state vacancy totals only when they were given by the institutions. But most open admissions policies did not allow for numerical estimates, hence state totals are minimums. (Author)",

A review of the various causal factors offered in explaining this discrimination is given. The second part of the paper is concerned with the quality of work obtained by women and men in two education classes, those with four years of college, and those with five or more years of college. Descriptive characteristics of work for detailed occupations, taken from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, are applied to 1960 Census of Population occupation data. The qualitative characteristics include: intellectual requirements; educational and training requirements; physical working conditions; interests and temperaments; and  socio-economic prestige levels of each occupation. This analysis indicates that in general the work available to college educated women is less challenging, utilizes their training to a lesser degree, offers little opportunity for work with abstractions or of a creative nature, and has lower socio-economic prestige, as compared to men with the same education. Custom, labor market institutions, and discrimination are the prime causal factors for these differences. (Author)",

Forms of British expansion are discussed. One of these is the new 2-year Dipolma of Higher Education that, according to the government's recent White House paper on education, may be designed as a terminal qualification in its own right, or as a basis for subsequent education for teaching and other professions or for degree courses in polytechnics and universities. The Dipolma, it is pointed out, may serve to diversify educational opportunities and introduce greater flexibility in the pattern of higher education; on the  contrary, if it is standardized, it may fasten a new rigidity on the system. The final paper points out deficiencies in the planning and coordination of the University and polytechnic sectors, emphasizes the necessity for designing the whole of higher education, and outlines the need to articulate the parts of a comprehensive and diversified system if the British are to plan &quot;the accommodation of future numbers of students, the future balance of work between the sectors, the future types of course and the future academic communities, entirely free from the suppositions of the past.&quot; (Editor)",

Population and participation data provides evidence that the Regents have grossly overestimated Ohio higher education enrollment and that 2-year colleges and technical schools will replace urban 4-year universities as the fastest growing by 1975. Private schools must move from the declining appeal of religious differentiation to flexible or more innovative programs, small size, and  faculty-student relationships. Research in financing higher education is needed not only in the area of cost but also regarding price, income and cross elasticities among various socio-economic groups. (Author/MJM)",

Analysis of physician staff members' patterns of patient management with respect to these indices led to individualized educational effort for each physician staff member. One year later, physicians' patterns of patient management had changed, and values of the indices for the hospital showed quantifiable improvement in the quality and efficiency of care. An educational researcher collaborated with a physician to interpret data and formulate researchable questions. The collaboration suggests an important role for an educational researcher in the development and implementation of criteria for quality of health care. (Author)",

        "description":"A mathematical model is developed for the expansion of facilities at different campuses of the University of California for a given sequence of enrollment forecasts. Based on total projected enrollments for the University system, the model computes a minimum total cost expansion program, i.e., the stages at which to expand existing campuses or to build new ones, and the enrollments that should be allocated to those campuses. It is formulated as a network-flow problem in which nonzero flows on certain arcs incur fixed charges; however, for computational purposes the problem may be reduced to a linear integer program in binary variables. The model does not include such factors as graduate-undergraduate mix, departmental mix, departmental sizes, or restrictions on tenure faculty,  but rather is oriented towards a method of accommodating gross enrollments.

The problem is to find control strategies which will bring about desired changes in these proportions. This report is confined to investigating what can be achieved by controlling the numbers of new appointments made into each grade. It is assumed that movements within the system and to the outside would be governed by time-homogeneous transition probabilities. A number of theorems are presented showing that not all structures can be attained and that some which are attainable cannot be maintained. Some bounds are given for the length of time needed to achieve the goal when this is possible. A number of suboptimal strategies are  proposed and their performance is studied empirically. Suggestions are made for further research. Finally, a nontechnical summary of this analysis is given at the beginning of this report. (Author)",

Both utilize a matrix of faculty input coefficients to transform a vector of student enrollment projections into a forecast of required faculty members. The purpose of the present investigation was twofold: (1) to explore the computational feasibility of a linear workload model that predicts the demand for University of California faculty by department rather than by the currently used subject matter groups; (2) to determine whether the faculty input coefficients are sufficiently stable over time to provide meaningful forecasts. The first section of the report describes the dimensions of the departmental model, and proposes a meaningful  method of aggregation. In the second section, several sets of Berkeley faculty input coefficients for the years 1963-1966 are presented, together with an analysis of the instability evident in several of them. (Author)",

It is assumed that the system is in equilibrium in the sense that the flow rate of new appointments is equal to the sum of resignation, retirement, and death rates. Several models were formulated and discussed at the University of California in the fall of 1967; it soon became apparent that there was a need for a simple, informal explanation and discussion of the more complicated statistical models used to predict faculty movements, promotions, resignations, and changes in rank and age distributions with the passage of time for the planning purposes of  institutional administrators. This report is intended to be such a device for explaining the underlying patterns of tenure and nontenure personnel movements, and as a model for estimating the magnitude of these flows and the qualitative effect of new appointments on promotions policies.

However, the existing literature does not demonstrate conclusively whether schooling and ability are complementary determinants of earnings. In particular, recent publications by John Hause and by Paul Taubman and Terence Wales reach opposite conclusions on the existence of an interaction effect. Interestingly enough the two studies make use of the same data set, the NBER-TH sample. The author reexamines and reestimates various tests for the existence of an interaction in the NBER-TH data. He concludes that despite strong theoretical considerations in support of an interaction effect there is very little statistical evidence for a significant interaction. The theoretical importance of an interaction effect is  briefly discussed, followed by a discussion of the Hause and Taubman and Wales tests. Finally, various specifications of the earnings function are estimated and exact tests for an interaction are made. The effect of alternative specifications and tests on the results are compared.

In the first part of the questionnaire, subjects responded with their perceptions of how much influence each of the five groups (students, student government, faculty, administration, and trustees) currently has in campus affairs and how much influence each group should have. While the majority of respondents expressed a preference for a high level of influence in each group on most issues, disagreement occurred on whose influence should predominate. Trustees had the closest correspondence in their ratings of current and ideal patterns of influence, and students' current and ideal  ratings were least alike. In the second part of the questionnaire, each group rated the current and ideal level of importance of 29 goal statements. While the groups were more alike than unlike in their ratings, students and faculty had the highest level of agreement and trustees had the least strong agreement with other groups. Generally, there was less agreement on what the relative importance of goals should be than on how important goals actually are. Respondents indicated in the third part of the questionnaire how acceptable certain roles and attitudes were for the institution. Traditional means of influencing society were most acceptable to all groups. (Author)",

It is directed toward academic administrators, although others in higher education may find it useful. Accountability was treated as an essential set of transactions present in every relationship involving two or more individuals or agencies where: (1) there are expectations regarding performance, (2) those involved cannot remain in continuous proximity, and (3) at least one of those involved has the inclination and capability of influencing the behavior of one or more of the others. It was assumed that accountability is already functioning in all existing institutions and that it would probably be more congenial and productive if  improvements could be made in those activities involving: (1) establishing and clarifying expectations, (2) obtaining and disseminating quality information, and (3) making adaptive responses. A review of current conditions regarding accountability in relation to undergraduate instruction would on the surface suggest that almost any change would be an improvement, proposed changes must be evaluated in terms of the threat posed to institutional autonomy and academic freedom.

        "description":"This paper describes a computer model that was developed for use to predict the effects of operating the universities in the province of Ontario on a year round basis. The apparent advantage in going to year round operation of universities is the saving in capital costs of buildings and other facilities. This can be achieved because the student enrollment is spread more evenly over the twelve month year and therefore fewer students are in attendance at any one time. The disadvantage of year round operation is the increase in operational costs due to increased instruction costs associated with offering courses year round and also other costs associated with opening the university facilities all year. Whether any particular program of year round operation results in a net saving  over the standard two term program depends on many factors and is the purpose of this model. This study was undertaken on behalf of the Ontario Commission on Post Secondary Education. The paper describes how key variables were identified, the method of analysis and the important conclusions derived from the results of the model. Particular attention is given to the problems encountered in obtaining data and how these problems were overcome by using a parametric approach. This allowed a sensitivity analysis to be performed whereby key variables were assigned different values and the sensitivity of the costs to these changes was observed. (Author)",

Some of the more reliable position indicators of tenure trends are faculty-by-rank distribution, potential faculty eligible for tenure and actual tenured faculty rates. These trends indicate that the number of tenured faculty is increasing at a rate of .5 to .7 percent per year. In reviewing tenure policies, institutions must be able to deal with future program shifts, demands of collective bargaining, federal and state financial cutbacks, and normal higher costs to retain tenured faculty. Several solutions  applied to problems stemming from too many tenured faculty include quotas, equalized rank distribution, early retirement benefits, term contracts, more temporary appointments, appointment of new faculty only to lower ranks, and general slowdown of rate of promotion. Another alternative for resolving the tenure problem involves the concept of flexible dollars. These are dollars not committed because of tenure, job security, or other relatively fixed forms of financial obligations. In analyzing institutional situations, tenure commitment calculations are based on dollars rather than on positions. Normally 10 to 15 percent must be added to an institution's tenured personnel percentage figure to obtain actual dollar commitment. (Author)",

In developing a plan for planning for a State community college system, such questions as these must be answered: why plan? who plans? what is to be included in the planning? what is the time frame for planning? Five general processes, each a subsystem of activities, tasks, resources, policies, and procedures, are involved in the planning cycle for Florida: (1) an assessment of the conditions and environment of the community college system; (2) an assessment of societal needs the college is responsible for considering; (3) a definition of goals and setting of objectives based on the needs assessment; (4) a determination of a program of action to achieve the objectives; and (5) an  assessment of progress toward achieving the objectives. The Community College System Plan is designed to produce a document specifying clear goals and objectives for the State system. Involved in developing such a plan are: status assessment, needs assessment, evaluation of the current long-range plan, statement of assumptions, identification and documentation of system-wide goals, and development of the planning procedures manual. College Planning Systems should be developed to serve the management and planning needs of the individual colleges. The Community College Program Plan and Budget should state goals, objectives, and resource requirements for the State for a multi-year period. The Statewide Plan, when completed, should include the purpose of the plan, program plans and budgets,  and assessment of the prior year long-range system plan. An implementation schedule and program structure are appended. (KM)",

For career curricula, the following are considered: community, State and National need and acceptance; available jobs, pay; enrollment, charge-backs; Cooperation with other colleges; approval of certain State agencies; approval of national accrediting association; and cost. For general studies, student need, enrollment and cost are considered. Various offices, committees, individuals and outside agencies are involved in curriculum design, supervision, implementation, and evaluation. During the next few years curriculum development will be limited somewhat by  space problems and the nationwide drop in college enrollments. Probably no new curricula will be developed in the baccalaureate area. Special interest programs for students will be implemented from time to time. An Election '74 program is now under development. Courses as extensions of existing curricula will be added from time to time, and some new disciplines, such as astronomy, may be added. The thrust in curriculum development during the next five years will be in career education. (KM)",

Two examples of the response from community colleges to the need to restructure are: (1) competency-based learning--Minnesota  Metropolitan State College and Vermont Community College; and (2) the cluster college concept--New York's Rockland Community College, California's Chabot Community College, and Illinois's DuPage Community College.

Comparisons are also made between students entering private and public junior colleges. The characteristics and attributes are: Level of Educational Aspiration, College Choice Factors, Family Income, Racial/Ethnic Background, Type of Anticipated Housing During the First Year of College, Planned Extra Curricular Activities. The samples used were drawn from ACT Class Profile tapes containing information supplied by students who took the American College Testing Program's Assessment during the 1967-68, 1969-70, and 1971-72 test years. A total of 546,006 students (283,352 males  and 258,654 females) from 275 institutions, including 69 two-year colleges (58 public and 11 private), comprised the study population. The breakdown as to college type was: 2-year colleges 72,451, 4-year colleges 49,406, master's-level colleges 195,627, and doctoral-level universities 224,522. The study results are provided in two sections--an analysis of the percentage distribution of each variable by year for all four institution types, and a comparison of the distribution for each of the variables between students in public and private junior colleges for all years combined. The study data are provided in 14 tables. The results of the study show that, in general, substantial differences exist between the distribution of characteristics of students entering junior colleges and those  entering other colleges and universities.

The terms compared were five, five and one-half, and eight weeks. Questionnaires were mailed to 1,230, or 20%, of the summer student body; 524 students responded. To ascertain faculty opinions, questionnaires were distributed to all 133 faculty members who taught during the 1971 (8 and 5 weeks) and 1972 (8 and 5- weeks) summer sessions; a total of 95, or 71%, answers were processed. Results of the study showed that the shorter term was more popular with the Western Campus students and that term  length influenced the mean number of credit hours carried per student at that campus. The capability of completing a program of studies earlier than normal was most frequently cited as the reason for enrolling in a summer session; enrollment was not related to the length of the session. Most students were satisfied with the length of the term in which they were enrolled. Nearly all faculty respondents considered term length to be of some importance in attracting summer students. Summer GPA for 1972 was significantly higher than the GPA's of the 1971-72 academic year. There were significant differences between eight-week and five-and-one-half-week GPA's, the eight-week mean being 3.01 and the five and one-half mean being 2.61. These differences appeared to be related to campus influences.  Twhenty-six tables and eight appendixes provide the data. (DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of the research and development described in this report is to implement and operate an on-line, computerized regional library system that makes available to faculty and students in individual colleges and universities the library resources throughout a region, while at the same time decelerating the rate of rise of per-student library costs. The major intellectual problem solved in the course of the investigation was the design of on-line computer files of bibliographic records and a technique for efficient retrieval of bibliographic data from the files employing derived, truncated search keys. The research and development culminated in the successful implementation of an on-line union catalog and shared cataloging system. A variety of libraries, large and small, had  demonstrated that not only could the system slow the rate of rise of per-student costs, but also could effect net savings for libraries. The conclusions of this report are that the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) system does make available library resources throughout a region to individuals at a participating institution, that it decelerates the rate of rise of per-student costs and can effect net savings, and is transferrable to other regions.

More scholarship and creative work on the part of academic librarians are demanded, creating a need for library faculty members who have the ability to keep abreast of new developments in the library field, to integrate their knowledge with the teaching functions of the University, and to process informational materials for effective use. Although it is important that librarians gain specialized knowledge in order to be promoted into higher academic ranks, it is imperative that their own professional degrees be considered as equal in importance to those of their colleagues in other subject fields and that librarians who show competency in their specialities be assured of rewards similar to those  acquired by their colleagues in teaching fields. The tenured library faculty will review the standards and qualifications of librarians annually. Inducements will be provided for superior librarians to join the library staff, to give all librarians opportunities to contribute to the growth of the University, and to attain their highest potential development. It is imperative that librarians continue to have full faculty status with the academic rank, tenure, promotion, sabbaticals, leaves, and other benefits accorded to their teaching colleagues. It is equally important that they achieve the same expertise in their fields as is expected of the teaching faculty. (Author)",

The consortium was initiated to increase the capacity for bibliographic information retrieval supportive of the delivery of patient care in the hospital environment. Secondarily, it addresses itself to the information needs of the dentist as manifested in both institutional and non-institutional relationships. Both purposes address themselves to the extension of MEDLINE services at the local or &quot;Basic Unit&quot; level as the hospital is now termed, and to the needs of the health practitioner in his clinical setting. This extension, conceptually, was possible through the introduction of MEDLINE into the hospital environment with  the consortium arrangement as an experimental methodology for such extension. The data and observations in this report help to identify the members of the consortium, and provide a rationale for their selection for this experiment. The broad outlines of the selection required, 1) involvement with dentistry, 2) diversity of services and teaching programs, 3) adequate libraries, 4) a history of community services, 5) an immediate capability for initiating MEDLINE service, and 6) an acceptance of the consortium concept. The report also contains a chronology of the development of the consortium. (Author/SJ)",

Persistent library crime, such as pilferage, theft and vandalism, represents much more than financial loss. It deprives the public of access to irreplaceable books, rare manuscripts and other reference materials. Equally important, it inflicts hardships on budget-tight libraries wishing to replace increasingly expensive books. In recognition of such factors, Burns Security Institute, a private research unit devoted to the study of crime and how to better cope with it in the institutional, industrial and commercial areas, undertook a national survey on library security. Two-page questionnaires were returned by 255 public libraries in 39 states with annual circulation totaling more than 92  million volumes. The items covered in the survey, and reported upon in this volume, are: book theft, security controls, fire alarms, burglary alarms, guards, book recovery, overdue books, exhibits protection, violent crimes, major security problems, and improving security.

This paper describes and comments on a training program for community librarians in New Mexico. The program was initiated by the New Mexico State Library with the assistance of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), using as resources a Loyola University of Chicago correspondence study course, several practicing  librarians in New Mexico, and an out-of-state consultant. Planning for the program began December 30, 1970, and phases I and II of the program were conducted over a period of approximately nine months in 1971. (Author)",

The market system is discussed at length and recommended because it provides maximum freedom of choice by parents, and enables the day care industry to evolve according to the needs of the children and parents it serves. Further recommendations include a key resources program (planning, technical assistance, start-up costs, facilities, etc.) to be implemented to help the market meet new demand without artificially raising prices and to insure entry  into the day care market of a variety of providers. Legislation guidelines are presented: (1) a voucher system giving parents purchasing power for day care services to accompany the key resource program, and (2) a national research program in child development.

Results were analyzed by means of a 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance, with the following variables: sex of Object Figure, sex of Identification Figure, and sex of subject.

(2) What might they be capable of doing in the context of a recognition test that they might not be able to do as effectively in the context of a free recall test? A total of 72 kindergarten-age children participated; half were assigned to the look instruction condition, half to the remember instruction condition. Two response measures figured in the assessment of each S's storage and retrieval activities: (1) the incidence of overt labelling, and (2) the number of correctly remembered stimuli in each of three retention tests. A three-way  analysis of variance was performed on the retention test data. Retention test data revealed an apparent hierarchy of retention test scores, with scores in the visual recognition test superior to those in the auditory recognition test, and scores in the auditory recognition test superior to those in the free recall test. Additional results are given. (CK)",

Learning is defined in the psychological literature either as a hypothetical mental ability or as a relationship between repeated stimulation and changes in performance. Both definitions are rejected. There are two implications of this analysis for children with problems in self-care, language, school subjects, and social behavior. First, it is more fruitful to refer to these children as children with specific problems than with learning disorders. Second, it suggests that findings from the experimental literature can readily be applied to helping the teacher help the child. (CK)",

At 36 weeks, 40 weeks (term), and 1, 3 and 8 months, the periodicity of both Active and Quiet Sleep was consistently in the 40-60 minute range. At all ages, the cycle time of one state was consistently longer than the other. The appearance of clear periodicities underlying both states and the similarity of the periodicities found in 36 week records to those found in much older infants' records indicated that this biological rhythm is basic  to human CNS functioning. The Index of Rhythmicity values in these records and other investigators' data suggest that this rhythm reaches a mature form by 36 weeks post-conception. (Author)",

To resolve this apparent contradiction, a test probing metaphoric capacity was devised. Matched groups of subjects ranging in age from 3 1/2 to 19 were required to indicate knowledge of the literal meanings of antonymous word pairs and then to project these terms into domains where they only apply in a metaphoric way. Though there was improvement with age, preschool children demonstrated considerable ability at this task; the order of difficulty of words and domains were regular across age, except for an isolated difficulty displayed by the preschool children in projecting words onto swatches of color; reasons for  matches differ markedly across ages. Whether metaphoric capacity is attributed to children appears to depend on whether the ability to select acceptable metaphors or an explicit awareness of the rationale for the metaphor is the criterion. The distinction between an operative skill and an awareness of its existence, and the preconditions for metaphoric competence are discussed. (Author)",

Children at each age witnessed the procedure under a fixed level of distraction, under instructions either to 'look' or 'remember,' and under one of three vicarious consequence treatments (reward, neutral, punishment). A series of analyses of the children's overt visual attention to the modeled activity and their recall revealed: (1) highly significant positive correlations between attention and recall, (2) a facilitation of attention and recall with instructions to remember, (3) a facilitation of attention and recall under vicarious reward and vicarious punishment treatments only when instructions were to  look, and (4) age increases in relevant overt attention and recall.

        "description":"A five-year study was conducted to evaluate the effects of varying intensities of family life education services on samples of high and low-income families (110 of each) in Montreal. The purpose was to provide these families with similar programs for one year and to study them longitudinally for three years to determine whether the programs resulted in measurable changes and if so to assess the durability of those changes. The main service provided was a traditional type nursery school for four-year-olds. Instruments to assess change included IQ tests (WPPSI and Draw-a-Person), stress measures (the Langner scale for the mothers and the Glidewell scale for the children), and a parent-attitude-to-childrearing scale (Hereford). Two years into the project, it was discovered that no  significant changes were being registered; it was then decided to add cognitive stimulation programs to the nursery schools and narrow the focus of the research to study cognitive changes in low-income children only. Results indicate that nursery schools with cognitive stimulation programs can produce modest improvements in IQ test performance of low-income children. (Author/CK)",

Two classes of elementary students participated in the experiment, one a sixth grade of denied children and the other a fifth grade identified as gifted on an intelligence test. Each group of children participated in two sessions per week over an 8-week period of sequenced task-directed conversations about their feelings regarding specifically stated situations. The treatment was conducted by the investigator. An instrument was designed which caused narrative reaction in written form to visual and auditory stimuli. The instrument was administered prior to and following the treatment period. Scoring was  based upon teacher and investigator word counts from each subject's written narratives. Interjudge reliability exceeded .96 for all four administrations of the instrument. A \"t\" of 4.42 and 3.24 was found in the sixth and gifted fifth groups, respectively, exceeding significance at .01 in both cases. It was concluded that the Human Development Program procedures constitute a measurable effective treatment for the generation of effective linguistic tools. (Author)",

The intervention technique employs an intensive educational program for the very young high-risk child, beginning before six months of age. Using survey data, a maternal IQ was designated the basis for selection of a group of newborns. A two-phase program was initiated to prepare the mothers for employment opportunities and to improve their homemaking and child-rearing skills. An infant stimulation program was also implemented. The program was designed to facilitate intellectual development of very young children. It is concerned with (1) physical location which promotes learning, (2) a staff to manage and  arrange instruction for children, and (3) the educational program. Development was assessed by an intensive schedule of measurements, including measures of physical maturation, standardized and experimental measures of developmental schedules of infant adaptive behavior, tests of general intelligence, an array of experimental learning tasks, measures of motivation and social development, and measures of language development. The success of this program requires an active community service program for which there is no previous model. (CK)",

(4) What sort of parent-child experiences are more common in families of early readers than of non-early readers? (5) To what extent does early reading relate to such variables as birth order, family size, parent education and so on? Studies discussed include the Durkin study. A pilot study was conducted in which  children were matched for age, sex, IQ scores and socioeconomic status. T-tests for matched pairs were done for each of the variables in the study.

The first examined the role of verbal instructions in generalized imitation by comparing the use of a \"do this\" instruction with no such instruction and the use of positive reinforcement with no reinforcement. The tenacity of generalized imitation in this study led to the second experiment, designed to determine whether generalized imitation would occur in the total absence of verbal instructions. The evidence in the first two studies of the ineffectiveness of observation of a differentially performing model in producing discriminative imitation led to two further studies. Observation of a differentially responding confederate proved ineffective in both studies, but the observational procedure  was not used until the Ss had a history of responding nondifferentially. Consequently, another experiment was conducted to determine whether this history might be responsible for the results; in this experiment, observation of differentially performing adult was made from the beginning of the study. Differential responses in imitation of the adult were noted throughout this experiment. Another experiment was conducted to study the effects of observation of the same or different behavior and the use or lack of reinforcement. The data together suggest that generalized imitation is largely a function of the priming procedures used to generate the imitative behavior. (KM)",
