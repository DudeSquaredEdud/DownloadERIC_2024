          "Myhill, Debra"],
        "description":"Set in the context of international concerns about boys' achievements in writing, this article presents research that explores gender differences or similarities in linguistic competence in writing. Drawing on the results of a large-scale analysis of the linguistic characteristics of secondary-aged writers, we outline gender difference in the sample. The article explains the limited differences revealed through this analysis but highlights the repeated pattern of differences in boys' writing, mirroring parallel patterns in able writers. The findings are discussed in light of the prevalent discourse of difference that permeates academic, professional, and political consideration of gender and writing. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"In this article we offer a research-based response to and critique of approaches suggested to address boys' literacy and pedagogical reform. Our aim is to open up a dialogue by examining the conceptual limits imposed by casting boys as particular sorts of literate subjects. We argue against officially sanctioned literacy practices that fail to engage with research-based literature that raises serious questions about gender reform initiatives. We suggest caution and further informed dialogue in response to media generated public concerns and educational policies aimed at remasculinizing schools rather than interrogating gender binaries.",

        "description":"Using data from the reading component of the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (N = 113,050), the effects of gender and curricular track for nine sub-scores of reading achievement were investigated. Only students indicating that they did not receive additional programming support were included in the analysis. Gender accounted for less than one per cent of variance in reading achievement. Gender differences for each curricular track were in the close-to-zero and small range. The results suggest that any observed differences may be of little practical consequences, and that the notion of under-achievement of boys' reading achievement has been greatly overstated.

It reflects on the swathe of populist discourse centring on boys, and on literacy, that drives a potentially divisive education agenda. In providing more nuanced analyses of the debates surrounding the disputed territory of boys, literacies, and schooling, the article offers examples of disaggregated literacy test data to demonstrate the importance of adopting a &quot;which boys&quot; and &quot;which girls&quot; approach to the issues. The article also provides brief coverage of the Success for Boys program, introduced in Australia in 2006, that encourages teachers to swim against the tide of populism by embracing the agenda in all of its complexity.

When the variance due to differences in class size and socio-economic status was removed, the correlations between the number of students with special needs and the average class achievement scores were slightly, but significantly, positive (0.05 to 0.07), suggesting that the presence of students with special needs does not adversely affect achievement of other students.

One task was a closed, force-choice task, the other, an open-ended task. Boys and girls had similar interests, either preferring stories or liking information books and stories to the same degree. Yet boys and girls perceived that boys prefer information texts and girls prefer narratives. The children's perceptions reflect gendered stereotypes. (Contains 6 tables and 1 note.)",

Although all had their limitations, the novels offered more complex renderings of gendered identity in the lives of female and male adolescent characters, addressed the effects of enforced traditional masculinity, and productively, if only momentarily, disrupted the connection between sex and gender in ways that allow for engagement with alternative notions of masculinity. Studying masculinity in these contemporary young adult novels about girls' lives offers much for students and teachers to consider in analyzing masculinity and femininity in texts and in life.

The focus of this article is Nicholas, a grade-7 boy, who was identified as challenged by the literacy curriculum. The analysis utilizes a multiliteracies framework (The New London Group, 2000) and the four resources reading model (Luke &amp; Freebody, 1999) to interpret Nicholas' progress during reading circles. Results suggest that multiliteracies, which interweave scaffolding, diverse texts, and meaningful tasks, can encourage agency for student learning.",

        "description":"In the context of information and communication technologies in five Newfoundland coastal communities, this article deals with participatory research and outreach. Outreach in these communities, reeling from the near-collapse of the fishery and struggling to survive in a climate of neo-liberal restructuring, is considered to be a holistic educational enterprise involving new technologies and the popular media, schools, and their district officers, clinics and regional health care providers, and children and adults as lifelong learners. Based on five approaches that emerged in the final year of one project--the work of an on-site liaison, a residential workshop, community workshops, reports through popular media, and contacts with outside organizations--the author argues that outreach should be recognized as integral to all stages of participatory research.

Levels of self-efficacy remained relatively low for teacher candidates across each of the four years of this program. Most candidates suggested summative purposes for assessment and only a minority expressed formative purposes. They favoured observational techniques and personal communication. (Contains 3 tables.

While generally supporting the &quot;big&quot; rules such as no weapons, students engaged more critically with minor ones. We drew on Foucault's governmentality studies to discuss students' successful compliance. We evaluated students' contestation of the rules, rule-breaking as potential resistance, and rule breaking as a manifestation of students' desire. Although students challenge school rules, they are &quot;already caught&quot; within the dominant language that frames the rules and their top-down application, with little sense of themselves as potent political actors.

In Canada, and especially Ontario, school boards are following the lead of many American institutions in establishing key partnerships with university faculties of education and provincial governing bodies to best prepare and induct beginning teachers into the profession. The objective of this qualitative research study was to examine the perceptions of 173 beginning teachers in Ontario participating in purposely selected exemplary induction programs. Four core categories emerged that showed conceptual differences in how teacher cohorts over a 2-year period understood their induction; namely, induction as exceeding beginning teachers' expectations, their appreciation of meaningful support, their recognition of teacher leadership, and the disconnect between in-services and practice. This study draws attention to the professional enculturation of beginning teachers, but more notably, compels a practical reconsideration of how induction is defined in light of beginning teacher growth and sustainability.

        "description":"In his book \"The World Is Flat,\" Friedman (2005) argued that people have under-appreciated the role that humiliation plays in terrorism. If it is true, that humiliation plays a role in terrorism, what role might this under-appreciated emotion play in middle school? If terrorists act, in part, based on humiliation, how do middle school students act when they experience this emotion? To answer these questions, the authors interviewed 10 middle school teachers and 10 students. They asked them about times they (or their students or peers) were humiliated and what happened. The responses from the teachers and students about the ways that students are humiliated clustered into three major areas: (1) bullying; (2) teacher behavior; and (3) remedial reading. In addition, the authors searched the ERIC database for documentation about the impact humiliation has on middle school students. This article begins by discussing the findings from the authors' interviews and surveys. Then it describes the effects of humiliation on middle school learners and examines the perspectives of teachers and students on each of these issues, including: (1) drug and alcohol use; (2) attendance problems; (3) dropping out of school; (4) pregnancy; and (5) suicide. Recommendations for reducing humiliation in the middle school are presented. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"The objective of this study was to describe the predictors of substance use relapse of American Indian (AI) women up to one year following substance abuse treatment. Relapse is defined as any use of alcohol or drugs in the past 30 days at the follow-up points. Data were collected from AI women in a 45-day residential substance abuse treatment program. Predictors include distal (in time) proximal (recent), and intrapersonal factors. Results indicated that intrapersonal factors showed the strongest relationship with relapse, followed by proximal and distal factors. Negative messages about using alcohol or drugs from the client's father while growing up may have had an impact on whether the client used alcohol at 6 months. Conflicts with other people and being in the company of alcohol or drug users were highly predictive of relapse. While craving was highly predictive of substance use at follow up, self-efficacy was highly predictive of no substance use. Knowledge about predictors of relapse among this population should be used as a guide toward individual treatment planning. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The present experiment investigated whether the gambling of American Indian (AI) and non-AI participants would be sensitive to the actions and/or ethnicity of another gambler (i.e., a confederate) when playing a slot-machine simulation. Eight male AIs and eight male non-AIs participated in five gambling sessions. In one, the participant gambled alone. In the other four, the participant played in the presence of a confederate of the same or different ethnicity who gambled the entire session or quit after playing five times. The gambling of the AI and non-AI participants did not differ, nor was either group sensitive to whether the confederate was AI or non-AI. Gambling behavior was altered by the confederate's actions, with participants gambling less when the confederate left the session than when alone or when the confederate stayed and gambled. These results suggest that the differences in gambling problems between AIs and non-AIs reported in the overall literature may not be a function of ethnicity per se. They also suggest that the actions of other gamblers may inhibit gambling, which may have treatment implications. (Contains 1 footnote and 1 figure.)",

During 2002, she spent nine months reviewing and renewing her statistical sources for use in nonfiction essays and presentations. Those statistics that she has been able to renew have been consistent with sources she used a decade ago, indicating very little progressive change in socioeconomic behavior toward Native Americans in the field of education. Significantly fewer statistics are available today than a decade ago, and even the quantity of statistics can be interpreted as a cultural indicator in terms of interracial relations. For the purposes of statistical presentation, the author has created a fictional Native American female character, Jane Doe.

        "description":"Using multicultural literature in the classroom has become a focus in recent years as classrooms have become more diverse. While offering teachers and students many opportunities to gain broader understandings about the world, the use of multicultural literature also presents challenges. The challenge is not only obtaining high quality multicultural texts, but the greater challenge may be creating an awareness among teachers of the important role multicultural literature plays in the lives of children. In this article, the authors explore prospective teachers' understandings of the use of multicultural literature in the classroom. Specifically, the authors examined changes in their beliefs and proposed practices based on new understandings regarding the importance of using literature in the classroom that portrays a variety of cultures, themes and views. They collected student response papers from approximately 100 preservice teachers enrolled in elementary language arts methods courses. Data were analyzed on emerging themes using the following four-phase process: (1) coding the data; (2) developing themes from the data; (3) defining themes based on the findings; and (4) connecting and interrelating themes. During the development and defining of themes, five categories were identified: (1) \"it opened my eyes\"; (2) \"finding yourself\"; (3) \"opening their minds\"; (4) \"not just African-American\"; and (5) \"it's my responsibility.\" Implications for educators are presented.",

        "description":"Service-learning is a wide-spread educational strategy in K-16 education. Currently 64% of all public schools and 83% of public high schools have community service. Researchers have proclaimed the many benefits of service learning in terms of student empowerment, but does it have the power to create a counter-hegemony that provides an alternative worldview to transform society? In this literature review, the author examines the effectiveness and limitations of service-learning practices and presents recommendations to move service-learning outcomes from individual student empowerment to social transformation. The method for gathering the literature was a cross-reference of related educational issues: service-learning, social justice, multicultural education, and citizenship education. Although the opinions and analyses presented in the literature are varied, both supporters and critics concur that service-learning has the potential to be a powerful tool for transformative social change. After a thorough examination of the literature, the author concludes that service-learning can be a counter-hegemonic practice to affect social transformation. (Contains 1 table.)",

Many students have been victims themselves of violent, verbal, and physical assaults. Classroom teachers and educators continue to address this issue locally in classrooms and in their schools. Amid the various questions that emerge from the need to address violence and equity issues in society, three central questions stand out: What is Peace Education? What is the role of Multicultural Education in support of Peace Education? What is the role of Teacher Education Programs in promoting multicultural education, peace education, and social justice in the curriculum? In this article, the authors examine the literature related to institutional and teacher education reform and change related to multicultural education, peace education and social justice. A transformational model of cultural competence seems to describe the particular changes that have taken place at a small, private liberal arts university. The authors' reflections regarding peace education, justice, and equality and the implications for practice in teacher preparation programs are based on such a transformational model of cultural competence.

        "author":["Clark, Christine"],
        "description":"With the still relatively recent advent widespread technological innovation in the global marketplace, leading to the \"information age,\" massive automation, and corporate capital flight to Third World labor markets, future leaders are still needed, but increasingly, future workers are not. As result, students previously educated to be future workers are now educated, or rather miseducated or even diseducated, to be future prisoners. In 1977, Foucault posited the society as one predicated on a system of control originating from the disciplinary structures, beginning with indentured servitude, evolving into slavery and the military industrial complex, and culminating today in the prison industrial complex. These disciplinary structures impart social order throughout the population--into each family and individual--by means of the institutions of schools, social service providers, and places of worship, among others. Though disciplinary structures that employ negative sanctions are generally the least effective form of social control, the kinds of disciplinary structures the society has used and continues to use are, in fact, based on the idea of social control through the imposition of ever-increasing negative sanctions (Foucault, 1977). In this article, the author presents statistics which clearly illustrate the impact of this approach to social control on the establishment and proliferation of schools as breeding grounds for prisons. Furthermore, the author states that toward the development of multicultural education as a tool for reclaiming schools organized as breeding grounds for prisons, multicultural educators must: (1) Provide a point of entry for the schools as breeding grounds for prisons theme within the field of education by locating it in relationship  to parallel ones in economics and criminal justice, among others, from both an historical and present-day context; (2) Offer an overview of the roles that the field of education as a whole, and teacher education in particular, must play in seeking to prevent schools from becoming breeding grounds for prisons and to reinvent those already functioning in that manner; (3) Examine the current curricular and pedagogical practices in teacher education that encourage the proliferation of schools as breeding grounds for prisons; (4) Investigate the educational practices of in-service teachers that make schools into breeding grounds for prisons; (5) Articulate, in great detail, what good education looks like it--the kind that dismantles schools as breeding grounds for prisons and reconceptualizes them as imparters of critically conscious learning, laboratories for the practice of democratic citizenship, and producers of leaders and practitioners predisposed to progressive action in all academic and professional arenas; (6) strategize as to how to establish and maintain schools that can and do provide the kind of good education that precludes the breeding of students for prison, given the economic and political machinery invested in the status quo; and (7) Discuss the specific responsibilities of leaders and practitioners in teacher education, teacher education policy, teacher education professional organizations, teacher education schools and colleges, in-service teachers, students, and parents, among others, in revealing and dismantling schools functioning as breeding grounds for prisons, as well as in creating the new context in which good education can be realized.

To increase the graduation rates of students of color, the author suggests addressing the issue of the hidden curriculum, the unwritten and unspoken values, dispositions, and social and behavioral expectations that govern the interactions between teachers and students within schools. She challenges higher education administrators, faculty, researchers, and policymakers to develop and implement policies that would provide all students equal access to the academic cultural knowledge of postsecondary institutions. To maintain affirmative action as a cornerstone of recruitment process in higher education, the author stresses the importance of simultaneously developing new approaches for improving the retention of students of color and first-generation college students.",

From the founding of the nation to the new century, the presidents have set the tone of the nation in matters of race. For centuries, the ideology of the country has been one in which only one perspective that of the white, European man has been dominant. The presidents have had the power to change this perspective but have failed to do so for many reasons, such as greed, weakness, timidity. This article focuses on three presidents--Andrew Jackson, Woodrow Wilson, and Dwight D. Eisenhower--and their legacy to a nation still fighting towards racial equality. It examines the roles of Jackson, Wilson, and Eisenhower in leading the country. [For other articles in this series see EJ781910; EJ781919; EJ682498; and (4) EJ727797.]",

        "description":"The research presented in this article is just a step in the arduous task of defining the legacy of globalization on education as cultures are forced into new association via an international economic agenda. United States-Mexican interchanges have developed as a result of the encouragement for global economic activity provided by the increase in open trade during the last decades of the twentieth century. The economic changes engendered by the global activities are monitored and documented to ensure benefit to the corporate interests. However, in the country hosting U.S. factory industries, the rapidly escalating societal changes left in the wake of the economic activity, such as those in education, are seldom monitored or documented. In this article, the author presents a study which examines the impact of U.S. business involvement in Mexican education through philanthropic contributions that arise as social needs become obvious and through education and training provided to the employees of those businesses.

Racism, classism, sexism, equity, and social justice issues feature as generative themes (Freire, 1970), which underpin this educational project. One area of research in multicultural teacher education that this article investigates is the way in which White students have sought to make meaning of their own Whiteness in the midst of a plethora of claims regarding the pervasiveness and immutability of racism in America. In this article, the authors present four case studies which illustrate the different responses of White preservice teachers to a challenging multicultural environment. For some, providing them with the language of multicuturalism allowed them to articulate previous experiences, while for others the very language of multiculturalism was used to keep at bay the challenges that multicultural educational classes present.",

One is the color-blind-myth that Williams (1997) cites in her essay, \"The Emperor's New Clothes\": \"I don't think about color, therefore your problems don't exist,\" is the phrase that she attributes to this \"school of idealism\". The other is the notion of race as a social construct. Race is not inscribed in a gene, and therefore it is not natural but the product of human communal perception. What many half-hearted constructionists seem to forget over this valuable approach, however, is that thinking cannot stop there. Race matters exactly \"because\" it is socially constructed. But how can the attempts at colorblindness be reconciled, in a socio-political reality, with the understanding that here and now race \"is\" an influential factor? In this article, the author interrogates the tension that arises between these two perceptions. She positions her voice in the interstitial spaces between commonly-accepted concepts and binaries and comes up with an alternative perspective. (Contains 10 notes.)",

        "description":"The recognition, development and implementation of multicultural education in America is a relatively new and emerging idea. Prior to the middle of the previous century, the concept of addressing and providing a meaningful educational experience for all students, including students of color, was non-existent. In recent years, through the work of numerous educators (Banks, 1993; Banks, J. & Banks, C., 2004; Baptiste, 1979/1986/ 1994; Bennett, 1995; Boyer & Baptiste, 1996; Garcia, R.L., 1982; Gay, 1988/1994, 2004; Gollnick & Chinn, 1990; Nieto, 1992), not only has the concept of multicultural education begun to become a reality, it has become a driving force in curricular development. While these efforts by educators are important, the commitment of this country to multicultural education in American schools and on the international scene has not been significant (Spring, 2000). Part of this absence must be attributed to the lack of support and leadership from the President of the United Sates and his administration. Through the policies and actions of each President's individual administration, the role of multicultural education in this country is affected, both positively and negatively. In this paper, three presidents, John Quincy Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman, was examined as to their roles in multicultural education. While considering these three men, it may appear that there is no common theme connecting them other than that all of them occupied the office of President of the United States. There are, however, connections that can be made among them. One thread was the political backgrounds of these men. Each would reflect the beginnings, evolution, and change of political parties in this country. [For the Second Installment in this series, see EJ783087.]",

        "description":"For decades the National Science Foundation has been funding the development of instructional materials whose design is based upon the recommendations of educational research. These recommendations include the idea that learning be sequenced and organized using an experiential learning cycle or an instructional model such as the Biological Science Curriculum Study (BSCS) 5E Instructional Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate). More recent research studies such as those synthesized in \"How People Learn\" suggest that instruction address students' prior knowledge, help students connect new knowledge to a rich framework of big ideas, and support students in monitoring and taking control of their own learning. Over time, the work of curriculum developers in response to these recommendations has resulted in an extensive portfolio of research-based instructional materials that span the sciences disciplines.

For nearly twenty years, the Supreme Court had been silent on the issue while lower courts attempted to apply the rules announced in previous Supreme Court decisions. It is unclear what impact the &quot;Morse&quot; decision will have on the lower courts and the daily administration of schools.

        "description":"Knowing the great impact education has on a nation, the author decided to investigate the education systems in America and Japan. The aim of the study was to answer how educational systems or practices in Japan and America differ, and how Japanese practices might improve those of American educators and administrators. Besides many similarities, there are striking contrasts between American and Japanese views and visions of education, and they point to quite different directions and paths of reform in the two nations. While Americans are busy constructing common standards and benchmarks, developing and using more standardized tests for all students, and moving toward standards-based school reform, the Japanese seem to desire just the opposite--deconstructing uniform standards, moving away from the pressures of national exams, and focusing more on the interests and potential of each student, a goal that has often been ignored in Japanese culture and schools. The study suggests that Japan's education system enables teachers to motivate student learning through a well-rounded national curriculum, closely integrated through all subjects, that engages students and builds strong classroom relationships. In addition, a narrower curricular focus fosters a deeper understanding for students. Whole-class instruction helps Japanese schools motivate their students by emphasizing effort over ability, engaging students, building strong classroom relationships, and unifying students under a common goal.

First, the author examines cultural differences between Japan and America as a lens through which to look at these two countries. Then, Japanese and American schooling are compared in terms of four suggestions that the author's friend had proposed to improve American students' academic achievement. The four suggestions were: (1) more testing; (2) increased administrative oversight of teachers; (3) a return to basics; and (4) stronger discipline. Finally, the author shares a classroom model from a large-scale project and two simple yet effective ideas that offer promise for American students' academic, social, and ethical growth.",

One possible explanation for their occurrence is that educators become comfortable with familiar routines and believe they must be doing OK because that's the way schools have always operated. Another likely possibility involves a combination of factors including a lack of time, expertise, energy, or money to look thoughtfully into these issues.

        "author":["Cross, Tracy L."],
        "description":"It is believed by many that unsophisticated notions of elitism are the bane of the field of gifted education. Some claims of elitism are based on an interpretation of the founding of their country as inherently egalitarian. Educational opportunities that are tailored to student abilities are determined to be inherently elitist and therefore anti-egalitarian. Humility is often described as a corollary to egalitarianism. Obviously then, swagger would not be acceptable to those who hold these beliefs. This concern only seems to hold in the context of schooling, especially as it pertains to gifted students. The incubator of talent creates differing scripts for appropriate behavior across the varying domains of talent, but with more in common than different. As the talented emerge into their respective professional ranks, they are reborn into a world of vastly different cultures. Although many cultures of work exist, each with rules and regulations, swagger is manifest and even expected in many that celebrate world-class achievement. In this article, the author states that to understand greatness, one must be able to recognize it in others. Being appreciative of the greatness of others does not diminish the growth of the aspirant; it creates humility and it becomes a step in the direction of developing the talents of the individual. Requiring the intellectually gifted youth to maintain humility without swagger dooms them to ignorance as it inserts an unnecessary and disingenuous impediment to world-class performance. Not being able to recognize brilliance does not create egalitarianism, it creates mediocre performance.",

        "description":"Teaching in a regular classroom has become more complicated than ever with increased student diversity and pressure to connect learning experiences to educational standards and test preparation. Although teaching to the middle is often what occurs in traditional classrooms to meet required standards, it is neither an appropriate nor meaningful method of instruction for coping with the inclusion of both students who are gifted those who have learning disabilities or other disabling conditions. Differentiation of instruction, although challenging for the classroom teacher, is an effective approach that may resolve egalitarianism in education, where all students receive exactly the same educational experiences rather than \"everyone having an equal opportunity to actualize their learning potential.\" In this article, the authors present and discuss a third-grade differentiated unit on simple machines. The unit, taught over the course of 3 weeks, addressed all four forms of differentiation: (1) content--students learned different material based on their ability level; (2) process--using a hands-on approach to learning or reading from a book based on a student's preference; (3) product--choice in end product to turn in to teacher; and (4) environment--quiet independent study areas and small group work areas. The primary focus of this article is on exploring process differentiation (tiered lessons and options in expressing required learning) in the context of a flexibly grouped learning environment. The authors' goal is to help teachers gain perspective and insight about effective differentiation in elementary classroom settings and that science is a natural means of connecting curriculum to students' lives.

Students' responses to 3 surveys measuring civic responsibility, civic behavior, and leadership skills showed that enhanced civic responsibility, particularly a greater awareness of civic issues and a stronger connection and commitment to the community, was found among the students who participated in the service-learning program. Significant differences were not found for civic behaviors and leadership skills as a result of participation in the service-learning program. Longer term studies with students and examination of the type of service-learning activities students choose to get involved in are suggested to corroborate the positive outcomes of the service-learning program.

Through a descriptive case study design (Berg, 2004; Merriam, 1988), an action research approach (Stringer, 2004) and self-study methods, the teacher-researcher explored student perception of control, and its influence on motivation (i.e., achieving and underachieving performance patterns) for different assignment structures. Findings indicate that gifted underachievers and advanced underachievers, alike, preferred the student-constructed assignment structure and self-assessment. The majority of gifted achievers and advanced achievers preferred the student-constructed assignment structure as well; however, they were evenly divided on their preference of the teacher assessment and the self-assessment.

It was found that both teachers and students shared similarities in their views of conflict and in their management of  interpersonal problems at school. Conflict was generally perceived to be a negative phenomenon. In addition teachers and students commonly used a limited range of strategies, relying mostly on familiar and reactive conflict management techniques. Resolving  conflict though compromising and problem solving was rare. Student and teacher perceptions of conflict accounted for their handling of conflict. The need to reconsider the value of conflict as positive for learning and living within and beyond the school is raised.",

These literacy stakeholders defined self-directed learning as a combination of factors related to giving learners choices over what, how, and when to learn. They saw self-selected subject areas, assignment topics, learning pace, and attendance schedules as means to nurture self-direction by adult literacy students and other adult learners.

A strong belief among policymakers and public as well as private funding agencies is that test scores are directly related to the quality of teaching effectiveness. This relationship implies that there could be a direct causality among teacher preparation, teacher quality, and student achievement. The terms \"teaching  effectiveness\" and \"teacher effect\" are often used interchangeably in these conversations.  This article discusses several aspects of each construct, particularly: (1) teacher effects; (2) teaching or teacher effectiveness; and (3) an educational model of school and teacher  effects on student achievement.

Zero tolerance policies are rigid mandates of predetermined consequences for specific student misconduct. Common sense and fairness are not  necessarily served by the application of inflexible disciplinary rules that do not address the circumstances surrounding particular situations. A disciplinary decision can have long-term implications for a student's future career, as well as to his or her perception of the educational system. This paper provides three case studies where zero tolerance was applied; presents research that supports systematic reform of zero tolerance policies, as a means of reforming current discipline management practices in schools; and describes an alternative approach to the application of zero tolerance disciplinary measures.

The study suggested that an introductory course combined with field experience and focused on critical issues and self-identity development established an effective basis for career-long learning in multicultural education. Clearly, with increased concerns about student achievement and school effectiveness, particularly cultural and language minorities and low socioeconomic students in urban schools, more research needs to be conducted to ascertain how to best prepare prospective and current teachers to work effectively with students from different backgrounds than their own.

Something is clearly not working because many American Indian students experience high levels of educational failure and many drop out of school. In this article, the authors present an alternative to the traditional state-run public school for one group of American Indian adolescents. The authors describe the first year of a grades 6-12 \"choice\" school, within a public school system, that utilizes a project-based approach to education with a focus on local tribal culture. The school is somewhat unique because although it is located on a reservation and the student body predominantly (94%) identifies as American Indian, the school is within a public school  system with a predominately White student body.",

Reaching a satisfying balance may never be completely possible and the child may as an adult struggle all his/her life, but guidance toward such harmonious development and providing understanding and support is the only way to deal with the  problem. This article observes that an immigrant child is living in his/her created \"symbolic triad\" world, the result of struggles and overcoming crises. The \"symbolic triad\" helps living and interacting in the new world of symbols. The teacher as a cross-cultural interpreter  may help children learn to converse and \"participate in other children's conceptual  schemes.\" Considering different approaches to teach an immigrant child, it should first be attempted to reach his/her \"internal symbolic world,\" slowly shifting it toward the external one.

This may be the product of minds that appreciate the mainstream's intellectual contribution, positively or otherwise, to humanity. However, the growing cultural diversity of the United States makes it incumbent on educators to have a better understanding of the diverging values, customs, and traditions among all learners with different multicultural experiences as the minority thought or view may be just as equally legitimate and valid as the mainstream. This article examines why educators should be concerned with cultural diversity in the United States classroom, spotlighting on demography, stereotyping, socio-economic class, different learning styles, and achievement/cognitive processes. It also addresses the problems and challenges that educators encounter daily, including lack of genuine educational and societal support, lack of teacher knowledge, parental disapproval, and lack of materials.

        "description":"Some educators have developed teaching strategies to address issues of racism and discrimination in the classroom. Although these exercises are provocative and no doubt meaningful for students, they generally do not address the impact that racial group membership has on student response to provocative issues like affirmative action. In the author's experiences, students suspect that other students engage what Cornell West calls \"racial reasoning\" or something similar to it (West 1992). That is, members of a particular racial group are \"supposed\" to think a certain way because they are members of a particular racial group. In this article, the author presents an exercise that primarily engages the discussion of affirmative action without the use of racial group membership as an explanatory or interpretive device. The purpose of this exercise is to allow \"all\" students to express indignation without the possibility of having their membership in a particular ethnic group disqualify their feelings on this particular issue. This exercise removes the racial context and allows students to share an experience that they might not have shared before. (Contains 3 notes.)",

        "author":["Wenze, Gloria Tansits"],
        "description":"The current study is a replication of the author's unpublished dissertation conducted almost twenty years previously in a public school in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Census 2000 indicated a growing cultural diversity in populations entering the Scranton area, however, it continued to show strong evidence of White Ethnic groups. As with the original study, the purpose of the replicated study was to determine White Ethnic children's need for multiethnic education as it was perceived by their parents. It was considered that by identifying the elements of ethnicity (consciousness and locus of ethnicity), the need of White Ethnic children for multiethnic education could be determined. The rationale for the original study emanated as advocates of multicultural education proposed multiethnic educational programs for children of American ethnic groups who are phenotypically different from the dominant White American group. The original study suggested that White Ethnics are another group whose children would also benefit from multicultural/multiethnic education. In order to determine if a need for multiethnic education for White Ethnic children still existed, it was the goal of the original study to survey a group of White Ethnic parents who had children in a public elementary school determined by census and ethnographic data to be in a White Ethnic neighborhood. The goals were: (1) to determine if an ethnic consciousness existed among the parents; and (2) whether the locus of ethnicity is in the school or elsewhere. The American public school system has historically been a vehicle of Americanization for White Ethnics. (Contains 11 tables.)",

Expounding on Solorzano and Villalapando's application of CRT (1997), the hope is to engage the field of school leadership with constructive critique and suggestions for administrators who are dedicated to social justice and the well-being of students and staff. This article further seeks to address the question: How can CRT, as theory based in resistance to racial oppression, inform praxis for school leaders?

        "description":"In the last two decades the proportion of children of color in public schools in the U.S. has increased to about 40%. However, this has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in teachers of color. Many college and university teaching institutions have attempted to deal with the increase in the number of students of color in the public schools and the lack of minority teaching candidates by increasing the number of courses offered on diversity as part of their teaching programs. Students entering teaching programs have had prior experience with issues of diversity either through personal experiences or exposure to popular media. Sometimes, their own school curriculum introduces them to issues of diversity. The popular discourse on diversity issues whether in public schools or in popular media is fraught with problems regarding both the conceptualization of what diversity is and the framing of the problems surrounding issues of diversity. Students also come with pre-conceived notions about the role of schooling in society and the goals of education in the development of a person. Many of these ideals may conflict with the goals of a multicultural education program that truly leads to the empowerment of all children. This article discusses the myths that have been encountered by the authors in their personal teaching experiences with college students, and the impact of these myths on student teachers' understanding of their roles in classrooms. The authors hope to introduce readers to other writers who have commented and studied the myths. Finally some suggested teaching tips are offered as part of teacher education courses that will help clarify some of these issues for student teachers in their effort to be effective allies to underrepresented and marginalized students in their own classrooms.",

        "author":["Ukpokodu, Omiunota Nelly"],
        "description":"A critical issue in teacher education today is the mismatch between racially homogenous teachers and students from increasingly diverse cultural backgrounds. In the United States, the student population is becoming more diverse while the teaching force is becoming increasingly monocultural, white, and middle class. Current data on the teaching force also reveal that the prospective teaching population is predominantly white, middle class, monolingual, female, rural and suburban. The impact of this disparity in the socio-cultural mismatch between diverse students and their white and middle class teachers have been well documented to include lowered teacher expectation and teachers' racialized attitudes towards, and beliefs about students. Studies indicate that compatibility between school culture and student culture facilitates effective communication and positive interactions whereas differences interfere in communication and learning. Numerous studies indicate that a majority of white preservice teachers have negative and racialized dispositions toward diverse students; that these attitudes coupled with the attendant lower expectations, are major factors contributing to the widespread academic failure among diverse students. Consequently, researchers and scholars have challenged teacher education programs to provide prospective teachers opportunities for authentic experiential encounters with contextualized diversity where they can be challenged to confront their preconceived notions, and ultimately transform their attitudes. The current study is a response to that challenge. The participants' written reflective summary reports provided the most compelling evidence of the impact of the experience. In this report, participants described, analyzed, compared, and reflected while noting specific insights and perspectives of their interactions with their partners in various contexts such as home, school, place of worship, and other out-of-school extra-curricular activity centers. This article presents patterns and themes which emerged from analyzing the participants' reports of their cultural experience.",

Guatemalan educators are working to change the approach to education in their public schools, but in many ways it has not changed. Most teachers only know the methods by which they have been taught--rote copying from the board and recitation. In her nine years of working with the Guatemalan Reading Association and their American partners in the Guatemala Literacy Project (of the International Reading Association), the author has given workshops for teachers all over the country. Upon learning that many of them know about Paulo Friere and his Education for Liberation, and wanted to know more, the author decided to make her conference sessions a learning and teaching experience based on Friere's ideas. This article presents a description of the experience the conference participants and the author shared at the Fourth International Literacy Conference in Guatemala, which serves as an example of how to practice education for liberation.",

It's not that good ideas and usable methods were lacking there. It's that they live in a culture where people expect too much, in too short a time, for too little an investment in resources. How might educators go about assessing what is promoted as a best practice, even if they do not personally possess the expertise to finely evaluate the techniques or technologies involved? Looking back over the junkyard of educational innovation--and considering the countless wasted hopes it represents--it is clearly foolish to trust someone merely on his claim to be an expert. What recourse have they, if they lack specific knowledge to evaluate a proposed practice? This article discusses some common-sense measures they can take. For instance, they can evaluate a proposed intervention or practice by looking for certain positive characteristics and being on the watch for certain warning signs. (Contains 11 notes.)",

        "author":["Clabaugh, Gary K."],
        "description":"As a teacher the author often wishes that his students were more curious. Yet, Alice Ramos (this issue) proposes that curiosity can be a vice. She writes that there are times when a student might be motivated by a \"blamable desire for knowledge.\" Ramos bases this claim on a distinction made by Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century Aristotelian philosopher and theologian. Aquinas splits the desire to learn into two types: \"curiositas\" (or curiosity)--which he describes as a vice; and \"studiositas\" (or studiousness)--which he regards as a virtue. Here is how Ramos defines this distinction: \"Curiositas\" (or curiosity) is a vice because it occurs when the desire for knowing is \"disordered or immoderate\"; intellectual obligations are abandoned in favor of unprofitable study; or knowledge is sought from \"dubious\" or \"unlawful\" sources. \"Studiositas\" (or studiousness) is a virtue because it is ordered and limited; it occurs within a framework of moderation during the fulfillment of obligations; dubious or unlawful knowledge is avoided. In this article, the author questions whether educators should accept this dichotomy. He offers two related questions that one should first ask: (1) Who decides what is \"trivial,\" \"disordered,\" or \"immoderate\"?; and (2) Who decides what sources of knowledge are \"dubious\" or \"unlawful\"?

        "author":["Carpenter, Wade A."],
        "description":"As amply documented by &quot;evangelical/liberal&quot; Jim Wallis in his new &quot;God's Politics&quot;, any country can be profoundly improved by voices of faith, hope, and love whose appeals are to reason, conscience, and civility, and who have avoided the entrapments of partisanship. Among such voices have been those of Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu, Mohandas Gandhi, and John Paul II. The &quot;high wall of separation&quot; metaphor was written into federal law only with the &quot;Everson&quot; decision of 1947. Although the wall does much to protect children from zealotry, it may also be withholding from them the highest and deepest learning accumulated by many of the greatest thinkers, and helping to reduce the schools' curricula to the dull minimalism of No Child Left Behind. While it is unfair to blame the Bush administration for the bill--everybody has to admit it was depressingly bipartisan--everybody may fairly blame Dubya for the administration of the law, which has been either moronically rigid or fiendishly clever. (It is unclear which, since the evidence for its ineptitude and the assertion that NCLB is actually a brilliant &quot;stalking horse for privatization&quot; are equally plausible.) In this article, the author believes that a free, intelligent, and kindly people can avoid the extreme positions of Dewey and Dubya, of Orwell and of Cromwell. In the new spirit of the Catholics Maritain and John Paul II, perhaps a better metaphor for church-state relations can be found in the timeless Jewish Mishnah: &quot;Be deliberate in judgment, make many students, and make a fence for the Torah.&quot; A fence, after all, is protective, but it does not conceal.

        "description":"The conflict between the followers of Jacques Maritain and the followers of John Dewey seems to amount to this: each group accuses the other of promoting education for tyranny. Pragmatism, for the Deweyans, frees human beings from the idea of a fixed human nature to pursue freely their ever-evolving ideas of happiness or fulfillment. According to the followers of Maritain, pragmatists are really nihilists: they deny the reality of the natural purposes that shape and limit all human endeavors. In this essay, the author offers his thoughts on this debate. The author also asserts that people's creeping, selective libertarianism--which is really technological nihilism--points to new forms of tyranny. He contends that the only way to resist that tyranny effectively is to show that technological nihilism is untrue.",

        "description":"Jacques Maritain and John Dewey were two of the towering figures in philosophy of education. Maritain led an international revival of Aristotelian and Thomist philosophies known as Integral Humanism. Dewey, a founding figure of Pragmatism, exercised a significant influence on American education. Originating in very different philosophical settings, their ideas on education tend to represent polar opposites. An analysis of the divergent insights on education presented by Maritain and Dewey can help educators step back and reflect on their work. These two thinkers' voices have a relevance that continues to speak to everyone about the problems of education. In this article, the author considers the origin of Maritain and Dewey's ideas in different philosophical and theoretical contexts. The author also considers and compares certain aspects of Maritain and Dewey's concepts of human nature, the learner, curriculum and methods of instruction. (Contains 16 notes.)",

        "author":["McCarthy, Martha M."],
        "description":"Few topics evoke more emotion than how to discipline children in public schools. And not many people are neutral in their views toward corporal punishment. Surprisingly, the United States stands almost alone on its position regarding the legality of corporal punishment. Among thirty-five industrialized countries, only the United States and the Outback regions of Australia do not ban this disciplinary technique. And other than its use in public education, corporal punishment is banned in most U.S. government institutions, such as prisons and military bases. Although many European countries have prohibited corporal punishment in schools since the 1800s, the practice was not banned in the United Kingdom until the late 1980s, and there was no national ban of this disciplinary technique in Canada until 2004. Despite the absence of a national prohibition on corporal punishment in the United States, an increasing number of states and local school districts have adopted laws or regulations prohibiting corporal punishment in public schools. Only one state, New Jersey, prohibited corporal punishment by law in 1970, but by 2004, twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia had barred this disciplinary strategy in public education. In an additional state, Rhode Island, all local school districts prohibit corporal punishment even though there is no state law to that effect. Also, in nine states that still authorize corporal punishment in public schools, more than half the students are enrolled in districts that have adopted policies prohibiting this disciplinary technique. Most states still permitting corporal punishment are located in the southern region of the country. This article discusses the constitutional and state law issues of corporal punishment in public schools. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"\"What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is there between the Academy and the Church?\" According to third-century Christian apologist Tertullian, not much. From precisely the opposite perspective, the twentieth-century \"secular humanist\" John Dewey would have echoed Tertullian, although he was as greatly indebted to Christian thought as Tertullian was to the pagans; he would have described himself as deeply religious, while explicitly rejecting religion. Between the two is the remarkable thirteenth-century synthesis of reason and religion by St. Thomas Aquinas, applied to modern education by the twentieth-century philosopher Jacques Maritain. As some writers suggest, Maritain's thinking provides a Christian corrective to Deweyanism for public as well as private school-teachers who wish to honor both their sacred callings and their secular contracts. However, the author believes that Maritain and Dewey have enough in common to be synthesized for classroom purposes by intelligent and informed teachers, whether they be believers or not. In this article, the author compares areas of similarity and possible synthesis between the two philosophers' thinking, and provides some Christian suggestions for the education of teachers.

John Dewey, America's chief philosopher of education from the turn of the twentieth century, who influenced education--especially moral education--not only in the United States, but throughout the world, could be considered singularly responsible for this change in schools in the twentieth century, from the character-promoting mission of American education established in colonial days to the current situation in schools. Dewey's ideas on education and his philosophy still influence American thinking and schooling. However, Jacques Maritain, the most influential Catholic philosopher of the twentieth century, sharply disagrees with most of Dewey's ideas regarding moral education. In this article, the author discusses Maritain's thinking on moral education and compares Maritain's ideas on the moral principles of education to Dewey's. (Contains 27 notes.)",

The purpose of this paper is to explore the meaning of the virtue of \"studiositas\" and the vice of \"curiositas.\" The author examines how educators may be able to foster the virtue of \"studiositas\" and notice the manifestations of \"curiositas\" both in their students and in themselves.

As we approach the twenty-first century, America is turning into an electronic republic, a democratic system that is vastly increasing the people's day-to-day influence on decisions of state.\" Grossman's forecast implied a sea change in the way citizens would interact with, and participate in, their representative government; a revamping of the way Americans would \"do\" citizenship. Thomas Johnson and Barbara Kaye echoing Grossman's forecast, reported that \"Internet utopians, writing in advance of the 1996 presidential election, breathlessly predicted the 'Net would transform the democratic process by both increasing the public's access to government officials and their power over them.\" This article explores the literature in several areas (e.g., political science, civic education, social studies education, instructional technology) in order to summarize relevant research on the nature and degree of the Internet's impact on civic engagement and citizenship participation in the United States. In an attempt to provide a summary of the body of literature, the author first outlines what proponents describe as the potential of the Internet to impact the role of citizens, to increase citizens' access to government officials, or to increase civic engagement. Then the author turns to a review of literature on the influence of the Internet with respect to each of the following aspects: (1) voting rates and voter participation; (2) political information seeking behavior by citizens; (3) civic engagement (other than voting); (4) citizen networks, issue advocacy, and activism; and (5) the influence of electronic government (e-gov) on citizens. This article concludes with a re-examination of Grossman's prediction. (Contains 123 notes.)",

        "description":"Generally, children attribute agency, having the power or authority to act, to traditionally celebrated historical figures. Often this leads to increased apathy about their own future due to the sense that social change is the prerogative of only the most \"powerful\" of individuals. Agency is an essential part to being a productive citizen in a participatory democracy, and if children are expected to act, they must believe they possess the power to affect change. Edward A. Shanken avers, \"citizens, in the republican sense, must possess agency and must care about the results of their actions if they are to fulfill their responsibility to construct, maintain, and improve society.\" Teachers must find ways to instill a sense of agency within their students, in spite of traditional thought. It is essential for social studies educators to realize that preparing their students to take on the role of citizenship will be an ongoing and crucial process. Through interactive technologies, such as the Internet, generally available in the average classroom, educators have the potential to revitalize the traditional notions of citizenship education. Educators need to utilize various technologies, including the Internet, to encourage their student population to engage in disciplined inquiry, perspective taking, and meaning making and assist in the process of \"civic learning, deliberation, and action.\" This article looks at the notion of agency and ways in which social studies educators can prepare their student population to become agents for social change through the utilization of the Internet.

Because of the wealth of information available on candidates, issues, and policies, the Internet may foster citizens' ability to cast a more informed vote. As technology evolves and becomes more ubiquitous, it is likely that it will continue to reshape the American political process and landscape. The enhanced ability for citizens to both procure information as well as participate in the electoral process holds great potential in terms of K-12 social studies. With the wealth of information (as well as perspectives) that the Internet provides, its use among K-12 students can greatly facilitate the attainment of the goal of students becoming effective citizens. This article discusses the relevance of the Internet to K-12 social studies as well as its influence on American democracy. Although there are different types of Internet voting, the article describes and refers to the definition of \"Remote Internet Voting,\" in which a citizen votes \"over the Internet using a computer not necessarily owned and operated by election personnel,\" which, it should be noted, is a distinct process from electronic voting machines that are currently in use in some states.

In the M.Ed. program WebCT situates the interns within an online Professional Development School (PDS) Network of schools (half urban and half suburban) and practicing teachers as they take six field-based courses. Here, the author describes some of the components of the use of WebCT. Then, she discusses some of the outcomes from the use of WebCT and electronic pedagogy within the M.Ed. program.

        "description":"The need for an engaged, informed citizenry is central to the dream of democracy by Thomas Jefferson. The National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) places citizenship education \"at the heart of social studies\" and suggests that social studies teachers must prepare students to develop a \"reasoned commitment to fundamental values, such as life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, equality, truth, and promotion of the common good.\" In the process of developing their students' civic competence, social studies teachers make use of a range of resources. Increasingly, teachers are making use of a wide range of online resources that have civic educative value. These resources, which the author terms \"digital civic resources\" (DCR), are materials which enable teachers and students to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to engage in meaningful civic life and support the NCSS' description of effective citizenship. Given the easy availability of DCR on the Web, some researchers expect these resources to influence the practice of social studies education. This study examines patterns of use of DCR by pre-service social studies educators. Emergent patterns are presented along with the consequences of these uses for teacher education and social studies instruction. Prior to presenting these findings and the resulting conclusions, related literature on DCR is discussed. (Contains 1 table and 59 notes.)",

        "description":"Throughout human existence, changes in technology have influenced human life. Innovations in technology also impact civic life. Radio and television became prominent fixtures in the United States in the twentieth century. In entering the twenty-first century, another technological innovation, the Internet, emerged as a new factor in civic life. Technology has and continues to influence how people participate in their democracy and, in turn, shapes what educators must consider as they prepare students to become active members in a democratic society. This article begins by explaining three ways in which technology has impacted and continues to impact civic life in the United States. These are: (1) access to information; (2) access to the political process; and (3) access to the topics or issues that are debated, discussed, and legislated. It then highlights implications for social studies education based on the three ways technology changes democracy. (Contains 28 notes.)",

        "description":"The creation of digital archives has shifted the dynamics of doing historical research by changing who is able to conduct the research and how historical research is done. Digital archives are collections of numerical data, texts, images, maps, videos, and audio files that are available through the Internet. The majority of digital archives are free and accessible to all Internet users. Beyond offering access to resources that were unattainable by many before, digital archives offer users the opportunity to interact with resources in a non-linear fashion. Digital archives are one model of how technology can be used in the social studies classroom to teach and to learn in a way that was virtually impossible before the advent of the Internet. This study seeks to understand how teachers interact with digital archives by examining their experiences using digital archives to prepare a hypertext paper. The participants in this study were seventeen middle and secondary social studies teachers. Three primary sources of data were collected to inform this study: digital history inquiry projects, reflective narratives, and online discussion postings. Analysis of the data revealed three assertions related to the democratization of doing history. Each assertion explores one aspect of how digital archives can be used to democratize the doing of history. Here, the author explores the three themes that emerged and discusses the limitations of the study. (Contains 1 table and 19 notes.)",

        "description":"Over the past two decades, the technology \"revolution\" has evolved to touch nearly every aspect of the people's lives. More than just a convenience, this force has become a necessity throughout business, government, and education. One of the most invasive forces of technology is the way in which it plays a role in the types of instructional constructs, or lessons, that are used in schools, especially in social studies classrooms. The difference in how technology is applied in social studies instruction rests in the choices made while developing the intent, or meaning, of instruction. These intents form the discourse of instruction. Decisions here impact not only instructional operations but also the way in which content is understood and applied. Together they rest on a continuum that begins with little choice, in terms of learning outcomes, and ends with an expansive view of the self and instructional technology applications. This article describes the intents of instruction namely, (1) instruction for conformity; (2) instruction for information; (3) instruction for reason; and (4) instruction and the individual. In preparing today's students for the type of society they will enter, using technology applications to instruct students for conformity, information, reason, and self has a place in the social studies classroom, depending on the content and purposes of the lesson.

        "author":["Bair, Sarah D."],
        "description":"In its 1995 definition of social studies, the National Council for the Social Studies (NC SS) explicitly identifies \"citizenship for the common good\" as the purpose of social studies education. The roots of this perspective can be traced to early twentieth-century educators. In their introduction to the seminal \"1916 Report of the Committee on Social Studies\" the authors of the report declared that the \"social studies of the American high school should have for their conscious and constant purpose the cultivation of good citizenship.\" Between then and now there has been general agreement concerning the centrality of this purpose for social studies education, but considerably less consensus regarding what terms such as citizenship and democracy mean, or about how citizenship can best be developed in an educational context. This article examines the work of historian Mary Ritter Beard (1876-1958). A well known figure among women historians, Mary Beard has only recently been considered within the context of social studies education. Raised and educated in the Midwest, Beard married American historian Charles A. Beard in 1900 and became a leader in the American women's suffrage movement. She advocated social and economic reforms for workers, co-authored several important history textbooks with her husband, wrote a number of groundbreaking books on women's history, and worked tirelessly in the effort to develop women's archives. An historical analysis of Mary Beard's educational thought also raises important questions about the connection between women's history and citizenship. (Contains 67 notes.)",

        "description":"As character education continues to be an objective of the social studies, the more effective educators have taken up the challenge by first understanding the principles of their discipline and the opportunities for examining the values of character to be encountered. Social studies is rediscovering the focus on the actual men and women of history as a major cog in teaching character, a method once widely used in American schools and currently utilized successfully in foreign schools. But this focus cannot be a matter of relating simple, irrelevant facts. Rather, it requires the element of story-telling. History abounds with stories of the human struggle, a perspective that opens a myriad of opportunities for character education. This article shares the story of Dr. Tom Dooley, a Navy doctor whose name and exploits have surprisingly never graced the pages of an American history textbook. Despite the fact that during the peak of the Cold War in the 1950s he was acclaimed as one of the most notable individuals in the world for his humanitarian efforts, he is today a forgotten man to most anyone under the age of fifty. Yet Dooley is in his own right a model of character from which much can be learned as teachers seek those individuals who serve as fine examples of American values and citizenship. The story of this forgotten American is also the story of values that embody the character of the American citizen that schools strive to produce: he reminded the Americans of all that they can be.

        "description":"Many teachers shy away from teaching their students ethics. Yet American educators are concerned that students are coming into their classes with unacceptable ethical standards. Teaching ethics is important to the intellectual growth of high school seniors, as their departure from home to college or career is imminent. Social studies is a discipline that is highly conducive toward teaching ethics. Social studies teachers often go into current events and it is useful to their students to know how to apply ethics in current events. This article demonstrates the inclusion of ethics in the context of normal course topics would be an acceptable choice for social studies teachers. While many teachers teach ethics when they do not know they are doing so, the author believes that it is essential for teachers to teach ethics formally--even when it means putting the actual teaching of subject matter aside for a day. She urges teachers to consider adding ethics to the education of their students. (Contains 31 notes.)",

        "description":"While recent research has begun to explore how social studies teachers are responding to a standardized curriculum and its accompanying high-stakes tests, little is known about how teacher education programs are preparing their pre-service teachers for a world in which state curriculum standards and standardized testing often determine the content of the curriculum they will have to teach and in which the stakes are becoming increasingly higher. This study, conducted at a medium-sized university in Ohio, sought to assess pre-service social studies teachers' beliefs about standardized testing and identify some implications for how to better prepare them for their future role as classroom teachers through a case study approach. The setting for this study consisted of two separate undergraduate social studies methods courses at a medium-sized university in Ohio, one for Middle Childhood majors and one for Adolescent-Young Adult majors. Data collection for this research included the administration of a traditional multiple-choice &quot;Content Knowledge Assessment,&quot; consisting of thirty-three multiple-choice questions selected from &quot;What Do Our 17-Year-Olds Know?&quot; Data sources consisted of the students' actual assessments and their written responses following the classroom discussion. Results show that the AYA students scored substantially better on the assessment than the Middle Childhood students. As the pre-service social studies teachers in this study faced the world of high-standards, high-stakes in the near future, it was evident that they were struggling to understand its true impact. While they worried about how to cope with the reality of curriculum standards and the high-stakes tests their future students would have to pass, most participants in this study failed to critically analyze the content of the assessment.

If one inquires into the content of the relation between politics and history, then one discovers it is defined by symbiotic dependence. Those who are trained in history also take into account the political dimensions of history, and those educated in political science cannot neglect the historical factors inhering in current issues and problems. The fact that politics is part of history and vice versa has always been significant on both a theoretical level and in the practice of teaching history and politics. Currently, the relation between the teaching methodology applied to history and politics receives significant attention from the historical side, but is only seldom referred to from the political perspective. Nevertheless, at the present time there is no explicitly delineated educational approach that integrates the teaching of both of these disciplines. This article attempts to advance an approach that places historical and political learning in the field of tension spanning political history and historical politics. (Contains 44 notes.)",

        "description":"Because of its inherent political nature, projects for developing civic education in emerging democracies have often been criticized for being a tool for hegemonic control by the &quot;West.&quot; Much of these suspicions have been pointed at the United States (US) due to the government's policy of supporting educational reform in emerging democracies. Many of these programs have been criticized as well-intentioned but superficial consultations, or at worst, as a hegemonic imposition of American values and conceptions of democracy. In either case, the heart of the criticism rests on the often accurate perception that the civic education that is developed in these emerging democracies relies too heavily on Western expertise and conceptions of democracy and lacks sufficient indigenous voice and understanding of the context in which it is to be used. Some have even argued that this process is implicitly inherent in all Western educational aid programs. This article seeks to address this criticism through analysis of the conduct of an ongoing US-Ukraine civic education project. Emerging from this analysis is a series of lessons learned about contextualizing civic education that can be useful for others involved in such partnerships. This article first details the conduct of the Education for Democracy in Ukraine Project. The article examines the success of the project in overcoming the structural factors of dominance by comparing the Ukrainian products to similar US models. Then the article discusses the lessons learned about the importance of emphasizing context in civic education and concludes with some questions and suggestions for a framework for developing contextual civic education in the future.

This article presents an Australian case study of the experiences of curriculum workers involved in the development of an elementary social studies curriculum in the 1980s and their responses to the New Social Studies movement. It addresses the question: How did curriculum workers in the 1980s respond to innovative curricular and pedagogical practices espoused by Hilda Taba and the New Social Studies, and what influences shaped their work? It draws on data gathered primarily through oral histories of curriculum workers and corroborated by analyses of documentary evidence (reports, syllabuses, and correspondence) archived by the state educational authority in Queensland, Australia. Through their oral histories, curriculum workers provide reflective, evaluative, and contrasting &quot;voices&quot; on official state-level efforts, or what Ross aptly calls the &quot;official state curriculum,&quot; and their perceived impact upon the curricular and pedagogical practices of classroom teachers.

        "description":"This study provides a clearer portrait of the extent to which practicing history and social studies teachers, who explicitly expressed an interest in the potential of technology and advocate the use of primary sources within their teaching, are using Internet technologies to prepare students to learn to think historically and in turn participate in the education of young citizens who are capable of informed deliberative criticism. Participants for this study included teachers who participated in the Virginia Center for Digital History training efforts in the fall of 2003. The research design for this study included an examination of data from classroom observations using a conceptual/observational framework that explored the fidelity and frequency of primary source and technology use in terms of historical content and instructional purposes. This study demonstrates that the participants' purpose for teaching, in terms of their deliberative reflection of the relationship between means and ends,&quot; emerged as the strongest influence on both their use of primary sources and the use of technology to support these practices.

Several other studies have pointed out that problems related to the widespread lack of economic and financial understanding have serious consequences on the future economic well-being of many citizens. Financial and economic illiteracy may be traced to a lack of schooling in basic economic and financial principles. This article discusses an evaluation of achievement scores in economics and financial education of three public elementary schools in an urban setting. The purpose of the article is to illustrate the point that if economic and financial principles are taught to urban elementary children on a regular basis, the students may gain knowledge that will support them in daily financial decision making for the rest of their lives.

        "description":"Recognizing that democracy is not a static concept and that it should be learned and lived on a daily basis, the Council of Europe has named 2005 the European Year of Citizenship through Education. Citizens of European Union (EU) member countries face new challenges in their participation as citizens in a democratic society. While EU citizenship supplements or complements national citizenship rather than replaces it, education for democracy in light of these multiple identities presents a host of new challenges. Not only is education for democracy focusing on citizen participation, legal and political institutions, and governmental or constitutional issues pertinent to the individual's country, it must also incorporate a new dimension of citizenship--the development of a European awareness and identity. The Florida Law Related Education Association, Inc. (FLREA), through its participation in the CIVITAS International Civic Education Exchange Program has been partnered with CIVITAS Hungary, a civic education NGO based in Budapest. In the developmental stages of the partnership, FLREA and CIVITAS Hungary collaborated on the development of a new civic education academic competition similar to the United States based &quot;We the People...the Citizen and the Constitution&quot; competition administered nationally by the Center for Civic Education in Calabasas, California. As Hungary has advanced into EU membership, the Hungarian civic education program has incorporated a European citizenship focus. Issues pertinent to EU membership have become an important component of the new Citizen in a European Democracy academic competition. The name of the program has also evolved to reflect this expansion. The Citizen in a European Democracy program puts into practice issues relevant to citizens of Hungary and also issues pertinent to citizens in the European Union. This past year, researchers from Hungary, Florida, and Iowa worked to analyze the impact of the competition from both a Hungarian and European Union perspective. Key findings include increased student knowledge of political and civic issues as well as democratic principles for both Hungary and the European Union. The findings and impact of the collaborative evaluation and implications for its continued growth and diffusion throughout the European Union are the focus of this paper.

It is difficult for today's youth to choose training programs which will guarantee them secure, long-term employment. As the future grows less predictable, greater uncertainty and risk are involved in each career decision. This study concerns young adults enrolled in vocational education and training programs. The study sought to investigate the complex relationship between macro-structure influences such as social policy and job-market opportunities; microstructure pressures, which include such things as family obligations, peer influences, and personal goals; and an individual's perception of risk and opportunity as he or she plans for the future and makes the transition from school to work. The current study drew on individuals' narratives describing their future goals and life plans. In addition to questionnaires, information was gathered through focus groups and biographical interviews which were conducted with students enrolled in technical college training programs in a major city in the southeastern United States.",

        "description":"In 1993 Wicklein conducted a study to determine the present and the future critical issues and problems facing the technology education (TE) profession. The Wicklein study questioned 25 panelists from 15 states and the District of Columbia to ascertain the issues and problems facing TE. However, in the Wicklein study, only seven of the panelists were classroom teachers. The present study investigates the severity of these problems in schools today as perceived by current Indiana high school and middle school TE teachers. This study sought to answer the following two research questions: (1) What is the current level of severity of the 15 future problems identified by Wicklein (1993) as perceived by Indiana TE teachers?; and (2) Do Indiana TE teachers' perceptions of the 15 future problems (Wicklein, 1993) differ based on the Indiana teachers' demographic characteristics? The researchers acquired a list of 1,043 TE teachers from the Indiana Department of Education. A simple random sample of 747 of these teachers served as the sample for this study. Overall, the TE teachers who responded to the current survey reported the problem of the impact of high school graduation requirements on TE courses as the most serious problem of the 15 future problems identified by Wicklein in his 1993 study.

Adult education has recently seen the development by Conti and Kolody of a new model for the study and classification of learning preferences, which they call learning strategies. To accompany their model, they created a new assessment instrument named Assessing the Learning Strategies of Adults, or ATLAS. The purpose of this study was to apply the ATLAS test to identify and describe the learning strategies and the associated instructional preferences of students in CTE programs and to compare these results with those found in previous ATLAS studies of non-traditional learner populations. The subjects in this study were 621 career and technology education (CTE) students whose instructors were already using the ATLAS instrument as part of their instructional techniques. Data for the study were gathered from two instruments: The ATLAS test of learning strategies, and a short questionnaire developed specifically for the study. (Contains 5 tables.)",

As such, it is essential that the field recognize the key issues so that steps are taken to provide and facilitate necessary professional development. This article discusses how the integration of engineering design into the field of technology education will affect the profession's curriculum, educational philosophy, instructional strategies, and collaborative relationships.

The fields of technology education and vocational education were cited by researchers as having a lower than average number of applicants per position, with vocational education also showing a much higher than average failure rate for searches. This report uses findings from a survey of higher education department chairs and program coordinators to characterize faculty vacancies at the bachelor's and master's program levels in post-secondary technical education institutions, the criteria used to hire faculty, and the attitudes toward filling those vacancies with an individual who has earned a doctoral degree through an online method of delivery. The survey sample included department chairs or program coordinators of bachelor's and master's programs in technical education in the United States. An anonymous, online survey was used to collect data due to its ease for respondents, its low cost, the anonymity it guaranteed to respondents, and its avoidance of data entry errors.

However, a review of literature found no service-learning studies that focused on student engagement or commitment to learning in a high school construction technology classroom setting. This qualitative case study of a service-learning experience conducted among secondary students in a construction technology course addresses this lack of research. Data was informally collected during this case study to evaluate whether service-learning projects appear to help motivate and engage students in the learning process and whether students effectively learn the course curriculum and content objectives while participating in class service-learning projects. The study was conducted in an attempt to understand the relationship between students' commitment to a service-learning project and their commitment to learn the associated course content.

        "description":"A major emphasis in technology education is learning the practices of designers-making informed decisions, trading off achievement of criteria against each other, working in a team, communicating ideas and results, and so on. How can one help students learn such ill-defined and open-ended skills? There have been a variety of suggestions made by the best teachers and those who observe and analyze their practices about how to achieve learning from project experiences, and textbooks and innovative modules are being developed based on those best practices. The literatures of cognitive science and the learning sciences inform one about the learning of skilled practices and make some suggestions about how to promote learning such skills as reading and writing. There has been only a little research devoted specifically to using what one knows about skill learning to promoting learning of the kinds skills designers engage in. This paper focuses on lessons learned from an inquiry into science education about how to promote learning of such skills. The focus of \"Learning by Design\"[TM], has been to help middle school students (grades 6 to 8; ages 12 to 14) learn science content in such a way that they can apply it in new situations and engage skillfully in the practices of scientists. This paper also defines the terms \"skills\" and \"practices\" and discusses what it takes to learn them. This paper then presents excerpts from two LBD units that illustrate the strategies and tactics they use. Finally, this paper considers three big issues in making such an approach work: (a) assessing the degree to which students are learning skills and practices; (b) preparing teachers for managing a classroom environment such as the one they propose; and (c) taking the approach from science to technology classrooms.

        "description":"The word &quot;technology&quot; has evolved through several different meanings during the recent history of education. In 1985, the American Industrial Arts Association changed its name to the International Technology Education Association. This change reflected dissatisfaction with traditional &quot;shop&quot; courses, designed to prepare students for skilled trades and technical vocations. Instead, it was felt, all students needed to gain some familiarity with technology, to prepare them for life in a rapidly advancing, technologically sophisticated society. Although the objective is worthy, the transition from Industrial Arts to Technology Education is still a work in progress. Much of the Technology Education community still has its roots in Industrial Arts, and Technology has yet to become firmly established as a school subject in the United States. This paper proposes that technology education should focus on everyday artifacts and design problems, and thereby remove some of the barriers preventing its introduction into the schools. Curriculum materials and teacher support will be essential to this effort. However, traditional modes of curriculum development and professional development will not be effective, because they fail even to engage teachers, let alone exploit their expertise. A new paradigm is needed, which sees both tasks as collaborative design challenges that must involve teachers as full participants. After a discussion of these issues, this paper concludes with an extended account of the City Technology project, based at the City College of New York, which put many of these ideas into practice.",

Dossey, Fitch, and Loepp (mathematics, science, and technology, respectfully), to establish an organization on campus called the Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology (CeMaST). The originators of CeMaST immediately conceived a plan to develop an integrated curriculum that represented each of their disciplines. A proposal was written and submitted to the Instructional Materials Development (IMD) program in the Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education (ESIE) Division of the National Science Foundation (NSF). Funding was awarded in 1992 to design a standards-based, integrated 7th grade curriculum. Additional funding to develop the 8th grade curriculum was received in 1995, and to develop the 6th grade curriculum in 1999. This Integrated Mathematics, Science, and Technology curriculum project became known as &quot;IMaST.&quot; The purpose of this article is to discuss the issues associated with the design, development, and implementation of the IMaST curricula and to provide insights to those initiating similar endeavors by answering specific research questions and by making recommendations based on that research.

        "description":"The Children Designing &amp; Engineering (CD&amp;E) Project at the College of New Jersey is a collaborative effort of the College's Center for Design and Technology and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. The Project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), has been charged to develop instructional materials for grades K-5. The twelve thematic units under development integrate science, mathematics, technology and other content through design-and-make activities. Activities are coordinated with both state and national standards and are situated within contexts inspired by seven New Jersey businesses. Project staff members are also attempting to explore how design-based activities can provide an early orientation to skills and attitudes sought by employers. The CD&amp;E project began in 1998 as a three-year effort to help elementary teachers incorporate design and technology into their teaching. Project collaborators from the College of New Jersey and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce joined forces to design real-world, developmentally appropriate instructional units that would communicate the unique nature of technological pursuits and harness the inherent appeal of design activity as a vehicle for learning. The approach taken to the CD&amp;E units draws on research from a wide range of current educational orientations, with the most notable among these found in the literature on contextual learning and problem-based learning. Underlying the materials is a general constructivist perspective, and units feature elements of authentic assessment and cooperative learning. Theories about workplace contexts, learning styles, and multiple intelligences have also informed the design decisions. In this article, the author describes how the CD&amp;E project applies theories of contextual learning, problem-based learning, and Design and Technology (D&amp;T) education to create an amalgam of the three which project collaborators call Design &amp; Technology-Based Contextual Learning.

        "description":"Through the competitive proposal process, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) received a three-year Teacher Enhancement Grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in March 1998. The Maryland State Department of Education provided additional funds for the grant. The purpose of the grant was to administer the Technology Education Leadership Project (TELP), a statewide project designed to enable technology education teachers to more effectively deliver instruction that results in students achieving the technology outcomes identified by the State of Maryland. TELP addressed a long-term goal of Maryland educators to enhance technology literacy for all students by integrating the study of mathematics, science, and technology as a required component of the educational program. One of the primary objectives of TELP was to provide in-service professional training and teacher enhancement for more than 400 Maryland technology education teachers. Areas of instructional focus included the Core Technologies, teaching/learning strategies, and leadership. The project involved five components: (a) summer institutes; (b) local planning teams; (c) weekend institutes; (d) local in-service training; and (e) evaluation and follow-up. TELP brought together instructional resources and personnel in a statewide effort to develop Maryland's technology education leaders for the 21st century. Its activities have enhanced participants' technical knowledge base, strengthened instructional practices, and developed leadership skills. Future plans for TELP include submitting additional proposals to NSF and the Maryland State Department of Education to support TELP Institutes that will focus on the &quot;Standards for Technological Literacy&quot;.

The design of each was different, reflecting the differing natures of the educational programs at each level, but the importance of including technology education was common to both. In both projects, instructional strategies characteristic of technology education (which the authors define as the study of the human-made world), established links with mathematics and science education (MST) and were made explicit through teacher practice. There was an interconnected MST thrust to the instructional strategies that were employed and the activities that were created or refined.

        "description":"According to the literature, affective work competencies and personal-social competencies are but two of the terminologies among the plethora of captions employed to describe the set of behaviors commonly referred to as work ethics. The commonality linking these various captions is that all terminologies relate to the concepts of individual responsibility, self-management, self-esteem, integrity, and sociability in varying degrees. Additionally, the presence or absence of these behaviors tends to correlate directly with the ability of an individual to enter the workforce. The incongruity between possession of adequate skill levels and appropriate work ethic values has increasingly become an area of concern for the Georgia business communities and for Georgia technical institutes. In response to this alleged disparity between skill levels and appropriate work ethic values, each of the 33 technical institutes within the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education (GDTAE) system has incorporated the concept of work ethics into their curriculum. The eight core components of work ethic values, as outlined in the department's policy, include: (a) attendance and punctuality; (b) integrity and honesty; (c) productivity; (d) cooperativeness and teamwork; (e) responsiveness to supervision; (f) adherence to policies; (g) proper use of tools and resources; and (h) observance of safety provisions. The purpose of this study was to develop a psychometrically sound instrument in which the eight work ethic dimensions identified in the GDTAE (1991) &quot;Work Ethics Program&quot; were accurately and succinctly measured. Based upon this analysis, the following conclusions were formulated. First, the content validity of items included in the researcher-developed instrument was confirmed by persons within the field who were knowledgeable of the program, its focus, and its intent. Second, the researcher-developed instrument possessed acceptable reliability for research purposes. Third, the factor structure of the researcher-developed instrument was essentially the same for males and females. Fourth, results of demographic comparisons parallel results obtained by other researchers investigating similar constructs offering some degree of convergent validity. Recommendations for further research are also presented. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Technology education has progressed through several iterations over the past 100 years and continues to evolve as the primary medium for preparing children and youth in technological literacy. Over the past 20 years, technology education has worked diligently to move from a subject field where students primarily manipulated materials (industrial arts) to one of systematic instruction about technological systems and enterprises (technology education). The &quot;Standards for Technological Literacy&quot; more clearly define an operational agenda for the advancement of technological literacy for the nation's school-age youth. This study is the third in a series of national surveys that have systematically assessed the status of technology education in the United States and Canada. This study, a more recent analysis of the overall status of technology education, has been expanded significantly beyond the Oaks (1991), Chinien and Oaks (1995), and Newberry (2001) studies to include more indepth information regarding the general health and wellness of technology education in the United States. Eleven of the most critical issues and trends in technology education were selected and examined based on current literature, information from state technology education supervisors, and information profiled in the previous published articles. From a synthesis of these eleven topical areas, five major areas of focus emerged: (1) The status technology education holds at the state level and in schools; (2) The change in technology education program demographics during the last five years; (3) The degree to which extant curricular designs reflect current educational reform (the standards movement) and the evolution of technology education from industrial arts; (4) The current and future trends of technology educator supply and demand; and (5) The diversity of school populations as reflected in technology education programs. These five major areas became the focus of a comprehensive analysis of the profession, which began with the design and method of the research. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Tech Prep is a high school program of study. The student outcome objective is to prepare students to make the transition from high school to postsecondary pre-baccalaureate technical education, complete the postsecondary program without the need to take remedial academic courses, and then transition to commensurate employment. While the concept is not necessarily new--2+2 programs were around in the 1950s--the present day Tech Prep model can be traced to the writings of Dale Parnell (1985), who provided the rationale for Tech Prep's subsequent inclusion in the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Education Act of 1990. Since 1990, Tech Prep has become popular among federal policy makers, because it is consistent with their view that the goal of vocational education (now called career and technical education) is preparation for both full-time employment and postsecondary education below the baccalaureate level. The purpose of this research was to conduct a pilot study to investigate reasons for the lack of student persistence in Tech Prep programs located in comprehensive high schools. This study addressed two research questions: (1) Among Tech Prep program participants in comprehensive high schools, what 10th grade academic variables predict persistence? and (2) What are the postsecondary experiences of Tech Prep participants, and do they vary between those who persist and those who do not? Findings show two possible conclusions: One is that those students who elected Tech Prep but did not persist dropped the program because they lacked overall commitment to high school and adequate academic skills to pass the required courses. Second is that these teens are exactly the type of student that Tech Prep is intended to serve--meaning the non-baccalaureate bound--and, therefore, program modifications are necessary to ensure more desirable outcomes.

According to Butler (1987), every teacher has a personal learning style. Teachers teach to their own learning style for many reasons (Stewart, Jones, &amp; Pope, 1999). Teachers will teach to the way that they feel most comfortable and may have difficulty understanding those who have different learning styles. One teacher may use abstract examples while others may use concrete illustrations. Likewise, students learn according to the learning style with which they feel most comfortable. Teachers must understand their own learning style but must use a variety of ways to accommodate the learning styles of their students. In this article, the authors present a study which investigated the learning styles of postsecondary faculty. The purpose of the study was to determine if there was a predominant learning style among postsecondary instructors at technical institutes in Arkansas as measured by the Gregorc Style Delineator. The secondary purpose was to determine if there were significant differences in learning styles among instructors with different characteristics, including program area, gender, and work experience.

        "description":"The right to privacy is a firmly entrenched democratic principle that has been inferred in the U.S. Constitution and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment as a liberty of personal autonomy. It is the statutory right to privacy that has been most closely aligned with data protection as a form of self-protection. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has led efforts to enforce compliance with privacy. The statutory right of privacy limits access to personal information and has been extolled in the proliferation of privacy policies and legislation that control the collection of information about children on the Internet. Despite the longstanding tradition of individuals controlling access to and use of personal information, technology has expanded the flow of identifiable data into the public domain. Students' rights and protections are emerging as a key public concern, and the public documentation and tracking of young lives through Web logs or blogs, e-journals, digital photos, Web pages, online profiles, radio frequency identification, and other forms of data surveillance have complicated efforts to safeguard young people's privacy protections in digital spaces. This article explores controversies over the protection of children's privacy in a digital age and discusses connections between online privacy, cyber-identity, and self-protection in a democratic society.

        "description":"A 2005 MetLife Foundation/Civic Ventures New Face of Work Survey found that many baby boomers are eager to make career changes that can launch a new chapter in their working lives while they make social contribution. The survey found that 50 percent of Americans age 50 to 70 want jobs that contribute to the greater good. It found that more than 53 percent of this population plan to work in retirement because they need continued income, and they want greater flexibility in retirement jobs. Fifty-six percent reported an interest in working in health care, whether that be in a hospital or with an organization fighting a particular disease; 55 percent reported interest in a teaching or other educational position; and 45 percent say they are interested in working in a youth program. Getting baby boomers the education and training they need to enter fields such as health care, education and social services, is one way to address worker shortages in those sectors. This article discusses how community colleges, such as Central Piedmont Community College in Mecklenburg, North Carolina and Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C) in Ohio, are working to develop new programs and to strengthen existing ones in order to meet the growing needs of mid-lifers.",

This presents a unique challenge for comprehensive career and technical (CTE) schools. While there is an emphasis on the CTE path that students are interested in pursuing, academic areas must be mastered with proficiency in order for a school to be successful (in this case, as defined by the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment, or (PSSA)). In addition, graduation in select districts is dependent upon proficiency. For a comprehensive CTE school to survive, it must have a sustainable teaching model that aligns and integrates career and technical skills with math and reading anchors. Central Tech, a comprehensive career and technical school in Erie, Pennsylvania, has developed a working model for achieving this integration. This model developed as some of the school's academic teachers pushed into the career and technical programs and co-taught with the instructors. Appropriately, this has come to be referred to as the &quot;push-in&quot; model.",

        "author":["Staley, David J."],
        "description":"This article details a heuristic history teachers can use in assigning and evaluating multimedia projects in history. To use this heuristic successfully, requires more than simply following the steps in the list or stages in a recipe: in many ways, it requires a reorientation in what it means to think like an historian. This article, as much as anything, is an appeal to historians to view themselves as more than just writers, to expand the range of media in which they work, to think of themselves as information designers. By design, the author means \"the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order.\" When they write, historians are engaged in a design act, in that they impose order on the past by arranging words, sentences, and paragraphs into a meaningful whole. When working with visual and other multimedia objects, historians might also learn cognitive tools for meaningfully arranging and designing them to create visual narratives and visual arguments. That is, history teachers might learn to think historically using the affordances of many forms of media. Note that designers often work in several media: architects will design furniture and household objects; artists will work with paint and sculpt in clay and draw posters. They are not confined to one medium, and are able to communicate in a variety of media. The author would like to see historians similarly trained to work in a variety of media--not just the written word--when thinking historically. This conceptual reorientation will make it easier for history teachers to assign and critically assess multimedia representations in history. More important, the heuristic the author proposes helps historians expand the range of what they define as historical thinking. The author envisions a day when thinking like an historian means thinking about and representing the past, not only as a one-dimensional sentence, but also as a multidimensional visual space.

        "author":["Bolgatz, Jane"],
        "description":"When students learn about history in elementary schools across the United States, they take tests and write essays explaining what happened in the past. It is not clear, however, that students necessarily &quot;think about&quot; history. Yet if students know dates and names, but not the meanings of events or how those events connect to other events, they have only learned a small portion of the story. Teachers, therefore, need to help students think about history. To think about history is to reason critically and morally about the ideas and actions of people in the past. Rather than simply labeling actions or events as good or bad, students analyze details of events and ideas so that they can make sophisticated judgments about the past. To do so requires that students, like historians, engage in close, careful reading of historical texts, and connect ideas that are not explicitly linked. More broadly, historical thinking involves examining the multiple--and constantly changing--dimensions and meanings of concepts such as freedom or democracy. Engaging in historical thinking can help students learn how those concepts are both constructed and contested, and how history and the telling of history are full of ambiguities. The study of race relations is one important topic in history that lends itself to multiple interpretations, the exploration of various perspectives, and the making of moral judgments. Learning to think historically is not an easy task, particularly for elementary students. In order to understand how teachers can help students learn to think historically, and to see what happens when students study race relations in history, the author examined the discussions that took place in a fifth grade class studying colonial U.S. history. In this article, the author describes the ways the teacher both offered students a predetermined view of the history of race relations in the colonial era, as well as how she helped them think historically about some of that history. Her goal in this research was to answer the following questions: (1) In what ways did the fifth grade students discuss the complexity of race relations in history?; and (2) What processes or approaches might help the students comprehend, analyze, and interpret the history of race relations?

        "description":"This article explores PowerPoint slideshow's capacities for introducing history teachers and students to the pictorial and digital turns for representing and narrating the past. Based upon this research, the author argues that image-dominated PowerPoint slideshow provides teachers and students with a unique and powerful tool for composing and interrogating historical evidence and narrative. This investigation into PowerPoint's potential for history teaching and learning draws upon evidence from twenty-seven slideshow compositions produced by twenty pre-service history teachers. In the absence of instruction on PowerPoint slideshow and narrative history, the study found subjects quite predictably composed slideshow histories mimicking narrative structures featured in PowerPoint lectures frequently observed in classrooms and lecture halls. They also contained features such as heavy reliance on bulleted sentences and sentence fragments. Rather than exerting agency upon, and transforming, written and visual sources into their own interpretation and voice, subjects' first PowerPoint compositions tended to serve as vehicles for \"knowledge telling\" presentations. After instruction on PowerPoint and history, however, some subjects designed compositions demonstrating the medium's capacities to compose a different kind of historical narrative. These slideshows were dominated by images and much more open than subjects' first efforts at conversations about possible meanings an historical slideshow narrative may contain.

Data sources for this study included interviews, observations, and classroom documents of seven beginning high school history teachers who work in the high-stakes testing environment of Virginia. The interviews and observations revealed that when thinking about, talking about, and implementing instruction, the teachers appeared concerned with implementing a variety of instructional approaches in order to engage their students and to fill a block period. Explicit discussions of or references to historical thinking did not appear in their responses, but references to &quot;critical thinking&quot; did. When asked to describe resources used in the class, teachers did refer to historical sources, but most often as a means to interest or engage their students, to add another element of variety to instruction, or to teach &quot;critical thinking&quot; skills.

For over a century, the authors argue, &quot;best practices&quot; in social studies have always included instruction that promotes higher-order thinking and inquiry-based learning, regardless of whether the promulgators were committed to citizenship education, &quot;constructivist&quot; methods, or standards-based instruction. Their study, however, asks whether methods that promote thinking and interpretation actually appear in classroom practice. Using survey data, the researchers find a tension between the methods that teachers most commonly use and the methods they believe are most effective. In particular, the study finds that though teachers may value methods such as role play and debate, they are most likely to lecture. The authors conclude the results of this study suggest that among both elementary and secondary social studies teachers, passive methods are used more frequently than active, and arguably, more authentic methods.

        "description":"In this essay, the authors explore the structures, processes, and messages that accountability reforms communicate about the goals and means of coming to know history. In other words, how do existing history standards and formal curricula officialize certain orientations toward historical knowledge and traditions through which that knowledge is taught? Specifically, they begin by examining the &quot;National History Standards&quot; and the &quot;History and Social Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools.&quot; These standards documents are viewed through several overlapping lenses, including a typology of historical knowledge, a conceptual framework of teaching and learning history, as well as research, philosophy, and criticism related to the domain. They utilize these conceptual frameworks for their analytic, organizational, and pedagogical power, not because they represent reality in some undistorted way. The progression of their analysis, from a set of national standards to state-level standards, aims to address particular patterns of coherence &quot;and&quot; variability among these systems of reform. The inferences that can be drawn from a comparison of these documents and the contexts in which they were created, will call attention to examples of processes by which official school knowledge gets constituted. By examining the conceptions of history forwarded by these policy instruments, they explore the intersection of knowledge, culture, politics, and the institutional structures of school organization and practice. Ultimately, the authors are interested in how students and teachers interpret and interact with these systems of accountability and the conceptions of history they forward. They eventually narrow their focus even further to a specific local context, Fairfax County, Virginia, concentrating their analysis on a modern world history curriculum and related instructional materials designed to prepare students for the &quot;Virginia Standards of Learning Assessments.&quot; (Contains 50 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Ever since technology became a major component in education, schools have been charged with teaching and integrating technology to enhance learning and ensure technology literacy. However, there is still no consistent definition, process, or assessment in place, leading to concerns about accountability. Because technology standards are seemingly arbitrary and open to multiple interpretations, each school district, each school, and even each teacher will have to develop their own definition, process, and assessments. This leaves schools and teachers charged with an overwhelming responsibility; subsequently, technology integration and assessments vary greatly among teachers, school districts, and states. If a goal of PK-12 education is to prepare students to compete in the high-tech global economy, multiple areas regarding technology need to be addressed by various educational stakeholders. This article describes the Technology Curriculum Map developed by Colchester Middle School in Colchester, Vermont. Limiting themselves to only the NETS and Vermont technology standards would not provide the technology opportunities they envisioned for their students and teachers. Therefore, they also consulted the technology industry. One goal was to address process and assessment, incorporating approaches from both educational and industry organizations. Another goal was to develop a solution for validating their compliance with the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Enhancing Education Through Technology (EETT) Act of 2001, as this is what they ultimately are held to. Therefore, they used EETT as the backbone, while various educational and industry standards filled out the map. Simply put, the purpose of their Technology Curriculum Map was to combine educational and industry standards and assessments into one comprehensive program.",

        "description":"Technology is a part of most teacher education programs, but once teachers are in the classroom, they often discover it is difficult to find time to learn new things. Technology changes so fast that it is hard to keep up. Especially for elementary-level teachers, this problem simply means that it is difficult or impossible to efficiently integrate technology. For middle and high school business teachers, the need to stay current on technology is a vital job requirement. A partnership between these two levels of teachers can satisfy both groups needs for continuing technology development. Working with students and teachers in other curricular areas and grade levels can enrich a business teacher's overall technology knowledge and provide a larger technology support system for the district as a whole. This article presents collaborative ideas submitted by business teachers based on their experiences implementing effective strategic partnerships.",

        "description":"Lots of things have changed since the baby boomers began overfilling postwar schoolhouses in the 1950s. The sparkling new buildings erected across the United States to handle the population surge have lost their luster, and in many cases, their functionality. This is not new information; in a 1995 General Accounting Office report, nearly half of U.S. schools lacked the basic wiring to support computers, modems, and other modern communication technology. In the decade since that report, infrastructure needs have expanded dramatically. Replacing these buildings has become a priority for school districts. Eugene, Oregon's 4J district is fairly typical. It plans to open its fourth replacement school in as many years when the 2006-2007 school year begins. This article describes the two newest buildings in the district--Madison Middle School, which opened in fall 2005, and the new Cal Young Middle School, which is taking shape in the shadow of the current building. The lessons and insights the district and site-based staff shared with the authors should be of interest to personnel in other districts embarking on similar building projects.

        "description":"Every school that attempts to integrate technology into its curriculum knows that this effort consumes dollars in the school budget and hours of teacher time. School leaders invest in these resources because they believe that technology can help address meaningful learning problems. Yet, in many cases, their beliefs about the potential of technology are primarily supported by anecdotal evidence. The authors believe that schools should do a better job of providing rigorous research that identifies specific learning issues best addressed by specific technologies and that illuminates best practices for teaching with technology. This kind of research can better ensure that limited dollars are well spent and that teachers' time is well used. Recently, the National Technology Leadership Coalition (NTLC) brought together representatives from a number of teacher educator associations to address the issue of technology integration. The purpose of the NTLC initiative and the content area articles in this report is to facilitate effective research that is relevant and accessible, working in partnership with teachers and schools. In this collective report, leaders in teacher education in the content areas of science, mathematics, social studies, and English/language arts offer visions of the key research questions that should be addressed when studying the integration of technology into each of their fields.

        "description":"Today, school administrators face many challenges. These include pressures to increase all students' achievement in core content areas and to prepare students to be technology literate. In addition to these academic needs, principals are concerned for the security and safety of their students and ultimately seek to provide a positive school climate conducive to learning. Administrators in Michigan have pulled together in a statewide effort to meet these challenges with the help of technology. Their connecting point is a collaborative leadership development program called LEADing the Future (LTF), funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2002, the LTF grant team set out to train at least 80% of the administrators in the state (approximately 4,000) to use a variety of technologies with specific emphasis on four goals aligned with ISTE's National Educational Technology Standards for Administrators. This article describes the implementation and the outcomes of the LTF program in Michigan. (Contains 4 resources.)

When the Women in Computing Group at Indiana University (WIC@IU) was looking for ideas on how to increase the number of women in computing majors at IU, the authors realized that women were turning away from technology careers before they arrived at college. The authors realized that the solution in convincing women to pursue technology careers is to reach out to regional middle and high school students who are likely to attend IU and persuade them to consider a career in technology. The goal is to dispel common stereotypes about people who work with technology, in essence, to break the geek myth. In this article, the authors describe their interactive presentation--Just Be--and discuss their experiences delivering it. Just Be is a presentation wherein the presenters discuss how they got involved in computing when they were younger, their current work, and what they do outside of work for fun.

        "description":"The authors relate how they had been searching for ways to help teachers in their schools to integrate technology into their classrooms in a sustainable fashion. The authors have found that after-school workshops and one-on-one assistance to teachers have not enabled teachers to become self-reliant in their regular use of technology. Instead, their teachers have become dependent on the technology coordinator to assist them in the instruction and implementation of new tools in their classrooms. It has been their goal to develop a professional model, Collaborative Apprenticeship, to address this problem where the technology coordinator serves as a mentor who helps teachers build capacity in their ability to integrate technology into the classroom. Through collaborative apprenticeships, the technology coordinator and a teacher leader facilitate the learning of a group of teachers to advance and sustain their collective knowledge. In this article, the authors present Collaborative Apprenticeship, describe strategies for using this model within a K-5 school setting, and reflect on the challenges involved in providing ongoing support and development for teachers as they integrate technology into their instructional practices.

Membership can be free or fee-based. A typical social networking site provides members with a Web page or blog where they can post text, photos, and other content for visitors to view. Social networking sites have been expanding rapidly since 2003. Friendster opened to the public in March 2003 and initially expanded membership at a rate of 20% a week. Friendster made a big splash because of its unprecedented access to the coveted 25-35-year-old demographic. Since then, many big Web players have started up social networking sites. With the rapid growth of social networking sites and with millions of K-12 students actively participating in these online social clubs, the author calls on educators to explore how they can continue to educate students about how to use these sites wisely.

        "description":"The &quot;achievement gap&quot; is a well-documented problem in schools. Evidence of an academic performance problem requires that educators respond quickly and differently to signs of academic failure. As the lessons of the achievement gap suggest that historical decisions about when to intervene with performance support are flawed, performance support interventions must be provided much sooner than they have been considered in the past. Recent educational innovations, such as differentiated instruction and universal design for learning, offer insights into proactively planning instruction that embraces academic diversity. Recognizing the need for both physical and cognitive access to learning provides a rationale for far-ranging searches of existing technologies that fundamentally alter the way specific tasks can be completed. Here, the author suggests that the only viable options for enhancing performance are to provide cognitive supports and appropriate technology tools. The use of technology tools and cognitive supports represent essential and underutilized interventions for enhancing the academic performance of struggling students.

        "description":"Teachers know that a constructivist approach involving project-based, student-centered activities can result in students taking an active role in their own learning and engaging in thought-provoking challenges. When accomplished with collaborative activities, students develop skills that will serve them well in the future in any group project. Critical to this approach is the articulation of the challenge, often one or more questions and scenarios. This article provides a context, and then proceeds to demonstrate how teachers can modify an already good curriculum to create engaging and motivating challenges for their students. Exciting results occur when existing technologies and the emerging Web 2.0 applications are integral aspects of information gathering, data analysis, and presentation possibilities. WebQuests, originated by Bernie Dodge and Tom March, exemplify electronic constructivism and incorporate scenarios and tasks that go far beyond fact finding and reporting. When tackling WebQuest challenges, students engage in transformative thinking, combining their innate creativity and curiosity with the vast array of resources on the Internet, to create an original product to demonstrate their new knowledge. This article presents some examples that serve as models for practice and inspiration for practitioners to write the \"Introduction\" and \"Task\" portions of WebQuests.

        "description":"Standards are a reality in all academic disciplines, and they can be hard to measure using conventional methods. Technology skills in particular are hard to assess using multiple-choice, paper-based tests. A new generation of online assessments of student technology skills allows students to prove proficiency by completing tasks in their natural environment, are self-correcting so they save teacher time, and quickly and easily report scores. This article discusses five online technology assessment tools that ease the teacher's burden, help students learn, and correlate to ISTE's National Educational Technology Standards for Students. These are: (1) Certiport's Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC[superscript 3]); (2) Thomson Learning's Skills Assessment Manager (SAM) Computer Concepts; (3) Learning.com's TechLiteracy Assessment (TLA); (4) NETS Online Technology Assessment (OTA); and (5) International Computer Driving License (ICDL).

Online course enrollments have also increased from 31 students in 2003 to more than 600 in 2006. A major reason for this remarkable growth has been the Maryland Students Online Consortium (MSOC), a state-local partnership involving two-thirds of Maryland's 24 school systems (23 counties, one city) and the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). MSOC is a grant project funded by MSDE's Enhancing Education Through Technology Program, using Federal No Child Left Behind Title II-D funds to support MSDE's efforts to implement the Maryland Virtual Learning Opportunities Program for online courses. The Maryland consortium helps local systems implement successful programs by developing resources together, building on each others' successes, and sharing lessons learned.

Such support usually needs to be offered at the location where users are trying to access the technological resources. More often than not, the user who needs the support wants to get the support immediately, not at some point in the future after a technician has received, processed, and responded to a request. Compounding this already challenging environment is the fact that users often have different skill levels. To address these issues, the author proposes the use of flowcharts as a technical support for the users. Flowcharts offer the opportunity to graphically represent a large amount of information in a simple, graphical format. Because this support method is simply a piece of paper taped to a desk or wall near a computer or a single image posted to a Web site, it can be immediately available on-site for users. Here, the author discusses the benefits of flowcharts and shares tips in building a flowchart support system. (Contains 3 online resources.)",

Over time, she has come to realize that cell phones are part of the students' everyday existence. Today, students use cell phones to communicate and collaborate with the world around them. In this article, the author proposes that cell phones can be learning tools. Educators can help students learn how to use their everyday \"toy\" as a \"tool\" for constructing knowledge. With the new audio input feature of many Weblog sites such as blogger.com, gabcast.com, and blogzy.com, students can use their cell phones to create blogs, collect and store data, and develop multimedia projects. An audioblog is similar to a podcast; it is a voice message from a phone that immediately posts to a blog site. Students can post audioblogs anytime from anywhere. Here, the author explains how to create audioblogs using cell phones and provides some examples of how cell phones and audioblogging can be integrated into the classroom.

This proved to be true for two neighboring school districts in Oregon (Eugene School District 4J and Springfield School District) that took the time to survey what other schools had been doing. Now that the districts have new 1-to-1 programs of their own, they are quickly gaining the perspective their predecessors had.

To fully engage with the Web 2.0 world, educators work to include aspects of Web 2.0 into their teaching through the use of wikis, forums, and blogs. Administrators are also integrating classroom management software and curriculum mapping systems at their schools. These parts are coming together to build virtual learning communities. The next logical step would be the creation of an all-in-one, online communication and collaboration system for schools that leverages the best of what Web 2.0 offers. This article discusses how Hong Kong International School (HKIS) created its own all-in-one Web-based system called myDragonNet (http://dragonet.hkis.edu.hk). What began as an online file storage and calendar system for HKIS has grown into a multifaceted virtual community experience that works to leverage aspects of Web 2.0 to meet the users' educational, collaboration, and communication needs. The technical and educational architecture of myDragonNet is such that it is designed for future adaptation and expansion.",

Fulldome video, also called immersive projection, can help teach subjects ranging from geology to history to chemistry. The rapidly advancing progress of projection technology has provided high-resolution projectors at increasingly lower prices, resulting in entry-level systems within the reach of schools. The breakthrough for schools about fulldome systems has been twofold: higher-powered projectors combined with a special lens that allows coverage of the dome with a single projector. Another optical approach, developed in Australia, uses a spherical mirror and a projector with a non-fisheye lens, resulting in even lower prices, although with lower projection quality. Here, the author discusses how students learn through the immersive environment of fulldome video and describes some issues to be addressed in the future evolution of this new technology.

(2001), which can be used to evaluate learners' technology-enhanced experience in more powerful and critical ways. The New Bloom's Taxonomy incorporates contemporary research on learning and human cognition into its model. The original taxonomy created consensus about how to use important vocabulary as it helped educators make use of the hierarchical nature of knowledge in teaching, learning, and curriculum development. It helped teachers use objectives as tools to promote and evaluate student learning. Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues created a workable and valuable way for educators to think about objectives, talk to each other, and create curriculum. The new paradigm updates this classic taxonomy and has some very important changes that help technology-using educators even more. This updated version of the classic Bloom's Taxonomy emphasizes learners' cognitive processes and points toward technology-enhanced activities.

        "description":"The interest in online learning has been growing at a rapid pace, especially for professionals who find it inconvenient to attend face-to-face workshops or courses. This is particularly true for educators pursuing inservice professional development, as there is precious little time to be away from their classrooms. This need, combined with the growing demand for science content courses for teachers, resulted in the NSF-funded National Teacher Enhancement Network, a series of online science courses offered by Montana State University for teachers across the United States. George Tuthill, co-director of the NTEN project, was the one who popped the question: How would you like to teach the Science of Sound online? Little did the author knows that this question, and his affirmative response, would be the beginning of an adventure that would change his view of teaching and cultivate new skills as an instructor. This article discusses how the experience of teaching the course online has forced the author to rethink his ways of teaching. (Contains 1 resource and 2 online resources.)",

        "description":"The communication and collaborative interface known as a multi-user virtual environment (MUVE), has existed since as early as the late 1970s. MUVEs refer to programs that have an animated character (\"avatar\") controlled by a user within a wider environment that can be explored--or built--at will. Second Life, a MUVE created by San Francisco-based Linden Lab, has generated a great deal of media attention in recent months. This attention has attracted hundreds of thousands of new users (\"residents\"), including a growing population of educators who are seeing all kinds of possibilities. Dozens of universities and colleges are using the main grid to teach both traditional and distance learning classes. A growing number of middle and high school educators are focusing their attention on the Teen grid, designed specifically for students age 13-17 and educators who have been approved by Linden Lab. This article presents the stories of Peg Sheehy, a middle school educator in the Ramapo Central School District (RCSD) in Rockland County, New York and Barry Joseph, director of online leadership for Global Kids, a non-profit organization located in New York City as digital immigrants.

The VS movement continues to expand at a rapid rate, especially at the high school level. The continuing success of VS efforts will require K-12 teachers, administrators, and support staff at host schools to collaborate effectively with VS providers. Virtual schooling requires substantial shifts in teachers' roles and necessitates distributing responsibilities for providing an educational experience among host school participants and VS providers. Delineating new roles and responsibilities for teachers can raise their awareness of the demands of VS, and help them understand how teaching roles and responsibilities are likely to change in response to the needs of their digital native students. This article aims to raise the awareness of the people that every teacher may have a role to play in the facilitation of VS now that it is becoming a common experience in U.S. education.

The technology allowed teachers to transform education rather than just automate old ways of learning. At the beginning of the Instructional Revolution teachers had to schedule bandwidth time to work on projects with other schools. No one ever thought about limitations; they only thought about how to improve the communications and increase the capacity for data transfer.",

SLA is built on the notion that inquiry is the very first step in the process of learning and provides a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum with a focus on science, technology, mathematics, and entrepreneurship. The structure of the Science Leadership Academy reflects its core values, with longer class periods to allow for more laboratory work in science classes and performance-based learning in all classes. In addition, students in the upper grades have more flexible schedules to allow for opportunities for dual enrollment programs with area universities and career development internships in laboratory and business settings, as well as with The Franklin Institute.

        "description":"Jerome Burg, after 34 years of teaching, left his own classroom last year and now helps other teachers integrate technology into the curriculum at Granada High School in Livermore, California. One new project he designed is heightening global interest in literary road trips by creating a resource that combines a new technology with a time-tested instructional approach. Google Lit Trips harnesses Google Earth as a powerhouse teaching tool for literature studies. The interactive Web-based application allows users to literally search the globe, using satellite imagery, maps, terrain, and other three-dimensional images. Burg has designed custom files so that literature students virtually travel along with a literary character, using Google Earth to explore the key locations of a story. Burg's experience shows what can happen when a teacher understands the power of the mashup--a hybrid application that draws from multiple sources to create something new. Today's technologies--and the emerging mashups--help teachers to perform eight essential learning functions: (1) Ubiquity; (2) Deep Learning; (3) Making Things Visible and Discussable; (4) Expressing Ourselves, Sharing Ideas, Building Community; (5) Collaboration; (6) Research; (7) Project Management; and (8) Reflection and Iteration. Although technologies continually evolve, these learning functions remain fairly stable. (Contains 4 resources.)",

The temptation to replace highly skilled professionals with scripted, mass delivered &quot;content&quot; as a means of reducing costs and/or maximizing profits is a contender for the worst reason. New policies at both district and state levels will either promote or prevent effective online learning, depending on how well they are informed by professionals who have already spent years working in this field.

Although security measures appear to be well grounded, there is increasing evidence that many policies being imposed by administration as efforts to protect students and personnel from lawsuits are actually decreasing the availability and utility of integrating technology into teaching and learning. The more anecdotal information they gather, the clearer it becomes that increased use of security and monitoring software is having a negative effect on students and educators. In this article, the authors identify and discuss the threats of security: (1) E-mail; (2) Networks; (3) Web Sites; and (4) Filters. (Contains 9 resources.)",

The author also relates how they knew that truly successful technology integration would require a pedagogical focus rather than a technology skills focus. They also knew that the teachers and students already possessed substantial technology skills. Their objectives, therefore, were to help students use technology as a tool for higher-order thinking and learning and to help teachers use technology as a tool for promoting higher-order learning.

Success is based not only on what one knows or how much one knows, but on one's ability to think and act creatively. In short, people are now living in the Creative Society. Unfortunately, few of today's classrooms focus on helping students develop as creative thinkers. In addition, the proliferation of new technologies is quickening the pace of change, accentuating the need for creative thinking in all aspects of people's lives. In this article, the author discusses two technologies developed by his research group at the MIT Media Lab with the explicit goal of helping people develop as creative thinkers. The two technologies, called Crickets and Scratch, are designed to support what the author calls the &quot;creative thinking spiral.&quot; In this process, people &quot;imagine&quot; what they want to do, &quot;create&quot; a project based on their ideas, &quot;play&quot; with their creations, &quot;share&quot; their ideas and creations with others, and &quot;reflect&quot; on their experiences--all of which leads them to &quot;imagine&quot; new ideas and new projects.

Schools can benefit from these partnerships by receiving the latest hardware and software, and corporations benefit from increased profits. To find out exactly what (besides money) matters when principals engage in technology partnerships with corporations, the author spoke with nine principals across the United States. The author found that principals commonly cited their needs for additional hardware, software, and training as criteria for entering into various partnerships. The author used these responses to generate 10 guidelines specifically for technology partnerships to help school administrators and other decision-makers think more critically about all aspects of school-corporate partnerships that involve technology.

We interviewed 10 novice  counselors using a semi-structured interview protocol in order to understand their perceptions of broadening and narrowing processes during their Master's-level internships. Interviews were analyzed using a variation of the consensual qualitative research method (Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997).

        "description":"This paper considers mathematical abstraction as arising through a natural mechanism of the biological brain in which complicated phenomena are compressed into thinkable concepts. The neurons in the brain continually fire in parallel and the brain copes with the saturation of information by the simple expedient of suppressing irrelevant data and focusing only on a few important aspects at any given time. Language enables important phenomena to be named as thinkable concepts that can then be refined in meaning and connected together into coherent frameworks. Gray and Tall (1994) noted how this happened with the symbols of arithmetic, yielding a spectrum of performance between the more successful who used the symbols as thinkable concepts operating dually as process and concept (procept) and those who focused more on the step-by-step procedures and could perform simple arithmetic but failed to cope with more sophisticated problems. In this paper, we broaden the discussion to the full range of mathematics from the young child to the mature mathematician, and we support our analysis by reviewing a range of recent research studies carried out internationally by research students at the University of Warwick.",

By means of abstracting, the effects of this complexity can be reduced. Recent research and theoretical development show us that young children already seem to be able to think abstractly. The acknowledgement of this potential in young children may provide a vehicle for the promotion of more mathematical thinking. In this article, we describe an approach to abstraction that focuses on schematising activities. On the basis of our research, we conclude that young children are able to improve the quality of their abstract mathematical thinking by these means. (Contains 2 figures.)",

It documents the difficulties involved in and explores the potentialities of both accounts. Then it outlines a recent model which takes a dialectical materialist approach to abstraction in context. This model constitutes the basis of the second section where we describe an empirical study designed to investigate mathematical abstraction in socially rich (e.g., peer-interacted and tutor-assisted) environments. We then present data on two students working with the help of a tutor on tasks concerned with graphs of absolute value functions. On the basis of these data, we discuss four particular themes which are relevant to the purpose of this special issue and are important in the discussion of mathematical abstraction: human and artefact mediation, tutor interventions in assisting the formation of mathematical abstractions, implications of a dialectical view on student development, and the things that are abstracted.

        "description":"The article uses sociolinguistic and ethnographic methods and Black feminist theory to explore the classroom interactions of Pam and Natonya, two Black young females, during one event in a required high school British literature classroom. The event is presented as a telling case to explore gendered and racial complexities facing young Black female students in a British literature class, dominated by literature written from a Eurocentric perspective, primarily by White males. The telling case was analyzed to explore how Whiteness functioned within the British literature curriculum and classroom interactions and how the two Black young women were negatively positioned as a result of classroom interactions around the curriculum. The analysis made visible how Pam and Natonya were constantly negotiating whiteness within the British Literature curriculum. Their experiences are important as they afford educators and educational researchers the opportunity to see some of the challenges faced by historically underrepresented students who may have been marginalized by Whiteness within the curriculum.

This research was a collaboration between a teacher and a team of university-based researchers as they used ethnographic action research to make visible the teacher's espoused and enacted beliefs as to what counts as multiliteracies in her classroom during the exploratory first phase of the inquiry. Social constructionism framed our theoretical orientation and our epistemological view of knowledge. Data based on observations, field notes, reflective journal entries, videotapes and cultural artifacts were analyzed from contrastive and holistic perspectives using micro-analytic techniques to interpret ways that meanings were negotiated when reading a multi-modal text on an IWB. Results reported indicate lack of congruence between the teacher's espoused and enacted beliefs, given that her practices focused mainly on traditional print-based modes of communication. These findings will inform the teacher's action in the next phase of the study where ethnographic action research methods will guide the teacher's planning in ways that will align her espoused and enacted beliefs about multiliteracies, multimodal texts and the use of the IWB in her classroom.

        "description":"In early years' (primary grade) classrooms in Australia repeated patterns are commonly explored as an early introductory activity to mathematics. Most young students have an extensive knowledge of and exhibit success in copying, continuing, creating and transferring patterns into other media. By contrast, research indicates one of the most difficult concepts with which students grapple in their later years of elementary school is the notion of ratio. This paper reports on a design (teaching) experiment conducted over a four-lesson period in two classrooms comprising 51 students whose average age was 9 years and 6 months. The focus of these lessons was using students' knowledge of repeating patterns, an understanding that traditionally remains in the precinct of early years, to scaffold the introduction of ratio. The theoretical frameworks that underpinned the classroom interactions and learning were the socio-constructivist theory of learning, inquiry-based discourse and the simultaneous use of multi-representations to build new knowledge. The results show that after a short intervention period, repeating patterns can act as effective bridges for introducing the ratio concept. They also show that particular representations and teacher actions assisted students to identify ratio, recognize equivalence between particular ratios, and begin to represent these ideas in abstract notation systems.

        "description":"Classroom talk is regarded as essential in engaging and developing student understandings in the domain of mathematics. The processes of classroom talk may occur in quite different ways, ways that shape particular opportunities for learning mathematics. Little is known about how the talk produced in innovative approaches to education mediates the teaching/learning process and promotes student engagement in the practices of mathematics. Situated within a larger study that employed multiple forms of data collection to determine whether a sociocultural approach to teaching and learning could be employed by a sample of teachers to enrich the teaching and learning of mathematics, this paper examines how two teachers used talk to scaffold student learning and how this talk provided students with different opportunities for learning. In the analyses of talk produced in Year 7 classrooms we use Renshaw and Brown's (in press) discourse characterizations to make visible how different forms of talk were being used in the classrooms as thinking devices and as means to explain and generate understanding. We also employ Bakhtin's notion of &quot;voice&quot; to consider whether the formats of talk used in each classroom facilitate learning in the domain of mathematics. We conclude that the intentional and reflective use of classroom talk affords students a range of opportunities to develop their mathematical thinking and to facilitate engagement with the practices of mathematics.

Results suggest that opportunities to question teaching practices as well as co-planning and co-teaching with associates supported the development of self-reflection and educational philosophies.

Traditionally, researchers have tended to emphasize the poor academic performance of Black students, or issues and problems related to their academic failure, or to stereotype them as loud, lazy, criminal, athletic, deprived, dangerous, and deviant. In contrast, this article looks at Black students in Alberta who have achieved academic success in spite of considerable adversity. The data presented here show that factors such as the home environment and parental encouragement contribute to academic success. (Contains 3 notes.)",

Rogoff's socio-cultural framework, which proposes three planes of analysis for observation of human development, is used for the analysis. The literacy practices of Max (age 8) are the central focus. The analysis explores how community, interpersonal, and personal literacy activities connect to form holistic literacy practices for him. Insights into the nature of peer interactions around literacy, gender considerations in family literacy, and boys' out-of-school literacy practices emerge from this analysis. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Data consisted of tape-recorded focus group interviews and group planning meetings, as well as two researcher journals.

Using data extracted from a provincial quality of school life (QSL) survey, means associated with students from a sample of fishing communities were compared with provincial means. Although community students had poorer perceptions of school life both before and during the fishery closure, more positive attitudes were evident after the closure, suggesting that parental job loss may have motivated children to aspire beyond their parents' vocational achievements. However, not all communities demonstrated such a positive change. Plausible explanations for the community variability are discussed. (Contains 1 note, 6 tables, and 2 figures.)",

By describing the formation of the peer collaboration groups, the processes that led to the  Counselling Trio's successful collaboration, and the impact of the experience on the three  participants, we attempt to illustrate how peer collaboration can be used as a forum for  self-care among grief counsellors.

        "description":"Heart disease is the leading cause of illness, disability, and death among women in Canada.  Myocardial infarction (MI) accounts for almost half of these deaths yearly. The purpose  of this study was to understand younger women's experience of recovery from MI. A  purposive sample consisting of six younger women diagnosed with MI participated in  an eight-week guided autobiographical (GA) group intervention where they engaged in  weekly reflection, writing, and group dialogue. The experience of loss, uncertainty, changes  in self-perception, self-care, health care and support from others, and caring for others  emerged from the data analysis. GA was shown to be an effective psychosocial intervention  to facilitate emotional recovery following a significant cardiac event as all participants  described the GA group as a therapeutic component of their recovery process.",

If a client becomes employed, the counselling is viewed as successful, while all other outcomes are viewed as failures. We advance the idea that many other outcomes, such as seeking further training, can result in increased financial productivity over the long term, and therefore an employment equivalence measurement can be developed to depict this outcome. Furthermore, employment equivalence can interact with factors such as increased salary resulting from further training to yield a measure of return on investment that provides an indication of the financial return on some counselling outcomes that do not produce an immediate change in employment status. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate how employment equivalence and return on investment can be used to demonstrate the value of career development services.",

Although there were several limitations in this study, the results have important implications and raise questions for future research. The finding that half the universities have a specific assistive technology course that offers instruction in such technology designed for individuals with visual impairments is evidence of its importance. Of the 12 universities that either embed or integrate assistive technology into their programs, 6 responded that there was a possibility that a course on assistive technology would be created in the future.

        "description":"In this article, the author answers the question: &quot;Why do Americans love to reform the public schools?&quot; His answer has three parts. First, there is an old and persistent cultural strain in American history, derived from many sources, that seeks human perfection and sees education and schooling as essential to that perfectibility. That goal is high enough to guarantee that most people will not reach it. This means that numerous citizens at any point bemoan the quality of the public schools, which cannot simultaneously achieve laudable but mutually contradictory goals, such as high standards and equality. Second, many Americans believe that their nation uniquely respects the individual and, as a corollary to that belief, has a remarkably fluid social order. Individuals are so highly regarded that they are held personally responsible for their school performance. In the modern world, schools can decisively help determine which individuals will or will not attend college, who will rise into the professions, and who will sink into the service economy. When schools cannot produce success for everyone, citizens often blame teachers, not the more powerful folks in charge of the economy. Third, over the past two centuries America's public schools have assumed so many responsibilities for the care, discipline, and education of the young that they inevitably disappoint many people. The current mania for standardized testing hardly means that schools have shed their various social functions, many unrelated directly to academic achievement. The dream of perfection, the supreme faith in the individual and social mobility through appropriate schooling, and the unexamined assumption that schools should cure whatever ails the nation make educational reform a constant concern in American society.

But just the opposite happened. As belief in the research literature's nonexistence has spread, efforts to reference it have become less thorough or casually dismissed. After all, why bother to search a literature you believe does not exist? As ironic (and inexplicable) as it may be, the bulk of an available research literature that could help guide the society in implementing its primary and most controversial education policy remains largely unknown.

It includes their individual reflection and study as well as the collegial activities undertaken to prepare the lesson. In China, organizational structures for both individual teachers and a school's professional community embed lesson preparation in two activities: preparing a lesson plan and refining the plan through &quot;open lessons.&quot; In this article, the authors explore not only how Chinese teachers develop lesson plans, but also how the organizational structure of Chinese teaching enables them to use lesson plans as a professional-development activity. Lesson planning allows teachers to explore multiple aspects of pedagogical content knowledge. In developing lesson plans, teachers have opportunities to think deeply about the subject matter, including the way the subject matter is represented in particular textbooks or in such aspects of the curriculum as standards and benchmarks. They also have time to develop pedagogical activities or methods that enable students to grasp the subject matter. Lesson planners can ponder what students know and how they may best understand the content.",

        "description":"This review of literature on progress monitoring was designed to examine the full array of curriculum-based measures (CBMs) in mathematics for students from preschool to secondary schools. We organized the article around two primary concerns: the approach used to develop the measures (curriculum sampling or robust indicators) and the type of research necessary to establish the viability of the tasks. Our review addressed the technical adequacy of the measures as indicators of performance and progress, as well as teachers' use of the measures to improve achievement. The largest number of studies has been conducted at the elementary level, with less work in early mathematics or at the secondary level. In general, the measures have acceptable levels of reliability; the criterion validity of mathematics CBMs appears to be lower than that for reading CBMs. One important finding that emerged was the relatively low degree of consensus on the best approach to use in developing mathematics CBMs. We discuss probable reasons for this, along with implications for practice and research.",

        "description":"Bilingual education has been an extremely controversial and contentious topic in recent years among both educators and the general public in the United States. Long a bastion of what some writers have called &quot;ideological monolingualism,&quot; the United States has not demonstrated either great sensitivity to or tolerance of linguistic diversity historically. In this article, the authors discuss the case for bilingual education programs, though, from a somewhat different perspective from that generally offered by supporters and advocates of bilingual schooling in the United States. Most of the arguments in favor of bilingual education are grounded in defenses of the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of bilingual education programs--that is, in arguing that bilingual education is a good thing because it works. Although they believe this to be true, and briefly review the arguments and evidence for this claim, what they suggest here is that there is a far more powerful, and relevant, argument for bilingual education programs. Arguments of the sort generally offered presuppose that what is at stake is ultimately a matter of pedagogical effectiveness--what works best for the children involved. There are, though, constraints on effectiveness as a criterion for educational practice. Not everything that &quot;works&quot; is acceptable; no matter how effective it might be to use electrical shocks to increase student motivation to learn, for instance, no reasonably sane educator or policymaker is likely to advocate it. Similarly, there are certain fundamental rights (including linguistic human rights) that must be observed in the educational process. It is in this sphere, they argue, rather than in the sphere of pedagogical effectiveness alone, that the real case for bilingual education needs to be made. There are, they believe, some common, core assumptions shared by virtually all educators, policy-makers, and indeed, by most individuals in the general public that relate to the issues that they address in this article.",

The denigration of research methods which decline to adhere to the trappings of logical positivism may have begun with Rene Descartes, but the origins of the dispute between positivists and post-positivists reach much further into history. This analysis examines the dimensions of one such method of classical inquiry, rhetorical criticism, and, taking as an example the funding of public education, demonstrates the value of attending to the language of persuasion. Judging from the excerpt, it is a skill conservative policymakers practice all too well and one which the social foundations community may find beneficial in efforts to effect meaningful reform.

According to the U.S. Department of Commence, Census Bureau data (2002) the difference in household earnings between the upper and lower quintiles has worsened over the last forty years. Future generations possess suspect knowledge to properly manage this income, as youth possess very low financial literacy levels. Determining benchmarks relevant to all societal dimensions presents a challenge to developing financial education curricula. The No Child Left Behind Act (U.S. Department of Education, 2001) provided financial incentives for developing financial literacy curricula, but did not provide guidelines for these curricula. Absent systematic changes to the economic education processes, one risks alienating children by teaching them improper economic curricula. In this article, the author presents a literature review that begins with studies about economic relationships with psychological processes. It follows these studies with research into economic influences in education systems and concludes with suggestions for improvement in financial literacy education.",

        "description":"In a 1974 essay entitled \"Cloud of Smoke, Pillar of Fire,\" Rabbi Irving Greenberg offered the \"working principle\"--no statement, theological or otherwise, should be made that would not be credible in the presence of burning children--in response to Christian silence during the Holocaust and as a kind of moral plumb line by which post-Shoah theological claims should be measured. As a philosopher of education, the author is particularly daunted by Greenberg's reference to statements \"theological or otherwise,\" for it challenges him to reflect upon the significance of tragedy for secular education and thus engage a centuries-long conversation about topics that have confounded the conceptual nets of far more competent philosophers. But in the light of all that has happened in the past two years, in the shadow of all that happens year in and year out to remind of the realities of Greenberg's clouds of smoke and pillars of fire, he is moved to apply Greenberg's working principle to the enterprise of public education as it is commonly practiced in the U.S. and the claims made about it, philosophical or otherwise. In this essay, he proposes to reflect upon the question of what it might mean to teach in the presence of burning children, and what it might mean to do philosophy of education in their presence.

        "description":"In this article, the author discusses the technologies of power in classroom organization practices that occur on two levels: (1) locally, in a study of open-concept, learner-centered classrooms; and (2) discursively, in a commentary on the value of a Foucauldian analysis of power for educators. Foucault's analysis of what the author calls productive power provides the theoretical grounding for a study of power operating in classroom organizational practices. In turn, the study of power in classroom organizational practices serves to illustrate gaps in the predominant ways teachers \"read\" and, consequently, address, power. The paper proceeds in three parts. The author begins Part One by reviewing \"sovereign power,\" the dominant approach in contemporary educational theory and practice. Productive power is then introduced through an exegetical account of Foucault's analysis of panopticism (discipline), docility, and normalization (power/knowledge). In Part Two, she follows a similar path. The selected rupture emerges from a pre-service discussion of technologies of power in classroom organization in which it became clear that the technologies of power operating within traditional and open concept classroom settings appear markedly different. The bulk of this section is devoted to a genealogical analysis of open concept classroom organization. Again, panopticism, docility, and normalization are key themes. Finally, in Part Three, she argues that a shift in the ways teachers address questions of power must be accompanied by a shift in teachers' conceptions of practice. Illustrating the practices involved with an example based on the construction of resistant student subjectivities, she advocates a re-orientation of teachers' reflections that decenters the question \"what must be done\" in favor of Foucault's provocative \"what is the current danger?\" (Contains 1 figure and 47 notes.)",

They also address implications for qualitative researchers who wish to use performance as part of evaluation studies. They speculate on how to create a performance that not only gives justice to the multiple voices in qualitative data but that also invites dialogue that is meaningful, non-threatening, and ethically defensible. A dialogic approach to program evaluation research can lead to a more ethical and equitable relationship between evaluators and program participants, which in turn can result in richer understandings of program implementation. It also allows participants to claim ownership of the evaluation and can provide a vehicle for disseminating results. (Contains 3 notes.)",

One consequence of that loss, sometimes, is immobility--a paralysis brought on by the violent, forceful, uncertain rush of social mobility itself. The immobility of fear, the feeling stuck, the not being sure what educational successes have been hard-won and what scholarly failures should have been easy to swallow: these have been an integral part of saying farewell to the economic, cultural, and personal homes that have, for better or worse, nurtured people. The purpose of this paper is to offer three sets of thematically linked, dialogic narrative accounts of the confusing and complex paths of social mobility and immobility that academic institutions in the United States have provided the authors: two straight-identified, white-appearing American men from working-class backgrounds who are now critical education scholars and professors of communication. The authors hope that their positions of relative privilege can become a meaningful vantage point for reflecting on the unique interrelationship of social class and higher education--specifically in their cases, of working-class histories and academic lives.",

        "description":"In this paper, the author explores her experiences growing up of being defined as \"different\" due to her class background. The author uses the term \"difference\" to mean how the concept of the \"other\" is defined and understood in this society. The \"other\" in this instance are individuals or groups who have existed on the margins of the society; those whose concerns and perspectives have been shrouded in \"silence,\" left out of the discourse of the dominant culture. By exploring how the experiences of her home life, teachers and school organizations collided to designate her as \"different\" on many levels, the author attempts to show how conflicting internalized conceptions of self can develop. This interaction was inter-subjective, in the sense that her physical body did not change but her subjective perceptions together with the subjective perceptions of others saw different people within her. For this paper, the author makes the assertion that beyond small but obvious physical variations, people are not born with \"differences,\" and that the assertion of \"difference\" can be a negative and thus, dangerous construction. Specifically, the author examines how her \"difference\" was defined and continued to be redefined as she developed; and how negative designations as \"different\" were externally and internally stigmatizing.",

        "description":"In an effort to explore how racial and class oppressions intersect, the authors use their autobiographical narratives to depict cultural and experiential continuity and discontinuity in growing up white working class versus Chicano working class. They specifically focus on \"racializing class\" due to the ways class is often used as a copout by working-class whites to deny the existence of white privilege (Rothenberg, 2002) and to address the ways scholars of color romanticize being working class (Brayboy, 2003). Academic discussions of oppression typically compartmentalize various \"isms\" into separate, static categories (i.e. racism, classism, sexism, and heterosexism). As an alternative, the authors offer a more dynamic, complicated picture of oppression in everyday life. They propose that the lived experience of oppression is fluid, dynamic, and constantly being re/created rather than being set structures or categories that define people and how they experience and interpret the world. In their analysis, the authors build upon Patricia Hill Collins's (2000) \"matrix of domination\" in two distinct ways. First, they emphasize the idea of privilege. Secondly, complimenting Hill-Collins's idea that intersecting oppressions shift and are, \"organized through diverse local realities,\" they integrate Bourdieu's (1977) focus on human agency and habitus from his theory of practice.

As a novice teacher educator teaching a foundations course that foregrounds issues of diversity, power, and opportunity in schools and other social institutions, the author of this study set out to analyze how the students from her course who are pursuing teacher certification reflect upon their learning about diversity after completing this course. In this paper, she shares her analysis of interviews with four of her former students, foregrounding their voices in order to explore how they make sense of their learning about diversity. After an analysis of the reflections of the teacher candidates, she shares some initial conclusions about the challenges involved in teaching and learning about diversity. Here, she discusses the implications for teacher education, as she describes the tensions that the teacher candidates foreground and how these tensions complicate her theory of teacher learning about diversity that starts from the assumption that preservice teachers have experiences from which they can begin to theorize about issues of diversity. Before offering an analysis of each student's interview, she describes the foundations course that the students completed before their interviews, offers a brief introduction of the composition of the class and of the students who were interviewed, and describes the methodology of this study.

In each case, the selected texts are rendered as diaries or as first-person narratives describing disturbing situations which are resolved either through reading, writing or merely adjusting. In this article, the author discusses text interrogation as an instructional approach for instructors to use to introduce some of these literary works. Using this approach, the instructor uses focused questions to develop proximity to the text and to anticipate and address some of the historical and contextual information that will have to be carefully explained to youngsters. This approach promotes literacy in three ways: (1) using a compelling genre; (2) providing readers with opportunities to articulate reactions, personal positions, fears and concerns; and (3) the freedom to decide to \"gloss over\" what they do not want to read or deal with at the moment. In this day and age, when young adults are gratuitously exposed to scenes of violence in the media, a genre like this one seems most appropriate. The global/transcultural nature of this collection provides a first-person perspective on compelling historical events that had not been unearthed so dramatically before.",

Oftentimes this educational inequality is based on ethnicity, class, and gender as well as additional cultural factors. It is essential that teacher education programs include courses that address multicultural issues with the goal of developing true respect for those who are different than one's self. In order to gain respect for &quot;all&quot; others, pre-service teachers need to first understand what culture is; research their own cultural backgrounds and how individual cultural backgrounds influence the way one judges others; realize why multicultural education is needed in schools through an examination of the educational, economic, political, and social inequities in society; and be exposed to the true history of the United States.

Because of this organizational location, OHRP has campus-wide scope which has been foundational to its ability to adapt the Intergroup Dialogue Program (IDP) component of its IDLP from a student-focused initiative toward meeting the needs that staff at all levels on campus have expressed for intergroup dialogue. In responding to this expressed need over the last three years, OHRP has piloted a Black/Latina/o or &quot;Group-Specific&quot; Intergroup Dialogue for housekeeping staff at the university, as well as a Women of Color Story Circle Intergroup Dialogue for administrative assistants on campus, which are both discussed in this article. In the effort to address issues raised by these groups by systematically addressing the reasons most often offered to explain and even rationalize them, a draft &quot;Policy Resolution on Full Inclusion of All Staff into the University Community&quot; was recently developed. This resolution sets forth a three-tiered approach through which non-exempt staff may be afforded fuller access to participation in the shared governance and career path development within the university.

First, students are asked to contemplate transpersonal experiences such as healing and suffering, second, students are provided with tools to observe and analyze self and other, third, students are asked to apply these principles and methods to the study of a culture that is neutral to them, and fourth, the students are asked to contemplate the question of how narrative heals. The authors feel multicultural education should, at its foundation, have as a goal healing the pain \"all\" Americans have around the issue of race. (Contains 10 notes.)",

        "description":"We developed and evaluated the G3S-SP, a scale measuring health sciences graduate students' perceptions of the quality of their supervision. The scale was developed from a literature review and existing questionnaires. Feedback from health sciences graduate students and supervisors led to a revised version of the scale that was mailed to 215 students enrolled in eight programs of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Sherbrooke. Analyses show that mean satisfaction scores differ significantly across programs (p=0.036), which supports the scale's discriminant validity. Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure accounting for 84% of the variance. The first factor ([alpha]=0.88) assesses the supervisors' involvement in the design and conduct of the student's research project, while the second ([alpha]=0.76) refers to student-supervisor relationships. We conclude that the G3S-SP is a valuable tool to monitor health sciences graduate students' perception of the quality of their supervision and to identify areas that need improvement.

        "description":"In recent years, there has been an increasingly pervasive discourse regarding the need for high levels of post-secondary education for life course success in a knowledge economy. Correspondingly, most Western industrialized nations have seen a drastic increase in university enrolment. Although we do know that access to university continues to be constrained by social class, we know little about factors contributing to dropping out of university. Using qualitative data obtained through semi-structured interviews, in this paper I investigate whether first-generation student status and social class affect individuals' university experiences and decisions to drop out. Key findings suggest that first-generation students are more likely to leave university early--often despite solid academic performance. Reasons for leaving university without graduating are centred around class-cultural discontinuities, such as not fitting in, not \"feeling university,\" and not being able to relate to other students. These discontinuities are interpreted as a clash between an old and a newly developing habitus. (Contains 1 table and 3 notes.)",

Following a regulatory change introduced by the College of Nurses of Ontario in 1998, all Registered Nurse educational preparation was restructured to the baccalaureate degree level through province-wide adoption of a college-university collaborative nursing program model. Despite complex sectoral differences in organizational culture, mandates, and governance structures, this program model was promoted by nursing educators and policy-makers as an innovative approach to utilizing the post-secondary system's existing nursing education infrastructure and resources. This paper provides an overview of the introduction of Ontario's collaborative baccalaureate nursing programs and discusses some of challenges associated with implementing and maintaining such programs.

Since the implementation of NCLB, there has been increased course-taking in science, math, and the other traditional academic subjects by high school students in this country. Research shows that the consequence has been a loss of opportunity for many students to enroll in CTE--resulting in declines in CTE enrollments at the secondary level. A 2002 study found that over the coming decade, the country will be facing increases in public secondary school CTE enrollments, which will mean an increase in demand for new CTE teachers. Due to declines in secondary CTE enrollment, CTE teacher education programs rapidly withered across the country. Now, the CTE community faces a huge problem. It must address the quality of preparation of its teachers and students, and must make a fundamental reform of teacher education programs. This article discusses the need for CTE to develop a plan for its future.",

A convenience sample of 24 Navajo families with asthmatic members (n=35) was interviewed between June 1997 and September 1998. While 46% of families had previously used traditional healing, only 29% sought traditional healing for asthma. Use of traditional healing was unrelated to use of biomedical therapies, hospitalizations, or emergency services. Practical factors and questions about the nature and origins of asthma were the primary considerations determining use of traditional medicine. Little conflict between traditional healing and biomedical treatment was reported. The use of traditional healing for asthma is influenced by beliefs about the disease and factors specific to the individual, including their local social, economic, and cultural context.

The technological/human-caused disaster, a classification of interest in this article, is attributable to human error or misjudgment. Lower socioeconomic status and race intersect in the heightened risk for technological/human-caused disasters among people of color. The experience of the Navajo with the uranium industry is argued to specifically be this type of a disaster with associated long-standing psychological impacts. The history of the Navajo with uranium mining and milling is reviewed with a discussion of the arduous efforts for compensation. The psychological impacts of this long-standing disaster among the Navajo are organized around major themes of: (a) human losses and bereavement, (b) environmental losses and contamination, (c) feelings of betrayal by government and mining and milling companies, (d) fears about current and future effects, (e) prolonged duration of psychological effects, (f) anxiety and depression, and (g) complicating factors of poverty and racism.

Governmental funding agencies and research institutions have too often dictated the importance and focus of health-related research and information dissemination. In addition, the digital divide has affected rural communities in such a way that their members often do not possess the knowledge or experience necessary to use technological resources. And, even when they do, their skills may be limited, adequate only for implementing applications and programs designed by others who live and work outside of these communities. This need became the driving force in the creation of the Native Telehealth Outreach and Technical Assistance Program. The goal of the program is to equip Native community members, at both the lay and professional levels, with the means to use technology to address tribal health care needs. The transfer of relevant technical knowledge and skills enables participants to develop projects which enhance the community-wide dissemination of health care information. Nine community health advocates and professionals participated in the initial cohort. Eight of the participants successfully developed multimedia-based projects including Web sites, interactive CD-ROMs, and video focusing on a variety of health concerns. At the conclusion of the 18-month program period, projects were disseminated throughout rural communities. The NTOTAP staff continues to evaluate the use of these projects and their benefits within the rural communities. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"\"Saving Higher Education in the Age of Money\" is a critique of the pernicious syndrome set in motion when the means and concomitant benefits of higher education--money and prestige, in particular--became increasingly accepted as its most important and fundamental ends. The book contends, on the basis of extensive evidence and documentation, that such a distorted perception of the functions of higher education became far more widespread in the last decades of the twentieth century than ever before historically, and that its influence has continued to accelerate. In this article, the authors argue that the \"entelechy\" of higher education, the web of interlocking goals that join to compose the total function and purpose of higher education, is capable of answering all reasonable demands placed on the system. The authors contends that within that entelechy is room for colleges and universities to make education an instrumental economic good, an instrumental social good, and an instrumental civic and political good. All of these goods are obtainable within the entelechy of higher education and are reasonable to expect--so long as people remember to cherish and protect what undergirds and precedes them all.",

Watching Charlotte climb leads the author to reflect on a set of Big Questions such as, \"can I figure out how to lead a meaningful and satisfying life?,\" that students may pose when they reach college. The Big Questions often illumine the material people study, opening up fresh approaches and raising issues that enrich scholarship. In this article, the author suggests that faculty should not shy away from admitting the Big Questions into their classrooms.

Indeed, the questions of liberal education take hold of people only under certain conditions. They call for distinct curricular and pedagogical approaches suited to a particular kind of learner. Beyond the scene of learning, these questions also challenge societies more generally to recognize the value of acknowledging, experiencing, and responding to them and to maintain forums for their discussion. In this article, the author redescribes the nature of the questions of liberal education via a close reading of some words of Rainer Maria Rilke. It is his hope that a clearer appreciation of the existential nature of the questions will illuminate what should be distinctive about this education. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"Administrators hate to be called bureaucrats. They prefer to be seen as academic leaders. Leaders articulate priorities and values, serve as exemplars, and represent an institution to both others and itself. Today, more than ever, the humanities and the arts need academic leaders at every level of the university to give them voice, to avow their importance, to articulate the ways in which the humanities and arts speak for the university, the ways in which they give speech to the central values and value of a liberal education. Yet having been a dean for close to a decade, the author is aware that leadership takes place in an institutional and human infrastructure: a political landscape, a network of administrative hierarchies, faculty and academic senate committees, academic units with budgets, constituencies, needs, and responsibilities. Both day-to-day management and strategic planning take place in a bureaucracy, for better or for worse. The challenge for academic leaders is to \"think through bureaucracy.\" This means that they need to understand administration as an intellectual problem, that they need to understand the intellectual stakes of bureaucracy. Thinking through bureaucracy suggests getting \"past\" bureaucracy, but it also means thinking \"in\" bureaucracy, understanding bureaucracy as a space in which thinking can occur, a mechanism through which thinking must take place. This article discusses that for the humanities to have a place, faculty, faculty committees, department chairs, deans, and learned societies need to worry about the places in which the humanities conduct and organize their research and teaching, and that means thinking about bureaucracy. Thinking about bureaucracy, thinking through bureaucracy, means designing new maps rather than defending territory. If bureaucracy is ignored, the humanities will be left vulnerable to the sort of academic redistricting that will leave one without a territory to defend. An overlay of maps that design and define the overlapping intellectual communities in which teaching and research take place is needed and new forms of collaboration develop.",

        "description":"Each generation of students inevitably must confront anew the fundamental questions of meaning and value that have vexed human beings down through the ages. As students have struggled with these \"Big Questions,\" individually and collectively, liberal education has traditionally sought to provide them with a variety of cultural and historical perspectives, as well as to foster their analytical ability to confront and explore answers, necessarily provisional and often competing, for themselves. In practice, however, there are significant challenges, from lack of student interest and faculty expertise to the persistence of inadequate professional paradigms and reward structures. In this article, the authors provide responses to the Big Questions that engage today's students, which may concern religion; developing a sense of purpose; or how learning can be linked to what matters to each individual.",

        "author":["DuFour, Richard"],
        "description":"It should surprise no one that there are faculties throughout North America that refer to themselves as professional learning communities (PLCs) yet do none of the things that PLCs do. Conversely, there are faculties that could serve as model PLCs that may never reference the term. A school does not become a PLC by enrolling in a program, renaming existing practices, taking the PLC pledge, or learning the secret PLC handshake. A school becomes a professional learning community only when the educators within it align their practices with PLC concepts. Therefore, any valid assessment of the impact of PLC concepts on a school or the compatibility of those concepts with the middle school model would first need to determine if PLC practices were actually in place in the school. Only then would it be possible to determine the impact of those practices on the learning of both students and adults. The professional learning community concept does not offer a short cut to school improvement. It presents neither a program nor a recipe. It does provide a powerful, proven conceptual framework for transforming schools at all levels, but alas, even the grandest design eventually degenerates into hard work. A school staff must focus on learning rather than teaching, work collaboratively on matters related to learning, and hold itself accountable for the kind of results that fuel continual improvement. When educators do the hard work necessary to implement these principles, their collective ability to help all students learn inevitably will rise. If they fail to demonstrate the discipline to initiate and sustain this work, their school is unlikely to become more effective, even if those within the school claim to be a professional learning community. The rise or fall of the professional learning community concept in any school will depend not on the merits of the concept itself, but on the most important element in the improvement of any school--the collective capacity, commitment,and persistence of the educators within it.

In this article, the authors explore and discuss four selected cultural and linguistic factors to consider when teaching mathematics to diverse students. These four major topics, while broad and complex, do collectively create a perspective that values what students bring to the mathematics classroom. More specifically, this instructional perspective considers the strengths that students with diverse language and cultural backgrounds bring to a mathematical environment. These include different ways of representing, speaking, and thinking about mathematical ideas and skills. Teachers not privy to the various cultural and linguistic norms which ground these mathematical dispositions may have difficulty engaging students in mathematical conversations--the centerpiece of current mathematics education reform. The discussion provides suggestions and specific instructional approaches encouraging teachers to view cultural and linguistic diversity as a strength in the teaching and learning of mathematics.",

The goals of the study were (1) to identify the perceptions of Puerto Rican CMSs related to the reasons for migration (M) and circular migration (CM), and (2) to identify their perceptions of how CM affects their social and academic lives. The study was binational in scope, involving CMSs from Puerto Rico as well as from the Northeastern region of the United States. The data collected consisted of structured interviews, that is, audio-taped or video-taped dialogues between a student and a familiar teacher that focused on the student's &quot;educational autobiography.&quot; The purpose of this study was to amplify the voices of Puerto Rican circular migrant students and gain much-needed insight into the perceptions, feelings, opinions, positions, and world views of this growing group. The findings of this study have implications for designing effective pedagogy and support services with other groups that also undergo similar continual circular migrations across national borders and between states.

        "description":"Why do some teachers demonstrate great cultural sensitivity in their work with children while others seem mired in stereotypes, perpetuating a view of diversity as exotic or denying that race is an issue in their classrooms? Why is it so difficult to change these dispositions of teachers? And what can we do in teacher education to further the cultural responsiveness we claim we want teachers to develop? Dispositions of teachers strongly affect the impact they have on student learning and development. Recent research has lead to dispositions playing a prominent role in the accreditation of teacher education programs, including the requirement to effectively measure dispositions of teacher candidates. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (2001) also requires teachers to demonstrate dispositions and the standards are rife with the language of dispositions: value, belief, commitment, passion. There is less consensus however, on the particular dispositions associated with effective teaching, or on the role that dispositions might play in the educational reform movement. In this research, the authors address these questions by using the adult developmental theory of Robert Kegan (1998) to analyze the foundation of the dispositions teachers bring to issues of racial and cultural diversity. They believe that dispositions stem from an underlying psychological meaning-making structure and that teachers need a deeper understanding of that structure so that they can identify the developmental level of their students' dispositional thinking and therefore provide learning environments that support students' growth in changing dispositions.

Results from pre- and post-measures of social sciences content indicated greater improvement in student achievement in these areas when scores from students from teachers who had gone through the training were compared with those that did not. There was also a correlation found between the level of use among the teachers with training and the level of achievement of their students. Perhaps most intriguing in the findings is the level of implementation of certain identified strategies from professional development seminars that were observed. The increase in achievement scores might suggest that teachers were effective in applying the strategies learned. Yet, the level of implementation of those strategies was minimal at best, reaching only a level 3 out of a possible six. Additional research needs to be conducted to explore the relative ratio of student achievement to the level of implementation of strategies employed by target teachers. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Most of the students at Milpera State High School are in Australia because of wars, famine, or economic devastation in their homelands. Many have suffered the additional loss of parents and other family members. Some have low (or nonexistent) literacy in their native languages, and many have had few opportunities for formal education. Such students enter high school well behind the grade level that their ages would indicate, and when they learn to read and write in English, they are learning to read and write for the first time. The very nature and culture of school can be foreign to them. Providing a quality education to such students presents a special challenge for schools and teachers. At Milpera, a newcomer program in Brisbane, Australia, this challenge is being met through a combination of social, cultural, and academic support grounded in critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy offers educators a road they can walk with refugee and immigrant students as they find their way in a strange new land. It is &quot;a pedagogy of engagement: an approach to teaching English as a second language that sees such issues as gender, race, class, sexuality, and post colonialism as so fundamental to identity and language that they need to form the basis of curricular organization and pedagogy.&quot; A critical, narrative research project conducted at Milpera in the waning months of 2003 describes how this school is able to reach refugee and immigrant newcomers through such pedagogy of engagement. This narrative portrait highlights ways in which critical leadership, critical teaching, and a focus on multiple intelligences and literacy serve to assist newcomers as they overcome trauma and develop their identities in Australia. Finally, the critical work being done at Milpera offers implications to all schools serving refugees and immigrants.",

The author suspects that the common thread among these students is the obsessive desire to obtain admission to the most elite colleges. What drives them is the perceived need to do whatever it takes to get into a \"good\" or \"great\" college. They perceive that there is a flow chart, an instruction sheet on what they need to do, and all will be okay. These students are acting as if they have no control. Why did this happen? Who is responsible for it? What impact will it have on the future well being of these students? In this article, the author argues that the cause of all this is a lack of coherence in the college admission process. Few colleges accurately and effectively communicate how they choose their students and, more importantly, why they have the policies and procedures that are in place. One of the most intractable problems in college admission is that there is not a clear congruence between what is best for students and what is desirable in terms of college admission. Here, the author offers a few modest suggestions that the college admission community can do to ameliorate the negative effects of the process on the students.",

        "author":["James, David"],
        "description":"On January 25, 2001, at an elementary school in Washington, DC, President Bush said that testing is crucial &quot;to determine whether or not children are learning.&quot; Testing is appealing to many because it is simple and easy. Americans want to believe that instituting something as routine and common as yearly testing will miraculously provide the solution to the complex problems in schools. Unfortunately, there are no such easy answers. The litany of school problems is as complex as the problems within society. Of course, schools are reflections of society. In this article, the author discusses three primary flaws with the President's educational initiative, namely that: (1) tests are imprecise measures at best; (2) high-stakes tests ultimately lead to a &quot;teaching to the test&quot; syndrome; and (3) using tests for high-stake decisions about student promotion and school funding is a misguided practice. The author stresses that the educational system must deal with issues of funding, educational research, politics, parenting and home environments, teacher training, assessment, technology, institutional leadership, community and business alliances, accountability, human services, and local economics, rather than instituting more testing.",

High school teachers and guidance counselors as well as college admission counselors and prehealth advisors can assist students by providing current information regarding general entrance requirements to health professions programs. The purpose of this paper is to provide both counselors and teachers with information that will assist them in helping students plan programs of study in college and seek relevant health-related experiences. The authors offer suggestions on to how to seek information about health professions and obtain first-hand exposure to the work responsibilities of practitioners. They describe the admission processes of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, physical therapy, and physician assistant programs. To that end, they review degrees available, required college course work, and application procedures and time frames.

        "description":"Every year the college rankings in \"U.S. News & World Report\" raise voices disparaging the rankings' methods, validity and contribution to status-driven consumerism. Now, voices are rising against a September 2002 \"Worth\" magazine article, which ranks preparatory schools not according to the quality of education, but merely on which schools appear to be the major feeders for Harvard, Princeton and Yale. All of this fuss over rankings--whether flawed, limited or simply fallacious as in the \"Worth\" article--loses sight of the fact that the national tendency to over-rely on college rankings jeopardizes one of the finest features of the American republic--the country's amazingly varied higher education system. Rather than supporting this system, the rankings threaten to undermine it. The rankings, focusing only on factual attributes, miss the power of the match between student and institution. Worse, they limit Americans' collective imagination, their ability to see the opportunities that speak instantly to a best-fit student. Here, the author stresses that Americans should not forget how they as Americans ideally do things. \"The pursuit of happiness\" is not just about gathering enough money to buy what one wants. Rather, it gives a person the freedom to be who he/she is, to create the person he/she wants to be and to select a college or university that helps him/her to do both.",

        "author":["Weicheng, Zou"],
        "description":"In the last 20 years, more and more Chinese high school graduates have applied to American colleges. They want to study in this country because the Chinese higher education system cannot meet the needs of China's huge population. This article talks about a seven-month, pre-college program hosted by the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania between 2001-2002. The purpose of the program was to train a group of Chinese high school graduates, who were seeking opportunities in higher education in the United States. The framework of the curriculum was built around comprehensive language training, especially in preparation for the TOEFL and SAT tests, college academic life and American culture in general. At the beginning of the program, a project was designed to teach students to select and apply to an American college. The project combined acquiring cultural knowledge with learning a language. The main component of this 10-hour project was a series of Chinese student interviews with a group of American college students, who had been through the process of college selection, application and admission. The students learned to critique their existing knowledge of American college culture and to make decisions based on the critical analyses of factors involved in college selection and application. Students also had an opportunity to experience authentic, spontaneous and conversational English. At the end of the project, all students began the college selection and application processes. By the end of the pre-college program, all respective universities where students applied accepted them.",

        "description":"College admission professionals use the interview process as a tool for evaluating prospective students. Academic credentials and standardized test scores may attest to a student's academic ability, but they do not provide reliable insight into a student's motivation, character, intellect or basic values. To assist in this evaluation process, admission professionals can utilize Socratic questioning during the admission interview to develop a comprehensive profile of the prospective applicant. It is the dialectic method, founded by Socrates, which outlines that the most precise method of attaining reliable knowledge is through disciplined conversation (Stumpf, 1994). This paper examines the similarities that exist between the goals and characteristics of dialectic method--introduced as an interview technique during a session of interviews with candidates for full-tuition academic scholarships at a competitive private university--and the admission interview. It provides examples of how the dialectic method can be applied during the admission interview.",

        "author":["Weeks, Anne Macleod"],
        "description":"In the early seventies, little thought was given to the role of the college counselor in independent schools. Often they were English teachers who wrote well and by default were asked to take on the daunting task of shepherding students through the process of choosing a college. As faculty, they had little training in the development of adolescents and often resorted to a \"toughen up\" attitude when confronted with an anxiety-ridden student. They did not discuss match, support or need. At the Stanley H. King Counseling Institute (MA), independent school administrators and faculty were encouraged to learn basic counseling skills in an effort to humanize their school environments. In this institute, a smaller retreat that would employ the skills necessary for success, specifically in college counseling in independent schools was formed. Nurtured by three seasoned educators Sarah Hecksher, Jake Dresden and Robin Mead, the retreat has become the Blackberry River Retreat, currently held at Mt. Holyoke College (MA) every January. The Stanley H. King Counseling Institute continues to provide an enriched forum for discussion of independent school issues and needs, and as its step-child, the Blackberry River Retreat, provides an invaluable resource for independent school college counselors. The Blackberry approach could be easily implemented into the structure of larger guidance offices in the public system for the only keys are time, patience and a willingness to listen.",

        "description":"There has been an increase on the number of applicants and the average SAT scores of the admitted students to colleges and universities in the United States. The total number of applicants may increase for purely external reasons, such as more students graduating from high school or more students reading good things about a particular college, but the number may also be increasing because admission offices are driving it up by fair means and foul means. Similarly, SAT scores may be going up because American young people are getting smarter, reading more books, broadening their vocabularies, and grasping the points of arguments faster, but, it also appears that SAT scores are going up because college admission makes them a more important factor each year, privileging the applicants with big numbers and playing rough with anyone whose scores are low. In spite of the increased numbers, things are not better than ever. It is commonplace to say the new emphasis on numbers results from the ever-growing power of the &quot;U.S. News and World Report&quot; rankings of colleges. The larger cause of the problem, however, is the lack of a clear definition in this country of what constitutes a good pre-college education. In this article, the author stresses that Americans should recognize the problem and take responsibility, individually and collectively, for the problem. He also calls on those who work in college admission to empower their professional organizations to address the problem.",

        "description":"As teachers and students consider the heated conversations over selective college admission, including a loud cry to end or curtail early application programs, the author urges admission offices to consider that greater access to the most selective schools must involve a redistribution of precious resources. A smaller percentage of early admits means less savvy students and families gain a relatively greater chance at admission. It also means a larger commitment to financial aid for needy students, which could ultimately drive tuition costs up or redistribute aid away from middle and upper-middle income families. In this article, the author discusses basic reform issues related to highly selective college admission that demand the utmost attention. This system that has evolved to recruit, sort and sift candidates at few select schools is a challenge to America's democratic system because it undermines the meritocratic values Americans hold so dear. A great many articles and conversations report that the college admission processes at the most selective schools can create too great a pressure on students. It is time to expend less energy describing the problem and more on solutions.",

Bullying is defined in this study of 819 rural middle and high school students as when a student is exposed repeatedly to negative actions by one or more other students. Students responded to a questionnaire about how often and where bullying occurred and who students told. Analysis of the data reported frequencies, and the Pearson chi-square was used to test for significance (p less than 0.05) for gender and school level. Results indicated that while there are many similarities, there are some differences in bullying at these two levels that should be considered when reducing bullying. First, students should be encouraged to develop positive strategies to react to name calling and teasing particularly at the middle school level. Second, administrators and teachers must communicate better with students that they care about reducing bullying, especially at the high school level. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This study examines an elementary teacher education certification program delivered by a state university to Native American teacher aides on the reservation. Data were collected over two semesters using a Freirean critical theory framework to analyze the data and to explicate the problematic nature of Native American education. Analysis of the data indicated that the program reproduced Euro-American cultural values, was insensitive to Native American history or values, and did little to support individual teachers. Suggestions include the need for the program to acknowledge and address the historical cultural genocide that occurred in the education of Native Americans and the cultural and political hegemony of the teacher education program. More focus needed to be placed on supporting individual participants and their academic and cultural struggles in becoming teachers. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"Historically, rural schools have been geographically and politically isolated to the extent that some might say that they have been the victims of, or beneficiaries from, an unstated government policy of benign neglect. Recently, conditions and relationships have changed with the enactment of state and federal accountability legislation and legal challenges to the constitutionality of state funding systems for schools. Federal concerns about the quality of teachers and the progress of students are accompanied by state standards, proficiency tests for high school graduation, and school report cards. Most of these requirements are unfunded or under-funded mandates. However, rural schools likely will benefit from the recent shift in school finance litigation from a single emphasis on equity to a dual interest in equity and adequacy. If education is a state responsibility, then in an era of state-mandated standards and assessments, the state has an inherent responsibility to ensure that students have access to the human and material resources required for them to meet standards and pass state proficiency examinations.

Students at Bear Lodge share their perspective and provide a living testimony as to the importance of alternative schools in allowing students to meet with academic success and social acceptance. Bear Lodge allows its students to work at their own pace in a caring and non-coercive environment. Here students attend school regularly, follow a standards-based curriculum, form close relationships with their peers and teachers, and know that the staff believe they can be successful in and out of school.

School size and location impact many areas of education, including the characteristics of the school, curriculum, and post-school outcomes. Research reveals that students in rural schools face many personal and education hardships--from living in poverty to having less opportunity and sophistication in technology. Rural schools also have fewer course offerings. While rural schools are a unique, urban and rural schools may be more similar than expected, particularly as compared to more affluent suburban districts. Rural and urban schools have larger rates of poverty and more dire financial situations, which do impact the educational offerings, experiences, and outcomes of their students.",

Through qualitative interviews, the former high school principal describes reactions and lessons learned as the student made his sexual orientation known, attended prom, and was awarded one of three Matthew Shepard Scholarships given in the state. The unexpected way in which events unfolded in the school and community were nearly as surprising as the revelation of the student's sexual orientation. The experiences reinforce the importance of school climate, meaningful relationships between students and staff, the sometimes hidden challenges of high school, and provide valuable considerations for all educators.",

The results of this study indicated that there are two primary barriers that low-income rural students face in preparing for college: financial and social. Students and parents considered applying to the program not only for academic reasons but also for financial and social reasons. Once enrolled in the program, rural students began to benefit academically, financially, and socially. The retention rate at this public university is significantly higher than the national retention rate reported by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.

Begun in April 2000, the five-year Coastal Rural Systemic Initiative (CRSI) is striving to stimulate sustainable systemic improvements in science and mathematics education in school districts with a long history of low student expectations, persistent poverty, low teacher pay, and high administrator turnover. The CRSI capacity-building model is designed to address issues in rural school districts that traditionally limit the capacity for creating sustainable improvements in math and science programs. A critical action step is that each school district must sign a cooperative agreement to establish Continuous Improvement Teams (CITs) at the district and school levels. These CITs represent a fundamental system capacity-building change in how decisions are made at the school and district levels--a change that is also fundamental to creating lasting improvements in math and science education programs.

Measures of teaching strength are related to INTASC standards. Rural participants differed significantly from non-rural participants in their lower self-perceived accomplishment of action plan goals. Rural participants were significantly more likely to move from their 1st positions after 1 year, but their attrition was not significantly different in later years.

        "description":"In a time of growing interest in accountability, sharing school governance with parents, teachers, the community, and business leaders has become a norm. School councils or advisory groups have become a requirement for schools in many states. This research examined school council members' perceptions of issues addressed by the councils and council effectiveness in rural Georgia. Additionally, this research examined the relationship between council members' perceptions of school council effectiveness among council member constituent groups and the difference between council members' perceptions of issues addressed and actual issues addressed. The research identified factors school council members believed to be important for school council effectiveness. The data were gathered through a survey of school council members in the forty-one county Valdosta State University service area. Actual issues addressed were obtained through a content analysis of school council minutes. Implications for educational practice in rural schools included a process of involving of a variety of constituents in policy making at the school level in an attempt to improve student academic performance and principals hold the key to council effectiveness.",

In addition, the study found that critical issues such as student achievement and qualifications of teachers were not addressed during the recruiting or interviewing phases of the employment process.

Data were collected to determine the impact on the teacher leaders and the effectiveness of the presentations as perceived by the overall teaching faculty. The results suggest an overall positive experience for teachers, as well as an increase in collaboration.

Its purpose is to prepare highly qualified teachers for rural southwest Virginia. The model was developed in response to the growing teacher shortage facing school districts in rural southwest Virginia. Poorer, more rural districts often have weaker tax bases that provide limited, and at times inadequate, financial support for their school districts. This lack of local resources often results in lower salaries and benefits when compared to many districts that compete for the shrinking pool of potential teachers. Additionally, rural communities are often geographically isolated areas and have fewer amenities that attract young teachers from outside the district. The Appalachian Model Teacher Consortium attempts to naturalize shortages by recruiting potential teachers from the local area, and providing incentives for them to stay and teach in their home community.",

        "description":"Part of a larger research project involving the study of mathematics achievement of middle and high school students in Tennessee, this report analyzes said achievement in terms of school locale and the percentage of disadvantaged (pdisadv) students enrolled in the school. Schools were designated as Rural, Large Central City, and Other Nonrural. Socioeconomic Status (SES) was determined by the percentage of students receiving federally subsidized free and reduced lunch. Schools were then placed into one of three economic categories: Low to moderate pdisadv (less than 50 percent of students receiving free or reduced lunch), High pdisadv (50-74.99 percent), or Highest (75 percent or greater). The findings involving SES and achievement were as expected, the higher the percentage of disadvantage, the lower the achievement. Interesting results involving locale as well as the intersection between locale and SES were also discovered. If a student is poor, the data suggests, it is better, in terms of mathematics achievement, to be rural. The possibility exists that close-knit, economically disadvantaged rural locales offer a sense of community not found in other economically disadvantaged locales which enables rural students to achieve at a higher level mathematically than their nonrural peers.

Therefore, rural high school students' and rural general education and special education teachers' perceptions of inclusion provided the primary focus of this case study. Data analysis identified that while overall general education teachers supported the idea of inclusion they did not believe that they were trained. Additionally, the students supported the concept of inclusion when they were allowed choice in which classroom they were placed and if the teacher allowed choice in classroom activities. Also the classroom size was identified by all stakeholders as an issue by being affected negatively by the addition of more students being placed in inclusive classrooms. Implications for the teacher training, and the allocation of resources in rural settings are significant. (Contains 4 tables.)",

All of the participants lived in the same rural county in south Georgia (USA). One of the results from this research was the positive description of living in a rural area. Despite literature that often describes rural areas in a negative light, all of the participants spoke about the positive aspect of living in a rural area. These positive characteristics were discussed as simplicity, quiet, community, and nature. Negative aspects of rural life were mentioned as lack of resources and fewer people. Ten participants were purposefully chosen who were identified as active older adults who continue to learn. Two interviews with each person were conducted and the interviews were transcribed verbatim. The findings were based on recurring themes as a result of comparative analysis throughout the process.

In considering these reasons, patterns emerge in the data that prove intriguing. For example, one pattern indicates that teachers link the lack of student success to aspects beyond their control. These aspects include student home life, socioeconomic levels, and parental attitudes toward school. The second emerging pattern shows that teachers couple their own teaching practices with student achievement. Such indications have great implications for future studies in that the perceptions of teachers may be key in utilizing the results of standardized assessments. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

At issue in the consolidation movement have been concerns of efficiency, economics, student achievement, school size, and community identity. Throughout the history of schooling in America, school consolidation has been a way to solve rural issues in the eyes of policy makers and many education officials. Today, faced with declining enrollments and financial cutbacks, many rural schools and communities continue to deal with challenges associated with possible school reorganizations and consolidations. This paper, developed by the National Rural Education Association (NREA) Consolidation Task Force, provides a review of the literature on rural school consolidation, defines consolidation, addresses current research and issues related to consolidation with respect to school size, economies of scale, and student achievement, and concludes with proposed recommendations for the NREA Executive Board.",

Conclusions of the study revealed that the independent school district in the study does not have a structured transition implementation program to assist rural elementary school district students. Despite literature that supports the success of transitional programs for students and the fact that the county in the study once had a transitional program, there is currently no program in place.

The Technology Supported Induction Network (TSIN) was developed to address these issues by providing support and ongoing professional learning opportunities for preservice teachers through distance technology. A qualitative case study was used to investigate the TSIN's impact on elementary level student teachers. Results indicate that the TSIN's two primary components, a discussion board and compressed video sessions, served different supportive roles.

This research project developed in three phases: (1) identifying; (2) observing teaching practices of; and (3) conducting a weekend focus group with a sampling of teachers of color working in middle and secondary education in the rural state of Wyoming. The data sought from these participants emanated from the following overarching question: How do teachers of color in isolated, relatively rural contexts make sense of their teaching experiences as marginalized people in their profession? Participants were also asked to share the challenges they face as teachers in the settings in which they have chosen to work. The authors identified three broad themes--being held suspect, misperceptions, and invisibility--that captured the diversity of the challenges the participants related. The study shows that participants acknowledge entering teaching as a career for many of the same reasons that draw educators from the nation's general population. That is, they have experienced the support and encouragement of family and other adults, they recognize a \"natural teaching ability\" in themselves, and they bring the desire to impact the lives of others. However, these participants bring three additional elements unique to the equation for teachers of color: (1) the opportunity of being a role model primarily for students of color; (2) the potential to challenge racial-ethnic stereotypes and replace them with acceptance as professional individuals; and (3) the training and desire to bring a multicultural perspective to the schooling enterprise.",

        "description":"The requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) have presented special challenges and opportunities for rural schools (Reeves, 2003). Researchers have suggested that one way rural schools may be able to overcome these challenges is through an increase in the level of technology integration in their school (Collins &amp; Dewees, 2001). This case study reports on one school's attempt to use grant resources funded through NCLB to integrate specific instructional technologies to facilitate increased student achievement. Through interviews and observations, the roles, attitudes, and difficulties of teachers and administrators in implementing a technology initiative in a rural middle school were observed, examined and discussed. Emerging themes included issues related to teacher ownership of the technology, teacher feelings of power and participation, differing goals of teachers and administrators, technical difficulties, school wide support, and changes in school culture.",

Initially, schools embraced this opportunity to provide their students with opportunities that were previously unavailable. However, within a few years the AP program was relegated to urban and large regional high schools. Few smaller, and particularly rural schools, were able to offer AP courses only to the brightest one or two students taking it as an independent study. In 1997-98, schools began to deliver AP courses in a web-based method. The purpose of the study is to examine the retention rates and student achievement in AP courses in the province between different delivery models. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Smaller schools, we are told, are able to somehow disrupt the association between SES and student achievement. Using eighth-grade data for 215 public schools in Maine, I explored the hypothesis that this finding is in part a statistical artifact of the lower reliability of school-aggregated student achievement in smaller schools. This hypothesis was supported for mathematics achievement but seemingly not for reading achievement. Implications are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

Dual enrollment programs allow high school students to enroll in college courses for credit prior to high school graduation with local school districts covering the cost of tuition. Participants in this study were recruited from two rural agricultural counties from Washington State attending a local college. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that dual enrollment participation was related to academics, financial, social, and choice reasons. Results showed no significant differences between 11th and 12th grade participants regarding financial and choice reasons to participate. However, statistically significant differences were found regarding academic and social reasons for participation.

The superintendent is the leader of the school district, which is typically the community's largest employer. There are a few examples of superintendents who embrace this sometimes overwhelming responsibility and who are often seen as pillars of ethics, leadership and morality in the community. Dale Carter is one example of this type of superintendent. Mr. Carter has been employed by Kenawee Public Schools since 1969. During his tenure he has been a teacher, coach, principal and superintendent. This case study will examine how Carter has considered community values when making decisions and how the integration of those values along with his personal and professional values have allowed him to lead a rural school district.",

Though it might be argued that they are not really new, these two components are today necessarily explicit whereas they were more implicit in the past. As research has become increasingly qualitative and constructivist, the idea that describing precisely the theoretical base from which one's work grows has taken on much greater significance, thus the term \"theoretical framework\" which is incorporated into the lexicon of educational research. Likewise, if research is conducted for which the primary data sources are interviews and observations, it becomes necessary to describe how the researchers will know when they have found a result that has meaning or perhaps importance. And the \"how do we know\" questions fall under the heading epistemological framework. Thus emerged a partner for the theoretical framework: the epistemological framework. In this article the author talks about rural science education research and the significance of the two frameworks for rural education research that give it form.",

Initiatives include community conversations with key leaders to determine necessary steps to take in encouraging economic growth and attracting businesses, the institution of entrepreneurship within the community, the transformation of the school into a community resource and the encouragement of place-based education within schools. In the second year of this program there are 13 school districts actively involved in the enhancement of their schools and community. The program adopted many of the principles for rural revitalization seen in the remote communities of South Australia.",

While rural school districts are dealing with many of the same issues facing urban districts, there are unique challenges that rural school principals face. However, effective professional development that addresses the unique needs of rural school leaders can build essential leadership capacity that supports school success. This article discusses the results of a study on the professional development needs of rural high school principals for school improvement.

        "description":"This article relates the story of Jean-Yves Ngabonziza, a full-need international student. During his senior year, on Rwandan National Mourning Day, April 6, 19-year-old Yves spoke to the entire school community for the first time about his past and the past of his native country. He began with the history of central Africa, introduced the factions of the Rwandan conflict, described the genocide (&quot;a civil war that erupted into genocide&quot;), told how it played out and resolved.  It was a remarkably professional presentation, in Yves' fourth language. Yves' education was made possible by the efforts of a Chicago-based Congolese man intent upon establishing a foundation for young Central Africans to be educated in the United States. With the assurance that his organization would provide for Yves' postsecondary education, Yves received a full scholarship package and stipend. The author contends that if individual philanthropists and foundations could match a college offer of a full tuition grant, third-world students would be amply supported--and many colleges can make that offer. If more high schools could prepare third-world students for their colleges, there would be little risk to accepting them to study for the B. A. and beyond. The Congolese scholar placed a number of Rwandan and Congolese young people in various independent boarding schools. Every one of these schools nurtured the international students through culture shock and adjustment to a new academic environment, taught them English and prepared them to flourish in college. All they need, to release their unlimited potential, is continued financial support.",

        "description":"The ability of students' social supports, such as friends from high school and family, to effectively lessen stress often wanes during students' transitions to postsecondary institutions. College, most often the best years of a student's life, at its first bloom (choosing a school) carries with it with high anxiety about changing location, routine and study habits; separation from friends; the learning environment; managing finances; and much more. On the positive side, college marks a period when new systems of social support are being created. Accurately predicting which students are likely to experience academic, personal, and social difficulties, or leave college before they graduate due to stress, would aid the creation and implementation of interventions targeted to specific cases. Studying student peer groups and the patterns within is the key to predicting which subgroups will be prone to what behaviors. The purpose of this study was to conduct a baseline investigation of African-American university students' health behaviors, self-rated health, mental health, and quality of life (QOL). The authors used a quality of life questionnaire that gauged the college student's health status, lifestyle, mental health, and living conditions, which would help identify certain subgroups of students at particular risk for certain types of depression, stress, health behaviors, mental health, and health habits while attending college. The results of this questionnaire provided an important snapshot of the current life styles, college life stresors, and health behaviors among male and female college students at an HBCU institution in North Carolina; and indicated that gender is an important determinant of the level of health risk behaviors for African-American students.

        "author":["Kretchmar, Jennifer"],
        "description":"Many colleges and universities receive thousands of applications for freshman admission every year. To facilitate the process of evaluating each and every applicant in a relatively short amount of time, schools often devise quantitative ratings scales to summarize student characteristics. The ratings give readers a shorthand way to communicate the qualities of each student, and sometimes play a critical role in determining whether or not a student is offered admission. Given the significance of the decision for both the student and the institution to which he or she is applying, admission officers should have a vested interest in the reliability of their ratings scales and should be asking if students would receive the same ratings if their applications were reviewed by different readers. Ironically, even as admission officers evaluate applicants according to strict standards, they sometimes fail to evaluate their own practices with similar precision. For an accurate rating, admission professionals must determine different sources of variations in scores. Generalizability theory allows for this consideration and, therefore, has several advantages over more traditional measures of reliability. The purpose of this research was to use generalizability theory to investigate the reliability of six ratings scores used when evaluating applicants for admission to a university's undergraduate program. Reliability estimates were generated for these scales for both relative and absolute decisions--for the purpose of rating an individual applicant relative to all other applicants, and for the purpose of making a decision to offer or decline admission.

By being familiar with these colleges, counselors can help their students of faith better facilitate a successful college search. Christian colleges are \"all together different.\" They hold many things in common with each other, while still maintaining individual distinctions and personalities. They share a number of traits with the rest of higher education as well, but have characteristics that obviously set them apart. They are not the right choice for every student or even, for that matter, most students. However, for those who seek or might benefit from a faith-based academic environment, from a highly personalized education, from a campus that affirms their evangelical religious traditions, Christian liberal arts or Bible colleges may be an ideal fit.",

Founded in 1993 by the late John Wallach, Seeds of Peace is a peace education program for young people from conflict regions. Teenagers from regions of conflict attend a three-week summer camp in Maine and have opportunities for follow-up participation at home. Participants are nominated by their schools, must be able to converse in English, and undergo a rigorous selection process held by their governments. While the media continually broadcast scenes of violence and despair from the Middle East, the author has been privy to another story--one in which Israeli and Palestinian youth constructively interact with one another. Today, over 120 Seeds of Peace alumni are enrolled in 50 U.S. universities. With support from the counseling community and admission counterparts, future Israeli and Palestinian leaders may emerge from this group of hopeful, bright students, and find a way to make peace between their peoples.",

        "description":"Over the last several years there have been numerous calls for reforming high school to college transitions. In 2000-2001, the American Youth Policy Forum (AYPF) and the National Commission on the High School Senior Year respectively called for a re-thinking of how students moved from secondary to postsecondary education. A widely-discussed initiative was dual or concurrent enrollment, or as referred to by the AYPF during its 200 roundtable discussion, &quot;secondary postsecondary learning option, (SPLO).&quot; Dual enrollment allows high school students to enroll in college courses. Participation in dual enrollment programs gives high school students first-hand exposure to college, while allowing them to gain both high school and college credit. Two university researchers collected data as participant observers, leading to a description of an innovative University High School early college experience designed for students in grades 10 through 12. The purpose of this study was to record participants' experiences in an early college innovation, and by systematically capturing an account of policies, structures, politics, and participant experiences, to inform the design and implementation of similar reforms. In addition, the study's aim was to ensure that students enrolled in this early college &quot;experiment&quot; at Florida Atlantic University's (FAU's) University High School would have a research-base on which to make modifications in subsequent years of implementation. It should be noted that this University High early college experience is not the same as dual enrollment. The difference is that in dual enrollment, the high school student belongs to a high school and takes college classes either on the high school campus or on a college/university campus. In this case study setting, the University High School is a virtual high school with a legal designation and authority to award high school credits and diplomas. In return for giving up traditional high school courses and extracurricular activities, the students in this experiment, with a signed parental release letter, were &quot;free&quot; within limits to explore any and all aspects of university life.",

        "description":"Red states, blue states. Maybe in politics there are differences, but when it comes to progressive transfer policies, the color-line division disappears. From the Northeast to the mid-Atlantic states to the Florida peninsula, across the Great Plains to the Southwest and on to California, state public higher education systems have made, and continue to make, great strides in recognizing the value of community college education. More importantly, they are taking leading roles in demonstrating how to promote access to higher education. One of the most compelling examples of this is seen in the development of transfer and articulation systems that facilitate the transition of community college students into public four-year institutions. Thanks to the Internet, the most exciting and effective way to see this system in action is through the array of Web-based resources dedicated to the transfer process. This article describes a survey of state-supported Web resources that answer common transfer questions.",

Tony, a traditional-aged student, reluctantly entered his local community college because he was unable to prove, scholastically, that he was capable of handling the coursework at his choice flagship institution in the state. After spending four semesters at the community college, he not only proved he was able to compete academically, he also developed his leadership abilities. Mary Ann, though much older, was hesitant to enter her community college, but did so because she saw that  the only way to get out of her current situation as a single-mother with growing responsibilities was to receive further education. Even though these particular students are separated by over two decades in age, their outcome was the same. Through these two highly-typical stories, the strengths of the community college transfer student can easily be extrapolated.

        "description":"The number of students with learning disabilities enrolling in colleges and universities is increasing each year. Affirming effectiveness of resources and programs meant to support students' integration into the campus community involves multilayered research, because the subjects must be self-advocating to get  the full advantages the resources and programs provide. To test the development of these students, the researchers looked at the programs through students' success in three design vectors--developing competence, managing emotions, and developing autonomy. Arthur Chickering (1969), a psychosocial theorist who studied  college student development at length and created these vectors, theorized that individual development involved the accomplishment of a series of developmental tasks and suggested that mastering these tasks was a process and specific conditions in the college environment influence that process. Because reading disabilities were reported to be the nature of the learning problem for the vast majority of the students with learning disabilities, students identified as having dyslexia or reading problems were selected for this study, which was conducted on  a private, selective, coeducational, four-year college campus in the Midwest. Researchers used qualitative design to make interpretations about the individual student experiences, feelings, attitudes and perceptions (Finn, 1998). Students represented all four of the academic units on campus: Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, and Engineering. The students indicated that they found it necessary to continue using academic services in their transition from high school, and in accessing and integrating into the postsecondary educational environment. All the students reported feeling challenged by college writing expectations as compared to high school. To integrate into the institution, students sought support for their  writing assignments by requesting extra time for tests, writing assistance and assistance from note-takers. As a group, the students were critical of the level of accommodations available in the college environment and reported feeling challenged to meet the academic expectations with such limited services.",

A common measure of accountability is student retention. What role do admission officers play in student retention? While the admission processes may be quite different between four-year institutions and community colleges, the purposes are similar. Insofar as they set the stage for what it takes to be successful in college, admission officers play a crucial role in the broader student life cycle that extends from prospect to alumnus.

After all, honors students at four-year colleges are thought to be the best of the best, while community college students are often considered \"diamonds in the rough.\" Many community college honors students have intellectual abilities that may not have been developed in their high schools, or they weren't encouraged to develop their abilities by their parents and friends, or they don't have high expectations of themselves. Whatever the case, these students are in need of more than just the standard courses taught at community colleges. These are students capable of excelling in standard liberal arts courses at community colleges, but may have not fully developed their abilities because they can earn high grades with little effort. If we are truly to educate this segment of the community college population, then we need to ask: Who are these students and what do they need? To be more specific: How can we take these students from where they are now and encourage them to become successful professionals?

Professionals consider the admission process successful when they are able to configure a class that meets the institution's many missions and notions, rather than just attracting a general group of students who want to learn. Therefore, admission actions and policies, to some extent, create a mismatch in supply and demand leading to an artificial shortage. This shortage leads to admission decisions becoming ethical paradoxes of equity and equality, as admission officers are ethically bound to strive for both. This article presents a case that illustrates an ethical dilemma in admission and serves as a springboard for discussion of ethical dilemmas. It also presents an overview of the multiple ethical paradigms, which consist of four lenses--(1) justice; (2) critique; (3) care; and (4) the profession--and discusses the use of ethical lenses in examining the dilemma.

        "description":"While students are the center of the college admission process, the individual student is transient within the process, involved for a short amount of time, trying to get a spot in the freshman class of a university. Counselors and admission officers are the stewards of the process, the keepers of the code and the architects of the maze. In this position, they have a unique perspective, the long view. The universities can engage the process on both levels of focus, the short view is finding the best freshman for their class next year, and the long view works to preserve the integrity of the application process. Part of their responsibility to the application process and their profession is to evaluate their context, to ask critical questions of the process and use this examination to continue to craft local and national policy. Attempting to digest this process in pieces, writers find themselves concentrating on the ethics involved in helping with the application essay. The way this ethic of help is constructed will shape the college application process of the future. This article explores the ethic of help in the philosophical context of John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, and Alan Watts. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Throughout the country and through the years, several colleges and universities have been the focal point of violence and tragedy. These tragedies include the brutal beating and murder of a gay student; a campus bonfire that killed 12 students and alumni; a residence hall fire that claimed the lives of three students; terrorist activities in two of America's urban centers; racial riots that effectively shut down a large city; and shootings of students and professors by college classmates. When news of crises such as these makes national headlines, prospective students and their parents may reconsider attending or even withdraw their applications from the institutions associated with the crises. Thus, universities and colleges must work hard to keep these students interested in their institutions, and assure parents and students that the institutions are safe. This article presents the results of research on the ways a campus and/or community crisis may influence the college-choice decision of prospective students and their parents, and offers recommendations to colleges. The study was conducted at three institutions that varied in size, location, and type (Interlaken University, Bern College, and Luzern University). The crises investigated involved a residence hall fire, a racially-based community crisis, and an on-campus student death. Participants in the study had two major recommendations to share with colleges based on their own experiences: communication and establishment of a crisis management plan. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Of these 1, only 7 percent will enroll in college and ultimately earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Some American-Indian students fail to complete their studies for financial reasons. Financial aid--whether in the form of grants, loans or student employment--is of critical importance for American Indians. There are a variety of ways that American-Indian students can finance their educations. Funding is available from the federal government, state governments, tribal governments, institutional scholarships, and private scholarships. Increasing college completion rates among American Indians necessitates that students identify all potential sources of funding and have access to enough aid to enable them to attend and complete college.

This mission can be undermined if management decisions are not informed by detailed enrollment data, especially on how the timing of student decisions affects their academic success. This paper explores enrollment flow at a large urban, community-based technical college to recommend and monitor enrollment decisions, while keeping the fiscal and student success implications for the institution in mind. Research findings were generated from analyses of program applications and registrations in the fall terms of the 2004-05 and 2005-06 academic years, giving special attention to when students applied and registered. Analyses highlight the issues involved in changing student behavior, while modifying institutional procedures affecting application processing. The creative challenge was to find the optimal balance among honoring the college mission; easing admission processing; providing retention efforts; and maximizing fiscal support.

The theoretical grounding for this application is the understanding that the suffering person has an underlying need for ontological security. It is suggested that this is made possible by a twofold connection: intra-subjective connection to self through integration of emotions, thoughts, and psycho-physical states; and inter-subjective connection to others.

This &quot;depth&quot; spirituality is based on a rediscovery of our native capacity for &quot;awe&quot;, and addresses the very fulcrum of our contemporary lives. It is a spirituality informed by the existential-theological tradition of Soren Kierkegaard, Paul Tillich, Ernest Becker, and Rollo May, which welds the zeal and exaltation for religion with the scrupulosity and skepticism of science. Drawing from my recent book &quot;Rediscovery of Awe: Splendor, Mystery, and the Fluid Center of Life&quot; (Schneider, 2004) as well as both film and literature, I explore the nature, power, and therapeutic implications of the spiritual capacity for awe.",

Male teachers with children can be situated closer to the cooperating pole of the interpersonal teacher behaviour typology. Male teachers without job security, and teachers without job security who have children, perceive themselves more as leaders with helpful/friendly behaviour in comparison with colleagues who do have job security. Further, years of experience have an impact on teacher wellbeing. Also, the wellbeing of teachers with a high score on the dominance-cooperating quadrant of the scale increases, whereas the wellbeing of teachers with a high score on the submission-opposing quadrant decreases.",

        "author":["Maloch, Beth"],
        "description":"This five month qualitative study explored, over time and across literacy events, the ways in which a second grade teacher, Ms. Wilson, and her students built a shared frame of reference, or shared mental context, for viewing reading. Data sources included: field notes, video and audiotaped records, artifacts, and teacher and student interviews. Analysis was informed by Mercer's (2000) notions of context and continuity and considered the ways in which students and teacher drew upon contextual resources, both the context immediately available to them within the classroom and in the surrounding discourse, as well as displaced contexts, those objects, words, and understandings occurring in the past (Mercer, 2000). Constant-comparative and discourse analysis yielded three themes related to the building and maintenance of an active stance towards reading--what the students and their teacher called \"WOW reading.\" First, the teacher encouraged students to draw on a variety of contextual resources, including personal experience, shared experiences, and the text environment to make sense of their reading. Second, Ms. Wilson talked explicitly about interpretive strategies and their connections to books, introducing a meta-level to their conversations. Third, students had multiple opportunities to engage in reading and thinking about reading. Theoretically, this study illuminates the building of and building on of shared contexts within lessons and the continuity that develops across classroom lessons. As well, it provides insights into the ways in which teachers may help students draw on a variety of contextual resources, in and out of school, that afford rich opportunities for learning.",

Quantitative analyses were undertaken to determine the types of interaction that occurred in the three learning environments and the incidence of interactions beneficial for learning, and some examples were provided to illustrate tins. The results showed most of the interactions in all three of the learning environments to be cognitive in nature. More regulative interactions occurred when a computer was involved. Interactions beneficial for learning occurred more often in the environments involving face-to-face interaction than in the learning environment involving computer mediated interaction.",

The major findings of teacher effectiveness research are outlined and the process that was followed in order to design questionnaire measuring student views of their teacher behavior in the classroom is presented. The main findings of research into teacher interpersonal behavior are also presented, and the process that was followed in order to translate, to Greek, the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) and examine its content validity is described. A stratified sample of 38 primary schools in Cyprus was selected and the two questionnaires were administered to all year-6 students (N=1973) from each class (N=92) of the school sample. Evidence supporting the reliability, discriminate validity, and construct validity of each questionnaire is provided. Data collected from most of the scales of each questionnaire were associated with student achievement gains in both cognitive (Mathematics and Greek Language) and affective outcomes of schooling. Implications of findings for the development of a teacher evaluation system based on the main findings of teacher effectiveness research and research into teacher interpersonal behavior are drawn.

The sample consisted of 2859 pupils from 72 pre-primary institutions/classrooms (selected through stratified random sampling to ensure adequate representation of private, public, urban and rural schools). The collection of data involved using two observational instruments (Classroom Interaction Sheet, CIS and Ten-Minute Interaction Instrument, TMI) to record interaction patterns in 72 lessons during the teaching of numeracy. Data analysis involved the use of frequency, percentages, chi-square and graphical illustrations. The result revealed that the major language of instruction was English language rather than the language of the pupils' immediate community; the use of instructional time and direction of interaction tend to be sensitive to language of instruction; teacher-initiated interactions and whole class activities are associated more with the use of English as language of instruction while learner-initiated interactions and individual/small group activities are associated more with use of language of the pupils' immediate community in instructional delivery; and the direction of communication was mainly from the teacher to the whole class.",

To investigate this relationship, student perception data have been gathered with 1021 secondary science students, located in 31 classes in Kashmir, India. Teacher interpersonal behaviour was conceptualised in terms of two behavioural dimensions, Influence (the degree of teacher control in communication with students) and Proximity (the degree of cooperativeness between teacher and students), and measured with the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI). Multilevel variance analyses were conducted on students' attitude scores, and the effect of the interpersonal variables was corrected for the effects of student, class, and teacher background variables, as well as for other elements in the learning environment. Results indicated that both teacher Influence and Proximity were positively associated with students' attitudes and that their effect remained statistically significant after correction for other covariates and learning environment variables.",

Teaching was studied in terms of a model originating from clinical psychology that was adapted to education. Teacher interpersonal behaviour was analysed in terms of two, independent behaviour dimensions called Influence and Proximity. This study investigated the added value of students' perceptions of teacher interpersonal behaviour (after correction for covariates such as gender, report card grade, class size, etc.) on students' subject-specific motivation. Data of 52 third-year English as a Foreign Language (EFL)-classes (1041 students), taught by 32 secondary teachers, were included in the analyses. The study used multilevel analysis of variance to investigate the effect of teaching on motivation and included several covariates as well. For all of the discerned subject-related attitude variables--pleasure, relevance, confidence, and effort--a positive and strong effect was found for teacher Proximity. In addition, for three of the outcome variables--pleasure, relevance and effort--Influence also had a positive effect. Overall, however, proximity seemed to be of greater importance than teacher influence. The results demonstrate the significant role of teacher interpersonal behaviour in student motivation and the importance of combining insights from various educational research disciplines.",

Why do some teachers talk too much when they are teaching, and what can a teacher education program do to address this problem? When informed, then transformed, by available research in the area, the question becomes more accurate and useful for teachers and teachers educators. How can a teacher education program enable teacher candidates to encourage greater student participation and interaction in their classrooms? This article attempts to answer these questions by reporting the results of both a comprehensive literature review and a case study of six teacher candidates in one course of a teacher certification program. The study compares what the candidates say and believe about students' participation and interaction to their own actual participation and interaction in a teacher education classroom, resulting in provocative and intriguing implications for teacher education programs.",

An intervention would lead to a sustained decrease in misbehavior and coercive discipline without using any external control systems. In this case study, a male, veteran Grade 8 teacher and his students were involved in a long-lasting conflict characterized by an increase of disruptive student conduct and the teacher's coercive behavior. Inspired by the explanatory model of the extended symmetrical escalation (Lapointe, 2003), the researchers developed an intervention using attribution retraining to resolve the problem. Data collected from observations, questionnaires, and interviews indicated that this non-coercive intervention contributed to long-term general improvement of teacher-student relations and behaviors. The results highlight the importance of perceptions within conflicting interactions and lead to recommendations for interventions that could be used to reduce group discipline problems.",

The course offered an alternative to the large lecture instruction typical in introductory university physics and promoted learning in an informal environment. The course organization attempted to engage students in investigations with only a small fraction of time devoted to lecture/discussion. Students collaborated in groups of three to conduct investigations with the use of computer tools and laboratory apparatus. The instructor and teaching assistants interacted directly with the students with the intent to ask probing questions to guide the students through conceptually meaningful problem solving. Researchers video taped students groups as they worked through investigations. Field notes and students' investigation reports provided additional information about student performance. The study reports detailed accounts of student interaction through discourse during the class investigations and comments on the nature of the student collaborations. The study showed that during collaborative problem solving, the students engaged in informal elaborative and reflective discourse that critically examined the data the students had collected during the investigations. The author comments on possible relationships of these interactions and cognitive processes to knowledge construction in an informal setting.",

        "title":"Evaluating Strategies Used to Incorporate Technology into Preservice Education: A Review of the Literature",
        "author":["Kay, Robin H."],
        "description":"The following paper is based on a review of 68 referred journal articles that focused on introducing technology to preservice teachers. Ten key strategies emerged from this review, including delivering a single technology course; offering mini-workshops; integrating technology in all courses; modeling how to use technology; using multimedia; collaboration among preservice teachers, mentor teachers and faculty; practicing technology in the field; focusing on education faculty; focusing on mentor teachers; and improving access to software, hardware, and/or support. These strategies were evaluated based on their effect on computer attitude, ability, and use. The following patterns emerged: First, most studies looked at programs that incorporated only one to three strategies. Second, when four or more strategies were used, the effect on preservice teacher's use of computers appeared to be more pervasive. Third, most research examined attitudes, ability, or use, but rarely all three. Fourth, and perhaps most important, the vast majority of studies had severe limitations in method: poor data collection instruments, vague sample and program descriptions, small samples, an absence of statistical analysis, or weak anecdotal descriptions of success. It is concluded that more rigorous and comprehensive research is needed to fully understand and evaluate the effects of key technology strategies in preservice teacher education. The following are appended: (1) Details of Studies Reviewed; and (2) Variables and Criteria Used to Code Studies. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

Students from either an in-class or online section (ns = 810 and 74 respectively) of introductory psychology had access to live recorded lectures via the VLH, made available through the course Web site. Approximately 45% of in-class and 78% of online students used the resource prior to each of two course midterms; 32% of in-class and 50% of online students completed a five-item survey assessing student perceptions of whether the VLH enhanced learning or increased grades, and whether they wanted the resource in other courses. Number of VLH accesses and total duration were calculated. Results showed that regardless of course section, greater VLH use was linked to higher midterm scores, and student perceptions of the VLH were highly favorable. Curiously, whereas in-class students' VLH use and duration were negatively related to expected grade, that same link was positive for online students. Directions for future research in resource development and implications for educators are discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Besides the face-to-face weekly lessons in existing Project Work classrooms, the students engaged in computer-supported online forum discussions. Two hundred and sixty students and 26 teachers from seven high schools participated in this study. Their perceptions of this new learning environment were assessed using a modified version of the Web-based Learning Environment Instrument (WEBLEI). In addition, the instrument was also validated. The WEBLEI exhibited satisfactory internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity. Comparing the actual and preferred perceptions of the students and teachers revealed that there were differences between the actual and preferred perceptions for both students and teachers. With these in mind, the implications for using technology to support the face-to-face teaching and learning in Project Work classrooms are discussed in this paper. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovations theory was used as the theoretical framework in the process of instrument development, data collection, and in the interpretation of the results. The faculty members in the study reported low levels of use and expertise in instructional computer technologies. Variables significantly correlated with faculty members' level of computer use were computer expertise, computer access, barriers to computer access, attitude toward computer use, support for computer use, and adopter categories based on innovativeness. The importance of administrative support and the need for faculty development were two major findings from this study. The results from the qualitative data provided information on addressing barriers to faculty computer use and confirmed the characteristics of Rogers' adopter categories. Findings interpreted through Rogers' theory suggest that an action plan should take advantage of faculty members' positive computer attitudes and collegial communication to help them move to the higher levels of use and expertise in instructional technologies. Methodology used in this study provides a model for other colleges of education worldwide to obtain information about the needs of their faculty members. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Results showed a deepening of knowledge and a differentiation of knowledge following experiences of exploration, evaluation, and comparison of different types of software. Results imply that directing preservice teachers' attention to utilizing the functional characteristics of software for developing plans and for the design of instruction may be fruitful for more effective integration of software in their future teaching. However, participants' preexisting content knowledge and their pedagogical worldview tempered this effect. (Contains 8 figures and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Growing perceptions that students exploit information technology to evade academic assignments prompted surveys of student attitudes about unethical uses of information technology (e.g., cutting and pasting excerpts from Web sites without attribution) at two institutions. Students at a private church-affiliated college rated cheating behaviors as more offensive than their counterparts at a regional campus of a major research university. However, ordinal rankings of academically dishonest behaviors at both institutions were surprisingly similar (rho = 0.90). Further, students who rated such behaviors as being more serious, typically valued idealism, the ethical principle of doing no harm to others, and disapproved of high sensation-seeking activities involving alcohol, drugs, and sex.

The study used multiple research tools, interviews, questionnaires and observations, focusing on both teachers' beliefs and classroom practices. The findings reveal that following multi-year experiences in technology-based classrooms, teachers' educational beliefs had changed quite substantively, demonstrating multiple views rather than pure beliefs. The study argues that teachers' beliefs form a mosaic of complementary visions, even conflicting ones. It also shows that it is easier to change classroom practices than educational beliefs.

Using the Concerns-Based Adoption Model of change, this study investigated the concerns of teachers in the early stages of a one-to-one laptop initiative. The results of the study indicate that teachers fall into two relatively well-defined categories in terms of their concerns regarding the innovation. The majority of teachers have genuine concerns about how the introduction of laptop computers into the school environment will impact them personally. A lesser number have concerns about how they will be able to best use the laptops to meet the needs of the students. Implications for professional development include differentiating training based on teacher concerns, ensuring teachers have a voice in the process and are well-informed of decisions pertaining to the adoption, and implementation of the innovation.

        "description":"This study examined the effects of question prompts, knowledge integration prompts, and problem solving prompts, embedded in a Web-based learning environment in scaffolding preservice teachers' conceptual understanding and problem solving in an ill-structured domain. A mixed-method study was employed to investigate the outcomes of students' conceptual knowledge and ill-structured problem solving. The quantitative results indicated that students who received knowledge integration prompts had significantly higher scores in overall problem solving performance, but the same was not true for prompts focused on conceptual knowledge. Further, the qualitative findings revealed the positive effects of knowledge integration prompts in facilitating students to make intentional efforts to identify and explain major concepts and their relationships that are necessary for solving the ill-structured problem. This study has implications for designing curricula in ill-defined domains that seek to integrate and promote the application of educational principles to real-world problems. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Data were collected from 15 secondary mathematics and science teachers and 450 secondary students. The results suggest that teachers' attitude towards technology uses in schools tends to be negative, while student attitudes can be summarized as enthusiastic. Most importantly, the fearfulness of being replaced by computers contributes to the \"oversold, underused\" phenomenon. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Comparison groups included course format (FTF vs. online), discussion format (chat vs. discussion board) and discussion format option (choice vs. no choice). Results reveal that students' choice of discussion format was influenced by the trait of academic introversion-extraversion but not by the instructional environment (FTF or online) in which they enrolled. In addition, providing the choice of discussion format to students enhanced course satisfaction and, while some differences were found in cognitive achievement, the results were weak.

There have been noticeable achievements in building competitive, first class universities in many developing nations, particularly in Asian countries. This paper will examine the process by which SNU can be transforming SNU into a world-class university in Korea. The analysis will focus on the internal reforms implemented at SNU over the last 10 years and the effectiveness of these policies. The main strategy undertaken to bring SNU up to the world-class level was to emphatically pursue excellence in research. Long before governmental funds were allocated for this purpose from 1999 onwards, SNU had already vigorously pursued excellence in research and teaching. The experiences of SNU in these endeavours represents an important case study that bears vital theoretical and practical implications for other Korean universities, as well as for universities in other middle-income countries.

Between June and July 2006, this study conducted a simple questionnaire and interview survey of 16 postgraduate students. The results suggest that music students are confident in their abilities to use multimedia technologies but that many do not believe that the introduction of multimedia technologies into the curriculum will improve the quality of their education. Whilst students' motivation to learn depends on their interest in the subject and their lecturer's approach, the incorporation of technology should always be relevant to each individual module. The results of this case study could help other universities respond to the changes brought about by electronic learning and other educational multimedia technology. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Monolinguals reported using compensation strategies most and affective strategies least. Bilinguals preferred to use metacognitive strategies most and memory strategies least. Despite a less favorable formal English education environment in the Korean-Chinese community and less experience in learning English, bilingual Korean-Chinese reported higher use of learning strategies, which is arguably indicative of the positive effects of the bilingual context in learning a new language.

Our findings show that although the students recognized that the program improved their competence in interacting with others, there are problematic organizational and instructional issues that have to be ironed out before students can profit fully from cooperative learning programs.",

        "description":"Research indicates that affective attitudes such as liking of a subject and confidence in one's ability within a subject predict academic performance. Generally, immigrant minority students have positive attitudes and often have low academic performance. This study examines the self-efficacy and liking of subjects of New Zealand students and analyses the relationship of those attitudes towards academic performance in mathematics, writing, and reading by self-reported ethnicity. Data were obtained from the norming samples from the Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning project in New Zealand. Of special interest are the relationships between attitude and performance for Pasifika and Tongan students in New Zealand. Tongan and Pasifika students had positive attitudes, but their mean scores were not significantly different to other ethnic groups except in writing for Tongan students. Tongan and Pasifika students did have lower academic performance than majority and Asian immigrant students in all three subjects. The correlation between liking and self-efficacy was fundamentally zero for Tongan and Pasifika students, while it was weakly positive for majority and Asian immigrant students. Together these results question the power of self-efficacy and liking attitudes to predict academic performance for immigrant students from agrarian or traditional societies. Further, the data suggest that &quot;school effects&quot; are most likely explanations for this relationship, rather than lack of attachment, opposition, or deficiency theories.

        "description":"The aim of this present study is to expand our general understanding of bullying behaviour and to advance our knowledge about bullying among pupils. As evidenced by historical documents, the phenomenon of bullying is not a new concept. The fact that some people are frequently and systematically harassed or attacked by others is described in literary works and it also has been found most realistically in schools. Overall, considerable examples of bullying incidents among young people in earlier times have been found out through this study. In earlier times, according to descriptions in old documents from the 18th to early 20th centuries, bullying was generally described as physical harassment that usually related to a death, strong isolation, or extortion in school children. However, in contrast to the forms of bullying in earlier times, and the first descriptions of bullying as one or a few physically strong boys directly and harshly treating weaker ones, bullying in modern contexts includes more psychological and verbal threatening as well. Moreover, the meaning and forms of bullying has been expanded and developed as including mean gestures and facial expression, gossiping, and spreading rumours.",

        "author":["Ngok, Kinglun"],
        "description":"Education policy has been undergoing great transformation in China since the initiation of economic reforms and the open-door policy in the late 1970s. These market-oriented reforms and the pursuit of rapid economic growth in a globalized economy have significantly impacted China's education policy and development. In line with the development of the market-oriented economy and its increasing integration with the global market, a more pragmatic perception of education has gradually taken shape in the post-Mao era, resulting in the decentralization and marketization of education in China. This article aims to examine the development of Chinese education policy in the context of decentralization and marketization since the start of the economic reforms. It will firstly make a brief contrast between the education policies before and after the economic reforms. Then, the decentralization and marketization in the field of education since the initiation of the economic reforms will be examined. What follows is an assessment of the impacts that marketization and decentralization had on education policy. This paper argues that the weakening role of the state in education provision and the disparity between rural and urban areas are key issues facing China's education policy following the economic reforms and the open-door policy. It concludes by suggesting that equal and balanced development in education in China entails bringing the state back into the education sector. (Contains 6 tables.)",

The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was utilized as a framework for assessing participants' intentions to participate in advocacy. Participants completed pre- and post-test surveys to assess intent to advocate. Multiple linear regression was executed to determine the extent to which participants' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control predicted their behavioral intentions to advocate. Only perceived behavioral control significantly predicted participants' behavioral intentions to advocate, p = 0.009. Dependent t-tests showed that mean post-tests scores were significantly lower than pre-test scores for attitudes toward advocacy (M=11.59, M=7.41), subjective norms (M=16.21, M=13.11), and behavioral intentions (M=18.55, M=13.50). There was no significant change for perceived behavioral control (M=37.65, M=36.35). Participants' knowledge of the advocacy process was associated with greater involvement in advocacy (M=5.10, M=6.15). Findings from this pilot study suggest that participants' perceptions regarding their capacity for advocacy influenced their intentions to engage in the process. Findings also indicate that the training workshop improved participants' knowledge of advocacy, but not their intent to advocate. (Contains 2 tables.)",

A variant presentation is one in which there is a mismatch between the letter and sound or sound and letter correspondences and a contiguous representation is one in which there is a consistent match between the letter and sound information. Three 10 hour interventions were designed to determine the effects of two variant and one contiguous presentation of grapho-phonological information on five measures of reading and four measures of spelling. The Contiguous intervention class significantly (p less than 0.05) outperformed both the Grapheme and Phoneme intervention classes in reading regular words, and spelling exception words and nonwords. This suggests that the presentation of contiguous grapho-phonological information contributes to reading and spelling outcomes more than variant presentations. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to describe the extent to which undergraduates engage in disciplined enquiry, as one means of operationalising critical thinking. Three hundred essays from second-year students were judged on the indicators of disciplinary concepts, elaborated written communication and analysis. Non parametric statistical tests revealed that disciplinary concepts were more in evidence than was analysis. This was manifest in written communications which were not, overall, elaborated into coherent essays. The results suggest that students need to appreciate that knowledge is an intentional, and perhaps, effortful construction of the human mind and that this involves the use of a knowledge-transforming strategy rather than the coping strategy of knowledge-telling. For this to happen, however, some current pedagogic practices may need to be revised. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The performance of a cohort of Greek-Australian high school students (N = 270) on a diagnostic Greek reading test was significantly below that of pupils in second to fourth grades in Greece. The mean item difficulty for Greek-Australian high school students was 0.35 compared with 0.51 for second grade, 0.69 for third grade and 0.80 for fourth grade pupils in Greece. The pattern of responding indicated that the Rasch model fitted the data. The effects of background factors were also examined. Students whose mother or father spoke Greek had statistically significant higher levels of ability than those who spoke Greek and English or English alone. It was also found that the length of the key words (correct responses) had a large effect on the difficulty of the questions; the longer the key word, the more difficult the question was. The implications of the results for assessment of reading in and the acquisition of an ethnic or second language are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

Separate exploratory factor analyses for the actual and preferred forms supported the 10 scale &quot;a priori&quot; structure of the instrument. The use of multitrait-multimethod modelling with the 10 scales as traits and the two forms of the instrument as methods supported the TROFLEI's construct validity.

The method involves the use of QSR software. Three levels of findings are outlined. The first level is the coding categories that emerged out of reading the report text. There are five broad categories of codes that capture: the structure of the reports, the ways in which examiners communicate, the subject matter of the thesis, the characteristics of examiners' evaluative comment and their comments on their role and the examination process. The second level of findings concerns the frequency of different categories of comment and the prevalence of comment on the analysis and interpretation of the candidate's results. The third extends beyond the individual categories to what we can learn about the utilization of the report. One key finding is that the examiners took on specific roles: mentor-colleague, supervisor-instructor and assessor-arbiter. It was also found that the examiner tends to &quot;enter the examination&quot; at a point beyond the proposal, that is they comment primarily on elements that they feel they can influence, and this influence was evident in the preponderance of the formative instruction provided.

The epistemological thesis of Habermas is utilized and its well-established connections with the world of formal learning re-stated. Against this conceptual framework, the examiner reports are appraised with a view to identifying the ways of knowing being employed by the examiners. Of direct relevance to the PhD study is that each of the three ways of knowing identified in the Habermasian thesis implies a different positioning of the examiner against the doctoral candidate. These three positions could be described as &quot;expert&quot;, &quot;partner&quot; and &quot;listener&quot;, with each of them implying both a different relationship with the candidate and a different appreciation of the work under examination. It is concluded that the relative dominance of one way of knowing, its allied positioning and typical textual form suggests that the doctoral examination report may constitute a virtual literary genre not necessarily conveying easily the worth of the work under examination.",

Examination process, outcome and discourse are discussed in relation to the study design and a number of research questions to be investigated. The sampling method and data collection are described. A particular focus of this paper is how the categories were developed, tested and refined for coding the texts of the examiner reports.

Eleven behavioural autonomy items were elected by the adolescents and used to evaluate the frequency of desire, achievement and disobeying parents in early (12-13 year-old) and late (18-19 year-old) adolescents. Statistical comparison of the two age groups of adolescents was performed for each gender. Regarding achievement of autonomy, both male and female adolescents showed significant differences between the younger and older adolescents. Progress in autonomy was achieved by male adolescents more as a result of disobeying parents than was the cased with female adolescents. Narcissism, separation from family, and cognitive aspects were found to be important elements in adolescent's perception of autonomy. Desire for autonomy was present since the start of puberty, achievement lagged behind desire, and the capacity to fight for autonomy was a key mediator for the achievement of personal autonomy in the transition to adulthood.

Principal Components Analysis with Varimax rotation produced a clear and logical four factor solution that resembled but did not duplicate the IRI. Further scrutiny reduced the scale to a more parsimonious 12 item, two factor scale representing the two components of empathy.

A self-report survey measuring achievement goals, academic self-regulation, academic self-efficacy and affective distress was completed. Analyses of variance, cluster analysis and post-hoc comparisons were used to examine group differences. Gender differences in motivational goal patterns were identified, particularly with respect to the performance-approach goal. The dual task/performance-approach goal orientation reflected overall the most productive pattern of achievement motivation, and this was superior to the single task-mastery goal cluster.

Unweighted Least Squares extraction with oblique rotation produced 3 correlated primary factors that were interpreted as matching factors C, L and O of the Sixteen Personality Factors questionnaire for adults. Of particular interest was the factor L pattern which has never been identified before with children. Since the items most highly loading on factor L conveyed a sense of being persecuted by other children, scores on this dimension may prove useful in screening for bullying. Higher order factor analysis confirmed the hypothesis of a general anxiety factor. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

The co-occurrence of problems at home and kindergarten was assessed using the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales- Revised (Merrell, 2002), for a sample of parents and teachers of a) 22 children whose parents responded to invitations to participate distributed through kindergartens (regular kindergarten sample); and b) 11 children who had been referred to services because of behaviour problems (clinic-referred sample). For the kindergarten sample, 9.2% exhibited problems of behaviour across settings, with 35.5% displaying them in only one setting. For the clinic-referred sample, 63.7% exhibited behaviour problems across settings, with 18.2% exhibiting them in one setting only. Responses to misbehaviour at home and kindergarten were assessed using the Competency and Behaviour Management survey in a sample of 142 participants (79 parents, 63 teachers). Results revealed significant differences in parents' and teachers' responses to misbehaviour.

Results showed that children's self-concepts moderated the test-retest reliability over extended intervals for younger and older children. Social self-categorizations moderated slightly the test-retest reliability for both age groups. For younger children only, personal self-categorization and self-reported talking about items moderated the reliability. In contrast, there were no moderators of test-retest reliability for shorter retest intervals.

Those few studies which have examined Vygotskian inner speech from a reading perspective tend to support the notion that inner speech is an important covert function that is crucial to the reading process and to reading acquisition in general. However, Vygotskian notions on inner speech, in particular, syntactic and semantic aspects of inner speech (e.g., predication, word sense and agglutination), have not been investigated in relation to the study of the decoding aspects of silent reading. In this paper, an argument is presented that Vygotskian inner speech acts in two main ways to process text during silent reading, as a mechanism which condenses chunks of text into compact meaning units and as a subvocal rehearsal mechanism which elicits meanings when reading cognition becomes problematic. In addition to this, a Vygotskian inner speech reading model is also described.",

Methods: Students completed a questionnaire which examined their level of participation in MVPA and sedentary behaviours along with a number of potential correlates. Hierarchical regression was used to explore the relationship between hypothesised factors and MVPA. Results: Approximately a third of students (31.9%) reported involvement in at least five sessions of MVPA in the previous week. The students reported an average of 2.8 hours per day watching television and 1.7 hours per day using the computer. In the final regression model, 33% of variance in MVPA was explained. Perceived barriers, peer support and family support were statistically significant predictors. Conclusions: This study confirmed a number of factors to be associated with participation in MVPA. No relationship was found between sedentary behaviour and MVPA. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with the pathways students take through their studies at university. A critique of current research demands a fresh approach to explaining student progression, in particular within Australian higher education. To date, theories of student progression commonly consider the fit of the person to the university environment within one rather homogeneous socio-cultural milieu. Socio-ecological approaches provide a new, more appropriate framework for investigating the progression of undergraduate students. Student pathways are conceptualised as a diverse series of choices within the discrete learning contexts of courses. In principle, student pathways and related behavioural outcomes are a function of student characteristics and the supports and constraints within each course. Understanding the differential impact of personal and social characteristics of students and their specific learning contexts contributes to an understanding of the choice behaviour of students as they negotiate common and distinct pathways through courses within the broader context of higher education. This paper presents an appropriate, useful and meaningful theoretical framework for understanding how students navigate the Australian higher education system. (Contains 1 note.)",

Teachers (N = 78) rated the program highly and reported improved knowledge and skills in managing disruptive student behaviour. Objective measures of teacher (n = 32) pre- and post-workshop data revealed significant changes in teachers' use of positive strategies for female students. Change in teachers' use of punishment was in the expected direction, with insufficient power to produce statistical significance. Juxtaposed to high teacher self-reported satisfaction are objective pre and post data for a small group of very difficult students who showed no change in disruptive behaviour.

Processing efficiency occurred differently for hi-trait and lo-trait types. Results supported the hypothesis that trait controllability exerts a moderating effect on the way task-relevant feedback is processed. A selective encoding of information was evident, involving processing limitations inherent to the working memory system.

Teachers' understandings of what learning is probably influence their teaching practices and student academic performance. Aims: To validate a short scale derived from Tait, Entwistle, &amp; McCune's (1998) ASSIST inventory and to determine and compare the strength of agreement New Zealand and Queensland primary and secondary teachers had for both conceptions. Samples: Two survey studies with three populations provided valid data: 235 NZ Primary teachers in 2001, and 784 Primary and 614 Secondary Queensland teachers in 2003. A survey of 81 NZ secondary teachers in 2000 did not have enough participants to generate stable estimates. Methods: Five items defining learning were administered using a six point, positively-packed agreement rating scale. Data were analysed with MMLE confirmatory factor analysis with oblimin rotation. Multiple models were compared and results from the best fitting model (CFI and TLI greater than 0.90; RMSEA less than 0.08) for all three samples are reported. Cohen's &quot;d&quot; effect size was used to determine significance of differences in conceptions mean scores. Results and Conclusions: Psychometric properties of the two scales were good. Conceptions of learning were structured as two inter-correlated factors related to transforming and reproducing conceptions of learning. All samples agreed more with the transforming than the reproducing conception of learning; however, there were small group differences in mean scores. The response scale and items generated sufficient variation to detect differences in teachers' attitudes towards transforming and reproducing conceptions of learning.

Variability in talents based on the sex of respondents was also analysed. Analysis of the data from self-report questionnaires provided by 241 adolescents showed nine clear and reliable factors. The highest rated factors were Physical and Sport Activity, Musical and Rhythmic, followed by Construction and Spatial Design. Weak sex effects showed that males rated themselves higher on Mathematical and Logical, and Construction and Spatial Design factors and females rated themselves higher on the factors of Self-awareness, and Nature and the Environment. The factor structure and high internal consistency of factors of this instrument indicate that linking Approaches to Learning and MIs is a promising approach for further research.

It is unclear whether this label is intended to be identical with the DSM-IV Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) diagnostic category, or if it is a separate diagnosis based on Randolph's Questionnaire and the premises underlying this instrument. The third option is that any allusion to \"attachment\" relates to a position which has evolved from Bowlby. All three variants of this diagnostic label allude to early parent-child interactions, and thus imply the need for remedial interventions at the parent-child level. There are limited options for such interventions at school. A more fruitful interpretation is that the inference of inadequate early childhood interactions designates an incomplete early psycho-social task (the development of Basic Trust) and this perspective leads towards credibly promising school-based interventions.

        "description":"This study examines the gender differences among Ghanaian adolescent students' beliefs about aggression and its association with their reported level of aggression. A total of 800 students selected from eight same-sex senior high schools participated in the study. It was hypothesized that male and female students will score high on the instrumental and expressive beliefs of aggression respectively. Instrumental belief will be positively related to reported level of aggression while expressive belief will relate negatively with reported level of aggression. The EXPAGG (Revised) Questionnaire and the Fuch's Questionnaire on levels of aggression were the instruments used. It was found that male students scored high on the instrumental belief scale and female students on the expressive belief scale. Instrumental beliefs about aggression correlated positively with reported levels of aggression while expressive beliefs about aggression correlated negatively with reported levels of aggression. The study adds to our understanding of the relationship between beliefs and levels of aggression by considering it in a non-western culture. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Executive functions (EF) are a group of interrelated complex mental abilities that are involved in planning and initiating goals and carrying them through despite interruptions. As these functions are typically higher-order and involved in integrating other, more basic, lower-order functions, they are difficult to assess directly, and executive dysfunction often goes unnoticed. This is a particular problem in children, as most tests of executive function are developed for adults and have not been properly standardized in children. The aim of this article is to introduce the methods typically used to assess EF in children, and discuss the challenges associated with assessment of EF in children and adults. Issues such as ecological validity, difficulty separating individual components of EF, problems with separating EF from other cognitive abilities, implications of the degree of complexity of assessment stimuli as well as task-dependent variables that may contribute to variability in performance will be discussed. These concerns will be discussed with implications for development of more standardized measures of EF assessment in children, as these abilities are important for maximizing potential for learning and academic achievement.",

All participants were given a battery of standardized tests and completed a questionnaire that addressed demographic information; reading, spelling and educational experiences; and learning and study strategies. Significantly more HRD than NRD participants reported using study strategies at both the secondary and post-secondary level. No significant differences were found in reported use of learning strategies at the secondary level, but significantly more HRD participants reported participating in classroom discussions and using organizational strategies at the post-secondary level. The findings suggest that university students with a history of reading difficulties use study strategies and, at the post-secondary level, some learning strategies to a greater degree than students without such difficulties. We suggest that this is likely a means of compensating for their remaining reading problems. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Conclusions based on this review suggest that MST can be a very powerful alternative to the usual legal and social service approaches (e.g. justice system, day treatment programs) used in the treatment of adolescent CP. Assessment of the overall quality of this body of research identified strengths in the provision of MST across various treatment locations, the various dependent measures used in the research, and the long-term follow-up periods. Limitations included the lack of specificity in the descriptions of treatment and comparison groups, the direct links between the majority of researchers and MST model developers, the lack of quality assurance measures, and the over-interpretation of findings from correlational studies. MST continues to expand nationally and internationally with relatively little empirical substantiation on the world stage. This review calls for further empirical scrutiny of MST efficacy with consideration of the outlined limitations.",

        "description":"Recognition of poverty and neglect is very important in formulating a practical diagnosis of children's and adolescent's learning disorders. Early brain development forms the basis of learning, behavior and health over the entire life span. Through accumulated stressors and lack of supports, early poverty undermines competent parenting which then impairs learning and is the most common cause of mild mental retardation (MMR). Parenting interventions left until school entry do not prevent the insidious decline in IQ over the developmental period. Most types of learning disorders (e.g., ADHD, LD, FAS/FAE) are either aggravated or actually caused in the presence of chronic early poverty. Lack of functional accessibility to family, extra-familial and community resources for the poor impairs their adjustment to their children's learning disorders. Stresses due to poverty and cultural marginalization also exacerbate FAS/FAE. Poverty and despair eclipse diagnostic debates in producing hyperactivity, memory impairment, and social maladjustment. The need for early identification of at-risk infants and the provision of nurturing stimulation, cognitive training and parental support cannot be over-emphasized.",

          "Salomon-Fernandez, Yves"],
        "description":"Since passage of the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in 2002, state departments of education across the U.S. have been busy creating or modifying school accountability systems to meet NCLB guidelines. Ultimately, NCLB seeks to have all public school students proficient in English/Language Arts and mathematics by 2014. To identify schools in danger of not meeting this goal, states must establish student performance benchmarks and identify schools not making &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; (AYP). Those consistently failing to make AYP can be ordered into &quot;radical restructuring,&quot; which may include having the state intervene in running the school (U. S. Department of Education, 2002). Given these NCLB provisions and the growing number of schools not meeting AYP, the number of state interventions in low-performing schools will certainly increase. Accordingly, this article explores two questions about state-led interventions. First, how have teachers and administrators in underperforming schools in Massachusetts perceived state intervention? In addition, based on their perceptions, what might be done to make the process more effective? At three schools that experienced interventions from the Massachusetts Department of Education, a qualitative study explored the process of state intervention. A survey to principals in 22 of the 23 schools deemed underperforming by the state between 2000 and 2004 supplemented the in-depth qualitative work. Drawing on these mixed methods data sources, this article offers a series of proposals aimed at informing future state interventions in Massachusetts and elsewhere.

These voices were found to be instrumental for a contextual understanding of the tendency of Japanese students toward passivity and groupism, which is partly attributed to the interplay between students and the outside world.

It is yet one more element that teachers need to deal with in their professional contexts. This article focuses on the perspectives of ESL secondary teachers as they experience curriculum innovations introduced into the educational system via provincial exams. Survey results from 153 teachers are reported. The survey is part of a larger washback study that also triangulated classroom observations and teachers' and students' perception data in a longitudinal study. The survey results suggest that teachers would like to do their part in moving the system into a position where curriculum, their teaching and assessment, and the system's high-stakes exam correspond. They achieve this, however, according to their beliefs and professional stances, which may not present a unified performance across teachers.",

I have analyzed the process of curriculum making of the LINC 4 &amp; 5 Curriculum Guidelines (TCDSB, 1999) through three stages: from production, through reception, to implementation. The production stage is investigated by contrasting commentaries from two members of the Advisory or Specialist Committees who helped to prepare the document. The reception stage is investigated through interviews with five present or former LINC teachers, who discuss how they used or are using the Guidelines apart of their curriculum-in-use. Although this LINC document can be characterized as representing a &quot;Liberal democratic&quot; approach to citizenship and a transactional approach to citizenship education in a multicultural framework, a minority position supporting a more critical and transformational approach to citizenship education is also evident.",

I was often asked by teachers, &quot;Why don't they show up at school?&quot; The absence of ESL parents from school is often misinterpreted as parents' lack of concern about their children's education. However, many ESL parents indicated that they care passionately. Instead of assuming that ESL parents do not care, educators need to understand the barriers that hinder some parents from participating in their children's education. This article explores the barriers affecting ESL parent-teacher communication based on relevant literature and the author's reflections. It goes on to identify parents' and teachers' varying perspectives on ESL learning, followed by an indication of successful strategies to improve ESL parents' participation. The article concludes that schools and teachers must take the initiative if the resource of ESL parent participation is to be fully utilized.",

It explores the factors that promote or hinder multilingualism, with special attention to the following questions: What are the beliefs and attitudes of students enrolled in various postsecondary institutions across France toward learning a foreign language? How do these beliefs and attitudes change as students progress from beginning first-year students to upper years? The results suggest that the reasons first-year students typically have for studying a foreign language have more to do with internal factors (e.g., personal attitude) that with external factors (e.g., social value). Moreover, this trend becomes more pronounced with upper-year students whose motivation to learn a foreign language compared with that of first-year students is influenced less by perceived societal beliefs and more by intrinsic reasons.",

        "description":"In this paper, we propose a conceptual and operational framework for process reengineering (PR) in higher education (HE) institutions. Using a case study aimed at streamlining exam scheduling and distribution in a distance learning (DL) unit, we outline a sequential and non-linear four-step framework designed to reengineer processes. The first two steps of this framework--initiating and analyzing--are used to initiate, document, and flowchart the process targeted for reengineering, and the last two steps--reengineering/ implementing and evaluating--are intended to prototype, implement, and evaluate the reengineered process. Our early involvement of all stakeholders, and our in-depth analysis and documentation of the existing process, allowed us to avoid the traditional pitfalls associated with business process reengineering (BPR). Consequently, the outcome of our case study indicates a streamlined and efficient process with a higher faculty satisfaction at substantial cost reduction. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper first presents the development of distance education in Icelandic universities. Its second aim is to present a detailed analysis of the distance education practice at the University of Akureyri (UNAK), Iceland. Finally, the paper aims at analysing academic achievement, as well as attitudes towards courses, among campus and distance students in business administration at UNAK. The research is based on secondary data from the university's information system and official statistics. The findings reveal that distance education has increased significantly in Iceland in recent years. UNAK has had a leading role in developing distance education at university level in Iceland. Nearly half the students at UNAK are enrolled in distance education. Females take longer to finish their study than males, but they receive higher grades than males. Distance students take up to a year longer to finish their BSc programme than campus students. The study also has shown that distance students tend to receive lower grades in business administration at UNAK, and they are older, on average, than local students. Finally, both groups of students seem to express similar attitudes towards taught courses within the faculty. More research is needed in order to fully understand the factors behind the different achievements of distance and campus students. (Contains 7 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Siemens and Downes initially received increasing attention in the blogosphere in 2005 when they discussed their ideas concerning distributed knowledge. An extended discourse has ensued in and around the status of \"connectivism\" as a learning theory for the digital age. This has led to a number of questions in relation to existing learning theories. Do they still meet the needs of today's learners, and anticipate the needs of learners of the future? Would a new theory that encompasses new developments in digital technology be more appropriate, and would it be suitable for other aspects of learning, including in the traditional class room, in distance education and e-learning? This paper will highlight current theories of learning and critically analyse connectivism within the context of its predecessors, to establish if it has anything new to offer as a learning theory or as an approach to teaching for the 21st Century.

        "description":"Current comparative research literature, although abundant in scope, is inconclusive in its findings, as to the quality and effectiveness of distance education versus face-to-face methods of delivery. Educational research produces contradictory results due to differences among studies in treatments, settings, measurement instruments, and research methods. The purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of a meta-analytic approach by researchers, in which they synthesize the singular results of these comparative studies, by introducing the reader to the concept, procedures, and issues underlying this method. This meta-analytic approach may be the best method appropriate for our ever-expanding and globalizing educational systems--in general, crossing over geographical boundaries with their multiple languages, and educational systems in particular. Furthermore, researchers are called to contribute to a common database of distance learning factors and variables, from which future researchers can share, glean, and extract data for their respective studies.

Despite the fact that a transactional approach seems to be consciously or unconsciously adopted by theorists and practitioners alike, the reluctance to recognise it as a global theory has plunged distance education into a theoretical impasse from whence there has not been much development. It is argued that the TDT can have applications along all the supply chain of the distance education enterprise: it can explicate and ensure the sustainability of quality distance education in a technology-driven world, and; encapsulate the national concerns for policy development. TDT is seen as a useful instrument that should effectively inform institutional as well as national development. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)",

Authors of the blogs participated in a focus group discussion about the purposes for blogging. Findings revealed that the primary use of blogging was for social purposes. Self-disclosure was the most notable purpose for blogging, in addition to sharing emotional responses to learning. The lack of teaching presence may have influenced students' use of blogging for social rather than instructional purposes. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Japanese distance education has been slow to utilize the Internet, and mainly depends on   the mail system and, to a lesser extent, television broadcasting as its mode of delivery.   Since 2001, however, regulations have been relaxed to allow students to complete all   course requirements for a university degree via online distance learning. This paper reports   the results of a questionnaire study administered to the students (N = 424) enrolled in one   of Japan's few online distance universities. Satisfaction with learning was explored by   examining students' opinions and learning preferences in regard to five aspects of distance   learning identified as important: (1) learner-teacher interaction, (2) learner-content   interaction, (3) learner-learner interaction, (4)  learner-interface interaction, and (5) student   autonomy. In addition, the analysis included students' responses to three open-ended   questions. Results indicate that students were  generally satisfied with their learning, and   that, specifically, learning satisfaction was higher for students who: (1) could persevere in   the face of distance learning challenges, (2) found computers easy to use, (3) found it easy   to interact with instructors, and (4) did not  prefer social interaction with others when   learning.

The overall concern of the paper is to explore the ways in which personal reflection and learning is enhanced through dialogue. The paper explores the ways learners engage in dialogue in two environments that use different aspects of digital technologies to support the development of portfolios. The findings from the case studies point to the ways in which different technologies facilitated personal reflection mediated through sharing and dialogue. We develop the idea of affordances as a relationship whereby the learner is involved in a purposeful engagement with the possibilities created by their environment. The affordance of digitised technologies in supporting dialogue is, therefore, conceptualised in relation to the characteristics of the learner, not as a simple technology relation.

        "description":"Recent experience shows that reusable learning objects, like the computer assisted learning programmes of the early 1990s, have so far failed to achieve expected levels of integration into educational practice. This is despite technical interoperability, cataloguing systems, high quality standards, targeted dissemination and professional development initiatives. Analysis of this problem suggests that conceptualization of the problem may be limiting the scope of solutions. This paper proposes a sustainable and participative approach to reuse that involves repurposing learning objects for different discipline areas. For some time now there has been a growing awareness that even the most accessible resources have failed to be widely adopted by the educational community and as a result have also failed to fulfil their considerable educational potential.

Important infrastructure initiatives have also been launched recently with a view to enabling the sustainable implementation of these educational programmes, through strengthening organizational capacity as well as through building open, standards-based technology. Each of these initiatives point to a rich palette of transformational possibilities for education; together with the growing open source movement, they offer glimpses of a sustainable ecology of substantial and quality educational resources. This discussion piece will highlight some of the educational opportunity presented by MIT's current information technology-enabled educational agenda and related initiatives, along with their strategic underpinnings and implications. It will address various dimensions of their impact on the form and function of education. It will examine how these ambitious programmes achieve a vision characterized by an abundance of sustainable, transformative educational opportunities, not merely pervasive technology.",

        "author":["Tall, David"],
        "description":"This paper focuses on the changes in thinking involved in the transition from school mathematics to formal proof in pure mathematics at university. School mathematics is seen as a combination of visual representations, including geometry and graphs, together with symbolic calculations and manipulations. Pure mathematics in university shifts towards a formal framework of axiomatic systems and mathematical proof. In this paper, the transition in thinking is formulated within a framework of \"three worlds of mathematics\"--the \"conceptual-embodied\" world based on perception, action and thought experiment, the \"proceptual-symbolic\" world of calculation and algebraic manipulation compressing processes such as counting into concepts such as number, and the \"axiomatic-formal\" world of set-theoretic concept definitions and mathematical proof. Each \"world\" has its own sequence of development and its own forms of proof that may be blended together to give a rich variety of ways of thinking mathematically. This reveals mathematical thinking as a blend of differing knowledge structures; for instance, the real numbers blend together the embodied number line, symbolic decimal arithmetic and the formal theory of a complete ordered field. Theoretical constructs are introduced to describe how genetic structures set before birth enable the development of mathematical thinking, and how experiences that the individual has met before affect their personal growth. These constructs are used to consider how students negotiate the transition from school to university mathematics as embodiment and symbolism are blended with formalism. At a higher level, structure theorems proved in axiomatic theories link back to more sophisticated forms of embodiment and symbolism, revealing the intimate relationship between the three worlds.

The suggestion we present in this paper--to view and understand the high school to university transition in mathematics as a modern-day rite of passage--is an attempt at defining such framework. Although dominantly reflecting North-American reality, we believe that the model could be found useful in other countries as well. Let us emphasize that our model is not new in the sense that it recognizes the transition as such. In this paper, we try to determine whether (and, if so, how) the notion of a rite of passage--which is a well-understood concept in anthropology, as well as in some other disciplines (e. g. culture shock in cultural studies)--can help us understand mathematics transition issues better. Can it help us systematize existing body of research, and enhance our understanding of transition in mathematics; does it point at something new? We believe so, and by elaborating some traditional aspects of rites of passage, we hope to provide a useful lens through which we can examine the process of transition in mathematics, and make suggestions for improved management of some transitional issues.

        "description":"Following the political changes of 1994 in South Africa, the decision was taken to replace the traditional skills-based education system at primary and secondary school level (Grades 1-12) with an outcomes-based education system (OBE) . The implementation of the OBE system did not come without problems, giving rise to revised initiatives. The OBE approach, referred to as Curriculum 2005, was introduced into schools in 1998, for all learners in Grades 1-6 and progressively phased in after that. In 2002, the OBE system was put on hold for the two upper grades of these learners. Learners in these two grades reverted back to skills-based learning for their last three years of schooling, i. e. in Grades 10 - 12. The most senior of these learners that had been subjected to four years of OBE and another three years of the old system finished their schooling in 2005 and 2006 and entered university in 2006 and 2007. These groups are of interest. Students ahead of them had their full schooling in the old system and students two years younger were only subjected to OBE. These students are the &quot;group in the middle&quot;. This paper reports on what the impact is of the growing pains of such a new, inadequately planned education system on the mathematics preparedness of students entering university. This report will be extended in 2009 when the learners that have been fully subjected to the OBE system enter university. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"It has been recognised that many student perspectives on equations and their use of the equals sign have not mirrored those that mathematicians would like to see in tertiary students. This paper tracks transition of understanding of the equals sign by comparing secondary school students' thinking with that of first year university students. We analyse the understanding displayed in terms of properties of the constituent parts of equations, identifying a number of incomplete or pseudo-conceptions that are sometimes influenced by representational aspects of the properties, and other times by apparent over-generalisation of a property. A start is made on constructing a framework for understanding of the mathematical equation object that could assist in the transition from school to tertiary mathematics study.

In this paper two levels of algebraic structure sense are defined: for high school algebra and for university algebra. We suggest that high school algebra structure sense components are sub-components of some university algebra structure sense components, and that several components of university algebra structure sense are analogies of high school algebra structure sense components. We present a theoretical argument for these hypotheses, with some examples. We recommend emphasizing structure sense in high school algebra in the hope of easing students' paths in university algebra. (Contains 2 footnotes and 1 table.)",

However, the much-needed change in tertiary pre-calculus programmes--aimed at bridging the gap between high-school mathematics and tertiary mathematics--is happening at a far slower pace. Following a discussion on the nature of the gap and the objectives of a potential bridging programme, this paper aims at demonstrating that the gap can be bridged, by presenting an ongoing modular bridging programme especially designed for the diverse types of student populations in teachers training colleges. We also present here some innovative teaching and assessment methods that were judged essential for the success of these programmes--focusing mainly on the &quot;Questionnaire Based Instruction Method&quot;. Finally we suggest directions of follow up and research.",

Mathematics is taught differently depending on the discipline and the perceived background of the student. There is engineering mathematics for the students heading towards engineering degrees, life science mathematics for those heading towards biology degrees and so on. This paper considers the phases of transitions that students experience as they embark on a course of study and then go on to professional life. We make inferences about the ways the curriculum should be designed to alleviate the difficulties of these phases as well as to take account of the capabilities that graduates will require in the workplace. It is not only where students are coming from that affects their learning but where they are heading to, in combination with their perceptions of that destination. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Digital libraries play a crucial role in distance learning. Nowadays, they are one of the  fundamental information sources for the students enrolled in this learning system. These  libraries contain huge amount of instructional data (text, audio and video) offered by the  distance learning program. Organization of the digital libraries is therefore very important  for easy and fast access to the desired information. Improper categorization of data may  mislead the students searching the library. Since manual categorization of huge amount  of data might be challenging, an automatic and reliable method is needed. In this sense,  this paper proposes an automated categorization scheme for digital libraries in distance  learning. The categorization scheme is designed and developed by a pattern recognition  approach. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated on widely used Reuters  database. The results of the experimental study verify that the proposed scheme is a good  candidate for categorization of digital libraries in distance learning programs. (Contains 6 tables and 2 figures.)",

Seventy-eight freshman  students from the Divisions of Biology Education and Chemistry Education participated in  the quantitative study which included a pre-test/post-test control group design. The  experimental group consisted of students from the Division of Biology Education while  the control group consisted of students from the Division of Chemistry Education.  Experiment and control groups were randomly selected. The subject of geometric optic covered in Physics II Course was provided through a simulation program called Pearls 3.0 to the experiment group, whereas the control group had the same instruction through face-to-face teaching methods. An achievement test addressing the contents of the geometric optic subject was prepared, which had an internal consistency coefficient of .73. Data obtained through the achievement test were analyzed through conducting t-tests with SPSS 11.0 for Windows. Findings revealed that the experimental group which had the instruction through the  computer simulation was more successful than the control group who had face-to-face  instruction.

The dropout rate of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle were 51%, 41% and 67% respectively. The drop out rate is  very high and increasing day by day. The reasons of high dropout rate might be due to  language difficulty, lack of proper recommendation in high competitive job  opportunities, lack of service incentives, financial support, scholarship/fellowship and  recognition as cadre service by the Government.

This is fuelled by the emergence of worldwide information and  computer communications technologies. However, online education is not being  adopted in science and engineering subjects as widely as in other fields because of the  idiosyncrasies of some science and engineering-based courses. For online engineering education to be broadly accepted and utilized, the quality of online courses must, amongst other things, be comparable to or better than those of traditional face-to-face classroom education. This paper explores and reports on the importance of creating multimedia-rich course content and the important role that animations can play in creating a successful online learning experience. Results of our study on an online data structures course over five years offerings show that students consistently perform much better in questions requiring application of material taught in carefully animated algorithms. These results should carry over to other educational environments. (Contains 1 table.)",

Totality of features includes stated as well as implied needs and expectations of all types of customers. No quality improvement is possible without its unambiguous measurement. But, &quot;Total Quality&quot; of the learning experience in &quot;Open and Distance Education System&quot; cannot be measured unless it is expressed in measurable clear terms which include complete spectrum of student support and educational services. A model for &quot;Total Quality&quot; of an open and distance education system was used to measure impact of the &quot;Web Technology&quot; on the &quot;Total Quality&quot; of the learning experience in &quot;Open and Distance Education System&quot;. Evidence indicates that application of the proposed model for &quot;Total Quality&quot; and &quot;Web Technology&quot; can simultaneously optimize quality, access and cost. Thus, a better learning experience can be provided even in open and distance education system, which can be comparable with the best.

The application was developed based on the concept of \"right once run on any browser\" for different range of devices including WAP Phones, Laptop/Personal Computer(PC), Pocket PC and Personal Digital Assistants(PDAs), on a three tier architecture--the client tier, web server tier and database tier. As supported in traditional classroom, some requirements for e-Learning were acquired and corresponding application modules to service each requirement were identified. A prototype application was developed for one of the modules--File Transfer module using Microsoft Visual Studio.Net platform. The architecture will serve as a reference for the research communities and software developers in the area of multi-channel support for e-Learning web application. The e-Learning application when fully implemented will provide a basic platform for learning and enable students in remote locations have access to costly and scarce scientific equipment for carrying out experiments in the laboratory.

        "description":"Nowadays, educational systems are being questioned to find effective solutions to problems that are being encountered, and discussions are centered on the ways of restructuring systems so as to overcome difficulties. As the consequences of the traditional teaching approach, we can indicate that the taught material is not long-lasting but easily forgotten, that students do not sufficiently acquire the knowledge and skills that are aimed at developing, and that students lack transferring their knowledge to real life. In our current situation, individuals prefer to use educational resources where and when they want, based on their individual skills and abilities. Throughout the world, because the internet infrastructure has developed quite rapidly, it has been offered as an alternative way for a rich learning and teaching environment. This study aims at determining teacher candidates' preferences regarding internet-based learning environments in student-centered education by involving the teacher candidates enrolled at Osmangazi University, Faculty of Education, Primary School Teaching, Mathematics Teaching and Computer and Educational Technologies Education programmes. This study is a descriptive study. The data collection scale consists of the &quot;Constructivist Internet-based Education of Science Scale (CILES-S)&quot;. The sample group of teacher candidates in the study showed differences with respect to their preferences regarding internet-based learning in student-centered education. The candidates scored higher in the internet-based learning environments of Cognitive Development and Critical Judgement. The lowest average scores of the sample group were observed in the internet-based learning environment of Episthemologic awareness. (Contains 11 tables.)",

        "description":"Teaching literacy skills is inextricably meshed with the work of transformation. When students learn to read and write, they are learning the knowledge and skills needed in order to better understand their world and ultimately to participate in the remaking of their realities. Leadership for social justice is a democratic, empowering relationship involving human beings who are bound together by common and distinct purposes. These principles of social justice are not only inherent in teaching literacy. Most subjects carry weighty moral concerns and overt political/power relations; therefore, the topic of social justice should not be something that is sequestered to literacy classes. Specifically, the authors argue that pedagogical content knowledge--a marker of professional teaching competence--must eventually engage students in the moral and ethical issues surrounding the use of knowledge in democracy. Any conception of literacy teachers' work must account for subject matter taught in schools; and, as a corollary, teachers are positioned to help K-12 students understand \"knowledge relations\" that reify race, class, and gender inequities still prevalent in the democracy. As a way to demonstrate how this can be achieved, the authors begin this article with a brief review of the literature that recognizes teachers as educational leaders. They use the case of literacy instruction to illustrate transformative pedagogical principles and practices that serve other university faculty in PK-12 educational leadership programs.

Literacy development begins well before children enter school and can accelerate in an early childhood classroom setting. Teacher educators often hear about the importance of literacy development. In particular, the significance of phonological awareness to emergent readers and writers is emphasized. Teachers must be adequately prepared to teach important phonological awareness skills and must have a basic understanding of language structure. This study explores the extent to which early childhood educators are knowledgeable in regard to these components of early literacy. If teachers are knowledgeable in phonological awareness and language structure, then they have the potential to positively impact students' early literacy development.

However, little evidence exists about whether teachers use identified, research-based strategies when teaching. In view of the critical nature of literacy achievement for diverse populations and demographics, research on this topic is critical. The study reported was conducted with graduate students in San Diego State University's (SDSU) advanced reading specialist credential program, where they are taught reading comprehension strategies as well as observed and evaluated as they teach these strategies during clinical work with students. As Graduate Reading Program Coordinator, the researcher along with her colleagues, was interested in determining the impact program instruction and experiences had on the pedagogical practices of the graduates. In this study, the researcher examined some particular and critically important outcomes of the Graduate Reading Program, not as an evaluation of the program's effectiveness, but as a beginning look at how teachers may be educated to teach reading comprehension instruction more effectively. The Rand Report on Reading Comprehension identified a number of research priorities for reading comprehension. In essence, a substantial research knowledge base exists but it is &quot;sketchy, unfocused, and inadequate&quot; as a basis for educational reform. (Contains 1 figure.)",

What happens when two instructors from two different institutions are at the helm of a single graduate-level university course? The duality of these situations is recognized in the notion of what the authors termed \"instructional synergy\", drawing upon synergy as both \"the interaction of two or more agents or forces so that their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects\" and as \"cooperative interaction among groups, especially among the acquired subsidiaries or merged parts of a corporation, that creates an enhanced combined effect\". This article, which describes one model of a district/university partnership offering an induction program to new teachers while striving for instructional synergy, will consider how the two \"identities\" of the teacher as a student, the two \"instructors\", as well as the two \"institutions\", could bring to bear the combined efforts of a school district and university in order to ease a new teacher's transition into the classroom and help provide these teachers with a solid platform from which to launch successful careers as educators.

        "description":"California public schools serve a highly diverse student population, including: 65% minorities, 24.9% English Language Learners, 10.6% disabled, and 19% in poverty. In the face of this diversity, all teachers are expected to use the Curriculum Frameworks of the California State Board of Education as a &quot;blueprint for implementing the content standards adopted by the California State Board of Education and are developed by the Curriculum Development and Supplemental Materials Commission.&quot; The Curriculum Standards for California Public Schools and &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (NCLB) appear to have a goal of equal access to education for all students. &quot;Education: The Promise of America&quot; states that the goal of the NCLB legislation is to ensure that &quot;all children are proficient in reading and math by the 2013-2014 school year&quot; and to &quot;to close the achievement gap that exists between students of different socio-economic backgrounds.&quot; A 2004 American Association of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences Teacher Opinion Poll illustrates the disparity in teachers' beliefs regarding NCLB. Sixty-two percent of responding teachers say that they do not think NCLB has enhanced or will enhance the education of American children, and 37 percent respond positively regarding NCLB. In regards to district, state, and federal mandates, it appears that teachers may make the final decision as to how they interpret and implement curricular standards, including NCLB, into their practice. The initial objective of this study was to determine what factors govern elementary school teachers' informal collaboration (i.e., voluntary conversations) regarding technology use (computers, software and the Internet). The scope of the study, however, quickly extended beyond technology and informal collaboration, into teachers' practical theories. It became readily apparent that teachers' beliefs concerning implementation of mandated curriculum, and their academic expectations for students, seem to strongly influence with whom, and under what circumstances they may informally collaborate.

At the same time, there has been an ever increasing population of students who have not been prepared adequately through their high school education to meet the rigors of college/university-level content. The present study investigated the effects of a web-based technology centric course, Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS, 2001), on the remediation of college freshmen enrolled in an intermediate algebra class. Mathematics anxiety and attitudes toward mathematics were investigated to determine if ALEKS lowered mathematics anxiety, as well as improved attitudes. The findings of this research found that ALEKS Intermediate Algebra students performed as well as the control group taught by lecture.

Often though, we do not spend enough time helping our candidates discover what their own theory base is and thus that theory to practice (praxis) connection gets broken. One of the ongoing assignments for our graduate program in reading requires students to write and then revisit and rewrite their literacy philosophy. The majority of our students are classroom teachers at the PreK through 12th grade level. Most teach a variety of subjects requiring a lot of reading and writing. However, a growing number of students working with developing readers at the college level are entering our program. As they do, they bring with them different challenges--challenges for them and for us as we work to make the curriculum relevant to the differing literacy instructional needs of our candidates. The following literacy philosophy exemplifies the journey we must all take as we move from seeing ourselves as teachers to teacher-learners, and reveal the necessary reflection required to truly allow our theory to inform our practice.",

        "description":"The life history method, which achieved a prominent position in the Chicago tradition of sociological research in the early 1920s, has been widely adopted for educational inquiries since the 1980s. The power of the life history method in illuminating subjective teacher experiences in social historical contexts has made it &quot;probably the only authentic means of understanding how motives and practices reflect the intimate intersection of institutional and individual experience in the postmodern world (Dhunpath, 2000, p.544).&quot; In this regard, the authors made an attempt to employ the life history method to study teacher professionalism, an area of concern which has been increasingly tied up with educational quality and global competition at the turn of the twenty-first century. This paper aims at explaining why the combined methods of life history and collective memory are considered useful in analyzing teachers' professionalism. The authors first give a brief account of the study, which provides the background for the understanding of the methodological innovation. Then a few examples are given to illustrate how data analysis was carried out both at an individual and a collective group level. Finally the authors discuss the potentials of the combined use of life history and collective memory in educational research. (Contains 3 tables and 3 notes.)",

        "description":"Many new teachers in urban settings understand that the ways in which they are required to teach stem from local implementation of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), entitled &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (NCLB). Unfortunately, they find the legislation confusing, the implementations baffling, and the effect on the practicing and pre-service teachers disheartening. This study presents the thoughts, feelings, and understandings of new teachers in Language Arts (LA) classrooms &quot;from the inside&quot;; that is, from the perspective of second- and third-year teachers in poor urban districts. These teachers are emblematic of curricular reforms in two ways: First, because they have been impacted more dramatically and intensely than other disciplines; second, because urban teachers in high priority schools experience more intense teaching situations than those teaching in wealthier districts. Although achievement gaps between White and minority students have been increasing for some time, the experiences of these LA teachers shed light on the growing evidence that NCLB reforms may be accelerating and exacerbating such gaps. The narratives of these new teachers suggest that educational reform is implemented ineffectively when the local realities of teachers and learners are ignored. (Contains 2 notes.)",

Specifically, the authors examined how candidates drew from three domains of dispositions--intellectual, cultural, and moral (ICM)--as they analyzed the case twice over the course of one semester. The authors were particularly interested in whether and how candidates' thinking shifted by the second analysis at the end of the semester. Teacher candidates tend to make particular assumptions, especially when presented with students unlike themselves. Therefore, an integral part of the analysis also included looking within the three disposition domains to examine both candidates' awareness of the assumptions Jackie made as well as candidates' recognition of their own assumptions as they analyzed the case. Although candidates demonstrated an ability to reflect on appropriate instructional strategies, demonstrating awareness within the intellectual domain, they generally lacked awareness within the cultural and moral domains. These results are described in detail following an overview of the ICM framework and the methods for the study. (Contains 1 table and 3 notes.)",

Many states no longer offer permanent certification, but instead require teachers to participate in career-long professional development (PD). Accordingly, increasing attention is being paid to the effectiveness of PD initiatives, raising questions concerning how best to provide PD services for teachers--e.g., how such services should be designed, what topics they should cover, and which teachers should be served. Studies indicate that PD initiatives varied in effectiveness depending on their design features. However, the success of these initiatives likely depends as well on the characteristics of the teachers who take part in them. This paper reports the results of a study that examines how the following characteristics--age, years of teaching experience, gender, grade level (elementary versus secondary), and level of educational attainment--are associated with teachers' attitudes about PD.

However, while teachers are required to participate in professional development activities, it is often the case that they are not involved in selecting and planning those activities, and that professional development may not be closely tied to classroom practice.

In addition to providing students with pedagogical methodologies, these programs should prepare students to work with various and diverse populations and give them the ability to acknowledge and address issues of social and educational inequities within their schools and classrooms. Many pre-service teacher preparation programs address some of these concerns, such as racial and ethnic issues, linguistic diversity and economic status, but few have confronted issues dealing with sexual minorities. The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory assessment of pre-service educators' attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. As there are no studies examining teacher candidates' attitudes towards gay men and lesbians, this project fills a gap in the literature. By examining the attitudes of teacher candidates on sexuality issues, teacher preparation programs can better address such issues and thus positively influence future teacher-student interactions.

        "description":"One goal educators have is to empower students at all levels in this diverse and changing society whether they work with teacher candidates or with P-12 students. Teachers are seeing increased differences in race, ethnicity, culture, and special needs in children in their classrooms. The changing composition of early childhood classrooms challenges educators to be more responsive to the diverse needs of all children. Therefore, implementing a curriculum that is culturally responsive and inclusive to assist children's needs is imperative. To prepare teacher candidates to integrate anti-bias or diversity curriculum with the regular curriculum then becomes a crucial goal of every teacher preparation program. Unfortunately, many teachers currently in the classroom report that they feel inadequate to teach multicultural or anti-bias curriculum. Implementing a diversity curriculum may not be easy because of the fear, uncertainty, or discomfort of many teachers and teacher educators. Teachers' beliefs influence and affect their teaching practices and may become barriers that prevent the integration of anti-bias curricula. However, previous research found that teacher candidates' level of intercultural sensitivity could be enhanced by their teacher preparation courses and activities and from teacher educators who encouraged teacher candidates to discuss and reflect upon issues. In this article, the authors discuss what an anti-bias curriculum is, provide the theoretical framework and rationale for involving teacher candidates in certain activities that promote the anti-bias curriculum, and offer additional anti-bias strategies for teacher candidates and teacher educators to implement in their classrooms.",

We incorporated modifications to traditional operant paradigms by using three video playback systems to deliver random-dot kinematogram motion stimuli coupled with salient computer-animated secondary reinforcers representative of biologically important appetitive stimuli. This procedure has the capacity to test other visual aspects in lizards as well as other non-human species using video playback and computer-animation techniques as experimental tools.

As in previous experiments, more intrusions from post-target items than from pre-target items were observed. The results from event-related potentials are also more supportive for the two-stage parallel model than for the serial or other parallel models, as reflected in the differential waves associated to correct and wrong combinations.

The misleading suggestions consisted of either changes in the original video information or additions of completely new contents. In the subsequent recognition task the post-event misinformation produced memory impairment. The participants used the underlying schema of the event to extract high-typicality information which had become integrated with episodic information, thus giving rise to more hits and false alarms for these items. However, the effect of exposure to misinformation was greater on low-typicality items. There were no differences between changed or added information, but there were more false alarms when a low-typicality item was changed to a high-typicality item. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

Students' reflections and subsequent performances were observed through four rounds of surveys using open-ended questions and Likert scales. Results show that learning goals remained unchanged over the semester while performance goals changed towards the end of the semester. Students differentiated importance of management, elaboration, and rehearsal strategies and tended to change strategies based on test performances. Relationships were found between goals and test performances, but not between goals and study strategies, nor between study strategies and performances.

Unfortunately, many students seeking degrees in education sometimes do not recognize the importance and applicability of educational psychology to pedagogy, especially if it is taught in a way that is removed from their perceived immediate needs. One practical way to help them recognize its significance is through the blending of educational psychology and action research. Action research is defined as a type of applied research that focuses on finding a solution to a local problem and, like educational psychology, it was developed to improve teaching and learning. Both educational psychology and action research are grounded in everyday classroom problems teachers face, based on data, and dedicated to improving classroom life. This article is a reflective piece that explains my use of educational psychology with pre-service teachers doing action research. It explains the action research cycle students complete and where and how the ideas within this cycle are fueled with theories from educational psychology. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)",

They then watched a DVD of the lessons they taught and each completed a guided reflection task on the experience. Responses were analyzed to identify PTs' self-reported insights about teaching. Findings indicate the emergence of new understandings regarding planning and organization, pedagogical strategies, delivery, content knowledge, and classroom management. Implications and recommendations for instructors are offered. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Videos which consisted of selected segments of multiple expert teachers thinking aloud were developed. In the first experiment, one of these videos was viewed by elementary-level teacher candidates participating in online database discussions using Knowledge Forum[R] 4.5. In Experiment 2, secondary-level teacher candidates who viewed one of the videos provided longer and more conceptually-rich case study analyses than a control group which engaged only in small group discussion. Results from both experiments suggest that the composite video of experts' insights served as an engaging pedagogical tool for instructors to use in case study analysis.

Finally, if the patterns identified can be implemented as templates for standard authoring tools, the design of effective, reusable and adaptable resources can be made available to those with limited skills in multimedia authoring and result in learning resources that are more widely accessible.

A literature review was conducted, a draft list of accessibility indicators was created, examples of applications of the indicators in existing distance learning programs were collected, the indicators were systematically applied to one distance learning program, input from a variety of distance learning programs was used to further refine the indicators, and these programs were encouraged to adopt the indicators and make use of resources provided by the project. Results of this exploratory work suggest that incorporating accessibility considerations into policies, procedures and communications of a program requires consideration of the unique needs of students, course designers, instructors and evaluators; involves approval and implementation at a variety of administrative levels; and is an ongoing process that may be implemented in incremental steps.

The chat room was moderated by a paid demonstrator, who assisted and encouraged students whenever possible. Most of the discussion was banter, which acted as a lubricant for relevant factual communication. Students were permitted a degree of anonymity, but nevertheless learned to treat the facility in a useful manner. The application and its mode of employment were found to be both motivating and supportive. Use was evaluated by questionnaire and an analysis of student input. As a result of the experience, it is suggested that abuse will certainly occur and may be minimised by technical improvements, but never eliminated. The Rogerian approach adopted was found to have transferred emphasis from teaching a topic to the learning of generic skills. (Contains 3 figures.)",

It begins by briefly discussing the pedagogical approach adopted for the case-study course and the action research methodology. It then identifies key dimensions of four interconnected developmental processes--orientation, communication, socialisation and organisation--that were associated with \"learning to learn\" in the course's networked environment, and offers a flavour of participants' experiences in relation to these processes. A number of key evaluation issues that arose are highlighted. Finally, the paper presents the broad conceptual framework for the design and facilitation of process support in networked learning that was derived from this research. The framework proposes a strong, explicit focus on support for process as well as domain learning, and progression from tighter to looser design and facilitation structures for process-focused (as well as domain-focused) learning tasks.

        "description":"Research in information and communication technology in education places an increasing emphasis on the use of qualitative analysis (QA). A considerable number of approaches to QA can be adopted, but it is not always clear that researchers recognize either the differences between these approaches or the principles that underlie them. Phenomenography is often identified by researchers as the approach they have used, but little evidence is presented to allow anyone else to assess the objectivity of the results produced. This paper attempts to redress the balance. A small-scale evaluation was designed and conducted according to \"pure\" phenomenographic principles and guidelines. This study was then critiqued within the wider context of QA in general. The conclusion is that pure phenomenography has some procedural weaknesses, as well as some methodological limitations regarding the scope of the outcomes. The procedural weaknesses can be resolved by taking account of good practice in QA. The methodological issues are more serious and reduce the value of this approach for research in collaborative learning environments. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 1 note.)",

        "description":"Many students who enter colleges and universities seem to be focused on memorizing and regurgitating information rather than on developing critical thinking and problem solving skills. Mentoring is crucial to help these students transition from the current approach to one that will be successful in college. Successful mentoring requires a structured approach. The scientific method can serve as the model for such an approach. An important component of successful mentoring involves teaching students about the learning process and teaching them effective learning strategies. Specific characteristics of mentors and proteges determine whether the mentoring is effective or not. (Contains 2 figures and 1 footnote.)",

Whether due to external influences, such as the Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, which promotes inquiry about teaching and learning, or more related to internal forces such as the pressure to improve student retention, learning assistance administrators and teaching faculty increasingly share a common mission. The CTL movement assumes that significant learning takes place in multiple environments in and out of the classroom and that learning is a social interaction dependent on multi-layered and diverse learning communities. A case study at Randolph-Macon College suggests that moving learning centers toward the CTL model can effectively address some of the biggest challenges in the current postsecondary climate, such as retention, use of limited resources, and increased access.",

The USMLE Step 1 scores correlated with performance on Organ Systems (r = 0.76), Human Structure (r = 0.65), and CBSE (r = 0.69). Accounting for 59% of variance in the USMLE Step 1 scores, Organ Systems course was a better predictor compared 2 2 to Human Structure (R[superscript 2] = 42%), or CBSE (R[superscript 2] = 51%). Combined, the curricular and extracurricular courses accounted for nearly 70% of total variance in the Step 1 scores.

          "Polman, Joseph L."],
        "description":"Over the past few years, there has been considerable explication of what it means to think  historically. According to this research literature, expert historians think about such issues as placing historical events within context and chronology, considering the differing perspectives of participants in events, and taking the bias and intention of different source documents into account. The teaching of history has turned toward instructional models involving young learners in genuine historical inquiry, in order to meet more demanding standards for historical thinking. At the same time, technological aids to the teaching and learning of history, most often through some sort of \"authentic\" historical inquiry involving source documents accessed through hypertext and on the Internet, have increasingly been used. Yet there is also concern that strong content area knowledge does not necessarily lead to effective pedagogy. Within the context of these developments, future teachers of history face considerable challenges to develop their own content knowledge of history and their pedagogical content knowledge of how to help youth engage in historical inquiry that is meaningful to them and prepares them for participation in democratic society. An initiative in 2002-2003 at a large Midwestern public university attempted to better prepare future teachers of secondary history, through their involvement in open-ended inquiry with youth into the history of their neighborhood during a technology-rich after-school program. In this paper, the authors explore important issues in developing future teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of high school students' historical thinking, through case study research into their efforts.

Quantitative data were collected by self-administered questionnaires given to teachers at two points in time: baseline (immediately pre-SDP) and immediately post-SDP. Qualitative data were collected via open questions at baseline and post-SDP to gain more in-depth information about teacher's experience of the SDP.  In addition, observations were conducted at four points in time: sessions 1, 2, 6, and 10. Results suggest that overall the SDP-Teachers had been an enjoyable experience.  The results of this study will add to the sparse literature and evidence base concerning interventions for teachers in mainstream schools, particularly interventions that consist of complementary and alternative medicine.

The study also investigated whether assessment practices and obstacles of assessment differ among resource room teachers as a function of gender and academic qualification. 150 resource room teachers were randomly selected out of 455 to complete a survey designed to serve the purpose of the study. Results indicated that most teachers rely heavily on teacher-made tests of academic achievement to make eligibility decisions. Curriculum based assessment; students' response to intervention (RTI) and dynamic assessment were found to be the least practices used by teachers. With regard to assessment obstacles, results revealed that one of the major obstacles to assessment were high rate of referral especially for low achievers.  Results also indicated statistically significant differences in assessment practices for teachers' qualification but not for teacher's gender. Concerning the obstacles faced by teachers both variables showed no significant differences. Implications of these findings for assessment practices and for future research in Jordan are provided.

Fourteen participants had never been diagnosed with learning difficulties and had attended mainstream schools throughout their school careers. Fifteen participants were previously at a special school for learners with barriers to learning, entry into which required a diagnosis of a learning disability of some form. During the time of this study all participants had been in the mainstream school for a minimum period of two years. The Culture Free Self-Esteem Inventory Third Edition (CFSEI 3) was utilised to elicit participants' perceptions of their abilities and attributes as well as feelings of self-worth. Data was analysed using the descriptive statistical procedure. A two independent sample T-test indicated that there were no significant differences found between the two groups of participants for each of the CFSEI self-esteem subscales as well as for Global self-esteem. While this research has limited generalizability, it appears to hint at the potential benefits of inclusion and it also highlights the potential value of self-esteem interventions as an important part of implementing inclusion in schools.

        "description":"In the field of specific learning difficulties research, interest has recently turned to affective and motivational issues as possible causal or exacerbating factors. In particular, studies have suggested that students with specific learning difficulties (SpLD) have diminished perceptions of their own capabilities as a result of persistent and frequent failure. Weakened beliefs in self-efficacy predispose the students to further poor outcomes through reduced confidence and effort. This study explores the perceptions of self-efficacy in both academic  and non-academic domains revealed by Chinese primary-age students with learning difficulties. Data were collected by questionnaire (the Academic and Non-academic Self-efficacy Scale: ANASS) from 34 students identified with SpLD (individually interviewed; oral administration), and 167 students without learning problems (group administration; written form). Results indicate that the SpLD students had significantly weaker beliefs in their own efficacy in the academic learning domain, compared to the students making normal progress. The differences were most marked in their learning of both English and Chinese language skills. There was no difference between the two groups in self-efficacy related to the non-academic domain. An  important finding in the study is that Chinese children with SpLD appear to have more positive beliefs in their self-efficacy than is implied for their counterparts in studies in other cultures. These findings are discussed in this paper, together with brief suggestions for practical implications and possible further research. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"In America, the number of children diagnosed with autism has increased to 1 out of every 150. The current trend in special education appears to support integrated education. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is recognized by many as a very effective instructional methodology in teaching children with autism. Parents are increasingly requesting that special education teachers and general education teachers incorporate ABA into classroom instruction. It is reported that most teachers graduate from colleges with minimum training in evidence-based practices for children diagnosed with autism. Yet, as these children spend more time in integrated and inclusive settings there is a need for well trained and &quot;highly qualified&quot; teachers in keeping with the &quot;spirit&quot; of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This study examines the increase of children diagnosed with autism in the Western Suffolk BOCES region in New York State (NYS) over a five year period (2002-2007); the number of ABA trained teachers in this region to meet the growing instructional demands of these children; and to what extent are randomly selected colleges and universities in NYS offering evidence-based training (ABA) to prospective special educators?

As a result of this revision, intense and often polarizing debate has surfaced regarding models and methods relevant to classifying learning disabilities in children. This paper presents a philosophical/worldview framework developed to facilitate discussion among and limit dogmatic insularity within the field of LD diagnosis as it attempts to further delineate LD identification procedures. Identification of LD is discussed in relation to four root-metaphorical world views: mechanism, organicism, contextualism, and formism. Application of world view principles to discussion and debate regarding proposed LD classification models might help the field avoid entrapment within dogmatic, insulated, and limited perceptual frameworks that tend to marginalize competing models while magnifying strengths and minimizing (or inadvertently ignoring) weaknesses of a favored LD diagnostic model. This discussion is critical because learning disabilities comprises 51% of all special education diagnoses in the U.S.; yet, consensus has not been attained regarding the most appropriate LD diagnostic parameters.",

        "description":"A secondary school for children with Moderate Learning Difficulties had requested assistance from psychological services for pupils that the school felt were experiencing poor motor-coordination and in some cases low self-esteem. An intervention programme for children with dyspraxic type difficulties (Portwood, 1999) was proposed as a suitable improvement programme for the children identified as being most in need of assistance (n = 6). The programme ran for eighteen weeks (four weeks of the daily exercise programme, four weeks rest, and once again four weeks of the exercise programme). Pre and post-testing was carried out in the areas of speed of handwriting (Wallen et al., 1996) and general gross coordination improvement. It was deemed suitable to attempt to measure improvement with regards to speed of handwriting due to its relevancy in most facets of education. The results indicated that there was a significant level of improvement in the experimental group with regards to the speed of handwriting and also in general gross motor coordination. All members of the Video Review Panel felt that there were strong levels of improvement in the subjects (ranging from 45% to 65%). The participant staff members of the project school unanimously agreed that the intervention programme was worthwhile and that tangible benefits had been brought to both the children and the school as a result. Despite the small sample size, it was felt that there are implications for how children with moderate learning difficulties are viewed when improvement programmes are planned and implemented.

Conclusions amalgamate Council for Exceptional Children Standards for a Beginning Special Educator, Bloom's Taxonomy, and the Critical Thinking Scale of the Watson-Glaser-FS. Findings reinforce the need for rigorous mentorship of the novice special educator and direct instruction for the pre service educator in critical thinking through participation in research coursework.

        "description":"Since independence in 1991, Ukraine has struggled with restructuring its Soviet style educational system. The process has been sluggish and fraught with tension, resistance, and set backs, mirroring Ukraine's efforts to revamp its economy and regain productivity levels that characterized it prior to independence (Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, 2003). One of the initiatives currently being discussed is integration of students with disabilities with their nondisabled peers in educational and social settings. The debate has prompted heated discussions and caused some to recommend a reexamination of the special education system (Zasenko, 2004). This article discusses some of the initial actions taken in this debate, and presents some of the pressing barriers that will have to be addressed to make inclusion a reality for Ukraine's young people and citizens with special needs.",

        "description":"With the passing of the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act into law alongside the move away from academic selection for post-primary pupils by 2008 and a far reaching review of the curriculum, education in Northern Ireland is about to face its most radical change in fifty years. Issues relating to Inclusive Education are now pressing and in addressing such change, it is recognized that pre-service programmes must be reviewed to ensure that student teachers are equipped to teach effectively in classrooms that may be very different from their own learning experience. This study seeks to discover the factors influencing student teachers changing attitudes towards inclusion during a one year Post-Graduate Diploma in Education. The findings reveal that positive attitudes towards inclusion were tempered by concern about personal competency to teach in an inclusive classroom and by continued attachment to the current system of academic selection with which they were familiar. The effect of a successful teaching practice in the non-selective sector had the most positive influence on perceived competency and on general attitudes towards inclusion. This research concludes that those responsible for pre-service education in Northern Ireland should ensure that school based experience is also underpinned with an effective programme of academic study about inclusion-based practices.

The sample consisted of 405 regular classroom teachers teaching 1st- to 6th- grade students in 30 schools in three Jordanian districts. Teachers completed a 40-item test designed by the researcher, which had adequate psychometric properties. T-tests for independent samples and ANOVA were used to analyze the survey data. The results of the study revealed that teachers had a moderate level of knowledge of learning disabilities. Female teachers were found to be significantly more knowledgeable than male teachers. Teachers' level of knowledge was unrelated to teachers' age, teaching experience, or academic qualifications.

While it is recognized that ACT can have a positive impact on learning for students with learning problems, the process for the integration of assistive technology into the curriculum is more complex. A well documented gap exits between the potential of ACT and the realities of the classroom (Edyburn, 2000, 2004; Zabala, 2006; Zabala et al., 2000). Educators need easy access to professionals with expertise in technology and pedagogy. Technology strategic planning is essential. This report reviews these factors and suggests a model to address the ACT implementation process. For the purposes of this report, the term \"learning problems\" will be used as a general term that refers to significant difficulties in acquiring, processing, retaining or applying information for any student. Students with these challenges are at risk for early school leaving. Much of the research in the use of assistive computer technology has been reported for students with high incidence disabilities such as learning disabilities. This report includes, but is not limited to, research related to assistive computer technology for student with identified learning disabilities. (Contains 1 figure.)",

The paper also shows that vision impairment is the most common problem reported by the teachers in the schools, especially in Accra. Also, most of the teachers did not have any training in teaching children with disabilities. This situation limits their capability of helping the children with disabilities meaningfully toward achieving their educational goals. The study also demonstrates that some teachers were not happy to have children with disabilities, especially those with behavior problems, because of their large classes. It is recommended that the Ghana Education Service makes Special Education courses a major component in the teacher-training curriculum in Ghana, and also appoints experts on children with developmental problems to organize workshops for teachers in order to increase teacher effectiveness in dealing with children with disabilities.

How does the educator determine what medium will be the most beneficial for each of their students? Many art educators would state that they know these things through experience in working with the materials and students, through trial and error, and by seeing how different populations respond to and work with these materials. Many art educators work on an intuitive level to make their choices, and some make choices based on what is available to them for use. This study explores a specific art media, digital video, to better inform special educators and art educators who are working with special needs students the beneficial aspects, drawbacks and educational strengths of digital video production for students with emotional, behavioral and learning disabilities. Through a preliminary survey to determine the inherent qualities of this media and a case study to provide an in-depth look at this media, this study explores how art educators/special educators make decisions about when, why and how to use digital video with special populations.

As a result various special education researchers have begun to examine the success of inclusion, as well as the attitudes and beliefs of general educators towards the inclusion of learners with disabilities in the general education classroom. In the present study, preservice educators' attitudes towards inclusive education were investigated. The participants are full time students of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. These students are registered for the Post Graduate Certificate in Education, B.Phys.ed) and B.A (Ed) and they are all in their final year of study. The students are mainly English-speaking. The sample comprises of 22 students seven males and fifteen females. Convenient sampling design was employed. A questionnaire developed by Choles (1997) was adapted and was used as a measuring instrument to record the responses of the research respondents. The adapted questionnaire comprised of the following sections: Biographical details, Attitudes towards inclusive education, Requirements for competency, Requirements for successful inclusion and Attitudes towards learners with Special Needs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The research participants were generally found to have positive attitudes toward inclusive education. The results of this investigation are significant in the sense that the understanding of pre-service educators' attitudes is critical for the successful implementation of inclusive education (Mowes, 2000; Elloker, 1999; Gadium, 2002; Dover, 2002; &amp; Mckeskey &amp; Waldrom, 2002).

The sample population consisted of (23) adolescents, 12 (10 males and 13 females) aged 12-17 years in the first year of secondary school. The researcher used the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) for the evaluation of Self-Concept. The results of this study showed that there were some differences in the adolescents' self-concept and self-behavior due to gender. Female students scored lower on social self-concept, family self-behavior, and moral self-behavior dimensions than male students, but higher on physical self-concept. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Intelligence testing is an important part of any individualized education plan; however, a verbal test measure may not be appropriate for the child with a physical disability, visual impairment, and/or the inability to speak. A child with a physical disability may not be able to point accurately or build a tower with blocks; a child with a visual impairment may not be able to identify the colors in the small boxes contained in the test, and a child who is unable to speak may not have the same command of language as a peer who is able to speak. In order for schools and others to have an accurate depiction of the intelligence of a child with a disability, alternate testing methods may need to be employed. It is in the best interest of every child to have an adequate assessment to identify his/her individual educational needs. The purpose of this paper is to present the special needs of children with a physical disability, visual impairment, and/or the inability to speak and to propose some alternative testing methods to make testing more appropriate for these children.",

The Storey et al., (1990) study observed that people with mental retardation were viewed less favorably when participating in segregated activities and the current research used an alternate methodological approach to revisit this issue. Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in the first group were exposed to a slide show depicting a young woman engaging in various segregated recreation/sport activities. Participants in the second group saw the same person engaging in integrated recreation/sport activities. The Attitudes Toward Individuals with Severe Handicaps survey served as the outcome measure. Participants evaluated the stimulus person more favorably when she was engaged in integrated as compared to segregated activities; however, the magnitude of these differences was negligible.

        "description":"This paper considers the support of children with special educational needs in Botswana. A variety of sources including policy documents, literature, statistical data, interviews with key personnel and observation, are used to analyse the context and delivery of provision. Botswana is a middle-income country that has seen rapid economic expansion in a short period of time. Revenue has been used to expand the social sector including education. In the last decade HIV and AIDS has become a huge socio-economic challenge. Attitudes towards people with disability appear to be changing to become more inclusive but there is still evidence that many are still on the fringes of society. There are strong policy statements on the provision of special education. Policy has moved to an inclusive model but practice lags in the field. Most provision for children with special educational needs is at units for particular categories of disability attached to ordinary schools. The majority of these are at primary schools. There is a drive to build support for pupils in the ordinary school and classroom. This is slow in developing but might speed up in the near future as all newly trained teachers now have elements of special needs education as part of their initial training. Non-governmental organisations play a key role in pre school and vocational training for students with special needs and also in provision for hearing impairment. However they struggle with funding and staff training. Issues of poor coordination between key stakeholders, a lack of curriculum development and a shortage of specialist staff all conspire to limit the effectiveness of provision. There have been a number of studies made that highlight these issues and suggest improvements that could be made. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"One of the main challenges facing primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) stems from the current educational movement towards inclusion. It is an international phenomenon, a process that emphasizes providing special education services to students with special educational needs within the regular classrooms. The purpose of the study was to identify perceptions about educating students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The researchers examined the issue of inclusive education and the attitudes towards inclusion among the primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the large private sector. The study was also designed to identify whether these teachers perceived themselves capable of adapting to what inclusion requires. The study relied on qualitative methods. Questionnaires were given to primary mainstream teachers working in two large private schools in Dubai. Additionally teachers were interviewed too. All teachers involved in the study are expatriates. An analysis of data collected indicated that primary mainstream teachers in Dubai in the private sector favour traditional special education service delivery models over full inclusive practices. These teachers felt students with special educational needs lack skills needed to master the mainstream regular classroom course content. The teachers also expressed that the heavy teaching load in the mainstream classroom makes it hard to meet the needs of students with special educational needs in the private sector. However, results also indicated that teachers perceive additional training, support from administrators, and access to related services and resources as necessary in order to meet the needs of their students with special educational needs in the mainstream education setting. The study ended with research based recommendations for future practice.",

The paper opens with the study rationale and the importance of the subject. The review is based on a thematic analysis of content taken from diverse sources. The analysis showed five principle themes: (a) numerous Bedouin children with special needs and the ensuing social issues (b) Physical infrastructure (c) Skilled professional and multi-professional personnel (d) Methods, and adequate diagnostic, placement and interventional tools and (e) Additional assisting services. The analysis shows vast and numerous deficiencies vis-a-vis extant conditions and needs. It shows the necessity of an overall interventional program which will address diverse needs. At the end of the article I will propose Recommendations for future action emerging from the study adapted to the context and needs of the community; their main thrust relates to identifying all the Bedouin children with special needs, developing a professional-parent-community dialogue adapted to the needs of the community and devoting more attention to research of the subject.

Teachers rated the desirability of all practices high indicating their awareness and the importance of each.

We firstly reviewed the most famous theories which have explained how typically developing children acquire counting, and then we discussed how children with Down syndrome acquire counting according to these theories. We showed how children with Down syndrome have a deficit in counting and demonstrated the main reasons which may lie beneath this difficulty. Inspite of this difficulty in counting, we found that children with Down syndrome benefited from intervention. We ended the review by briefly summarizing the characteristics of good interventions to demonstrate how we can improve children with Down syndrome's ability to count.",

Primary students with severe intellectual disabilities (N=24) were taught abstract painting in a two-part method. The first part involved a Pictorial Only method and the second, immediately following it, involved a Pictorial plus Classical Music background. Guttman scales were created to measure both quality of painting and, separately, classroom behaviour, weekly, for six consecutive weeks. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (General Linear Model, repeated measures with SPSS) found: (1) that interaction effects did not reach significance; (2) a significant main effect for method of teaching on painting quality, and on classroom behaviour, with the Pictorial and Classical Music method being significantly better; (3) a significant main effect for practice over the six weeks on painting quality, with the Pictorial and Classical Music method being significantly better; and (4) a non-significant main effect for practice over the six weeks on classroom behaviour. Teachers in special schools should try playing classical music as background during the painting sessions of their students, not only to improve painting quality, but also to improve student attitude and behaviour in class.

If special education serves the student, then a researcher should be able to identify resulting agency and emancipation among the students. However, if special education is serving the organization, then a different picture could be painted. Special education could be serving the functionalist needs of sorting and tracking students. An unintended finding of the study was the apparent neglect and subsequent isolation and marginality of special education teachers, especially teachers who work in self-contained classes. Responses clearly reflect a deficit in social capital. With regard to students, most responses reflect a functionalist approach to serving students in the special education program in that the program sorts challenging students from the mainstream who might impede the progress of other children.

The autistic child is frequently asked to practice memorizing sight words while classmates are introduced to literature. Although autistic children are increasingly being taught in general education classrooms, they are often excluded from rich and meaningful literacy experiences like storytelling, play-acting, journal-keeping, and writing workshop. In fact, it is not unusual for students with autism in these classrooms to follow a different curriculum than the one offered to their classmates.

Articles from 2004 were analysed with regard to 1) sex of authors, 2) country of institutional affiliation of authors, 3) themes and 4) perspectives. The analyses suggest that, to a large extent, research is still nationally oriented. Female authors were most common in 11 of the 12 journals. The thematic analyses revealed similar patterns across arenas but the theme inclusion was far more common in the British/European journals. Research perspectives were mostly normative and a possible emerging middle-ground was identified. Implications of these empirical patterns are discussed in the article.

Three behaviors were recorded; time to completion, the number of assignments completed, and the frequency of inappropriate behavior. These data were gathered for 30 minutes each morning. The overall outcomes indicated that the two different token systems were effective in improving the participant's academic and social behavior. The amount of work that was required could be increased without a large decrement in academic output or increases in inappropriate behavior. The program was enjoyed by both the teaching staff and the participant. Suggestions for future research and the maintenance of treatment gains were made. (Contains 3 figures.)",

The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the established research and best practices in enhancing the above skills for children with Autism in the United States, with an attempt to promote the development of educational programs for children with autism in Southeast Asian countries. The first part of this paper introduces several research-based educational approaches and best practices in the field, including structured teaching approaches, direct instruction, social stories, peer-mediated intervention, video modeling, and discrete trial instruction, which have been proven effective in teaching social skills and in improving communication ability, as well as in decreasing inappropriate behavior in children with autism. The latter part of this paper suggests how these educational programs can be introduced to Southeast Asian countries based on the actual situations over there, to promote the development of educational programs for children with Autism in those areas.

The experimental group received a ninety-minute chess lesson once per week over a three-month period; and the control group students regularly attended school activities after class. The experimental group performance on the test was not different from the control group performance. However, chess skill rating and TONI-3 posttest scores were significantly correlated when controlling for TONI-3 pretest score (d = 0.29). This suggests that chess skill rating is a key predictor for the improvement of student cognitive skills. Students at risk at beginning levels of competency in chess may be able to improve their cognitive skills and to improve their skill at chess. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The first sample comprised a group of teachers who had received professional development directly related to the management of students with special educational needs in vocational education settings. Their attitudes and expectations of students with special educational needs were compared to those of a larger second sample of similar teachers who had not received training in this area. Differences of attitudes are discussed in relation to the findings from similar studies conducted elsewhere in Europe, including a developing literature from eastern European states. The paper concludes that whilst most teachers in Estonian Vocational Schools demonstrate positive attitudes towards the greater inclusion of students with special educational needs, concerns remain with regards to the readiness of these schools to accept such pupils onto existing courses. Training of teachers emerges as a critical factor in promoting inclusive practice and there is evidence of the support provided to a cohort of teachers through training courses having positively influenced attitudes and expectations.

We investigated the influences on preservice teachers' decision-making during their student-teaching through a two-part study. In the first phase, six undergraduate student-teachers at a large Midwestern university participated in focus group. Participants indicated that they made instructional decisions in five main areas (i.e., planning, teaching style, teaching methods, behavior management, and handling of a difficult moment) that were primarily influenced by their cooperating-teacher, previous experience, and university coursework. We then generated a survey on which 51 special education student-teachers from the same university rated the degree to which these three sources influenced the five areas of instructional decision-making. Cooperating-teachers were perceived as a significantly greater influence than university coursework in handling a difficult moment, teaching methods, and planning; and were a significantly greater influence than previous experience in behavior management and planning. Previous experience was significantly more influential than university coursework in relation to teaching style and handling a difficult moment. Implications for teacher preparation and bridging the research-to-practice gap are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The problem for many educators is that the term, \"assessment\" is full of paradox, and has taken on different meanings for different people. Assessment has become a driving force and factor in the funding of schools, teacher evaluation, curriculum development, the adaptation of curriculum and testing for special needs learners, determining mission and vision for schools, the retention of administrators and even the re-election of politicians. In this article, the author explains the ways in which assessment has become paradoxical.

First, the study explains music learning as a reflection of the relative localization of Taiwan's political tendencies to allow greater expression of national local cultural identity in school music education. Second, it examines the dilemmas of implementing policies on local Taiwanese music in the school curriculum by analyzing the localization process first in the wider context, and then in that of school music education.

Can online education truly be of the same quality as a traditional face-to-face program? How is it possible to effectively manage such large programs, particularly at the doctoral level? For some experienced music educators, it may be quite difficult to set aside firmly entrenched reservations and objectively consider the new possibilities for teaching and research afforded by recent technology. Yet the future is already here, and nearly 600 music educators have seized the opportunity. Through online programs, the internet has become the latest tool for offering professional development to practicing educators who otherwise would not have access, particularly those currently engaged in full-time employment or residing in rural areas. This article discusses five key issues, each of which represents challenges that are complex yet solvable. The first part of this article identifies and describes these challenges, followed by presentation of what the author proposes as corresponding solutions to each of them.

This study also examined the differences between leadership styles, student leadership strength, and band festival ratings (marching and concert). Subjects (N = 42) were band directors from Texas and Arkansas who participated in marching and concert band festivals. The Leadership Measurement Instrument (LMI) was designed to ascertain the strength of student leadership within the band programs, the type of leadership practiced by the directors (autocratic/facilitative), and the marching and concert festival band scores attained by the participants of this study. The data indicated a statistically significant positive relationship (p = 0.01) for student leadership strength and director leadership style, meaning that band directors with greater facilitative leadership tended to have a greater amount of student leadership within their programs. No statistically significant differences were found for student and director leadership on marching band festival scores. However, data concerning concert band festival ratings revealed significant differences for student leadership strength for concert band festival ratings, favoring high levels of student leadership (p = 0.018).

        "description":"The primary research question for the study was, \"Will older adult amateur musicians' personality profiles reflect the traits found in professional musicians?\" Participants (N = 58, ages 52 to 79) recruited from a New Horizons Institute \"band camp\" for older adult amateur musicians completed a musical background questionnaire and the Cattell (1993) \"Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, Fifth Edition\" (16PF) on their own time during the five-day camp. Group scores for all the 16PF primary and global factor scores were within expected ranges for a normal population of adults, although Factor B (Reasoning) was noticeably higher and Factors E (Dominance), F (Liveliness) and L (Vigilance) were noticeably lower, as was the global factor IN (Independence). This suggests that this sample \"leans\" toward being more accommodating (IN-), deferential (E-), serious (F-), trusting (L-), and thinking more abstractly (B+) than adults in Cattell's normative population. The 16 primary and five secondary factors were analyzed using a gender by experience (2 x 2) MANOVA, revealing a significant gender by experience interaction, which was the impetus for follow-up univariate analyses. Three primary factors showed significant between-group differences: L (Vigilance), N (Privateness), and Q1 (Open to Change). Male newcomers were more trusting (L-) and disclosing (N-), although the opposite tendencies were found for male returnees (individuals whose instruments were the ones they had played in high school or college). Female returnees were more open to change than male returnees. A 2 x 2 chi-square analysis of gender by experience revealed that older adult females were more likely to begin a new instrument than were men. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)",

The results found that significantly more songs were about men than were about women.

Participants (N = 33) were undergraduate music majors--education and performance--from two beginning conducting classes randomly assigned to either the technology-based group or the self-practice group. Subjects worked for three, 15-minute sessions on the following skills: staccato conducting, legato conducting, and steadiness of tempo. The experimental design was a pretest-posttest using two conducting etudes to measure six dependent variables: staccato conducting, staccato presence, staccato steadiness of tempo, legato conducting, legato presence, and legato steadiness of tempo. Three expert judges scored videotaped pre and posttests with interjudge reliability ranging from 0.77 to 0.84. Six Analyses of Covariance tests (ANCOVA) were used to analyze the aforementioned dependent variables. A significant difference resulted between treatment and control groups for only the legato conducting variable (p = 0.05). The researchers concluded that a longer treatment period was perhaps necessary to produce a significant difference between the groups on the other variables.",

For example, very little is known regarding how perceptions of costs and benefits are implicated in an individual's decision to pursue college or university studies, and whether certain perceptions hamper access among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This paper presents results from a research programme designed to develop and evaluate an operationalization of &quot;perceived return on investment&quot; (PRoI) in post-secondary education, based on students' subjective considerations of costs and benefits. These results are derived from two key research questions: is it possible to reliably measure high school students' perceived return on investment in a post-secondary education, and does the measurement of these perceptions predict actual post-secondary participation? Results show that PRoI can be measured satisfactorily and is predictive of university attendance, net of other factors currently known to influence participation. The &quot;perceptual horizon effect&quot; model is proposed to account for both positive and negative perceptions of returns on investment. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Corporate managerial practices that value individualism and productivity bump up against more democratic and collaborative practices inherent in the traditional academic culture and governance. Tensions result as faculty members are left on their own to make sense of the shifting political, economic and social landscape of higher education and to understand the implications for their professional identity within their Faculty. In an unstable institutional culture that lacks rules or mechanisms to shepherd faculty through this process, individuals can feel anxious, confused or incompetent as they negotiate the contradictions in their professional lives and deal with issues of power and resistance. Grounded in their own experiences of liminality, this paper uses an autoethnographic approach to explore and describe the experiences of three academic women &quot;betwixt and between&quot; their senior management positions, taking up positions as academic members of a Faculty, and the strategies they used to support each other, to reconstruct their professional identities and to understand the norms of the Faculty culture. The paper speaks to the importance of post-heroic forms of leadership, dialogue and collaborative communities that contribute to the creation of a culture in which faculty members can flourish.",

        "author":["Scott, Elizabeth S.",
          "Steinberg, Laurence"],
        "description":"Elizabeth Scott and Laurence Steinberg explore the dramatic changes in the law's conception of young offenders between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twenty-first. At the dawn of the juvenile court era, they note, most youths were tried and punished as if they were adults. Early juvenile court reformers argued strongly against such a view, believing that the justice system should offer young offenders treatment that would cure them of their antisocial ways. That rehabilitative model of juvenile justice held sway until a sharp upswing in youth violence at the end of the twentieth century led both public opinion and public policy toward a view that youths should be held to the same standard of criminal accountability as adults. Lawmakers seemed to lose sight of developmental differences between adolescents and adults. But Scott and Steinberg note that lawmakers and the public appear now to be rethinking their views once more. A justice system that operates on the principle of \"adult time for adult crime\" now seems to many to take too little note of age and immaturity in calculating criminal punishment. In 2005 the United States Supreme Court abolished the juvenile death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment, emphasizing that the immaturity of adolescents made them less culpable than adult criminals. In addition, state legislatures recently have repealed or moderated some of the punitive laws they recently enacted. Meanwhile, observe the authors, public anger has abated and attitudes toward young offenders have softened somewhat. In response to these changes, Scott and Steinberg argue that it is appropriate to reexamine juvenile justice policy and to devise a new model for the twenty-first century. In this article, they propose what they call a developmental model. They observe that substantial new scientific evidence about adolescence and criminal activity by adolescents provides the building blocks for a new legal regime superior to today's policy. They put adolescent offenders into an intermediate legal category--neither children, as they were seen in the early juvenile court era, nor adults, as they often are seen today. They observe that such an approach is not only more compatible than the current regime with basic principles of fairness at the heart of the criminal law, but also more likely to promote social welfare by reducing the social cost of juvenile crime.

        "description":"The dual requirement to ensure community safety and promote a youthful offender's positive development permeates policy and frames daily practice in juvenile justice. Balancing those two demands, explain Edward Mulvey and Anne-Marie Iselin, requires justice system professionals at all levels to make extremely difficult decisions about the likely risk and amenability to treatment of adolescent offenders. Mulvey and Iselin point out that although various forms of \"structured\" decision-making instruments are used widely in other fields, juvenile justice professionals today make limited use of these tools. Instead, they make decisions based mainly on their intuition about whether the adolescent before them is more likely to harm the community or to use justice system services to turn his life around. The reluctance of busy court professionals to use these structured decision-making tools, they say, arises partly from their heavy work load. But it also grows out of the ethos of the juvenile court itself. Restricting an adolescent's freedom or access to interventions based on a tallying of empirical data is antithetical to viewing each adolescent as a unique individual whose life chances may remain intact with developmentally appropriate intervention. Mulvey and Iselin recommend and examine three ways to integrate structured judgment approaches into the juvenile justice system that both capitalize on their strengths and support the court's attempts to provide fair, individualized justice. First, more reliance on actuarial methods at detention and intake would promote more efficient and equitable screening of cases for subsequent court involvement. Second, the use of structured decision making by probation officers could provide more consistent and valid guidance for the court when formulating dispositions. Finally, implementing structured data systems to chart the progress of adolescents in placement could allow judges to oversee service providers more effectively. The challenge for the juvenile system, say the authors, will be to harness the new capacities of the science of decision making and of computer technology to increase the efficiency of its limited resources for the benefit both of the community and of the adolescents in the system.

        "description":"For many years, notes Alex Piquero, youth of color have been overrepresented at every stage of the U.S. juvenile justice system. As with racial disparities in a wide variety of social indicators, the causes of these disparities are not immediately apparent. Some analysts attribute the disparities to \"differential involvement\"--that is, to differences in offending by minorities and whites. Others attribute them to \"differential selection\"--that is, to the fact that the justice system treats minority and white offenders in different ways. Still others believe the explanation lies in a combination of the two. Differential involvement may be important earlier in the judicial process, especially in youths' contacts with police, and may influence differential selection later as individuals make their way through the juvenile justice system. Adjudicating between these options, says Piquero, is difficult and may even be impossible. Asking how much minority overrepresentation is due to differences in offending and how much to differences in processing no longer seems a helpful way to frame the discussion. Piquero urges future research to move beyond the debate over \"which one matters more\" and seek to understand how each of the two hypotheses can explain both the fact of minority overrepresentation in the juvenile justice system and how best to address it. Piquero cites many sizable gaps in the research and policy-relevant literature. Work is needed especially, he says, in analyzing the first stage of the justice system that juveniles confront: police contacts. The police are a critical part of the juvenile justice decision-making system and are afforded far more discretion than any other formal agent of social control, but researchers have paid surprisingly little attention to contacts between police and citizens, especially juveniles. Piquero notes that some states and localities are undertaking initiatives to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. He urges researchers and policymakers to evaluate such initiatives, especially those using strategies with a track record of success. Researchers should also examine empirically the far-reaching consequences of disproportionate minority representation in the juvenile justice system, such as poor outcomes in education, labor force participation, and family formation. Finally, Piquero emphasizes that one critical research area involves updating justice system data systems and repositories, which have failed to track changes in U.S. demographic and immigration patterns.

        "description":"Rising juvenile crime rates during the 1970s and 1980s spurred state legislatures across the country to exclude or transfer a significant share of offenders under the age of eighteen to the jurisdiction of the criminal court, essentially redrawing the boundary between the juvenile and adult justice systems. Jeffrey Fagan examines the legal architecture of the new boundary-drawing regime and how effective it has been in reducing crime. The juvenile court, Fagan emphasizes, has always had the power to transfer juveniles to the criminal court. Transfer decisions were made individually by judges who weighed the competing interests of public safety and the possibility of rehabilitating young offenders. This authority has now been usurped by legislators and prosecutors. The recent changes in state law have moved large numbers of juveniles into the adult system. As many as 25 percent of all juvenile offenders younger than eighteen, says Fagan, are now prosecuted in adult court. Many live in states where the age boundary between juvenile and criminal court has been lowered to sixteen or seventeen. The key policy question is: do these new transfer laws reduce crime? In examining the research evidence, Fagan finds that rates of juvenile offending are not lower in states where it is relatively more common to try adolescents as adults. Likewise, juveniles who have been tried as adults are no less likely to re-offend than their counterparts who have been tried as juveniles. Treating juveniles as adult criminals, Fagan concludes, is not effective as a means of crime control. Fagan argues that the proliferation of transfer regimes over the past several decades calls into question the very rationale for a juvenile court. Transferring adolescent offenders to the criminal court exposes them to harsh and sometimes toxic forms of punishment that have the perverse effect of increasing criminal activity. The accumulating evidence on transfer, the recent decrease in serious juvenile crime, and new gains in the science of adolescent development, concludes Fagan, may be persuading legislators, policymakers, and practitioners that eighteen may yet again be the appropriate age for juvenile court jurisdiction.

In 1980, boys were four times as likely as girls to be arrested; today they are only twice as likely to be arrested. In this article, the author explores how the juvenile justice system is and should be responding to the adolescent female offender. She begins by reviewing historical trends in arrest rates, processing, and juvenile justice system experiences of female offenders. She also describes the adult outcomes commonly observed for female offenders and points out that the long-term consequences of offending for females are often more pronounced than those for males, with effects that extend to the next generation. She also considers common patterns of offending in girls, as well as factors that may increase or decrease the likelihood of offending. She then reviews what is known about effective treatment strategies for female offenders. (Contains 4 figures and 114 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Laurie Chassin focuses on the elevated prevalence of substance use disorders among young offenders in the juvenile justice system and on efforts by the justice system to provide treatment for these disorders. She emphasizes the importance of diagnosing and treating these disorders, which are linked both with continued offending and with a broad range of negative effects, such as smoking, risky sexual behavior, violence, and poor educational, occupational, and psychological outcomes. The high rates of substance use problems among young offenders, says Chassin, suggest a large need for treatment. Although young offenders are usually screened for substance use disorders, Chassin notes the need to improve screening methods and to ensure that screening takes place early enough to allow youths to be diverted out of the justice system into community-based programs when appropriate. Cautioning that no single treatment approach has been proven most effective, Chassin describes current standards of \"best practices\" in treating substance use disorders, examines the extent to which they are implemented in the juvenile justice system, and describes some promising models of care. She highlights several treatment challenges, including the need for better methods of engaging adolescents and their families in treatment and the need to better address environmental risk factors, such as family substance use and deviant peer networks, and co-occurring conditions, such as learning disabilities and other mental health disorders. Chassin advocates policies that encourage wider use of empirically validated therapies and of documented best practices for treating substance use disorders. High relapse rates among youths successfully treated for substance use disorders also point to a greater need for aftercare services and for managing these disorders as chronic illnesses characterized by relapse and remission. A shortage of aftercare services and a lack of service coordination in the juvenile justice system, says Chassin, suggest the need to develop treatment models that integrate and coordinate multiple services for adolescent offenders, particularly community-based approaches, both during and after their justice system involvement.

        "description":"Over the past decade researchers have identified intervention strategies and program models that reduce delinquency and promote pro-social development. Preventing delinquency, says Peter Greenwood, not only saves young lives from being wasted, but also prevents the onset of adult criminal careers and thus reduces the burden of crime on its victims and on society. It costs states billions of dollars a year to arrest, prosecute, incarcerate, and treat juvenile offenders. Investing in successful delinquency-prevention programs can save taxpayers seven to ten dollars for every dollar invested, primarily in the form of reduced spending on prisons. According to Greenwood, researchers have identified a dozen \"proven\" delinquency-prevention programs. Another twenty to thirty \"promising\" programs are still being tested. In his article, Greenwood reviews the methods used to identify the best programs, explains how program success is measured, provides an overview of programs that work, and offers guidance on how jurisdictions can shift toward more evidence-based practices. The most successful programs are those that prevent youth from engaging in delinquent behaviors in the first place. Greenwood specifically cites home-visiting programs that target pregnant teens and their at-risk infants and preschool education for at-risk children that includes home visits or work with parents. Successful school-based programs can prevent drug use, delinquency, anti-social behavior, and early school drop-out. Greenwood also discusses community-based programs that can divert first-time offenders from further encounters with the justice system. The most successful community programs emphasize family interactions and provide skills to the adults who supervise and train the child. Progress in implementing effective programs, says Greenwood, is slow. Although more than ten years of solid evidence is now available on evidence-based programs, only about 5 percent of youth who should be eligible participate in these programs. A few states such as Florida, Pennsylvania, and Washington have begun implementing evidence-based programs. The challenge is to push these reforms into the mainstream of juvenile justice.

In addition, a quarter of the words looked up in the study were neither essential to the articles' main points nor frequent or useful words, according to corpus research.

A surprise vocabulary test that measured recall of form, recognition of form, recall of meaning, and recognition of meaning was administered after the treatments.

Reading performance was significantly better for students receiving vocabulary assistance during reading, but not for those receiving it before reading. Reading time of the newspaper article was less for students receiving prereading vocabulary assistance, but total lesson time (the prereading time plus reading time) was more for those students. Given the particular activities of this study, a vocabulary activity before reading appears to speed up reading without affecting comprehension, while vocabulary assistance during reading appears to improve comprehension without affecting speed.",

        "author":["Handley, Karen",
          "Cox, Benita"],
        "description":"The importance of feedback as an aid to self-assessment is widely acknowledged. A common form of feedback that is used widely in e-learning is the use of model answers. However, model answers are deficient in many respects. In particular, the notion of a \"model\" answer implies the existence of a single correct answer applicable across multiple contexts with no scope for permissible variation. This reductive assumption is rarely the case with complex problems that are supposed to test students' higher-order learning. Nevertheless, the challenge remains of how to support students as they assess their own performance using model answers and other forms of non-verificational \"feedback\". To explore this challenge, the research investigated a management development e-learning application and investigated the effectiveness of model answers that followed problem-based questions. The research was exploratory, using semi-structured interviews with 29 adult learners employed in a global organisation. Given interviewees' generally negative perceptions of the model-answers, they were asked to describe their ideal form of self-assessment materials, and to evaluate nine alternative designs. The results suggest that, as support for higher-order learning, self-assessment materials that merely present an idealised model answer are inadequate. As alternatives, learners preferred materials that helped them understand what behaviours to avoid (and not just \"do\"), how to think through the problem (i.e. critical thinking skills), and the key issues that provide a framework for thinking. These findings have broader relevance within higher education, particularly in postgraduate programmes for business students where the importance of prior business experience is emphasised and the profile of students is similar to that of the participants in this research.

Process writing refers to writing that consists of multiple drafts. It may be a process of re-writing without feedback or re-writing based on feedback where the teacher or peers will provide feedback on the original draft and then the students will revise their writing based on the feedback given. The objective was to explore how knowledge of students' cognitive processes when using multiple organizers can inform the teaching of writing. The literature review analyzes the interaction of the design, function and task components of the framework; culminating in instructional approaches for using multiple organizers for classes with students of different writing abilities. Extended implications for designers of concept mapping tools based on these approaches are provided. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Any application of information and communication technology in education (ICTE) sits, at times uncomfortably, at the intersection of three key disciplines: technology, education and sociology (including reflexivity). To confuse matters, any specific study may need to take account of specific knowledge within subdisciplines, such as organisational management and technology transfer, and of knowledge within the domain of application (e.g. nursing, social work, fashion, etc.). Researchers must build a consistent model of knowledge that can integrate disparate methodologies, research goals and even conflicting interpretations of the same terminology. Without this, the ICTE research field will be dominated by what is simply novel, irrespective of the relevance of particular changes to educational practice. If existing models in this field are as limited as suggested by Moule, when should lecturers and teachers, with no motivation to use technology for its own sake and no additional financial support, review progress in this field for effective examples of innovative practice, let alone wide-scale change? On most of the criteria that could be introduced to compare two papers, the views of Moule and Salmon appear almost diametrically opposed and a detailed comparison would seem of limited value. Instead, this paper asks a more fundamental question: what could be the basis within this research community for establishing coherence within the field and ensuring that research can justify actual changes in educational practice?",

The authors reflect on these lessons using educators' voices and by exploring how the experience of school change in post-Katrina New Orleans intersects with the broader literature on change so that a deep discussion of change after chaos might help to inform future efforts to change school systems.

Its powerful impact on student performance--in both classroom assessments and large-scale accountability assessments--empowers students to guide their own learning and internalize the criteria for judging success. In this article, the authors define student self-assessment and its importance in influencing student motivation and learning. The authors begin with a detailed definition of self-assessment, then review pertinent theoretical and research literature that supports the positive impact of student self-assessment in the classroom. The authors intention is to show that, based on both theoretical and applied research and theory, self-assessment works, and that by applying a set of practical steps teachers can facilitate this kind of assessment and reap the benefits.

        "description":"There has been a wealth of investigation into the use of online multiple-choice questions as a means of summative assessment, however the research into the use of formative MCQs by the same mode of delivery still remains patchy. Similarly, research and implementation has been largely concentrated within the Sciences and Medicine rather than the more discursive subjects within the Humanities and Social Sciences. The INQUIRE (Interactive Questions Reinforcing Education) Evaluation Project was jointly conducted by two groups at the University of Oxford--the Said Business School and the Academic Computing Development Team to evaluate the use of online MCQs as a mechanism to reinforce and extend student learning. This initial study used a small set of highly focused MCQ tests that were designed to complement an introductory series of first-year undergraduate management lectures. MCQ is a simple and well-established technology, and hence the emphasis was very much on situating the tests within the student experience. The paper will cover how the online MCQs are intended to fit into the Oxford Undergraduate study agenda, and how a simple evaluation was executed and planned to investigate their usage and impact. The chosen method of evaluation was to combine focus groups with automated online methods of tracking, and the paper discusses the findings of both of these. (Contains 1 note.)",

In order to complete the activity, the faculty members had to work collaboratively with others across the university. Activity theory provided a framework within which to study faculty members' collaborative activities with members of different activity systems that had different goals, tools, divisions of labor and accountabilities. In concordance with activity theory, such differences led to contradictions, disturbances, and transformations in thinking and work activities. The results of the study have implications for individuals and systems undertaking technology integration in teaching.",

It argues that a clear articulation of these affordances would enable us to understand how these technologies can be most effectively used to support learning and teaching. We believe that any one affordance can be considered to have both positive and negative connotations and the paper draws on social and educational theory to provide an initial taxonomy of these affordances.

        "author":["Yang, K. Wayne"],
        "description":"While the major urban centers around the country were flooded by millions of protesters demanding immigrant rights in March 2006, the San Francisco Bay Area remained relatively quiet. A coalition of organizers, including Centro Legal de la Raza, Deporten A La Migra, and the Bay Area Immigrant Rights Coalition mobilized a one-week hunger strike, creating media visibility and political pressure despite their smaller numbers. On the morning of March 27th, 2006, a throng of organizers broke camp and prepared to march to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein's office to demand changes to the bill being constructed by her senate committee. Eventually, thousands of people including teenagers closed down Market Street, the main thoroughfare through downtown San Francisco, to rally in front of Senator Feinstein's office. Youth played a large role in organizing for immigrant rights in cities throughout the country, but in San Francisco they became the critical mass necessary for a significant mobilization. This article explores the nature of &quot;fast organizing&quot; among youth made possible through the advent of new media, particularly instantaneous text messaging and virtual communities formed in cyberspace. However, this study affords an analysis of not just new media, but of the contemporary terrain of youth organizing and popular culture. (Contains 9 notes.)",

        "description":"This article takes up what people might learn about resistance and surveillance by looking at how students at a Bronx, New York, high school have responded to security initiatives recently imposed on them. It discusses three responses: the protest; tactical avoidance; and what the author calls emergent participation. The author addresses each of these strategies in depth and follows with a brief consideration of what they teach individuals about resistance. Taken together, these responses offer people a chance to consider the multiple forms that resistance takes and those that emerge over time, in this case, over the course of a school year. The author begins by considering what is perhaps the most promising and definitely the most visible response to school-wide surveillance measures: a student-organized walkout of 1,500 students that took place at a large comprehensive high school in the Bronx, New York, in late September 2005. Before she discusses the protest, the author gives a brief history of New York City school security policy. (Contains 12 notes.)",

        "description":"On a cold and wet Friday night in January of 2006, thirteen undergraduate students gathered together in a small room on campus at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) to found Students Informing Now (S.I.N.). S.I.N. was created to support the AB 504 students, labeled in this country as &quot;illegal aliens.&quot; Inspired by Paulo Freire's philosophy of popular education, the organizers used an activity called &quot;the flower&quot; to develop their organizational mission and vision statement. This article seeks to show how S.I.N. serves as a vehicle that makes it possible for undocumented students to engage in the growing youth-led movement for greater educational access and equity. This article illustrates how S.I.N. works as a safe space, where testimonies and the creation of trust enable SINistas (members of S.I.N.) to speak freely about their experiences without fear of being judged and without shame. Thus, S.I.N. provides a zone of safety, enabling undocumented students to develop a political identity as AB 540 students. Drawing from the work of Latina feminists (e.g., Dyrness, 2006; Villenas, 2001), this article argues that the students' collective political resistance is made possible, in part, because of the personal transformation that occurs within the context of S.I.N.

In order to understand the reasons behind the parental and community support of Chinese students, a survey was conducted among Chinese parents to assess what they know about language loss, power, knowledge, and democracy. The results demonstrate that Chinese parents know what is valuable to their children's education; that Chinese parents know the importance of having their culture represented among school teachers, administrators, and board members and the importance of fighting for power; and that those Chinese students made the right decision to fight for their right to study Chinese as a foreign language. To examine this issue, it is necessary to position it within the existing research literature. The authors review literature on knowledge, power, language, and democracy to help in understanding why these students fought for their right to learn Chinese and why that action failed. The findings from the survey are discussed in light of the current knowledge base. (Contains 1 table and 1 note.)",

The data revealed that African American youth have a large capacity for activism and ability to resist. Early engagement on issues of social justice, equality and freedom by family, teachers, pastors and community leaders can help to shape political character and willingness to participate as an activist. Moreover, youth are more likely to become involved if they perceive issues as directly impacting their lives. As youth grow up they tend to become more jaded about their ability to make a change but they are still willing to work on fighting for justice if they find other like-minded individuals. While young people today are not involved with local electoral politics they demonstrate a highly sophisticated understanding of social organization, bureaucracies, and politics. Finally, when schools provide information and role models students are more likely to take risks and want to improve their surroundings. (Contains 11 notes.)",

Altogether, 106 single-subject studies, which produced 694 effect sizes, were analyzed. The grand mean of 106 averaged effect sizes was significant. Results demonstrated that the PEM approach was more congruent with the original authors' judgments than the PND approach.

Survey respondents ranked universal design for learning (UDL) as the most needed training topic. A web-based, self-paced professional development tool called FAME (Faculty and Administrator Modules in Higher Education) was developed, piloted, and revised in response to the training needs identified. In Study 2, a review of FAME by 98 faculty members and administrators supported the value of on-demand, multi-modal professional development in universal design. Ninety-two percent of respondents reported increased comfort in meeting the instructional needs of students with disabilities as a result of using this curriculum.

Although prior research has examined university faculty perceptions of students with LD, little is known about staff members' attitudes and perceptions. A survey instrument was administered to approximately 300 staff members at a large private university and resulted in 70 responses. The survey contained items pertaining to knowledge about LD, willingness to provide accommodations, understanding of available support services, and need for professional development. Findings indicated that staff generally had positive attitudes towards students with LD and were willing to provide accommodations. However, a substantial number of respondents indicated a need for training and professional development regarding students with LD in general as well as strategies to support students with LD in postsecondary settings. The implications of these findings are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)",

Disability services offices on college campuses can be an important resource to these students. This article reports the results of a survey of disability services offices at colleges and universities in 10 states. Data were collected from 275 disability services offices regarding the number of students with psychiatric disabilities seeking assistance, characteristics of the disability services office, and the services provided. We tested a multivariate model examining the relationship between a set of predictor variables (characteristics of the school and disability services office) and the number of students with psychiatric disabilities enrolled with the disability services office. Significant predictors included size of school, school type, and having an outreach/recruitment policy regarding students with psychiatric disabilities. Also significant were several characteristics of the disability service office. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

It describes how bibliotherapy was a powerful reflective tool that provided them with the opportunity to respond cognitively and affectively to their own schooling. By analysing readings about school students' learning and issues such as mathematics anxiety, they reflected on and reconstructed their understanding of their own school experiences. In turn, this challenged their assessment of their capacity to learn and teach mathematics. Bibliotherapy was a healing process that generated both enthusiasm for teaching and an enhanced confidence as the pre-service teachers looked to the future. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

The dynamic nature of identity as a mathematical thinker is illustrated by considering the experiences of primary pre-service teachers who undertook a mathematics and technology subject in their undergraduate education degree. The pre-service teachers developed their identity as self-regulating learners through setting goals, planning, organising, recording, self-evaluating, and structuring their learning environment. Affective issues, such as resilience, confidence, and ownership, were also significant in identity formation. The mathematical social context provided by the tutorial group and use of technology impacted on self-regulation and social identity and hence on pre-service teachers' identity as mathematical thinkers.

        "description":"In New South Wales the focus on assessment &quot;for&quot; learning requires teachers to consider carefully the alignment between assessment, curriculum, and pedagogy. This emerging agenda in teacher education seeks to ensure that assessment practices provide advice to teachers about what students know and where teaching might be directed to enhance learning. To incorporate this change into classroom practices, teachers need ongoing and sustained professional development. This paper describes the experiences of secondary mathematics teachers as they engaged in a two-year professional development program using the SOLO Model as the theoretical framework to explore the changing nature of assessment. Initially, teachers' views of the advantages of the professional development experience are identified as major themes. Following this overview, three case studies are presented to provide a longitudinal perspective about the ways in which the views of teachers evolved over the period of the project.

The paper discusses virtual gaming worlds from a theoretical pedagogic perspective, exploring the educational benefits of gaming environments. Then practical considerations associated with the use of virtual gaming worlds in formal settings in higher education are considered. Finally, the paper considers development options that are open to educators, and discusses the potential of Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) for learning in higher education. In all, this paper hopes to provide a balanced overview of the range of virtual gaming worlds that exist, to examine some of the practical considerations associated with their use, and to consider their benefits and challenges in learning and teaching in the higher education context.",

Much of the recent research into learning in immersive virtual worlds centres around games and gaming and is largely underpinned by cognitive learning theories that focus on linearity, problem-solving and the importance of attaining the \"right answer\" or game plan. Most research to date has been undertaken into students' experiences of virtual learning environments, discussion forums and perspectives about what and how online learning has been implemented.

In this paper we briefly review the use of virtual worlds for education, from informal learning to formal instruction, and consider what is required to turn a virtual world from a Multi-User Virtual Environment into a fully fledged 3D Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). In this we focus on the development of Sloodle--a system which integrates the popular 3D virtual world of Second Life with the open-source VLE Moodle. Our intent is not simply to provide additional learning support features for Second Life, but to study more generally the ways in which integrated virtual environments can benefit teaching and learning, and this is the focus of our closing discussion.

        "description":"The paper reports the theoretical underpinnings for the pedagogical role and rationale for adopting 3D virtual worlds for socialisation and knowledge creation in distance education. Socialisation or \"knowing one another\" in remote distributed environments can be achieved through synchronous technologies such as instant messaging, audio and video-conferencing. However, a 3D virtual world can provide an immersive experience where there is a visual presence and virtual proximity of the group members in terms of their 3D selves (avatars). We discuss the affordances of a 3D virtual world and its role in providing a platform for pedagogical design that engenders socialisation, synchronous communication and collaboration. We propose the use of a knowledge construction model as a framework for guiding the design of collaborative activities in a 3D virtual world for blended learning environments. We believe that this framework will also be useful for integrating 2D environments such as blogs, wikis and forums with a 3D learning environment. We consider the implications of this in the context of blended learning in distance education. This paper would be of interest to course designers, researchers, teachers, staff developers and policy-makers who are involved in integrating 3D virtual worlds within the curriculum of their programmes and institutions.

        "description":"With the increased interest in using Immersive Virtual Worlds (IVWs) such as Second Life to augment and amplify teaching or to develop communities of practice, the author engaged graduate students, all current K-12 teachers, in a qualitative study to examine their attitudes about communicating for the first time in a virtual setting represented by an interactive avatar. This study sought to determine if students were able to discern degrees of expertise in other avatars by providing encounters with guests who had a significant amount of experience navigating in a virtual world. The study examined Second Life as a synchronous discussion tool for a higher education setting and finds it lacking in some respects, but is able to make recommendations about training instructors to exhibit behaviours that may inspire confidence while leading a class in such a setting.",

Fifty females with learning disabilities (LD) and 73 females without disabilities, 25-39 years old, completed three different questionnaires sent to them by email. Findings indicate that the females with LD perceived the learning environment as less supportive and less satisfactory than the control group; they felt that the academic services were not sufficiently considerate of their special needs; and they were less content with the academic courses. Women with LD reported using more task-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping strategies and perceived their overall well-being as less satisfactory than female students without LD.

Similarities as well as notable differences were found between the LD (N=27) and non-LD (N=28) groups in perceptions and approaches to academic tasks. The LD group indicated a higher level of initiative than the non-LD group, which may be one of the factors helping contribute to their achievement. While the resiliency factor of initiative was higher for the LD group, self-efficacy in regard to coursework was significantly lower than that of the non-LD group. Even though by measures of aptitude and GPA the students with LD were not significantly different from their peers without LD, many indicated self-doubt about not being able to perform as well in academic coursework as their non-LD cohorts.

The Metrics on Disability and Postsecondary Education (MDPE) team designed the model to determine the extent to which the needs of students with disabilities were being met throughout their educational careers. The project consists of three phases. Phase I sought to identify the critical questions/issues related to disability access that the model needed to address. Phase II focused on instrument development, data collection methods, and implementation of a pilot study. Phase III was dedicated to dissemination across institutions of higher education in Illinois and finalizing the model. This paper reports the activities and findings of Phase I.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to examine the college and career plans of a high-achieving group of students, high school valedictorians, to determine whether the females had equal aspirations with the males at the end of the senior year of high school in terms of their intended college major, the selectivity of their chosen college, and for future labor market earnings in their intended careers. A unique, pooled dataset was constructed from valedictorian profiles published in a regional newspaper for the 2003, 2004, and 2005 graduating classes in the Research Triangle area of central North Carolina. The results indicated that the female valedictorians were equally likely to intend to major in a field in the sciences but were more likely to intend to major in fields in the humanities and social sciences; were less likely to intend to major in math, computer science, or engineering; and were planning careers in lower paying occupations. The female valedictorians were, on average, planning to attend less selective colleges, as measured by the colleges' acceptance rates, although the gender difference in college selectivity decreased when the females graduated from high schools with higher average SAT scores, all else held constant.

However, no one has systematically compared the text demands of high school with those of the postsecondary world. If there is a gap in text readability then apparent student unreadiness could be a function of different text demands rather than a deficiency in student ability.

By using the concept of racial identity a continuum of racism can be considered. Furthermore, addressing White privilege and racism in the context of a multicultural psychology course allows White students to have a greater appreciation for the history and subjective experience of people of color in the United States, as this history has been irrevocably influenced by White culture. Using a continuum of racism as a pedagogical tool allows for the introduction of psychoanalytic group relations theory, helping students to think more critically about the categories of \"racist\" and \"non-racist.\" This article presents the teaching methods the author employs, with the hope that these are additional tools which can be utilized in the field of White privilege and anti-racism pedagogy.

        "description":"With the increased focus on issues of diversity and multiculturalism in the United States and abroad, educators and clinicians have become more and more concerned about the feasibility and validity of their assessment instruments and practices for children and adults from nonWhite backgrounds. Many researchers emphasize that when working with racially diverse groups in multiple settings, issues relating to their cultures often differ from those of the dominant group and thus warrant different approaches and considerations. Therefore, the need to foster a multicultural perspective within educational and psychological assessment that embraces more than just test instruments is evident and paramount. For people of color, the negative and harmful effects of assessment practices reaches far beyond mere measurement and focuses on more critical issues than just testing bias. For people of color, a cultural approach to assessment must begin with a dialogue on multicultural standards, competencies, guidelines, training, and with the relevant profession for which the education and assessment is intended. Thus, a multicultural approach necessitates a moral and ethical responsibility for higher education institutions to be proponents of diversity and to prepare culturally sensitive professional educators to work with the diverse groups in the society. This study gleans from professional people of color in the field of education their experiences and perceptions of contemporary assessment instruments and practices and the relative influence these practices exert on people of color.",

        "description":"The past decade has seen a rapid growth of increasingly diverse immigrant populations in the United States--the most vulnerable among these are refugee children. Most immigrants enter a host country with a goal of improving their opportunities in life. They arrive after years of preparation, such as locating housing, securing jobs and support from the local ethnic community and/or nuclear or already established extended family. Most importantly, while preparing to move, many immigrants become somewhat familiar with the new language of the host nation. Unlike these typical immigrants, however, refugees are fleeing a history of oppression and have often experienced untold human horrors. Rather than immigrating with a goal of improving their lives, they do so simply to save their lives. Often they arrive in a strange country with their entire belongings reduced to the clothes on their bodies. On their own, they flee fear of persecution in search of refugee camps where they wait to be sent to a safe nation where they can resume their lives. Teachers in the United States are a relatively homogeneous group. The great majority are White and monolingual with very modest if any international travel experience. Moreover, they tend to come from secure, middle-class backgrounds. Their experience with the horrors of war and trauma are generally limited to watching the evening news or occasional documentaries. Given this background, it is unlikely that such teachers are prepared to respond to the specialized needs of refugee children during the most vulnerable period of those children's lives. This article alerts teachers and administrators to this problem so that they might be more likely to respond to the special needs of refugee children who arrive in their schools.",

Even though individual prevalence rates vary by state, published prevalence rate estimates are approximately one out of 150 children, making ASD the most common development disability diagnosed in children. The issue of ethnic disproportionality in children with ASD has important implications for diagnosis and provision of intervention since prognosis for children with ASD improves with early identification. However, previous investigations of ethnicity and ASD have indicated that parents from different cultures have varying points of view regarding ASD symptomology, often leading to a later diagnosis. Given contradictory evidence regarding ethnic representation among individuals with ASD, and the recognition that ethnicity may have an influence on rate of identification as well as subsequent special education placement, this study investigated the characteristics of a sample of children with ASD in Georgia, the classrooms within which they are placed, and the demographics of their teachers. Ethnicity of the child and teacher as well as educational setting were specific variables under investigation. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Research on Hmong-Americans started emerging in the late 1980s and continues to flourish to the present. Topics studied range from family dynamics and cultural transitions to student achievement and challenges. Little research has been conducted specifically on Hmong college students. More extensive and comprehensive research on the Hmong student experiences has been done at the pre-k-12 level. In the early 1980s, Hmong students began to enter the University of Wisconsin (UW) System. Statistics from the UW Office of Educational Policy and Analysis (2007) showed 8,316 Southeast Asian students attending the 13 four-year UW campuses, with 46 percent (3,773) degree completions from 1989-1999. Since the UW System does not break down the Asian/Southeast Asian categories by ethnicity, data on the number of Hmong students attending and graduating is unavailable. In conducting this research and constructing a theory about Hmong college students' matriculation, retention, and graduation from college, the author has examined key life experiences of 18 Hmong graduates from the UW System. Based on the evidence from in-depth interviews, participants identified five clusters of key life experiences. These clusters include: (1) Supportive family environment; (2) Social and academic support in a formal education environment; (3) Life lessons: embracing hardships and challenges; (4) Vision and drive for success that includes a college education; and (5) Financial support.",

In all of this, they set out to gather some answers to the following questions: What if anything are the Presidential Libraries doing for education? Is the information being disseminated through the Libraries appropriately multicultural in its perspective, or is it more narrow and biased? What can be done to enhance the educational programs of Presidential Libraries so that they are &quot;more accountable to the diverse public&quot; and &quot;a fair equitable message about the Presidents of the United States&quot; is sent out to students young and old?

        "description":"Young people have the potential to be creative and skilled storytellers, actors, and writers. They also can become profoundly insightful about the way diversity affects themselves and others, as well as actively challenge bias. \"Act It Out\" encourages these potentials in students. Augmenting the writing program that many teachers already use, it enables students to write about, act out and learn from experiences of discrimination in their lives. By collectively acting out and discussing their \"bias stories,\" students improve their writing by generating more detail to use in revising their work. At the same time, they expand their understanding of discrimination and responses to it. This article describes the genesis of \"Act It Out,\" the steps in the process through the voices of teacher Karen Cathers and her third grade students, and approaches to raising awareness about diversity and anti-bias actions, useful for elementary and secondary students alike.

        "description":"The &quot;Education for Democracy Act,&quot; authorized by the United States Congress, provides funding through the U.S. Department of Education to support programs designed to assist educators in creating and implementing civic education programs both at home and abroad. One such program is Civitas: An International Civic Education Exchange Program. Much of the work undertaken by Civitas is conducted through the various partnerships that exist between and among some 30 U.S. states and 26 new and emerging democracies. One such partnership is the Florida-Texas-Mississippi-Hungary-Romania partnership. Established in 1995, the partnership has provided cross-cultural exchange opportunities for students, teachers, university faculty, civic leaders, and elected officials from each of the five partner countries and states. Teaching effectively for and about democratic citizenship is demanding, and educators must be energetic and imaginative in their approach to teaching about it. A recent example of the partnership's efforts to meet this demand and enhance civic education around the world is the staging of an annual democracy camp. The camp provided a weeklong opportunity for the educators to explore, discuss, and debate issues related to teaching for and about democratic citizenship. The international design of the camp afforded the participants a unique experience to examine and reflect upon the combined challenges for teaching for and about democratic citizenship in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Pre and post surveys were conducted during the camp to determine differences in views within and among the groups. The findings of the survey research provided evidence that the participants changed their definitions of democratic citizenship to more global definitions after their week-long cross-cultural interactions. The findings of the study also indicated that as a result of their experiences during the camp, the educators further affirmed their commitment to the importance of teaching for and about citizenship in a democratic society. Additionally, they became more inclined to teach the concept of democratic citizenship in explicit, rather than implicit, terms. (Contains 2 tables, 3 graphs and 8 notes.)",

The HSI project materials provide streamlined and aesthetically engaging Web-based historical investigation exercises. Each case exercise engages students in a historical investigation using rich and varied historical primary sources scaffolded by document-study prompts and activities requiring specific analytical skills and processes. The HSI project, originally developed in 2001 by the principal investigators of this study, has undergone numerous revisions in efforts to extend topical coverage and more explicitly align online materials with state content standards for history. In addition, revisions focused on matching the chronological sequence of cases to a sequence of historical thinking skills, and, finally, on ensuring that the technical aspects and functionality of the program more easily supported teacher and student use of each investigation. In this study, the authors examine the historical evidentiary reasoning of fifth-grade students following HSI-based instruction. In particular, they wanted to know if discrete, short-term exposure to the HSI materials and activities strengthened the development of historical thinking such as historical causality and perspective.

        "description":"Harold O. Rugg was one of a small group of leaders of the Progressive Education Movement centered at Teachers College, Columbia University, and a leader among the Social Frontier group that emerged in the 1930s to argue that schools should play a stronger role in helping to reconstruct the society. He was the author of an innovative and best selling series of social studies textbooks which ultimately came under attack from &quot;patriotic&quot; and business groups in the prelude to the United States involvement in World War II. The story of his rise and fall encapsulates a significant and central story in the history of American education. The Rugg story reveals a great deal about the direction of schooling in American life, the many alternative roads not taken, and possibilities for the future. This article focuses primarily on the examination and discussion of Rugg's social studies ideas. Revisiting Rugg's vision will underline several of the main themes of his work and highlight the fact that Rugg was instrumental, a seminal thinker in the world of social studies theory and practice. A full understanding requires a brief examination of the origins of his ideas, his developing theory, his critique of the standard practices in schools, the key principles and explicit rationale under-girding his social science program, and the controversy he inspired.

        "description":"Recent research indicates that social studies is being de-emphasized in the elementary school, particularly in favor of greater attention to reading. Historically, there is evidence that social studies has not been a strong component of the curriculum in elementary classrooms although it often appears in state and local courses of study. In the early grades (K-3) the traditional focus has been on teaching social studies through units on the self, family, and community workers. These topics may be supported by the use of a textbook or by children's fiction. A specific social studies time frequently is found in the upper grades during which the social studies textbook traditionally serves as the major resource in the curriculum. Instructional strategies such as whole group or individual reading occur and sometimes are supported by having students fill out study guides and/or answer questions at the end of the chapter in preparation for an eventual unit or grading period examination. These traditional formats are widespread but variation exists. Some schools and teachers implement curricula and instructional strategies that are nontraditional and constructivist, as reported in manuscripts on practice published in journals such as &quot;Social Studies Research and Practice,&quot; &quot;Social Studies and the Young Learner,&quot; &quot;The Social Studies,&quot; and &quot;Social Education.&quot; Although such publications indicate that nontraditional teaching of social studies occurs along with the more common traditional forms, the concern in recent years has been with whether any form of social studies education is found at the elementary school level. This article reports a study which used teacher candidates' journals as a source of data to explore what was happening in a sample of elementary social studies classrooms, whether de-emphasis of social studies was occurring, and what effects were seen in classroom curriculum and instruction when a de-emphasis was occurring.

Parabolic extrusions are used as reflectors behind fluorescent tubes and solar heated water pipes. Parabolic reflectors are used to build solar ovens, searchlights and radio telescopes. This article presents two work sheets: the first is designed for use with \"Cabri Geometry\" to study the parabola as a conic section and the second presents a similar construction for a circular paraboloid using \"Cabri 3D.\" Both models show clearly that the parabolic locus will reflect incoming rays, that are parallel to the line of symmetry, back through the focus. This article also illustrates a use of the two \"Cabri\" products to study a 2D object before considering its 3D equivalent. \"Cabri 3D V2\" now allows one to insert measurements, equations and coordinates.

        "description":"Proportional thinking is the mathematical basis of a wide range of topics in the middle-school mathematics curriculum. While the concept is obvious in the traditionally-named ratio and proportion sections, proportional thinking is also the key to such diverse topics as rate, gradient of a linear function, similarity, trigonometry and percentage, to name but a few. The separation of topics and the lack of focus on the underlying structures of concepts are key problems in the presentation of mathematics to students. In his \"Principles for the Design of Teaching\", Alan Bell (1993) discussed the idea of \"structure and context\". This principle highlights the need to help students to see that the same mathematical structures can occur in different contexts. If the structure is recognized in a new context, then solution methods similar to those used previously can be applied to the new context. In this article, the authors first outline ways of working in proportional situations and then demonstrate how similar solution methods for problems based on proportion can be adopted in a range of contexts. The authors argue that \"proportion\" is not really a topic in its own right, but rather the concept underlying a wide range of topics.",

        "description":"This author was surprised to read a short article in &quot;The Mercury&quot; newspaper in Hobart about blue-eyed people being more intelligent and brown-eyed people having faster reaction times. Such an article invites immediate scepticism from the statistically literate. The lack of data in the article should lead the interested reader to a search for further information, most likely through an Internet search. Although the first claim might be considered too contentious for investigation in the classroom, the second one about brown eyes and reaction times seems quite harmless and could provide considerable motivation for data collection and analysis to confirm or refute the claim. This article progresses through the steps that could be followed in a middle school classroom to explore the question and develop critical statistical reasoning skills. Students should first consider their initial reaction to the claims in the article and what questions they would like to have answered before accepting the claims. Second, students should undertake as much research on the topic as possible, probably through the Internet. Next students have the opportunity to collect data from their own class and see what their sample suggests about the claim. Finally students can collect larger random samples, such as from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) &quot;CensusAtSchool&quot; website to check out the eye colour and reaction time claim. All of these steps should then contribute to a report that supplies evidence for and/or against the claim and reaches a tentative conclusion about its validity.

This article is the first in a series of two papers that attempts to address such an idea.

        "description":"The key to understanding the development of student misconceptions is to ask students to explain their thinking. Time constraints of classroom teaching make it difficult to consult with each and every individual student about their thought processes. However, when a particular error keeps surfacing, simply marking the response as incorrect will not assist the student. A two-minute conversation can help a student's mathematical understanding. In this article, the author describes a misconception about decimal place value she identified from the examination response of a Year 7 student. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Throughout much of the world, boys continue to outscore girls on standardized mathematics tests. For example, in most of the 57 countries that participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006, boys' performance was significantly higher than girls on the mathematics scale. This fact alone can harm girls' opportunities for competitive scholarships and entry into top colleges, attitudes toward the subject matter and themselves, and participation in mathematics-oriented occupations. Intervention programs are equitable measures for addressing the needs of special populations. They can have successful results in bolstering the knowledge, dispositions, and participation of underrepresented groups in domains in which they are marginalized. In this article, the author describes a mathematics and technology intervention program for middle-grades girls. This description of the Northern Nevada Girls' Math and Technology Camp in the United States provides ideas for conducting other effective out-of-school programs. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Analyses were conducted to explore variation in subjective experience in relation to the contexts in which homework was completed, and in relation to academic and social-emotional outcomes. Students' cognitive, affective, and motivational states showed significant variations depending on who they were with when they were doing homework, as well as whether homework was their primary or secondary activity. Variations in the quality of homework experience were, in turn, significantly associated with several outcomes, such as self-esteem, future expectations, and school grades. Findings are discussed in terms of contributions to the homework literature by addressing the much needed link between homework and students' cognitive, affective, and motivational states.

As the number of Asian students with disabilities continues to increase, very little research has focused on how collaborative partnerships can be developed between schools and their families. The purpose of this study was to examine the expectations of 12 Chinese families of children with disabilities towards American schools. One-on-one interviews were used in the study. Results suggested that the participants had five expectations from American schools: (1) accessibility of quality interpreters, (2) cultural sensitivity among professionals, (3) advocacy, (4) home-school communication, and (5) parent education.

Mainland Chinese fathers represent one immigrant group that has had to successfully learn to navigate various challenges while interacting with their children and the American K-12 educational system. This case study explores the issue of fathers and their children through interviews with five men from Mainland China. The article first highlights the most common concerns expressed by Chinese families toward American schools and details how the fathers in this study developed specific strategies to address similar worries. The findings then focus on the concept of parental involvement in children's education through the fathers' perspective and how it might diverge from a more traditional view of involvement held by some educators. Implications for strengthening cross-cultural awareness between families and schools are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 5 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Guided by both Coleman and Bourdieu's theories on social capital, I interviewed Chinese immigrant parents to understand their experiences in weaving social connections with the school and teachers to benefit their children's education. This study confirms Coleman's argument that human capital in parents will not transfer to the children automatically. The intergenerational transmission process is interrupted because the parents, although well educated, are not familiar with norms and practices in the new education system. In sharp contrast to parents in China, who aggressively seek and create opportunities to connect with teachers, immigrant Chinese parents adopt a passive role in initiating contacts with school and teachers. Factors contributing to the lower parental commitment to networking include time, jobs, language, and cultural barriers. However, the deeper reason lies in the change of people's mindsets when they experience a dramatic shift in the surrounding social structures. The informant parents view American schools as egalitarian and competition free and, therefore, attribute to parent-teacher relationships less instrumental value in their children's success than they would in China. American education professionals would be surprised by these parents' naivety and idealization of American schools. Nonetheless, it would be simplistic to conclude that the lack of parental involvement is due to external restrictions or immigrant parents' misunderstanding of the current U.S. society.",

This study explores outreach methods, desired services, and benefits of participation from the perspective of 113 low-income, urban, predominantly Latino, community school consumers. A multi-pronged community outreach approach which emphasizes personal relationships is  likely to be most effective. Consumers participated in diverse programs, but their first priorities were programs that would benefit their children's learning and their home environment. Consumers reported positive changes in their children, themselves, their collaboration with the school, and, to some extent, in their community as a result of their involvement. The findings suggest that the successful engagement of urban parents and community residents on school campuses requires diverse outreach strategies. A wide variety of learning opportunities should also prove beneficial to children, families, and schools. Implications for practice are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Retaining students is a key factor in an institution's maintenance of its stability and reputation, and it helps students and society to avoid the all-too-common consequences associated with a lack of education, including underemployment and poverty. Remedial and developmental education offerings are an important response to student attrition. Remedial and developmental education is one response to attrition recently adopted within the School of Language and Liberal Arts at Fanshawe College, in the form of a Writing Program. An examination of the literature on retention strategy, best practices, and remediation's place within the area of retention hold promise to guide future action in this area. This article presents the author's conclusions that focus on remedial/developmental education within the framework of retention efforts. These conclusions differ from those of the remediation critics. In addition to surveying the literature linking remediation and retention, the author also examines the theoretical framework behind much of the research on retention and catalogues some of the best principles and practices documented in these interrelated fields.",

        "description":"Constructions of power are latent everywhere; the nature of the concept of power, as it finds its expression in and through literature, is presented in all its forms, notably power's implications and its consequences. Far too many college students approach literature anemically and conclude that reading literature and writing about it are meaningless exercises that hold little practical value, particularly as they pertain to the social contributions they can make to the world around them. Arguably lulled into this state of indifference by traditional teaching methods, teachers can stem the tide by altering how one approaches literature, an approach that coincides with a specific pedagogy. Paulo Freire's teaching approach to impoverished Brazilian citizens, for instance, made social change its aim. These citizens, who lacked access to literacy education, found themselves increasingly out of power and, as a consequence, felt powerless to change their world. Students, when encouraged to see political constructs within the confines of literary texts that they can dissect and analyze, can then turn to their immediate surroundings for change that they too can endeavour to achieve. Naive utopianism aside, change is endlessly desirable, but often impractical. Critical awareness of political and structural impositions, such as those expressed in Gothic literature, unravel those systems of power that are assumed to be normal, and hence functionally true. The empowerment that students experience from this precise literary analysis can then be used to procure a greater sense of awareness of the innumerable implications of power at work in their lives, and the lives of those around them.

Third-year students at a small, mainly undergraduate, Canadian university showed a wide variety of approaches when tested with Kolb's (1976) Learning Style Inventory. Students in the Humanities were the most varied, and those in Health Science and Science tended to the practical Active Experimentation (learning by doing) approach. Those in the Sciences often used the data analysis based Strategy of Convergers, especially males, who lived up to their stereotype and seldom used the affective approach of Divergers. Professors' course outlines de-emphasized the Concrete Experience (sensing/feeling) Style and affective based Diverger Strategy far more than students, and often asked for the bottom-up objective evaluation of Reflective Observation, as exemplified by quantitative tests. For both genders and across four Faculties, the diversity of student approaches to learning was the most striking finding. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

The author found the article stimulating because so little has been written on the topic of music teacher education at the graduate level. It appears that graduate music education in institutions of higher learning is locked into traditions that online programs are ready to challenge. In this essay the author considers this challenge from a traditionalist viewpoint to determine if an online approach is a feasible option to music education at the doctorate and master's levels. Specifically, the author seeks to determine what the nature of graduate degrees in music education are or should be, if online and traditional curricula are in agreement in fulfilling these requirements, and if some variant or compromise is appropriate in developing music teachers at the graduate level.",

        "description":"Music education organizations achieved a huge success in Texas several years ago when legislation declared music as a part of the core curriculum. Similarly, more recent national education legislation like No Child Left Behind has recognized music as a core curricular subject. Since that time, little has been done to assess music students to ensure a set of basic skills and knowledge is being achieved. While national and state music standards exist, these standards, in many cases, are not mandatory and merely serve as a guide or recommendations for music educators to follow. Other core subjects endure severe oversight and rigorous testing at the state and local levels to measure whether or not students are attaining minimum standards. Some music educators are pushing for national testing of music students to demonstrate that music has an academically measurable component. Yet other music educators are fearful that assessment of music education will have the same negative effects that other core subject high-stakes testing has had on schools. This article serves to discuss the current debate on national music assessment and to argue that music education's place in the core curriculum demands an increase in oversight through standardized music assessment of students in music education classes.

An instrument created for evaluation and assessment was constructed to yield twelve scale areas of needs and concerns. Comparison of responses provided results showing areas of congruence and disagreement among music performance teachers and supervisors. Teachers placed teaching materials and resources as a high concern while supervisors expressed greatest concern in the area of music-related competence. In terms of assistance, non-tenured music teachers felt that mentor teachers, music conferences, and discussions with experienced colleagues provided the greatest support during their early years of teaching. This study provides a means by which music supervisors could better assist their non-tenured music performance teachers. Findings from this research should be of assistance in the development of mentoring and professional development programs. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

We found that AIAN students had among the lowest exposure to teachers who reported they were knowledgeable about standards, who participated in standards-based professional development, and who practiced standards-based instruction. In addition, AIAN students were less likely than African American and Latino students to report that they experienced standards-based classroom activities.

But such reasoning is inadequate. The answers are not to be found in the hazy otherness of corporate and political structures, which people are all-too-quick to imbue with qualities that they themselves possess and daily practice: greed, materialism, rampant, and blind consumerism. Most people have never really realized that they themselves were responsible for the actions of government and multinationals. In this article, the author discusses how men's eternal search for happiness and possession has caused damage to our ecology. He states that people must stop buying the way they do, stop living the way they do, and stop demanding the things they do, which are produced at great natural and social costs. It is only when one learns to abandon the equation of happiness with consumption and possession of material goods, he contends, that the rightful path of living in harmony with nature will be achieved.

        "description":"The main objective of this study was to gauge preparedness in math with achievement in first semester math for the fall 2005 intake of Manufacturing Sciences Division post-secondary program students. The data used to measure this level of preparedness was gleaned from students' high school Grade 12 (new and old curriculum) or Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) math marks and the results of a diagnostic test given to students during the first week of the fall semester. In addition, success in first semester math was analyzed in relation to the specific high school math course taken. The findings of this study demonstrate that high school math marks alone are a poor predictor of performance in first semester math. In addition, students emerging from the new curriculum Grade 12 Math for College and Apprenticeship (MAP4C) failed first semester math at nearly three times the rate of all other course groupings combined. Conversely, students emerging from any of the university stream high school Grade 12 math courses or the college stream Math for Technology (MCT4C) were best prepared for college math in Manufacturing Sciences Division post-secondary programs. The diagnostic test marks were not a reliable predictor of individual student success (or &quot;at risk&quot; behaviour) in first semester. However, students falling into the fortieth percentile or lower groupings on the test showed a marked increase in tendency towards &quot;at risk&quot; behaviour or failure. Technician stream students as a group exhibited a failure rate that was double that of the technology stream group. It is recommended that the administration of the diagnostic test be continued by the college and that tracking of these indicators be carried out annually in order to monitor these trends. In addition, it is recommended that students at the high school level are made aware of the need to take Grade 12 Math for Technology (MCT4C) as a minimum preparation for success in Manufacturing Sciences Division math courses. The questions raised in this study concerning differences in performance according to gender and stream warrant further study. (Contains 3 tables and 10 figures.)",

The authors propose to first explain why the conception of citizenship resting on the deliberative theory of law and of democracy reveals itself to be superior to predominant conceptions. They then attempt to define, using grand strokes, the normative framework of civic education which, within pedagogical practice, would conform best to the conventions of the conception of citizenship being asserted in this article. Their task will consist in the end of expressing as much the implications as the consequences of the deliberative conception in regard to the training of citizens. They intend to give some direction to the mandate of Quebec's citizenship education project, as well as to define the idea of dialogical competence that teachers will have to possess in order to confront the underlying issues at stake in educating future citizens.

        "author":["Magistro, Elena"],
        "description":"This paper presents some considerations on teaching L2 rhetorical conventions in university-level multilingual classrooms. It is claimed that if L2 students need to acquire versatile writing skills in L2 to be given a voice in the discourse milieu of the receiving society, they should also have the right to preserve their L1 cultural perspective. Drawing from Mao's notion of \"creative heteroglossia\" (2004), emphasis is placed on the positive transfer of knowledge and skills from L1 to L2, and on the creation of a rhetorical space shaping a \"new culturally combined persona\" (p. 53). The concepts of linguistic, academic and cultural literacy are briefly discussed, and reference is made to the institutional and pedagogical challenges of creating such new rhetorical space for L2 students.",

        "description":"This paper analyses summer teaching and learning from an undergraduate business student's perception. The survey reported here was designed to investigate how undergraduate business students perceived a marketing subject--Introduction to Marketing-- during summer school. At the same time, this research investigates the duration of study, the environment, student motivation and the contribution of these factors to the effectiveness of learning. The study emphasised greater instructor/student interaction (only 49 students per lecture and not more than 25 students per tutorial), prompted peer assisted learning, and represented an integral component in the implementation of a two-way communication approach to teaching and learning the subject. This inductive primary survey study took a triangulation research approach with a response rate of 86%. The positivism and interpretative evidence from the questionnaire survey demonstrated that the majority of students: (1) demonstrated that there is no difference in performance whether students study during summer school or during normal school terms; that is to say that this aspect of the learning environment is not significant to the effectiveness of learning and; (2) preferred to enrol in summer school (intensive learning mode of 5 weeks) rather than normal school length (12 weeks); and (3) found the subject they studied in summer school (intensive learning mode of 5 weeks) was more enjoyable (motivational) than any other business course in their previous studies, indicating that the process of learning is significant.

Work identity that reflects a determination on the employee's part to commit to the values of the work group is vocational identity, which is important for the employee's well being as an adult. According to a European research group, how workers accept or reject challenge and change will determine their success in their jobs and affect productivity. The group's recommendations are relevant to community colleges in their function as gatekeepers to employment readiness; as is a consideration of how craft identity compares with the form of vocational identity that the research group has determined to be crucial to global competitiveness for the western world.",

Teachers are the dinosaurs who do not understand how to maneuver in this brave new world of technology, while students are the evolved birds who will live on into the future. Part of this assumption is correct; students do embrace and use technology in ways that previous generations did not. However, while they use these technological tools almost constantly, they have not truly learned how to actually operate them, nor have many of them actually used other basic technology, such as word processing software. In this article, the author discusses the failure of students to learn how to use these technology tools for academic purposes. If teachers continue to assume that students already know how to use technology and do not truly teach them to engage it, then there is a chance that students will leave college with the same narrow worldview with which they entered.",

Movements such as TQM (Total Quality Management), class size reduction (CSR), school leadership, parental involvement, and multicultural curriculum have not directly addressed the power or influence of the individual classroom teacher. However, research shows that individual teachers can profoundly impact the academic achievement of their students. Teacher educators, however, often find it difficult to agree upon a common definition of teacher quality. To develop exemplary teachers, Claremont Graduate University's Teacher Education Internship Program (CGU's TEIP) addresses the techniques, attitudes, skills, and experiences necessary to become a quality teacher by embracing the ideals of three key concepts: Accountability, Collaboration, and Social Justice. This article describes how the CGU program has committed to preparing teachers able and eager to break the cycles of academic failure that have traditionally plagued poor, non-white, and linguistically-diverse students.",

Unless an institution explicitly develops and articulates its values, vision, and mission, and until it is clearly understood by stakeholders, and widely supported, then the institution itself is at the mercy of everyday events. However, an institution's governing body and its leaders are required to go beyond short-term or daily events.

        "description":"This paper reports and discusses the results of a study that was undertaken to determine factors that influence choices that secondary school students make between enrolling in community college or university, and in particular whether or not those choices are affected by the degree of &quot;articulation&quot; within a public system of post-secondary education. There are several studies that have emerged recently in the United States and Canada that examine factors that influence the choice of university and four-year college. There are a few studies that examine the choice of community and two-year college. None, however, either in Canada or in the United States, has sought to examine &quot;college choice&quot; comparatively among students who apply to baccalaureate and (four-year colleges and universities) and sub-baccalaureate (community colleges) programs. This study examines college choice on the basis of two series of longitudinal surveys conducted in the province of Ontario since the late 1980s, and on a series of surveys and interviews of students, parents and guidance counselors in six secondary schools, each with a different student population, since 2004. The third study--called the &quot;college choice&quot; project--tracked secondary school students as they made decisions about attending college or university, and as they finally selected the institutions that they would attend. The study concludes that greater conventional articulation will not significantly affect rates of transfer, that for most students plans to transfer develop after they enter college and are not a major factor in their initial &quot;choice,&quot; that the rate of transfer is highly dependent on the corresponding arrays of programs at colleges and universities, and that articulation might better be thought of as a subset of other basic forms of inter-institutional cooperation.",

Research suggest the affective domain is the gateway to learning, yet the cognitive and psychomotor domains take precedence. Some complexities of the affective domain are neglected. They further suggest that many college course outlines and lesson plans with affective outcomes fail to indicate how these will be taught and evaluated. They offer reasons, both historical and current, for this shunning of the affective domain, and indicate ways in which college faculty may begin to pay more attention to the affective domain of curriculum design implementation and evaluation.",

        "author":["Tavares, Hannah M."],
        "description":"In this essay, the author explores questions about the way identity and difference, as developed in the educational practices of multicultural teacher education and cultural diversity, proceed in directions that leave several fundamental assumptions unexplored. First among them is the assumption that pedagogic practice can and should be aligned with students' learning preferences, thereby leaving unquestioned the norms and competencies that organize school practices and educational goals in the classroom. Second, the assumption that multicultural education and cultural diversity are licensed or authorized discourses that provide the right inventory of cultural norms of different cultural groups leaves unchallenged the social relations and political and historical forces that sustain distinctions and differences. Finally, when cultural diversity and multicultural education are reduced to a &quot;unity-in-diversity&quot; discourse, it has the unfortunate effect of rendering difference and conflict inconsequential. These questions are posed in an effort to reinvigorate the increasingly restricted conception of diversity in education and to call attention to what is politically and ethically substantial about diversity: the issue of justice. The author's provocation is not a bid to reinforce the conceptual dichotomy that has taken over as the key tension in diversity; it is, rather, to solicit thought in a direction that takes into account the social, political, and economic transformations in the present time, and the systemic historic problems underlying racial disparities in education.

Ninety students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups (i.e., nutritional, exercise, relaxation, or cognitive behavioural therapy). There were approximately 18 students per experimental group and 18 participants in the control group. All five groups completed four pre-assessment instruments (i.e., the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Demographics and Health Habits Survey). Upon completing their respective 6-week intervention programs, 70% of the participants returned to complete the post-assessment. ANOVA results indicated that the nutrition education and relaxation response modalities produced the greatest improvement. Overall, all the mind/body training methods proved to assist college students in their perceived levels of stress. We conclude with a number of recommendations for future research.

        "description":"In response to the rapid advances in information technology, greater pressure has been placed on academic libraries and teaching faculty to incorporate information literacy skills into the curriculum. Although these skills have been taught for decades, the principles and concepts of information literacy have taken on new urgency as they are increasingly seen as essential &quot;new economy&quot; skills. This article argues that to reach the goals of creating a generation of truly information-literate students, academic librarians need to assume the leadership role. With their multidisciplinary understanding of technology and information management, in addition to their deep understanding of the issues and commitment to the cause, librarians are at a distinct advantage. A discussion of best practices, followed by three case studies of institutions where libraries have developed very different and innovative approaches to reach faculty and students, and an evaluation of the literature on information literacy will demonstrate why libraries are uniquely situated to ensuring that the critical thinking and evaluative skills of students are developed and become an integral part of their learning environment.",

However, there has been a trend that has seen just over half of all high school students in Ontario going on to post-secondary education. While some people have barely noticed this statistic, the OECD has released a projection that has many in business, education and government paying attention: more than 70% of all jobs in 2012 will require post-secondary education. Certainly, jobs that have decent pay, security and flexibility will demand post-secondary education. Post-secondary education used to translate directly into a profession or a specific career field. It was accepted that by taking a program at a college or university, a person would enter a specific sector of the economy: manufacturing, hospitality, health, education, engineering, technology, law. Today, this is not the case for most students: The river landscape has altered and what was once a stream with two banks is now a deep canyon with impressive and imposing mountainous walls. However, this erosion--caused by the combined effect of international competition, increased levels of education, and highly-skilled workers immigrating--did not occur in the past five years. This shift in the landscape has taken the last fifty years and economists, businesses and educators have all watched the erosion take place.

This study is a tangential section of a larger study on the influence of peer support groups in East Texas (Zascavage, Schroeder &amp; Armstrong, in print 2008). Our primary goal was to refine our special education recruitment focus using statistical determinants on peer support activities for students with disabilities in East Texas based on the demographic characteristics of the school districts most likely to have peer support. Based on the field literature position that peer support groups would be effective recruitment pools, the analysis investigated variables in a given school district with the purpose of determining which of these variables would influence future recruitment drives and funding allocations. Since teacher shortages are often location specific and requires innovative local solutions (Allen, 2005), what works one place may not be effective in another location. However, peer support groups are present or absent throughout the US, lending this study very likely to reflect the situations in many school districts. At this time, there are very few adequate empirical studies on the effectiveness of special education recruitment (Allen, 2005). Our study presents one possible cost effective, pro-active premise to impact local special education recruitment, the local determination of the presence or absence of peer support groups for students with disabilities.

Two hundred and eleven (8%) children enrolled in ECSE Programs were identified as having a psychiatric disorder with 84% of those identified receiving one or more psychiatric medications for their diagnose(s). Overall, teachers tended to agree that psychotropic medication helped students maintain control of their behavior. The more strongly teachers believed that medication aided in classroom control, the more likely children in their classes were receiving psychiatric medication. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Because most educators have little or no training in family involvement and pre-service teacher training in this area is at best limited, the purpose in this effort was to increase the opportunities for pre-service teachers to interact with special educators and parents of special needs children through an interview assignment designed to help them gain a fuller understanding of each of their roles and the need for partnerships. This investigation summarizes the class discussions from 90 undergraduate students over a three-year period to highlight their reflections which point out the need for teacher-parent collaboration.",

Students were asked to listen to and visually track sixth to seventh grade level text that was read to them using the Kurzweil 3000 text-reader software. They were then asked to answer seven multiple-choice inferential questions and to summarize the passage in a retell. Data were analyzed using a multiple-baseline, single subject design and a repeated-measures ANOVA. Results suggest that students with RD can have comprehension difficulties that are not resolved by text-reader software, and that self-questioning strategies significantly improve their ability to comprehend text supported by text-reader software. Results, however, varied between students. Implications for the use of text-reader software and comprehension instruction are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

The instrument was distributed to elementary, middle, and high school special education teachers in a large urban school district. Teachers trained by the school district in the FBA process were compared to untrained teachers. The study incorporated a post-test only design, with data analyzed using a factorial ANOVA. Those teachers who were trained in the district FBA program answered multiple-choice questions related to the function of problem behavior more accurately than those who did not receive training. There was no significant difference between trained and untrained teachers on their ability to make recommendations to promote behavior change.

The selected activity was making a basket form from clay and was carried out with two adults in the clay studio at a private center for special education for individuals with autism. A multiple probe design was used and the dependent variable was the skill to make a basket from clay. The independent variable was to teach the skill with the most to least prompting procedure. The research results showed that the method was effective not only in teaching to make a basket from clay, but also in maintaining the learned skill. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

One essential requisite skill for success on all of these assessments is reading. Because the classroom is typically made up of students who exhibit a broad range of performance levels, it can be quite challenging for even the most experienced classroom teacher to successfully teach the content to all students. Research has revealed that when explicit, teacher-directed strategy instruction is used students make significant gains in their reading skills. This paper examines the challenges that content area teachers face in addressing the academic needs of all learners and provides some specific strategies that have been proven effective in the inclusive classroom.",

        "description":"The aim of training children with hearing impairment in the auditory oral approach is to develop good speaking abilities. However, children with profound hearing-impairment show a wide range of spoken language abilities, some having highly intelligible speech while others have unintelligible speech. This is due to errors in speech  production. While children with hearing-impairment speak, segmental and prosodic errors may occur, so the intelligibility of their speech is affected. Because of  these segmental and prosodic errors, the speaking rate of hearing-impaired children can be slower than that of hearing children. The aim of the current study is to find out if there are differences between children with and without hearing impairment in terms of speech and reading rates. Relationships between speech rate, intelligibility, hearing loss, and aided thresholds of children with hearing-impairment are investigated as well. Hearing impaired children's speech and reading rates along with their speech and reading intelligiblity scores are compared. The speech samples of 25 high school students' with profound hearing impairment pre-lingually were compared with those of 15 students without hearing impairment. Data on the rate of speech were collected by means of a laryngograph. Speech intelligibility was rated by a jury of naive listeners who were asked to write down what they heard after listening to recorded statements from the speech samples. Findings revealed a difference between speech and reading rates of hearing and hearing impaired children, and a relationship between speech rate and speech intelligibility. No relationship was found between hearing loss and speech rate, hearing loss and intelligibility, aided thresholds and speech rate, and aided thresholds and intelligibility. The difference between hearing-impaired children's speech and reading rate was not statistically significant while the  difference between their speech and reading intelligibility was significant. Implications for the education of children with  hearing impairment are presented. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The quality of attachment relationship between the child and parent/primary caregiver may have an effect on the child and future relationships and social success (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998). When a child fails to bond with a caring adult, attachment becomes disordered and children may not be able to bond appropriately or at all with other people. This inability to relate and connect with others may disrupt or arrest not only children's social development, but also their overall development. The purpose of this review is to synthesize information and research on characteristics, diagnosis, and interventions currently in practice in working with young children with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD).

Three levels of requirements are discussed. First, the non-functional requirements that deal with the technical conditions to make learning objects interoperable. Second, some basic use cases (activities) are identified that must be facilitated to enable the technical exchange of learning objects, e.g. searching and adapting the objects. Third, some basic use cases are identified that are required to establish the exchange of learning objects in a community, e.g. policy management, information and training. The implications of this framework are then discussed, including recommendations concerning the identification of reward systems, role changes and evaluation instruments.

Charter schools in general and cyber charter schools in particular are not &quot;revenue neutral&quot; to local school districts. Nationwide, hundreds of millions of dollars allocated for education are being routed into charter schools. As parents opt for cyber schools to augment home-school resources, the funding burden shifts from the family to the taxpayers without input from local districts or residents. Cyber schools' rapidly increasing popularity demands the creation of new standards for educational funding and institutional governance. The recommendations presented in this paper focus on two areas: (1) funding formulas, and (2) empowering local school authorities to operate as management agents who maintain and control cyber school options to benefit their local clientele.",

Undoubtedly, current initiatives in public education favor those who support traditional approaches, yet many critics believe inflexible state tests are restricting teachers' flexibility in employing methods other than teacher-centered direct instruction. President Bush's proposal for extending mandatory testing beyond grade eight into high school and renewed discussions about establishing national curricular standards and tests are threatening to prevent schools and teachers from using progressive education theory and methods. While its easy for progressives to become discouraged, it is still premature to declare the final decline of progressive education in the United States.

Last, the article presents how constructivism as a learning theory can guide the process of learning and teaching in real classroom settings. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Middle school students are naturally curious about their expanding possibilities. This stage of their lives is a time of transition, of figuring out who they are and where they belong in the world. Many students also think that the world they look at through the classroom window is distant and unconnected to the world of chalkboards and pop quizzes they inhabit between the hours of eight and three. Models of middle school education have often included teacher and community expectations developmentally inappropriate for young adolescents; in fact, middle school students were often treated more like smaller versions of high school students. A newer model of the middle school seeks to explore many areas of recreational as well as academic and vocational interest. However, exploration opportunities are limited only to what the school can imagine. In this article, the author talks about interdisciplinary instruction and how this approach makes learning more effective for all students especially adolescents.",

People who want to teach in urban schools need to recognize the reality of the situation they will enter. Beginning teachers must recognize that preventing violence is an integral part of their legitimate work; the more effective they are at empowering youngsters, the less violence they will engender; the less effective they are, the more violence they will cause. Beneath the surface and not very far beneath the surface of all urban teaching is the potential for unleashing uncontrollable violence. Only those who really understand the constant threat and horrific consequences of school violence will be sufficiently on-guard to do the countless things that will prevent it. Violence is already smoldering in the children, and only those teachers who see the deep frustrations and anger children carry into the school building with them will be sufficiently sensitive to avoid setting it off. In this article, the author identifies the characteristics of teachers who are effective in urban school settings. The author refers to these teachers as \"stars\". Star teachers work toward a common goal by various forms of gentle teaching. How star teachers can use this ideology to empower children growing up amidst poverty and violence is discussed.

        "description":"This study investigated how early childhood education (ECE) (PreK-3) preservice teachers' ideas about science education change as a result of implementing an inquiry-based curriculum within an ECE science methods course (ten-week quarter). Fifty-two preservice teachers, including 50 females and 2 males, with 2 members of an ethnic minority group were part of the study. The preservice teachers' knowledge and understanding of how to implement inquiry learning deepened over the ten-week period. The preservice teachers seemed to gain some confidence in implementing inquiry learning. Preservice teachers need to have focused science teaching time with primary students to strengthen and support their confidence, attitudes, and abilities to implement inquiry learning. Also, support for inquiry learning must come from K-12 educators as well as arts and science faculty, as this is where preservice teachers can develop substantive content knowledge within authentic science learning experiences.",

Using the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire (VNOS-B) and interviews, we assessed views of NOS. The Learning Context Questionnaire (LCQ) was used to determine the cognitive levels. Using the Schwartz Values Inventory, we determined cultural values. We analyzed the preservice teachers' views of NOS by searching for patterns in responses to the VNOS-B by Perry position on the LCQ. We used SPSS to find significant correlations between cultural values and associated subscales' cognitive levels. We found that though preservice teachers at all Perry positions held misconceptions about NOS, there were patterns of views by position; those at the position of dualism described their views in terms of one right truth, while those at the multiplicity position described their views in terms of analyzing evidence from many different interpretations.",

        "title":"Becoming an Urban School Middle-Level Science Teacher",
        "author":["Jeanpierre, Bobby"],
        "description":"The purpose of this case study was to document the journey of three novice career change science inductees as they became middle-level science teachers in urban low socioeconomic status (SES) schools and included post-internship employment status data on all nine science teachers who completed the alternative certification program, up to the time of this writing. All teachers participated in a fast track master's alternative certification degree program and received in-depth education coursework and mentoring. Results indicated that support (i.e., administrative, parents, mentors) and teachers' beliefs about their students' capabilities may affect their effectiveness in urban, low SES middle-level science classrooms. Urban middle school science teaching presents a complexity of issues for the novice (beginning) teacher. First, the beginning teacher must learn to orchestrate effective teaching and learning strategies in urban school settings. Urban schools have often been characterized as places that have a number of inequities (Cardenas, 2000; Hoff & McCarty, 1985) and low levels of student interest and motivation to learn (Tobin, 2001). In addition, novice teachers may face challenges in teaching middle school learners. That is, teaching at the middle level can be daunting. The National Middle School Association (NMSA) states that \"teachers should understand the developmental uniqueness of young adolescents and should be as knowledgeable about their students as they are about the subject they teach\" (1995, p. 13). Beginning teachers must also learn how to effectively teach school science. A person who has had success applying academic knowledge, skills, and experiences using mathematics and science in the real world does not necessarily mean that he or she will translate the knowledge and experiences to a successful middle-level teaching career. Shulman (1986) argues that teachers also need \"pedagogical content knowledge,\" which he describes as knowledge that goes beyond understanding of the content to understanding the dimension of the subject matter for teaching. Taken collectively, these challenges may seem almost insurmountable for even veteran middle-level teachers. Improvements in middle school mathematics and science teaching are needed, and getting more qualified teachers into these schools is of the essence. Teachers without teacher preparation courses tend to feel inadequate to teach and are not sufficiently prepared to handle the details and intricacies of diverse student populations, classroom management, and student assessments (Darling-Hammond, Chung, & Frelow, 2002). Ball (2003) succinctly states, \"We cannot afford to keep re-learning that improvement of students' learning depends on skillful teaching, and that skillful teaching depends on capable teachers and what they know and can do\" (p. 1). This article reports case study findings of three career change teachers in a fast-track (one-year) middle-level mathematics and science master's degree program, which provided the education academic coursework and internship experience as they transitioned from the business world to middle-level mathematics and/or science teaching and employment data for all science teachers who completed the program.",

The lessons focused on the dipole nature of magnets and employed a visual representation of a magnet as an arrow for the kindergarten students. This dipole model was used to describe how magnets interact with each other and how they interact with steel objects (i.e., magnetization). Many students adopted this dipole model of magnets and were able to use it to describe how multiple magnets would interact and how magnetized paperclips would interact with magnets and with each other.

While science lab facilities are common to middle and high school, in elementary schools, science is typically taught in the regular classroom. Elementary schools across the nation, however, have devoted financial and other resources to establishing separate laboratory facilities for science. How do these facilities support the delivery models for elementary science instruction and aid in meeting the vision of the reforms? The lack of research in this area should be addressed to enable districts to make informed decisions about whether to allocate funds to establishing separate facilities or equipping regular classrooms for elementary science instruction.",

A set of responses for six of the physical science items targeting force/gravity and physical/chemical change was selected for analysis from 305 respondents. Written explanations were coded into three general categories: (1) correct explanation, (2) incorrect explanation, (3) guess or uninterpretable. The correct response rates for the explanations were compared to the correct response rates that were based on the accompanying true or false answers. The explanations were further analyzed and coded into specific categories that included alternative and naive conceptions. Correct response rates, when analyzed from the true/false or written explanations, were low (less than 60%) for five of the six items. Naive beliefs and/or misconceptions were prevalent for each of these five items, and understanding that students may hold these beliefs prior to instruction may provide teachers with useful information for the purpose of improving instruction.

        "author":["Roane, Henry S."],
        "description":"Examination of responding under various schedule arrangements is a core component of many analyses of operant behavior. Much of the pioneering work in applied behavior analysis was bred from laboratory research involving the exposure of nonhuman subjects to a variety of schedule arrangements. Hodos (1961) described a schedule arrangement in which the requirement to access reinforcement increased on a trial-by-trial basis within the course of a single session. That is, the subject would initially emit a predetermined number of responses before reinforcement delivery (e.g., 20 responses). Following reinforcer delivery, the subsequent response requirement would increase by some increment (e.g., another 10 responses; referred to as a step size) such that in the next trial the subject would be required to complete more responses than in previous trials (e.g., 30 responses before reinforcer delivery, 40 responses before reinforcer delivery). Within-session changes in response requirements in this pattern constitute a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. The primary clinical application of PR schedules involves assessment and quantification of differential reinforcer efficacy, which has sometimes been referred to as reinforcer potency (i.e., the ability of a reinforcer to maintain behavior). There are several methodological details to be considered when developing PR schedules for use in applied settings. Such factors include determining an appropriate algorithm for the progression of schedule requirements (e.g., increasing additively or geometrically), session-termination criteria (e.g., after cessation of responding for a period of time or after a total amount of time has elapsed), the type of target response to use (e.g., a relatively simple or a more complex operant), and the amount of reinforcement delivered throughout the analysis. Each of these variables has been inconsistently manipulated across the existing applied studies.",

Science teacher educators may be disappointed to find, however, that preservice teachers may fail to grasp this model, even after extensive instruction (e.g., Settlage, 2000). Our own preservice teachers often express the belief that teaching multiple activities related to a single concept is redundant. In this manner, they fail to grasp the importance of carefully sequencing learning activities to promote conceptual development. In this paper, we describe an approach in which we use the learning cycle as a model for our own instruction to assist preservice elementary teachers in developing \"conceptual storylines\" through carefully sequenced activities that follow the learning cycle.

It is unknown if similar effects would be obtained under higher schedule requirements. Thus, the current study compared high-preference and low-preference reinforcers under progressively increasing schedule requirements. Results for 3 of the 4 participants indicated that high-preference stimuli maintained responding under higher schedule requirements relative to low-preference stimuli. For 1 participant, high-preference and low-preference stimuli were demonstrated to be equally effective reinforcers under increasing schedule requirements. Implications with respect to rate of performance and response patterns are discussed. (Contains 3 figures.)",

High- and low-preference stimuli were determined based on the results of a paired-stimulus preference assessment and were evaluated in subsequent reinforcer and PR assessments using concurrent and single schedules of presentation. In Experiment 1, results showed that for 2 of 3 participants, stimuli determined to be low-preference functioned as reinforcers when evaluated independent of high-preference stimuli. Further, the results from Experiment 2 showed that low-preference stimuli also functioned as reinforcers under gradually increasing PR requirements. Results suggest that for cases in which a high-preference stimulus is unavailable or impractical, the contingent delivery of relatively less preferred stimuli may maintain appropriate behavior, even as schedule requirements increase.

Three children who engaged in problem behavior that was maintained by social positive reinforcement (attention, access to tangible items) participated. Results indicated that preference for different magnitudes of social reinforcement may predict reinforcer efficacy and that magnitude effects may be mediated by the schedule requirement.

Using definitions from the Video Study, this study re-investigated this &quot;shallow teaching syndrome&quot; by examining the problems on three topics in nine eighth-grade textbooks from four Australian states for procedural complexity, type of solving processes, degree of repetition, proportion of &quot;application&quot; problems and proportion of problems requiring deductive reasoning. Overall, there was broad similarity between the characteristics of problems in the textbooks and in the Australian Video Study lessons. There were, however, considerable differences between textbooks and between topics within textbooks.

Three children ingested ambiguous substances during a baited baseline assessment condition and continued to ingest these substances following group safety training. In situ feedback and response interruption resulted in a decrease in opening ambiguous containers; this decrease was maintained when ambiguous novel containers were presented and when assessments occurred in a novel setting and with a novel experimenter.

This study demonstrated the efficacy of using FT reinforcer delivery to reduce off-task behavior of 2 typically developing third graders using a teacher-selected schedule (FT 4 min). Immediate reductions in off-task behavior were observed for both children. Challenges in identifying the operative mechanism of FT schedules in natural settings are discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)",

The treatment package remained effective even when noncontingent attention was removed, making the procedure easier to implement.

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an effective approach to intervention with precontemplative smokers, yet a substantial number of healthcare practitioners lack training in this approach. Two interactive online tutorials were developed to teach practitioners to deliver brief tobacco cessation interventions grounded in the MI approach. The tutorials emphasized the unique aspects of working with precontemplative smokers, incorporating audio and video examples of best practices, interactive exercises, targeted feedback, and practice opportunities. One hundred and fifty-two healthcare providers-in-training were randomly assigned to use the online tutorials or to read training material that was matched for content. A virtual standardized patient evaluation was given before and after the training. Both groups improved their scores from pre- to posttest; however, the tutorial group scored significantly better than the reading group at posttest. The results of this study demonstrate the promise of interactive online tutorials as an efficient and effective way to deliver clinical education. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Thirty-eight teachers from three intervention schools (schools randomly assigned as intervention group) received intervention prompts: SMS messages, leaflets and posters promoting walking, and a pedometer. Fourteen teachers were from a control school (school randomly assigned as control group). All participants reported pedometer readings and rated their Stage of Change scores before and after intervention. Differences in step counts per minute between groups were examined using ANCOVA adjusted by time duration for step counts. The intervention group had a higher increase in steps-at-work (t = 3.61, P less than 0.001) than the control group and type of commuter affected the increase in steps-at-work for the intervention group (F [subscript 2,34] = 4.95, P less than 0.01, eta[subscript p] [superscript 2] = 0.23).

        "description":"Knowledge about various illnesses and their management is not satisfactory among high school students especially in rural areas in India. Various incorrect practices and myths associated with illnesses and injuries still exit. Training and education about correct management of injuries and illnesses for students is a sound and logical investment. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken among 120 students of ninth class (age group- 14-15 years) from a Government Senior Secondary School at Chandigarh, India. Students were randomly assigned to 2 groups (Group A and B) of 60 each using &quot;blocked randomization process.&quot; Both groups were administered a pretested questionnaire for assessing their baseline knowledge, followed by on-the-spot demonstration the next day for assessing their skills. A training manual on 40 common childhood illnesses and injuries entitled &quot;Swasthya Chalisa&quot; (which means 40 health conditions) prepared with the help of the experts, was distributed to all study students. In addition, group A was also provided with on-the-spot demonstration training session. Post intervention evaluation of the level of knowledge and practices of both groups was done 15 days after the intervention. A scoring system was devised to quantify the knowledge and practices of students on first aid. Informed consent of the principal, teachers, students and their parents was taken before conduction of study. It was observed that students lacked knowledge in subject areas like management of uncommonly encountered illnesses in childhood (viz. T.B, Backache etc), emergency conditions (viz. CO gas poisoning, respiratory tract obstruction, epilepsy, unconsciousness, burns, food poisoning) and some routine day-to-day conditions which are not taken seriously for treatment (acne, epistaxis, food-poisoning, and constipation). The mean group scores for both groups (Group A and B) on combined knowledge and skills were higher at post-intervention than pre-intervention. Increase in level of knowledge from pretest to posttest was greater for Group B than for Group A by 33%. Also, increase in level of skills from pretest to posttest was also greater for Group B than for Group A by 135%. Overall knowledge and skills increased to 43% in group B as compared to A. It is concluded that there is a need for strengthening the knowledge of students regarding common illnesses and injuries by incorporating these training and education as a part of school curriculum.

Knowing that schools are accountable for the achievement results of these students, teachers increasingly seek help. This article describes a professional development project designed to introduce K-12 teachers to effective strategies for enhancing the learning of English language learners and shares the results that occurred as the teachers placed greater emphasis on family involvement practices. The Sheltered Instruction and Family Involvement (SIFI) project introduced the teachers to research on the effects of family involvement on students' academic achievement and asked that participants develop plans for involving families more intentionally. Results of the project, documented in survey responses and in evidence shared at a culminating project event, indicated changes in many teachers' views and practices of family involvement. Teachers reached out to families in new ways and made their instruction more connected to students' background knowledge. They also acknowledged the challenges involved. Despite  the challenges, however, the professional development experience led to practices that are more likely to help English language learners achieve greater academic success.

While school personnel are trained to work with children and families and certainly have much experience in the matter, the perspective and values of low-income parents are not always understood nor incorporated into the school culture. Since parent involvement has been shown to positively affect academic outcomes, it becomes important to understand the potential contributions that low-income parents can make to their children's education. This article describes  a qualitative case analysis that examined what low-income immigrant Latino parents had to say about their parenting roles on \"La Placita Bilingue,\" a live call-in radio talk show produced by Radio Bilingue, the national Latino public radio network. Four themes that reflect the values of 18 parents emerged from the analysis of 11 hours of Spanish-language, live call-in shows: (1) the special place of children in the family; (2) \"saber es poder\"--knowledge is power; (3) \"querer es poder\"--where there is a will, there is a way; and (4) the importance of culture and of being bilingual.

A sociocultural theoretical approach and Epstein's framework of different types of involvement were applied. Participants included 35 families whose children were enrolled in Papahana Kaiapuni, a K-12 public school program in Hawai'i. The program uses the Hawaiian language as the medium of instruction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants about their program experiences. Kaiapuni family involvement practices were consistent with Epstein's typology. Consistent with previous research on family involvement in other contexts, Type 2 (school-home communications) and Type 3 (voluntary involvement) were prevalent. However, different from previous reports, participants were more involved in school decision making (Type 5). Families felt that their involvement promoted (a) the development of children's values, (b) family and community bonding, (c) children's English language learning, and (d) family members' learning about Hawaiian language and culture. The most frequently mentioned barrier to involvement was a lack of proficiency in the Hawaiian language.",

Naturalistic research over the last 20 years or so demonstrates that the family is a rich site for supporting children's literacy development across socioeconomic and cultural contexts. That research suggests that families engage children in a wide array of literacy activities in their daily lives. Furthermore, significant others, in addition to parents, play important roles in children's literacy development. In this study, we examined a representative sample of family literacy websites from across Canada. Findings suggest that: family literacy programs tend to focus almost exclusively on young children, families are portrayed narrowly, deficit notions of families are still prevalent, and the promises made about the impact of family literacy programs go far beyond what the limited research evidence available suggests.

        "description":"In the province of Quebec, there has been a movement towards creating community schools since the last education reform. School integrated services make a unique contribution to the creation of a community school, and some important challenges must be considered and overcome if the community school is to exist in Quebec as it currently exists in the rest of Canada and in the United States. This paper consists of a proposal for the use of a pull-in program, namely the consulting team model (CTM), whose aim is to support and involve teachers as part of this consultation model within full-service community schools. Over and above its multi-agency and multi-disciplinary emphasis, the CTM also incorporates the instructional interventions and the educational success of each student. CTM is presented as a fundamental component of the service delivery model that serves students with special needs which can be linked to school integrated services in the province of Quebec; such a model can also be replicated elsewhere for any student. Our CTM proposal is part of a school integrated services delivery model we are working to put in place in Quebec schools. (Contains 4 figures and 3 endnotes.)",

In this paper, the author describes an existing field-based teaching experience and her personal experiences implementing an innovative approach while working within limited time constraints.

Results indicate that participation in this field experience that included pre-service teachers facilitating science learning with elementary children was beneficial in the construction of the pedagogical content knowledge of the pre-service teachers.

Specifically, this study uncovered the particular ways in which the teacher candidate developed her own social aspect of identity through negotiating the tensions generated from her social relationships with the various people involved, and in attempting to meet their expectations. She ended up choosing a way of using her own personal values and beliefs to resolve the tensions by frequently either neglecting or resisting others' expectations. The findings highlight that the holding of different values and beliefs seemed to create difficulties in nurturing effective communication among the people around the beginning teacher. This especially draws our attention to the need to help teacher candidates realize what can be valuable to pursue in elementary science teaching, and to improve and change their ways of science teaching in an effort to modify their frame of reference toward more effective science teaching.",

Lack of content knowledge and/or insufficient skills in planning inquiry-based lessons may contribute to teachers' reluctance to utilize this methodological approach. This study explores the relationship between science content knowledge and inquiry-based lesson planning ability. The authors found a significant positive relationship between content knowledge and the ability to create an inquiry-based science lesson. These data are of great interest since proficiency in lesson-planning is believed to contribute significantly to the ability to teach an inquiry-based lesson. (Contains 1 table.)",

The students were interviewed about their ideas of air and about phenomena involving air before and after the lessons.

In this project, they have identified seven elements that constitute a quality professional development program. These elements include: (1) strong partnership between school districts and institutions of higher education; (2) unique collaboration between science educators and scientists; (3) three-phase training program designed around the school district's adopted course of study and national science standards; (4) integration of community resources; (5) partnership with preservice teachers; (6) development of teacher leaders; and (7) comprehensive program evaluation. The model of professional development implemented in this project is based upon the recommendations from Haney and Lumpe (1995) and Loucks-Horsley, Hewson, Love, and Stiles (1998) that mirror suggestions found in various national curriculum science standards. Moreover, their model emphasized enabling the teachers to become engaged with strategies that consist of ongoing processes rather than &quot;one-shot&quot; workshops. In addition, this study sought to explore the impact of the ASTER model of professional development on teacher self-efficacy and perceptions about science teaching. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Correlational and regression analyses revealed that both reasoning ability and meaningful learning orientation were related to students' understanding of photosynthesis and respiration in plants concepts. Reasoning ability explained more of the variance in the test scores as compared to meaningful learning orientation. Moreover, it was found that although reasoning ability was associated with both male and female students' conceptual understanding, meaningful learning orientation was associated only with female students' conceptual understanding.

In order to gain an understanding of my third-grade students' ideas about animal adaptations and how the teaching of a unit on crayfish influenced these ideas, I used clinical interviews, observations, and written assessments. I did this research while working as a science resource teacher in a suburban elementary school. The first year, I piloted the unit myself and then made changes to the unit based upon my findings. During the second year, the entire third-grade team taught the unit, and I co-taught with one of these third-grade classroom teachers. I found that students' ideas are developing and that connections to other parts of the science curriculum such as habitats, gases, and plants were necessary yet lacking. Teachers should be prepared to understand these connections themselves and to highlight them to students. Also, as other research indicates, a complex understanding of adaptations is difficult and perhaps not developmentally appropriate for elementary students. Teachers should recognize that elementary students will not develop an understanding of adaptations from merely working with and observing animals in their habitats. Further research is needed to see if the students need specific lessons on adaptations, an understanding of evolution, and/or more experience and maturity in order to truly understand the concept of adaptation.",

The method used involved treatment and comparison groups composed of 2,299 elementary school students in third, fourth, and fifth grades from ten different schools. In all the pairings but one, there were statistical differences in favor of the treatment groups or no statistical differences, suggesting that science kits enhance students' content understandings.

The survey in this study was part of the National Science Foundation-supported, five-year, in-depth longitudinal case studies aimed at elucidating K-8 classroom teachers' motivations, goals, and purposes for carrying out inquiry in diverse, low SES schools. In the longitudinal case studies, diverse low SES schools were defined as culturally diverse schools, which had 50% or more of their students receiving free and reduced lunches. The teacher respondents in this study completed a K-8 Master's in Mathematics and Science Program, which focused on the development of teachers as reflective practitioners. Based on an analysis of teachers' responses to a rated closed-ended survey, which was crosschecked with open-ended qualitative responses, they were using several different science research skills during instruction; however, teachers reported use of inquiry research skills likely occurred during guided inquiry projects with little evidence to support that they used full inquiry as suggested in the \"National Science Education Standards\" (NSES) (NRC, 1996).

The goal is to enhance learner understandings by recognizing the relationships between the two disciplines. Documented attempts to systematically enact this initiative in teacher preparation remain uncommon. As a result, an elementary science methods course instructor in collaboration with two mathematics education researchers conducted a practitioner-research study that examined his efforts to connect mathematics and science. The perceptions of two groups of interns (those in a specialized program that aimed to make connections between mathematics and science and those who were not in the program but who were concentrating in mathematics or science) were contrasted in regards to the following four elements: (1) an appropriate science learning environment for elementary students, (2) the extent to which their science methods instructor modeled good teaching of science, (3) the extent to which they observed their science methods instructor making connections to mathematics in his teaching, and (4) the rationale for and intent to make connections between science and mathematics in elementary teaching. We found that there were discernible differences between the two groups in their perceptions about the issues under study. An implication for practice is that caution should be exercised when attempting an integrated approach to a science methods course, since interns may perceive the discipline of mathematics in a limited manner.",

First, we elaborate on the core elements of the process of reculturing, referring to a complex learning process of finding a new balance between cognitions and emotions both individually and collectively. We then review the literature for issues related to school leaders' roles and actions during reculturing. We argue that the role of leadership power largely has been left out of the picture so far while at the same time leadership power is so crucial for teachers' roles and actions in educational innovation processes. To illustrate our line of thinking, we analyse the stories of three school leaders about their roles and actions during successful processes of reculturing and retrospectively analyse the role of leadership power during these processes, building on a framework of Hetebrij (2006) for judging the quality of power use.

It draws on research on young people's lives to highlight the changing world for which educators prepare young people. While older educational agendas such as literacies and numeracy remain significant, it is argued that education is increasingly important for its role in assisting young people to develop the capacities and skills that will enable them to live well and that will enhance social cohesion. Although these more recent social agendas are often acknowledged in significant policy documents, their enactment in schools is compromised by economistic policy imperatives that see young people primarily in terms of their capacities to attain labour market skills that will ensure Australia's international competitiveness. I make a link between the work that young people do to make themselves, and wellbeing, highlighting the role that education plays in shaping identities--and in enabling them to &quot;become somebody well&quot;. The article concludes that health and wellbeing are marginalised in school curricula not because of a &quot;crowded curriculum&quot; but because not all elements are given equal value within our current policy frameworks.",

It then examines the reforms in terms of theoretical relationships among knowledge, skills, activity and meaning, as advanced by Piaget (1980a, 1980b) and Vygotsky (1934/1986); and discusses the implications for this and other sectors of education. The paper concludes that the reforms in technical and further education have pursued an image of relevance, but have mistaken how individuals construct meaning in workplace activities and the relationships among these kinds of meanings and those used in wider individual and social activities. It is also concluded that this mistake has serious implications for the current directions of the sector and its effectiveness in preparing people for their working lives. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "author":["Stanley, Gordon"],
        "description":"The human capital emphasis in recent economic planning is leading to new pressures on the post-compulsory education sector where work-readiness is emerging as a major focus. With concerns about the impact of demographic change as the population ages, there is a renewed emphasis on greater productivity from and less wastage of human capital. Hence retention of young people in the education and training system to at least Year 12 and the development of explicit vocational pathways has become an urgent priority for educators to address. The dilemma is that uncertainties in the future nature and demands of work have to be addressed here and now, while the lead time and costs to produce work ready students is increasing. This paper considers the characteristics of early school leavers in NSW and the strategies developed in that State to re-engage such students in the education system to increase their opportunities for workforce participation.

        "description":"In this paper I am concerned with the challenge workplace learners and educators face, as they engage with global economies, to create \"a world in common as . . . known in common\" (Smith 1999). I focus first on why global companies need their geographically dispersed workers to engage with a world \"in common\", and how they go about constructing such a world. I pay particular attention to the role of written texts in connecting individual local sites with global discourses of knowledge production. Next, I explore the roles that workplace educators play in producing and interpreting the written texts of contemporary workplaces to produce \"working knowledge\". I develop the argument that a critical dimension of the work of many workplace educators is the standardisation of language practice across institutions on a global scale, mediating local and global discourses to produce and use working knowledge. Finally, I discuss the political implications of the textual work that workplace educators undertake.",

        "description":"In South Africa where there is a very high HIV infection rate among teenagers and young adults, it is surprising to find that students and teachers are very unwilling to talk about the possibility of being or becoming HIV positive. While AIDS messages dominate public discourse, there is a silence in schools about the personal in relation to AIDS. This article seeks to explain the reluctance of learners to test, talk about and disclose their HIV status, by examining silence within a broader context. It draws on gender theories to show the connections between the silence of AIDS and broader, society-wide gender inequalities. A focus on &quot;silence&quot; adds a neglected gendered phenomenon to the understanding of the AIDS pandemic. Silence is a feature of gender relations that prevents the negotiation of safe sex, the exploration of the self and the expression of vulnerability and hence the building of trust and respect. Conversely, silence contributes to intolerance and fuels prejudice. When interventions consciously attempt to break the silence, they make a major contribution to reducing the likelihood of HIV transmission and to promoting gender equality. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "author":["Moss, Julianne"],
        "description":"Since the publication of the Salamanca statement (UNESCO 1994), inclusive schooling has formed a growing part of the deliberations of the special education community. Inclusive schooling research in Australia in the main continues to reproduce traditions of the special education field, emphasising the dominant psychological perspectives that have been superimposed on inclusive education discourses. At the fifth International Congress of Special Education (ISEC 2000) held in Manchester, &quot;the death knell of the concept of special education&quot; (ISEC 2000) was announced. The concept proposed by Mike Oliver, Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Greenwich, asserts an end to understandings of diversity dependent on medical, psychological and charity-based discourses. From a recent study of inclusive schooling policy, and drawing from poststructuralist methodology, I suggest an approach to research, policy development and practice that questions traditionalist theorising in the special education field. Reflecting on the implementation of the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities Policy (DECCD 1995) in the Tasmanian government school system, I outline my alignment with Oliver's view and highlight how questions of epistemology and reconstructions of research methodologies are central to rethinking understandings of difference. I also illustrate a methodological orientation that offers possibilities for a different science to take place, thereby understanding diversity as multiple and contradictory--and beyond the single &quot;detective story&quot; (Gough 1998) of the medical, psychological and charity-based discourses that circulate in schools as the populist conceptions of &quot;inclusion&quot;.

Specifically, the paper attends to the significance of the peer group in shaping behaviour, and in particular exaggerated &quot;masculine&quot; behaviours, and illuminates the inadequacies of conventional teacher practices that individualise and pathologise group behaviours. The nature and dynamics of the peer group and the way these dynamics interact to form particular understandings of masculinity are illuminated through a snapshot of the study's data, presented as a narrative. Drawing on elements of group socialisation theory, within a post-structural foregrounding of socio-political relations of power, the contextuality and contingency of the young males' peer group behaviours are interpreted.",

        "author":["Lovat, Terence"],
        "description":"Chapter 5 of DETYA's volume \"The Impact of Educational Research\" (Selby-Smith 2000) begins with an examination of the peculiarity of decision making in the VET sector, followed by an examination of the idiosyncratic consequences for the function of research in the sector. Having established the distinctiveness of VET in relation to these two key factors (decision making and research), the chapter then proceeds to explore the linkages between them. The study on which the chapter is founded identified a complex research culture, in which overt forms of impact are difficult to detect, yet where, it is concluded, research nonetheless plays its part. The research which is likely to impact most heavily is that which is conducted around the practical issues with which VET must deal, preferably with a heavy on-site component, and which is carried out by researchers who are prepared to engage most fruitfully with the VET culture, ideally with a long lead time and maximum follow-up to the actual research phase. Chapter 5 contributes to the overall Impact volume in a variety of ways. First, it offers an insight into the enigmatic nature of educational research in general, and especially as it relates to the VET sector. Second, it makes it clear that educational sectors like VET are likely to be affected by research only when its application to their practical needs is clear and it is carried out by people who are committed to working with their realities. Third, there are broader lessons to be taken from the chapter, especially for university researchers who are imputed by the chapter to be among the least likely to effect research that impacts on practical policy and decision making. While unrelated to the main body of \"The Impact of Educational Research\" project, Chapter 5 contributes to the overall work through exposing the real world of research impact in what is very likely the least understood of the educational sectors.",

        "description":"This article is a response to &quot;Mapping educational research and its impact on Australian schools,&quot; Chapter 2 of The Impact of Educational Research, in which researchers Allyson Holbrook, John Ainley, Sid Bourke, John Owen, Philip McKenzie, Sebastian Mission and Trevor Johnson report on their Commonwealth Education Department commissioned study. They mined the Australian Education Index and the Bibliography of Education Theses in Australia for patterns in education research in Australia over the years 1984-1997 and compared the results with additional data obtained from university education faculties, postgraduate students of education, school principals, system-level administrators and professional associations. This response to the study argues that its strength is in the construction of a conceptual framework for research as well as in its use of the AEI and BETA. Its framework has potential to provide valuable ongoing data to service the whole education community. The data garnered through surveys of postgraduate researchers and stakeholder groups indicate an interest in research by the education community, but are insufficient to provide many answers about the influence of research on schooling in Australia. The framing of a research question in terms of &quot;impact on Australian schools&quot; perpetuates a separation of research community, policy community and school community, even though the research framework proposed by the researchers largely avoids the separation. In the end, by avoiding a detailed analysis of what might be encompassed by a critical construction of either &quot;collaboration&quot; or &quot;dissemination&quot; and working uncritically within the given construct of &quot;impact,&quot; the researchers lost an opportunity to develop a notion of community, &quot;collective intelligence&quot; or public interest in educational improvement through research. If dissemination were framed in more organic language--in terms of shared knowledge and experience, commitment to understanding and &quot;collective intelligence&quot;--the framework proposed by the study could be of major benefit to schooling in Australia.

The Impact of Educational Research produces a warrant for an alternative form of thinking about the deeper forces of contemporary change including the ways that individuals are culturally formed and how they relate to each other. Understood this way, classrooms and schools are sites where new meanings and understandings are created and shared.

The questions addressed are first, why was this subject introduced into the curriculum in the 1970s? Secondly, how has knowledge in the subject been defined and contested, how and why has it changed in the course of the subject's history? Thirdly, which knowledge attains the status of truth and becomes the accepted definition of what the subject is about? The theoretical perspective adopted in this study draws from both postmodernist critiques and sociologies of subject knowledge. It presents a critical sociology of knowledge that draws insights from both social historians of school subjects and the work of Michel Foucault. The study draws a distinction between knowledge as defined by formal educational authorities (articulated in syllabuses) and knowledge defined by those practising the subject (teachers and curriculum advisors).",

        "title":"Educational Research for Professional Practice: More than Providing Evidence for Doing \"x Rather than y\" or Finding the \"Size of the Effect of A on B\"",
        "author":["Rogers, Bev"],
        "description":"Educational research has been criticised by governments and practitioners. For some politicians and policy makers, there is a tendency to look for direct links between research and successful, effective and efficient practice. Research is needed to inform their evidence-based practice as policy makers, and to provide the kind of research teachers need to base their practice on the best available evidence for doing \"x rather than y\" (Hargreaves 1996) or predicting the \"size of the effect of A on B\" (Blunkett 2000). There is no doubt that both teachers and policy makers do make decisions on a daily basis based on some form of evidence. This paper explores Hargreaves' notion of evidence-based practice, providing a range of criticisms. It also examines Carr's historical account of \"praxis\" and \"poiesis\" to suggest a notion of evidence-based praxis based partly on the historical notion of \"phronesis\"--practical wisdom. The basis for this is the argument that wise and practical ethical and moral judgements are central to an understanding of teachers' daily work. What to do in a specific educational situation cannot be determined solely by theoretical beliefs or by \"techne.\" However the ethical dimension is not the only consideration. The paper suggests that evidence-based praxis use Stenhouse's notion of \"actionable evidence,\" which includes the ethical dimension, but also Thomson's concept of \"thisness,\" which describes the unique contextual characteristics of a school. If  is advantaged schools can make some sort of difference to learning opportunities for students, it is argued that teachers might engage in evidence-based praxis which involves them in reflecting on, and theorising what is happening in classrooms, schools and neighbourhoods. This \"praxis\" also involves them in modifying their theories, critically analysing \"what works,\" questioning how they know and developing ideas about how things might be done differently. There will be an element of developing knowledge about teaching and learning strategies (Hargreaves' \"body of knowledge\"), but it will be in the context of the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with education. It will take up the question of local differences as well as a realistic approach to what constitutes actual school improvement. Evidence-based praxis is also essentially a collective activity not an individual approach. Future development of the notion of evidence-based praxis might also include involving students in a more reciprocal and open learning process like that highlighted by researchers who focus on student participation linked to school reform.",

        "description":"This paper is an essay on the state of Australian education that frames new directions for educational research. It outlines three challenges faced by Australian educators: highly spatialised poverty with particularly strong mediating effects on primary school education; the need for intellectual and critical depth in pedagogy, with a focus in the upper primary and middle years; and the need to reinvent senior schooling to address emergent pathways from school to work and civic life. It offers a narrative description of the dynamics of policy making in Australia and North America and argues for an evidence-based approach to social and educational policy--but one quite unlike current test and market-based approaches. Instead, it argues for a multidisciplinary approach to a broad range of empirical and case-based evidence that subjects these to critical, hermeneutic social sciences. Such an approach would join educational policy with educational research, and broader social, community and governmental action with the aim of reorganising and redistributing material, cultural and social resources.

        "description":"Is the idea of the liberal university dead, has the postmodern university any chance of being emancipatory, has the theory-practice divide merely collapsed in an era of \"new knowledge work\", or has the university just become one aspect of market states and global capitalism? Knowledge-based economies locate universities as central to the commodification and management of knowledge, while at the same time the legitimacy of the university and the academic as knowledge producers is challenged by postmodernist, feminist, post-colonial and indigenous claims within a wider trend towards the \"democratisation of knowledge\" and a new educational instrumentalism and opportunism. What becomes of the educational researcher, and indeed their professional organisations, in this changing socio-political and economic scenario? Is our role one of policy service, policy critique, technical expert or public intellectual? In particular what place is there for feminist public intellectuals in a so-called era of post-feminism and public-private convergence? The paper draws on feminist and critical perspectives to mount a case for the importance of the public intellectual in the performative postmodern university. (Contains 1 note.)",

Addressing theoretical, empirical and methodological issues associated with these studies, I argue that the remaking of the white working class can only be understood in relation to gendered constructions within itself, the construction of relevant &quot;others&quot;, as well as deep shifts in large social formations.

Following Kamler (2001), I now bring a critical lens to my rereading of Sarah's metaphors as cultural texts that reflect the cultural storylines, positionings and practices that Sarah perceived were available to her.

        "description":"Education Queensland's New Basics project has extended conceptions of &quot;equity&quot; to incorporate dimensions such as higher order thinking and student control of classroom activity. This requires a critique of the outcomes attained by even high achieving students. It is therefore useful to interrogate professional discourses that shape pedagogies for particular groups of students. In this paper, discourses on &quot;the Chinese learner&quot; are reviewed. The review raises new issues of equity because Chinese students are often high achievers in Australian schools, but are frequently criticised for learning in ways that seem to fit uneasily with the types of pedagogy now valorised in Queensland. The paper concludes with a note of caution about the definition of high quality academic outcomes in the new policy, and the effects of a gap between understandings of equity and professional discourses and practice.

Data collected from 3773 high school students suggest that girls score significantly higher than boys in their belief in the value of school, learning focus, planning, study management, and persistence while boys rate significantly higher in self-sabotage/self-handicapping. However, girls rated significantly higher than boys in anxiety. In the qualitative phase of the research, boys identified the following features of effective and motivating pedagogy: a good relationship between student and teacher, the teacher's enjoyment of teaching and working with young people, providing boys with choices and input into the lesson, making schoolwork interesting and/or relevant, providing variety in content and methods, and respecting boys' opinions and perspectives. The paper then draws on data presented elsewhere to show that, in addition to some key gender differences in motivation, there are also some noteworthy parallels between boys and girls. The paper concludes with a discussion of motivation as it relates to the social construction of gender, fear of failure and masculinity, and program development, construction and implementation.

The GATS is a multilateral agreement through which WTO members commit to voluntary liberalisation of trade in services, including education. Transnational (or offshore) education refers to education that is delivered by an institution based in one country to students located in a different country. Two of the countries considered, New Zealand and Australia, have made commitments under GATS to allow relatively unrestricted cross-border provision of education in their countries, while the other two countries, Singapore and Malaysia, have made no such commitment. There is currently considerable activity in renegotiating countries' commitments to GATS as part of the Doha round of WTO negotiations, and simultaneously bilateral free trade agreements are being proposed between countries in the region. In this context, this paper examines the practical impact that GATS has had on these two countries that have made commitments regarding education, and the likely impact that similar commitments by Malaysia and Singapore would have on the tertiary education systems in those major importing countries.

To help students better understand the transition between these two worlds this article will describe the Stages of Internship developed by Sweitzer and King (1994, 1995, 1999) and how this organizational framework for stage management was adapted for use in an undergraduate health education internship program at West Chester University. The Stages of Internship focuses on five predictable stages students encounter during internships. These stages include: anticipation, disillusionment, confrontation, competence, and culmination. The Stages of Internship serves as a framework for identification of each stage as it relates to student development throughout the internship experience. It is important for faculty and internship supervisors to be able to develop strategies to manage each stage during the internship experience and provide students with appropriate guidelines for transitioning through the internship stages. Guidelines are presented on effective stage management strategies and practical knowledge needed to help students understand the stages of change. A greater understanding of the Stages of Internship enables health education professionals to help students build skills to transition successfully from one stage to another therefore providing a strong foundation for future career development.

Using a primarily qualitative research technique, the researchers explored attitudes toward recent rioting at a northeastern Big Ten University using a 16-item questionnaire containing mostly open-ended items. A selected sample of 150 students majoring in education or health and physical education was chosen, 139 of whom volunteered to participate. Most students expressed beliefs that heavy alcohol use and rioting were linked; however, many rejected paternalistic approaches such as strict enforcement or countermeasures. Opinions toward increased police enforcement to reduce rioting among these respondents were fairly evenly divided, although many forceful responses opposing police enforcement were noted, especially regarding the use of tear gas, perceived limiting of personal freedoms, and characterization of police as intimidating. Respondents characterized the most recent public disturbance at this university as a \"riot,\" or a wild party that \"grew out of control.\" Only a small minority of respondents indicated they had participated in the most recent of three disturbances. Implications regarding the role of health educators to promote university- and community-based alcohol abuse prevention coalitions are discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

        "author":["Bryla, Karen Y."],
        "description":"Disordered eating among American adolescent females represents a significant health issue in our current cultural climate. Disordered eating receives insufficient attention, however, due to the public's unfamiliarity with symptoms and consequences, absence of treatment options, and unreliable instrumentation to detect disordered eating. Disordered eating differs from an eating disorder. While the term \"eating disorder\" denotes a clinically diagnosable disease, the term \"disordered eating\" refers to a pattern of eating that can lead to an eating disorder. Young females who engage in disordered eating face several times greater risk than their non-disordered eating counterparts to develop an eating disorder; therefore, understanding the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences associated with disordered eating proves necessary for developing effective prevention programs. Factors associated with the prevalence of disordered eating include age, weight, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Consequences of disordered eating include nutritional deficiencies, growth retardation, decreased metabolism, and susceptibility to binge eating behaviors. Disordered eating appears related to other health-compromising behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, suicide attempts, and unprotected sexual activity. Family, peers, and media also play significant roles in the development of disordered eating. This review explores these factors and offers suggestions for developing effective intervention programs for disordered eating.",

        "description":"As a two-year \"veteran,\" the author remembers well how much a little moral support and a smile can mean for a newly-minted teacher. It kept her going in those first few exhausting, confusing weeks. Building those connections is vital both for new teachers and for their profession. With so many new teachers leaving after just a few years (over 50%!--according to the latest figures), schools should all be putting out the welcome mat. In this article, the author offers 10 ways to make new teachers feel at home: (1) Cool off before starting up; (2) Give a gift of appreciation; (3) Listen to them; (4) Show them the sights; (5) Welcome their families; (6) Thank Fridays (and new teachers); (7) Have a happy hour; (8) Volunteer your expertise; (9) Make them newsworthy; and (10) Host a lunch club.",

This past July, President Bush weighed in, telling reporters in Texas that intelligent design belongs in the public school curriculum, alongside evolution. He said both ought to be taught so people can understand what the debate's about. The National Congress of Science Education (NCSE), a group of leaders from the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), quickly issued a response expressing its disappointment with the President's statement: \"Teachers of science should be supported in the teaching of evolution and the strong body of scientific evidence supporting it, and not pressured to present nonscientific views.\" In this article, the author discusses what is fueling this fiery debate and how it could affect the classroom by unpacking the facts, decoding the jargon, and talking to real teachers about their take on evolution in schools.",

Appointed by President Bush, Spellings is responsible for the overall direction, supervision, and coordination of activities and functions as the Chief Operating Officer for the entire Department. Spellings, who replaced the controversial Rod Paige earlier this year, has been focused thus far on implementing No Child Left Behind and on sharing the stories of improved test scores in many American school districts. Charming and tenacious, she also made it clear that she feels a special bond with teachers and wants and needs them on her side. This article presents the conversation between Grey and Spellings wherein they both discussed parenting, math and science, the arts, test prep, merit pay, and closing the achievement gap.",

Some religious groups protest the observance of what they consider a pagan celebration and administrators fret about maintaining security during events that are, by definition, wild. Even educators complain that class time devoted to candy corn parties would be better spent on math and science. Some critics want to know why a school can have witches in October, but cannot have Jesus in December. No single approach to Halloween will succeed everywhere, as opinions on the holiday vary widely from one community to the next. Schools ought to look beyond Halloween and establish a comprehensive policy on all classroom holiday observance, so that the issue does not return throughout the year. In this article, the author suggests that schools should consider initiating the development of a holiday policy, if they do not have one, by involving parents, elected officials, and religious groups in the discussion.",

Most attribute outstanding school success to money or luck--generous state dollars, corporate sponsorships, that one-in-a-million principal who could run a small country in his spare time. Sure, these things help, but the 20 schools that walked away with this year's Intel and Scholastic Schools of Distinction Awards are not waiting around for luck to make a difference in the classroom. Schools of Distinction winners come from every type of community--the richest to the poorest. Their teachers are veterans, newbies, and in between, but they all share a passion for reaching kids. In this article, the author discusses seven surprising things about award-winning schools: (1) They spend a day each week teaching teachers; (2) They teach math all day; (3) They harken back to the one-room schoolhouse; (4) They get kids (and parents) to come to school on Saturday; (5) They look to Hollywood for inspiration; (6) They let kids snorkel and climb active volcanoes; and (7) They have kids and teachers learn a new language.",

The appointment of a new Justice lets students witness the Court's role and how the three branches of government work together. Teachers also report that the Court is a favorite topic because children can see how rulings have affected their daily lives--in cases that deal with segregation, wearing protest armbands to school, immigration, or free speech. Lessons on the Court and the confirmation process should go well beyond memorization of facts. Diana Hess, faculty on the Supreme Court Summer Institute for teachers, says as a general rule, the best ones are those that require kids to process information and make some kind of decision. Role-playing and debates, which require judgment and critical thinking, help students better understand the Court and the confirmation, as well as larger lessons about the judicial process, checks and balances, citizenship, and the rights others have won for today's students.",

The high exit rate from the teaching profession, combined with a projected shortage of 2.2 to 2.4 million teachers has legislators, superintendents, and perhaps even Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, nervous. However, there are now districts across the United States where teachers are experiencing rising salaries. This article examines this trend and presents examples of teachers who found ways to earn more than $100,000 in salaries.",

What teachers are learning now is that offering high interest topics may be less important than offering kids challenging tasks--new problems to solve--that tap into the way children's brains are wired to learn. According to Alison Gopnik, a psychology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, children know how to program the TiVo or build his own skateboard ramp because they spent a lot of time messing around.

When teachers talk about mathematical concepts, even familiar, garden variety words such as \"parallel,\" \"power,\" \"even,\" \"odd,\" \"multiply,\" \"difference,\" \"product,\" \"positive,\" and \"negative\" take on brand-new meanings. What's the best way for teachers to help students master this unique vocabulary? In 2000, after analyzing two decades of research on vocabulary instruction, the National Reading Panel concluded that there is no one best method for teaching vocabulary. Rather, teachers need to use a variety of methods for the best results, including intentional, explicit instruction of specific vocabulary words. This article presents an interview with Marilyn Burns, founder of Math Solutions Professional Development. In this interview, Burns talked about how teachers can effectively integrate math vocabulary into their lesson plans.",

After these incidents, Frederick County Public School officials took an unusual step: They applied for a 10-day restraining order to prevent the boy from entering the school. The decision turned upon the conflict between the school and Bill's parents about whether inclusion was working. This case has highlighted the delicate balance that teachers and schools must strike as they ensure the rights of students with disabilities to learn in the least restrictive environment while maintaining the leaning community for the school as a whole. This article discusses the challenges of inclusion and suggests several strategies on how teachers can provide a safe school environment for all students.",

        "description":"When the author began teaching preschool after her youngest child began school, she asked children to bring in pictures of themselves and gave a \"Favorite Family Recipe\" book as a Christmas gift. The year was 1989 and she was blissfully ignorant of any other childhood than the kind her sheltered children lived. Then she met Angie. Angie was a tough, streetwise little thing with a sharp mind and a bad attitude. After a week of doing battle with her at every turn, the author pulled out her file to check her history, desperate to figure out how to help her fit into her class. She found out the socially isolating status of a child in foster care. The author still cringes when she thinks back to the number of small ways she was disrespectful to children in her class, not out of malice but out of ignorance. Now, when the author has a child in her care, she makes sure to meet with any new teacher to talk briefly about how they can work together to make the school experience a positive one for all of them. In this article, the author provides several ways a teacher can support a child in those critical first months.",

It is worth asking not only whether there are good reasons to support the nearly universal practice of assigning homework, but why it is so often taken for granted--even by vast numbers of teachers and parents who are troubled by its impact on children. The mystery deepens as widespread assumptions about the benefits of homework--higher achievement and the promotion of such virtues as self-discipline and responsibility--are not substantiated by the available evidence. In this article, the author discusses the myth about homework and its negative impact on children. He suggests that teachers ought to be able to exercise their judgment in determining how they want to deal with homework, taking account of the needs and preferences of the specific children in their classrooms, rather than having to conform to a fixed policy that has been imposed on them.",

        "author":["Clavelle, Peter"],
        "description":"The City of Burlington (population 40,000) is home to the University of Vermont (UVM), Champlain College and Burlington College. UVM alone enrolls some 7,300 undergraduate students and almost 9,000 students overall. With the university just a half-mile up the hill from the city center, Burlington's urban amenities--its arts and culture, restaurants, coffee houses and retail outlets--are within easy reach of the campus. UVM students have a significant, positive impact on the local economy. At the same time, students have had a profound effect on rental housing availability, rent levels and noise in the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown and the university. City concerns about student pressure on the rental housing market, on neighborhoods, and on traffic and parking congestion peaked in the late 1980s as UVM's enrollment grew dramatically. Burlington attempted to encourage and cajole the university into mitigating some of the impacts of its burgeoning student body--without success. By March 1990, the city and the university had entered into an agreement to address a range of housing, parking and traffic issues. While UVM-city relations have been at times contentious, they have made progress in the recent past. Last year, UVM, under President Judith Ramaley, reached an agreement with the city that addresses the three most difficult challenges affecting town-gown relations: (1) on-campus housing; (2) off-campus student behavior; and (3) UVM's land-use policies. In little more than a decade, town-gown relations in Burlington have been transformed from a contentious standstill to dynamic collaboration.",

Reflecting public skepticism about whether teachers know as much as they should, Congress has required teacher preparation programs to report their graduates' pass rates on certification exams, and states are ranking colleges based on those results. The media, policymakers and the general public are all asking: Who is--better yet, who &quot;should be&quot;--responsible for preparing pre-K-12 teachers to enter classrooms fortified with the necessary skills and knowledge? The old divide was between K-12 and higher education; the new one is between education and liberal arts faculty. In this article, the author discusses the differences between arts and sciences professors and education professors, the factors that discourage collaboration among these practitioners, and how to encourage the two faculties toward working together in teacher preparation programs.",

        "description":"When a fire breaks out in the twin cities of Lewiston and Auburn, Maine, the firefighter response time is just a bit quicker these days, thanks to student research at Bates College. When the alarm sounds, firefighters click on a computer map that tells them the size of the burning structure, the quickest route to the fire, the closest hydrant and whether it can provide enough water. Before his graduation in 1999, Bates geology student Peter Beeson researched and developed a Geographical Information System (GIS) for firefighters in the two cities. The system also is used to gauge environmental impact of road developments, and for other geographical purposes, such as optimum routes for sewerage. Municipal officials say that Beeson's research has saved them nearly $200,000. This experience illustrates the mutual advantages that research projects provide colleges and their communities--in this case, Bates College and its community development partner, an initiative of 36 local business, civic and institutional leaders in Lewiston and Auburn called LA Excels. Recently, Bates and LA Excels were awarded an $80,000 grant from the national Consortium for the Advancement of Private Higher Education's &quot;Engaging Communities and Campuses&quot; program. Over the next two years, the grant will fund 10 summer Community Research Fellowships. These fellowships will take qualified students into Lewiston and Auburn to undertake research projects identified by the community as essential building blocks of ambitious community development efforts. The applied research opportunities afforded through the Bates Community Research Program further expand how service and undergraduate academic experience can be connected by enabling students to put their academic work into practice. Bates is able to enhance hands-on learning while addressing community needs.",

        "description":"American research universities are renowned for applying cutting-edge science to the improvement of the world's health and environmental systems. Indeed, as a society, people have come to expect this type of intellectual leadership from their great universities. Less appreciated is the robust opportunity for state and local governments to harness the intellectual power of the academy to help solve community problems. Yet these kinds of partnerships are particularly strong at the nation's land-grant and sea-grant institutions, where federal investment over the past century-and-a-half has generated innovative solutions to problems at the local, state, regional and national levels. Over the past five years, the University of Rhode Island (URI) Coastal Fellows Program has provided capstone experiential learning for more than 265 students in various scientific disciplines and attracted more than $1 million in outside funding to URI. The program infuses externally funded research teams of faculty, staff and partners with the principles of undergraduate experiential learning. This model provides a powerful forum for undergraduate learning, particularly when set in the context of applied community problem-solving. The Coastal Fellows Program has generated a burst of enthusiasm on campus and contributed to a marked attitudinal change toward undergraduate education among research faculty and staff at URI. The Coastal Fellows model is clearly a powerful one for faculty and students, researchers and communities alike--potent enough to inspire the URI Department of Natural Resources Science to implement a paradigm shift in educating all its majors.",

        "description":"A wave of teacher retirements is expected just as fewer college-bound students express a preference for teaching careers, and more diverse students reach school age. Former U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley suggested the nation would need more than 2 million new teachers over the next decade. This article presents some perspectives on innovations in P-16 and particularly on the profoundly important question: Who will teach? A new study by Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies offers the first statistical glimpse  into the challenge faced by Massachusetts school districts each year. The Northeastern study found that, come late September, all but a few classrooms in Massachusetts were staffed by a teacher. At the same time, the study found that more than one-quarter of all secondary school teachers hired in Massachusetts last year lacked certification in their primary teaching area. The problem was particularly acute among special education, foreign language and math and science teachers. The study also anticipates that, over the next five to seven years, this fundamental teacher skills deficit will worsen considerably. The much discussed teacher shortage is not a classic labor shortage in which too many jobs chase too few qualified individuals. Rather, the predicament is the result of a recruitment and compensation system designed decades ago which has not kept pace with the contemporary economy.",

Unfortunately missing from an increasing number of these classrooms is a certified teacher with a mastery of the subject matter being taught and an understanding of how children learn. In this article, the author discusses the shortage of quality teachers in American schools and ways to address this problem. She also discusses the three new entrants in the teacher preparation field: (1) for-profit, proprietary companies; (2) fast-track programs targeted to career-changers and sponsored by local officials; and (3) packaged online modules. The author suggests that college and university schools of education need to abandon traditional thinking and initiate innovative approaches to training a new teacher force. They have to create accessible programs that are suitable to the widely varying educational backgrounds and experience that candidates bring, and they have to be creative in finding ways to guarantee jobs for teacher candidates. School systems and colleges need to work together to make early commitments to students.",

Her commitment to teaching grew out of a basic commitment to social justice. From her own experience, she knew that whether or not a child receives a good education often hinges on the child's socioeconomic status, ethnicity and gender. Although Boston is home to world-renowned colleges and universities, its preK-12 public school program is not effectively preparing local students to attend these institutions. Hopeful of positively impacting her students' educational experience, she found through her teaching experience at a comprehensive high school in Boston that she was not a good teacher.

A public school, UPCS enrolls students in grades 7 through 12. Clark professors teach at the school. Clark students serve as student teachers and mentors to UPCS students, who also attend some classes and lectures on the university campus. Perhaps most important to the schoolchildren, 78 percent of whom qualify for the federal school lunch program, Clark has pledged to admit, tuition-free, all UPCS graduates who meet regular entrance requirements as long as they have lived in the Main South neighborhood for five years. Clark and its partners are eagerly watching to see how many members of the charter class of 2004 end up attending the university. In fewer than five years, the University Park Campus School has had a profound impact on Main South.",

        "author":["Sacks, Peter"],
        "description":"Higher education authorities are embracing the latest movement in education known as \"P-16.\" Its proponents argue that colleges have operated too long as a separate realm from America's public schools. As a result, many high school graduates are not properly prepared for college, despite the unrelenting national push in public schools for rigorous standards and tougher tests. That standards gap, the P-16 proponents contend, is burdening colleges with too much remedial training and forcing ill-prepared students to drop out of college. Proponents of the P-16 idea say it is time for states to link their higher education, preschool and K-12 systems by aligning college admissions standards with high school graduation standards. Dozens of states have embarked on collaborative P-16 initiatives. In this article, the author argues that policymakers fall into a trap by insisting that achieving alignment of standards between schools and colleges depends on expanding the use of high-stakes tests. The writer maintains that significant educational damage is being wrought by the accountability movement in American schools and that upping the stakes on high school graduation exams could actually harm both academic quality and fairness in higher education. Creating stronger relationships between public schools and higher education should not, in the author's opinion, be about the alignment of academic standards between the two realms, but about engaging young people in the value of an intellectual life and a love of learning that will enable them to succeed both as students and as citizens.",

        "description":"Many white students are barely exposed to African-American history throughout their schooling. When students do examine the other side of American history, the one not generally found in their textbooks, they often wonder why they have not learned this before. An understanding of African-American history is central to any effort to eliminate racism. This is particularly true in New England where most schools are predominantly white, and myths and stereotypes are not countered by exposure to a diverse community. By learning about the pragmatic economic reasons for slavery in Colonial America and the years of Jim Crow laws, white and black students begin to understand the American caste system--based on the established inferiority of the African-American race--and the complex racial problems facing America today. Students need to learn how the accomplishments of the Civil Rights Movement have mitigated, but have not eliminated, prejudice and racial discrimination in American culture. White students also need to learn about the African-American men and women who have shaped history such as Benjamin Bannecker, Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, Adam Clayton Powell, and Althea Gibson.

This shift is being driven by considerable and significant research into educational theory, behavioral and cognitive sciences and human development. In the past, a common mode of teaching was lecturing. Today, many faculty facilitate discussions. Students today are encouraged to be more proactive and to take responsibility for their own learning. They have more experiential and hands-on education than their parents. Most of them, in college, were expected to work independently as individuals; many students today work collaboratively in small groups. Creating a community of learners is an important goal of many educators. Other forces are also changing higher education. The revolution in computer and communications technology has affected everything from grounds-keeping to teaching to research. Off-campus and distance learning initiatives are proliferating. Institutions compete intensely for students and for financial resources. State and federal requirements on colleges grow apace. Through all this, there is an increasing need to maintain, renovate or replace aging facilities and equipment. At the same time, building designs are evolving to support the changes taking place in education. The relationship between education and architecture is symbiotic--one affects the other.

Teacher shortages are looming throughout New England. But in the rural northern tier of New Hampshire, the challenge of recruiting teachers is especially tough. While New Hampshire is the fastest-growing state in New England, the growth is mostly confined to the southern part of the state. That makes it particularly difficult to attract married teachers whose spouses also may be looking for work to the North Country. In this article, the author discusses the North Country teacher apprenticeship program, which was launched by Plymouth State College with its College for Lifelong Learning, the New Hampshire Community Technical Colleges and the North Country Superintendent's Association to address the critical shortage of school personnel.

This article presents nine examples of recent New England campus building projects that offer some sense of the shape of things to come.",

        "description":"Kids are frequenting some old New England department stores again. They are not buying CDs and jeans; they are investing in certificates and degrees. The University of Rhode Island and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth have purchased former retail space in historic downtown buildings--and refurbished them for educational uses. Boston University houses its School of Hospitality Administration in a former Cadillac dealership. Maine College of Art, the Rhode Island School of Design and Montserrat College of Art have all converted vacant downtown stores to gallery space. After Housatonic Community College spent $27 million renovating the dilapidated Hi-Ho mall in Bridgeport, Connecticut, enrollment grew so fast, administrators began looking for more space--this time, in a former Sears building. College officials find rehabilitating old downtown stores attractive for several reasons. Fixing up an existing building can be more cost-efficient than buying land and building from scratch. Town-gown relations are improved as the institution's investment helps reinvigorate the central business districts and strengthen community ties. The college can also show the community its commitment to the environment by applying sustainable architectural practices to the site. Since department stores tended to be located right in the middle of downtowns, these buildings offer a central location for a sometimes-overlooked student market.",

        "description":"Billion-dollar investments in public higher education do not come easily in the State of Connecticut--or anywhere in New England. So, when in 1995, Connecticut Gov. John Rowland and the state's General Assembly approved the $1 billion comprehensive infrastructure improvement and private support incentive program known as UConn 2000, this was something bordering on the revolutionary. Looking back after seven years of dramatic transformation, it seems as if the arguments for the initiative were so compelling that they almost made themselves. But it was not that simple. It took courage on the part of the elected leaders, advocacy by alumni and thousands of other concerned citizens, leadership by a committed board of trustees and quite likely the prominence of their basketball programs--including their women's basketball team's NCAA national championship--to build the political support needed to make this investment. This article presents the university's experience in the seven years since the adoption of UConn 2000. If their experience is any indication, capital investment by the state plays a major role in making a much-needed transformation possible. The University of Connecticut, long a very good regional institution of higher education, is now clearly identified as a center of excitement where all the important trend lines are pointing upward.",

        "description":"New England may be the wealthiest region in the United States, but it is also the oldest and slowest-growing, and among the least diverse. These peculiar demographic characteristics combined with New England's history of heavy reliance on local governments suggest future problems for the region's educational systems. Since most public schools in New England are financed principally by local property taxes, any decline in the income of homeowners, and by extension, their ability or willingness to pay rising property taxes, is a serious matter. There is little doubt that in most New England communities, an aging population will make it more difficult to finance high-quality elementary and secondary public education. This could have equally serious consequences for higher education in New England because if school districts are forced to spend less, fewer high school graduates may be prepared for college-level course work. Perhaps what New England needs is a turnaround marketing plan. The region's colleges and universities should work in partnership with the six state governments to execute a coordinated, well-financed marketing program. This might include using the World Wide Web and other vehicles to recruit more young people to attend college or graduate school in New England and enlisting New England employers to convince a larger share of them to stay in the region to work. The long-term objective should be to bring up household income and bring down the rising median age. This will require more than just advertising economic opportunities available in New England. It will also mean addressing a few of the issues, such as lack of affordable housing, that hurt New England's competitiveness. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"At the end of World War II, Greater Boston was one of the least diverse metropolitan areas in the United States. In 1950, the &quot;minority&quot; population of only one of its 154 towns and cities exceeded 5 percent and that was the city of Boston, at only 5.3 percent. In the second half of the century, the region rapidly became multiracial and multicultural. By the 2000 Census, Boston itself was &quot;majority minority,&quot; with 50.5 percent minority residents, and dozens of cities and towns in the region boasted a rainbow of races and ethnic groups. Lowell, which was only 0.2 percent minority in 1950, had a minority population of more than 37 percent in 2000. The old white European &quot;Immigrant City&quot; of Lawrence, which was but 0.3 percent minority in 1950, has become a new, largely Hispanic &quot;Immigrant City&quot; with a &quot;minority&quot; population of nearly 66 percent. This demographic revolution, along with dramatic changes in the area's industry mix, has contributed to the economic and social renaissance of the region. Greater Boston has been transformed from an economic basket case hemorrhaging industries and jobs throughout much of the period before the 1980s to a vibrant metropolitan region based on high technology and professional services--the knowledge industries of the 21st century. Yet the fruits of the metro region's prosperity have been unevenly distributed. Workers with limited education, particularly those who are members of racial or ethnic minorities (i.e., groups other than non-Hispanic whites), continue to confront significant barriers. The nature of these barriers varies by race, ethnicity and gender so policies to reduce inequality must be tailored to each group. Only by attacking all barriers to improved earnings for minorities and women can there be hope to reduce the enormous earnings gaps that continue to detract from the otherwise exceptional economic record of the Greater Boston region.

        "description":"As in other regions, development on many New England campuses over the past 30 years has tended to be more random than planned. Following the same patterns of sprawl that have defined most development in today's era, the placement of new campus buildings often separated them from the life of the university, while a hodgepodge of architectural styles clashed with the vocabulary of the historic quad. Lost, or at least diminished, is a fundamental asset of academic life in New England: the experience of community on a campus uniquely and beautifully attuned to its surroundings. In recent years, an evolving understanding of the environmental impacts of new buildings has further separated campus architecture from a legacy universities can wholeheartedly embrace. The University of Rhode Island, for one, is trying to change that. There, planning is underway for a cluster of new buildings many hope will mend the fracture between forward-thinking new development and the historic campus. Though pencils have not yet been put to paper, planners foresee the new buildings as the foundation of a sustainable academic community, a model of &quot;green design&quot; that will project the values of environmental responsibility while enhancing the traditional assets of New England campus life. This melding of sustainability with strategic planning is not only the shape of things to come in campus architecture but the signal of a deeper cultural shift that may well change one's understanding of literacy. Sustainable design is not an ideology that imposes foregone conclusions on a setting. But as planning proceeds, students and professors at URI just may decide they too want a building like a tree--and a campus like a New England forest.",

Students from all over the world enroll in New England's institutions of learning and research, bringing resources to finance their education and living expenses that reverberate throughout local and state economies. Human capital-based industries driven by New England's college-trained talent fuel New England's local and state economies.

        "description":"The annual \"America's Best Colleges\" issue of \"U.S. News & World Report\" is to the news magazine what the annual \"Swimsuit\" issue is to \"Sports Illustrated.\" Both are best sellers that make big money for their publishers. And both succeed because they are sexy, glamorous, superficial and largely without redeeming social value. But \"America's Best Colleges\" has evolved into something else too: a widely recognized barometer and instigator of major higher education trends, and not all positive to the writer. This article presents several strategies that colleges across the country could adopt to improve their scores on one or more measuring sticks used by the \"U.S. News\" and thereby raise their rankings. However, most of these strategies contribute to bad public policy and undermine the integrity of the institution itself. Any college or university adopting these strategies, the writer warns, should not be naive about the potentially questionable role they are playing in a bigger game.",

In this article, the author offers several strategies that higher education can adopt to deal with the forces of change in the global economy: (1) adopt student-centered models; (2) become more market-driven; (3) develop \"Centers of Excellence\"; (4) Be a good neighbor; (5) Integrate distance learning technologies; (6) integrate wireless technologies; (7) design flexible facilities; and (8) facilitate social interaction.

        "description":"One challenge facing colleges and universities today is that an entire generation of scholars will be retiring in critical numbers over the next several years. A national survey conducted three years ago by the University of California at Los Angeles revealed that nearly one-third of the nation's full time professors were age 55 or older. Now, complicating the likely wave of faculty retirements, many higher education institutions nationwide will be experiencing budget cuts as deep as 5 percent. To those who see the glass as half-empty, departments will be losing faculty at a time when their budgets are ill-prepared to recruit and hire replacements, let alone expand into new areas of knowledge. But to those who see the glass half-full, these retirements present an opportunity to bring about substantive change without sacrificing what is of value. In this article, the author describes how the Five Colleges consortium copes with the changing faculty demography. The members of the Five Colleges consortium include Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges, and the University of Massachusetts.",

Colleges change admissions requirements without even informing high schools in their service areas. Community college graduates are denied access to four-year programs because of policy changes made only after it was too late for the students to adjust their studies accordingly. Most important, the enormous shifts in pre-K-12 education caused by the No Child Left Behind Act are totally unknown to higher education's leaders. There are also several demographic factors that New Englanders have ignored. First and most important, the decreasing birth rate in three New England states means that, unless young families of childbearing age start moving into New England in droves, the region's population will get older and smaller very quickly. A second factor is the &quot;net&quot; of people moving in and out of a state. During the 1990s, four New England states saw more people move out than in. Many of New England's low-income and minority citizens are not participating in the American Dream, and the number of college-goers in the region known around the world as a center of higher education is lower than one would expect, especially in Vermont.",

        "description":"According to this author, the single greatest threat to the public trust in higher education is alcohol. Specifically, it is high-risk drinking among college students and the lack of engagement by those who can help solve the problem. He contends that, for too many students, college is no longer about preparing for leadership roles and productive service to society, business and science, but rather about taking a vacation from the real world. Legions of binge-drinking graduates are leaving college as ill-prepared citizens feeling no more responsible for their contributions to democracy than they do for their inappropriate, excessive use of alcohol. A recent study by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has documented 1,400 student deaths, 600,000 physical assaults, and 70,000 sexual assaults per year among college students due to alcohol. Just as important, a majority of non-partying students report negative effects on their academic performance from alcohol-related behaviors ranging from vandalism and assault to significant loss of sleep and study time due to noisy, drunken roommates. Yet despite all this, many adults in positions of authority have not bothered to act. Furthermore, various studies show that alcohol impairs academic performance and that students who binge drink have lower grades than those who do not. The author states that the same social forces and trends that have created this social epidemic need to be used to change it, and that educators and administrators need to begin holding themselves accountable for the measurement of progress on their campuses.",

        "description":"In this article, the author cites a few studies which revealed startling statistics about sexual violence in colleges, particularly rape. He notes that sexual violence remains as much a dirty secret on the campuses as it is in the larger society. It flourishes because to confront it, an institution must be willing to shine a bright light on aspects of itself that are both ugly and painful. One of the most important steps that must be taken is a comprehensive, led-from-the-top campaign to change the community climate such that victims of sexual violence feel comfortable to report attacks to authorities. Paradoxically then, the first indication that an institution is courageously moving to end sexual violence is almost inevitably an increase in the official tally of that violence. This is not the kind of publicity that most college administrators strive to create. Yet some institutions have moved forward regardless.",

Increasing specialization and narrowing of academic disciplines over the past decades has deepened this divide.

In many of the communities in which they are located, they rank among the largest employers. They purchase goods and services from New England companies, and are often among the leading procurers of construction activity. Each year, they bring billions of dollars in federal research funding into the region. There is, however, one aspect of the research universities' role in the regional economy that has not been as widely recognized: some of New England's leading research universities, such as Harvard University's Extension School and Boston University's Metropolitan College, are also leading providers of continuing education for working adults. Not all research universities, of course, have embraced career and continuing education to the extent that Harvard and Boston University have. Some see it as inconsistent with their primary mission. In these cases, local officials might produce better results for their communities by promoting university collaboration with a local community college. Whether through individual university initiatives or through partnerships with other institutions, an expanded commitment to career and continuing education for working adults can provide local communities with a way to ensure that the economic benefits of the research university are widely shared.",

        "description":"Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in the educational advancement of women in the United States and New England. Nationally, the percentage of adult women with four-year college degrees increased from 8 percent in 1970 to 24 percent in 2000. Women narrowed the gap with men in college completion, as the female-to-male ratio in percentages of Americans with four-year college degrees went from below 60 percent to 85 percent. Yet women's progress in higher education has not translated into proportionate economic advancement in the workplace. In New England, women earn a low of 69 cents on the men's dollar in New Hampshire to a high of 78 cents in Vermont. All six New England states have female-to-male education ratios at least 3 percentage points above the U.S. average. But only two--Vermont and Massachusetts--have female-to-male earnings ratios 3 percentage points above the U.S. average. In all states except Massachusetts, the &quot;return to education&quot; ratio--as measured by the full-time working female-to-male earnings ratio divided by the full-time working female-to-male education ratio--is below the U.S. average of 86 percent. In other words, the economic returns to a college degree for women relative to men in New England is below the U.S. average. This article discusses why this economic disparity remains so pronounced even with the significant advancement of female students in higher education. In addition, it suggests how institutions of higher education might advance the economic status of women. (Contains 3 figures.)",

Now, in the early 21st century, as the most powerful higher education magnet in the world, New England still attracts many of the best students and faculty to its academic and research institutions. The region enrolls more than 45,000 international students who contribute more than $1.2 billion to the economy. A recent ranking by the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; in the United Kingdom listed eight New England institutions among the world's top 200. New England lures foreign students and scholars because of the quality of its academic institutions and programs, research infrastructure, research-based industries and the links among these elements. The social, cultural and other historical qualities of the region are also attractive. This article discusses international trends and realities showing that the basic strength of the universities in New England will continue to function as an international lure but that. as the academic world becomes more multipolar, New England's colleges and universities will find themselves competing not only with one another, but also with top-quality academic institutions in other emerging academic powers.",

        "description":"Recognizing the public benefits of higher education and the arts, the American Assembly of Columbia University convened a 2004 conference called \"The Creative Campus,\" from which emerged recommendations about better integrating arts offerings on campus into the curriculum, serving the surrounding community and preparing students for the demands of arts careers. In this article, the author contends that the \"creative campus\" must be thought of at a more profound level than as a place that supports the arts. Higher education talks about creativity but may not be willing to face how its basic institutional structures and measurements can work against the conditions in which creativity flourishes. The institution that would foster creativity is called upon to do many things: (1) provide access to a broad range of knowledge that contains the seeds of its own expansion; (2) encourage the flow of curiosity across disciplines; and (3) give the creator the discipline and craft to make the barely glimpsed idea visible. Institutions should not be so consumed with measurements, says the author, that they do not allow for the unstructured time necessary for discovery and experimentation, to link previously unrelated elements, recognize emerging patterns and take risks, essential steps in the creative process. Colleges should also pay more attention to qualitative assessment, such as portfolios, poster sessions, presentations and performances. The myth of the lonely creator must yield to the understanding that creativity is a group activity, informed by past ideas, expressions and even failures. To support this process, faculty and administrators must see creativity as a value, teaching students not only how to think, but also how to think about thinking. They must be wise enough to know when to reward creative perception and when to challenge it; when to urge more freedom of thought and when to demand more discipline. They must develop a pedagogy of creativity.",

Now, 25 years later, demographic projections still don't draw much attention. But they should, especially from presidents and trustees of New England colleges, whose admissions offices are confronting a series of factors that constitute a demographic &quot;perfect storm.&quot; In this article, the author discusses the declining total number of students graduating from high schools, the growth in the number of women gaining access to higher education, and states discussing strategies for increasing the number of out-of-state students.

        "description":"Who are New England's future college students? What is the shape of the region's future educated workforce? The answers to these questions may be found in part in the region's high schools where each year, 150,000 or so graduating seniors decide whether and where to go to college. It's a group most states do not consult often enough as they forge higher education policies. Vermont, however, has been doing so for a quarter-century, and New Hampshire is now following suit. In the spring of 2002, a K-12 and higher education collaborative called the New Hampshire Partnership for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education Research (NH PAPER) piloted a survey modeled after Vermont's, asking seniors at 21 New Hampshire high schools about their postsecondary education and career plans and their perceptions of the education they received in high school. Last year, with support from the New Hampshire Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the Measuring Aspirations and Participation survey was administered statewide to 8,100 graduating seniors at 56 public high schools and eight private high schools. The New Hampshire initiative offers a unique opportunity for students to provide feedback on their high school experience and for administrators to gather important trend information and useful data for planning, revising and upgrading curriculum. Some schools have used the findings to make curricular and guidance adjustments necessary to meet the requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind Act. The survey provides the higher education community with valuable insights about student preparation and plans for higher education. It also promotes understanding of the &quot;pipeline&quot; to New Hampshire higher education and, to the extent that students who go to college in their home state are more likely to work in that state upon graduation, a glimpse of the state's future educated workforce. This article presents some key findings from the class of 2004 survey.",

        "description":"Quantifiable measures required by many state education laws and the federal No Child Left Behind Act may be driving out the innovative learning and pedagogy that help develop the creative right-brain thinking that Daniel Pink and others are calling for. \"Greater Expectations: A New Vision for Learning as a Nation Goes to College,\" a report issued by the American Association of American Colleges and Universities, outlines a methodology widely used in studio courses in the visual arts, music, theater and creative writing. The Critique Method essentially puts the student at the center of the learning process, expecting the student to be a passionate and committed creator, and requiring the student to produce a coherent and increasingly sophisticated body of work, subject to rigorous analysis and assessment by faculty-mentors, student-peers, and often outside experts. From teacher to learner, from lecturing to mentoring, from empowering the teacher to empowering the learner, from rote learning to critical thinking, the method insists that individual students demonstrate accountability for their own learning--for all students in all classes, not only in studio classes. An important question is whether essential characteristics of the Critique--which does these things so well--can be transferred and adapted to liberal arts as well as professional education in schools and colleges. This article discusses the experimental curriculum at the Boston Arts Academy (BAA), and advocates that experience to date at BAA suggests that learning and pedagogy in the arts can inform learning for a diverse population of students in many of the ways called for by the \"Greater Expectations\" report.",

        "description":"When visitors enter the offices of the Nellie Mae Education Foundation, they are often taken by the art on display. The collection is striking and vibrant. Like all good art, each piece makes a statement--sometimes quietly, but boldly. When foundation staff proudly tell guests that the exhibit was created by Boston high school students, the reaction is frequently one of astonishment. The artwork is the creation of student-members of Artists for Humanity (AFH), a nonprofit social enterprise whose mission is to provide urban youth with keys to self-sufficiency through paid employment in the arts. The foundation has partnered with the after-school arts program since 2000. At least once each year, foundation staff select pieces of work by the young artists for display in their Quincy, Massachusetts, office. The Nellie Mae Education Foundation provides grants to programs that take on some of the most critical obstacles to educational success, and one of its four areas of focus is after-school learning. Students who participate in after-school programs, especially underserved students, tend to be more engaged in learning, have improved attendance and grades, and higher achievement in reading and math. Long-term investments, such as the one the foundation makes in AFH, represent the best strategy for high-impact grantmaking. This article describes how AFH began and how it seeks to ensure that all young people have access to the life-changing experience of the creative process; the opportunity to hone their questioning skills and discover new forms of expression; and the chance to explore the arts as a valid career choice.",

They know the subtext: college is an investment, and the higher the education level one achieves, the higher one's potential income for life. So what about the education of artists? Most art departments and colleges educate for careers in the so-called &quot;applied arts.&quot; The majority are in design-based fields, and their graduates do, in fact, find financially rewarding careers. There is only one accredited art college in New England, however, that is &quot;fine arts only.&quot; In fact, there are only three nationally accredited fine-arts-only art colleges in the United States: the San Francisco Art Institute, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Of those three, the Lyme Academy--with only two B.F.A. programs, one in painting and the other in sculpture--is uniquely dedicated to classical, Renaissance traditions in drawing, printmaking, painting and sculpture. The Lyme Academy asserts the primacy of &quot;the hand of the artist&quot; in a culture that is becoming electronic and digital. It is, instead, committed to the foundational disciplines that led to creation of the images by which Western civilization defines itself, from Michelangelo to Picasso.",

        "author":["Mandle, Roger"],
        "description":"Institutions like Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) provide New England with cultural wealth in a variety of ways, including the great art and design housed in their museums and their vibrant faculty and student body, which numbers in RISD's case, 1,900 undergraduates and 375 graduate students from the United States and almost 50 countries. Traditionally, institutions have relegated their relationship with their neighbors to a discreet set of activities referred to as &quot;town-gown relations,&quot; but RISD considers itself an active participant in the ongoing redevelopment and future aspirations of the city. In the 1970s, Gerald Howes, a RISD architecture professor, conceived of a plan to change the fundamental structure and appearance of Providence. After the city relocated railroad tracks and uncovered a long hidden river running through its center, RISD found itself with a spectacular riverfront campus. RISD's reorientation to downtown Providence physically positions the college for direct collaboration with leaders of the city's business community, government officials, nonprofit organizations and local residents. This engagement has helped RISD to flourish and also helped revitalize the city. With a population of just over 175,000, Providence has the advantage of size. The city can claim an intimacy, a sense of community. So in addition to collaborating with the college's immediate neighbors, RISD faculty and staff engage in a multitude of conversations to improve the city, ranging from the Rhode Island Economic Policy Council's attempt to designate Providence a world design capital to the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council's debating of state budget issues to the CEOs for Cities and the Providence Foundation's work on revitalizing the city's downtown. RISD is committed to helping nurture Providence into a creative city that is competitive with any in the 21st century. What exactly can an institution of higher education bring to the infrastructure, the vitality of a city, and the quality of life for all its residents? This article describes RISD's contributions which take many forms.",

        "description":"Nestled in the valley between the Berkshire hills and the Taconic range, North Adams, Massachusetts, in many ways is typical of old New England mill towns working hard to create a new identity in the global economy. When Sprague Electric left town in 1985, the city of 16,000 reeled from the loss of 4,000 blue-collar jobs. This article describes how North Adams has been reinventing itself today as a center for arts, culture and the &quot;creative economy.&quot; The former Sprague site itself has been transformed into the world-class Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMoCA), which has served as a major catalyst in this new economy since opening five years ago. North Adams and surrounding communities have experienced an infusion of artists, writers, filmmakers and others who bring new ideas, new energy, a degree of wealth and a willingness to take risks. This increasingly creative and entrepreneurial economy, driven in part by the array of arts and cultural institutions across Berkshire County, will demand skills and educational levels that are different, but not wholly separate, from those that provided a foundation for success in earlier times. As the old electric supply plant has been reinvented as MassMoCA, the old Normal School has evolved into a modern state college offering a wide range of academic degree programs in the arts, sciences, humanities and business. Among these programs is Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts' (MCLA) Fine and Performing Arts Program, specializing in arts management, the visual arts, music and theatre. Recently, MassMoCA and MCLA have collaborated on projects and programs including student performances and partnerships with K-12. Leaders from MassMoCA and MCLA, who serve as important stakeholders in the Regional Competitiveness Council, the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority, the Berkshire Chamber of Commerce and the recent Northern Tier initiative are proposing initiatives involving public and private colleges from Boston to the Berkshires to prepare students to compete in this new economy. By itself, MCLA generates nearly $90 million for the local economy. Overwhelmingly, driving this vibrant local economy is the powerful and efficient three-cylinder engine of arts, culture and education.",

Pink, MBA graduates are, in many ways, becoming this century's blue-collar workers--people who entered a workforce that was full of promise only to see their jobs move overseas. At the same time, businesses are realizing that the only way to differentiate their goods and services in today's overstocked, materially abundant marketplace is to make their offerings transcendent--physically beautiful and emotionally compelling. As a result, Pink contends that the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) is the new MBA. This article presents an interview with Pink, a contributing editor at \"Wired\" magazine and former chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore. Pink is the author of \"A Whole New Mind,\" exploring \"six essential abilities that white-collar workers must master to survive in an outsourced, automated, upside-down world.\" His earlier bestseller, \"Free Agent Nation,\" looked at the growing numbers of people who work for themselves. In this interview, Pink talks about his views on the growing importance of the arts to the economy.",

        "author":["Woodbury, Robert L."],
        "description":"Almost 50 years ago, a New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) newsletter editorialized that &quot;institutions of higher learning must not become devices to reverse our historic trend away from a class society. We should continue to open wider doors of opportunity for students of genuine ability without regard to (family) income.&quot; The Higher Education Act of 1965, with its commitment of federal support to new need-based student aid programs, and subsequent legislation establishing Basic Grants, later renamed Pell Grants, seemed to confirm that aspiration. The years following NEBHE's founding saw a significant expansion in the number of citizens pursuing higher education. In recent years, however, that social contract between the government and the larger society to make higher education available without regard to family income, has become increasingly tenuous. Recent articles, books, and media reports document the proposition that the more competitive institutions, whether private colleges or public universities, have become &quot;bastions of privilege&quot; as much as &quot;engines of opportunity,&quot; and that over the past 25 years, the more competitive and wealthier institutions have become increasingly populated by the most economically advantaged students. Public institutions with their more limited resources and lower tuition have become the places of necessity for middle- and lower-income families, if they can afford college at all. The hardening of class lines in higher education has broader class implications because as the rewards for a college degree from a prestigious institution become increasingly valuable in the global economy, it is the already advantaged who reap the largest rewards from higher education. In addition, the quality of a liberal education at all institutions suffers when the economic diversity of the student body disappears. This article discusses the factors resulting to the growing stratification in higher education and steps that can be taken to reduce the gaps between rich and poor overall in the United States.",

        "description":"Midway through the first decade of the 21st century, New England innovation and creative capacity are being challenged by other regions of the nation and the world. New England needs foresight to understand what its emerging economic sectors need to thrive in a changing demography. The region is losing 20- to 34-year-olds and seeing a growing disparity in household incomes in every state. Some New Englanders are doing well; others are struggling. Some of its local governments offer the purest form of democracy in the world--the open town meeting--but reliance on local property tax creates pressure for ever-more growth to pay for local services. While New England states tend to &quot;go it alone&quot; in responding to change, there are some things governors and legislators should do to focus strength on cooperative action.

        "author":["Wilson, Blenda J."],
        "description":"If one was an African-American student in a large Northern city 50 years ago, his public school, very likely, would have been segregated--even in New England. Only one year earlier, in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that legally sanctioned school segregation violated the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Following the Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts took legislative action, recognizing that segregation in housing had restricted certain racial and ethnic groups, including African-Americans and Latinos, to neighborhoods whose schools were inferior to schools in predominately white communities. In 1965, Massachusetts Gov. John A. Volpe proposed and the state Legislature approved the Racial Imbalance Act, which prohibited racial imbalance and discouraged schools from having enrollments that are more than 50 percent minority. The state Board of Education required written desegregation plans from school committees in segregated cities, including Boston, Springfield and New Bedford. The Racial Imbalance Law, however, ran into staunch resistance in many parts of the state. One of the striking successes of Massachusetts legislative action was the creation of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO Inc.). This state-funded, voluntary education desegregation program helped eliminate racial imbalance by enabling children from Boston, and later from Springfield, to attend participating suburban public schools. METCO has been a key player in the regional battle for equal educational opportunity. The major policy advances of this new century contain a commitment to educate all children for a competitive world. In addition to historically underrepresented populations--African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans--New England is experiencing a large influx of immigrants from all over the world, including large numbers of school-age children from Brazil, Portugal, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and India. While these groups may live in relatively homogeneous neighborhoods more as a result of choice than discrimination, the educational challenge remains the same as the struggle of the past 50 years--to provide a high-quality education for all.",

        "description":"The message that college matters is getting through to more and more young people. Young people understand that a middle-class lifestyle increasingly requires at least an associate degree. Yet the percentage of college students actually completing a two- or four-year degree has not increased significantly in more than 30 years. College completion correlates highly with academic preparedness for college-level work. Yet, according to one study, only 32 percent of high school graduates are academically prepared for college-level work with no remediation. College readiness is inequitably distributed: the lower the family income, the more likely that the combination of family background, community of residence and school and teacher quality will leave one unprepared for college success. The majority of low-income young people who enter college are at best minimally qualified for college-level work. There is a need to overcome the long-standing separation between K-12 and higher education systems to reduce the high attrition among students before they complete college. Disconnects between these systems create significant obstacles to successful transitions through college, particularly for students with little family experience with college-going. At the same time, policy efforts to overcome that separation can make a large contribution to helping more young people make it through college. Increasingly, governors and state policymakers are reconceptualizing public education as a K-16 or PreK-20 \"pipeline\" rather than a set of distinct systems. The metaphor makes visible how students \"flow\" in and out of different institutions, at which points and for which students the leaks are most serious, and how to target institutional and systemic improvement efforts to plug the leaks. In this framework, high school completion becomes a means rather than an end, a transition point in the progression to a college credential. This article discusses a set of policy approaches that echo the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education's findings on how states can best pursue K-16 reform.",

        "description":"America's current systems of K-12 and higher education are based on the traditional view that only an elite group of students attends college. Today, the majority of students attend some form of postsecondary education after high school. These students encounter numerous challenges: many do not complete their programs of study, almost half the students in higher education require remediation, and college-going and completion rates are inequitable in terms of income level, race and ethnicity. As student demographics shift and students who have been traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education become the majority in the population, the United States could face an education crisis. To counter this trend, the author advocates connection of high school and postsecondary education standards, policies and practice. Much of this should occur at the state level and it must particularly affect the &quot;broad-access&quot; institutions, which admit almost every applicant and educate more than 80 percent of America's college students. Though students of all races and ethnicities may aspire to the same levels of education, the roadblocks along the way have different impacts on different groups of students, according to data from Stanford University's Bride Project and The Education Trust. To understand these issues more deeply, the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education and its partners analyzed state-level policies that facilitate, or undermine, student transitions from high school to college in four states: Florida, Georgia, New York and Oregon. The research revealed that four policy levers are particularly promising for states interested in creating sustained K-16 reform. This article discusses these policy levers which center on: (1) assessments and curricula; (2)finance; (3) data systems; and (4) accountability.",

To answer these questions, most institutions are speaking a new language. &quot;Student engagement, outcomes, assessment and culture of evidence&quot; have become familiar terms as administrators, faculty and staff become invested in how to better recruit, retain and graduate students in preparation for their roles as respectable members of the workforce and society. This article discusses issues of assessment, outcomes, student engagement and data which help campuses better understand the entire process of student life, from recruitment to graduation. Colleges that do not effectively use data, engage students and listen to their voices risk failure in meeting student satisfaction and expectations (as well as accreditation, membership in various associations and grant opportunities).

        "description":"In this article, the author shares the voices of adults whose lives have been changed by their enrollment in a set of innovative college readiness programs geared toward adults. These women and men have overcome obstacles between them and college that they believed were insurmountable--fear, inadequate academic preparation, lack of information about college and academia's expectations, lack of confidence. Until the 1970s, a high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, was seen as terminal, sufficient preparation for a good job and a middle-class life. The economy has changed dramatically. Today, adults with only a high school education are seriously handicapped in the job market and are hard-pressed to take care of a family. New England's economy will be handicapped unless a way is found to help those adults find their way into college. About six years ago, the Nellie Mae Education Foundation, in partnership with the New England Literacy Resource Center (NELRC), created a grant initiative to support adult basic education (ABE)-to-college programs. The ABE-to-College Transition Project is designed to inspire and support adult GED recipients, many of whom have been out of school for a while, to pursue postsecondary education. The project creates a bridge to college for capable but underprepared adult learners. Those who have enrolled in ABE-to-college transition programs struggle with many barriers including academic preparation and challenging lives. It is a testament to their desire to achieve and create a better life for themselves and their families that they took the risk to prepare for college.",

Low-income, rural students suffer many of the same social maladies--such as severe poverty and widespread drug abuse--as urban minority children, and they are comparably disadvantaged when it comes to college access. These students endure geographic and cultural isolation as well as the fallout from stagnant local economies. Most of the high schools are located in low-income, rural areas that face dwindling enrollments, budgetary cutbacks, high faculty-turnover rates and other significant challenges. Since 2003, the Great Maine Schools Project, a statewide high school reform initiative funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been working to strengthen Maine high schools and send more Maine students on to higher education.

Bottom Line typically ranks students across three categories when determining their level of need. The most common problem by far is that students are not academically prepared for the rigors of a college education. In some cases, they are not even close. The second biggest problem is that students are not ready to make the financial commitment to college. Finally, there are many students who will struggle with the social and emotional adjustment to college. Bottom Line recognizes the extent of the support that is needed and it has built a holistic program that helps students select &quot;the right&quot; school to attend and when they arrive on campus it provides a support network to help them stay in school and graduate.",

        "description":"The New England states face several challenges that test their ability to compete. These include ongoing economic globalization and technological change, the continued decline of traditional industries and slow labor force growth. Further, the region is aging and will experience low overall population growth, with increases occurring primarily among minority and immigrant populations whose postsecondary participation has been historically low. Adding to that mix a projected decline in the annual supply of high school graduates beginning in 2008 and the highest-in-the-nation college prices focuses the region-wide concern about whether New England will continue to have enough individuals with skills and credentials to compete in the global economy. In 2003, a gathering of concerned New Englanders--representing business, K-12 and postsecondary education, government and a variety of nonprofit organizations--created the region-wide initiative called the College Ready New England (CRNE) P-16 Alliance, whose development has been supported by the Nellie Mae Education Foundation. CRNE leaders spent much of 2005 charting initiatives to ensure that all New England students leave high school well-prepared for postsecondary success and to improve the college attendance and completion rates of underrepresented students, particularly low-income and minority students and first-generation college-goers. In this process, CRNE participants have looked closely at the six New England states and across the country to inform their work and find tested and cutting-edge practices, policies and programs to increase college readiness and success. From this, an integrated framework for pursuing statewide and region-wide initiatives has emerged.",

        "description":"This paper presents an interview with Douglas Brinkley, an award-winning author and historian and director of Tulane University's Theodore Roosevelt Center for American Civilization. His wide-ranging portfolio includes books on John Kerry and the Vietnam War, Ronald Reagan and D-Day, Rosa Parks, Henry Ford, Dean Acheson and Jimmy Carter. He is also editing Jack Kerouac's diaries, Hunter S. Thompson's letters and Theodore Dreiser's travelogue. Brinkley's latest book, &quot;The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast,&quot; is a narrative of the crisis before and after the monster storm, which he experienced firsthand. Before joining Tulane, he was a professor at the University of New Orleans and at Hofstra University, where his American Odyssey course took students across the United States to visit historic sites and meet figures in politics and literature. His 1994 book, &quot;The Majic Bus: An American Odyssey&quot; chronicled his first experience teaching the on-the-road class which was the model for C-SPAN's School Bus. This interview focuses on Katrina, history, and higher education.",

        "author":["Reville, S. Paul"],
        "description":"According to a February 9, 2006 \"New York Times\" story headlined, \"Panel Explores Standard Tests for Colleges,\" a new accountability era is descending upon a resistant higher education domain. The story describes the deliberations of a Bush-appointed commission considering imposition of standardized tests on college students. Ten days earlier, the \"Boston Globe\" reported that Massachusetts community colleges have a three-year graduation rate of 16 percent. Last year, the Education Trust launched a website (www.collegeresults.org) devoted to reporting graduation rates at all U.S. colleges, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender and income. Two primary features distinguish the new movement from existing reports such as Measuring Up and those issued by publications such as \"U.S. News and World Report\": first, the focus will be more on educational outcomes (as measured by such indicators as standardized tests and persistence in graduation rates) and second, there will be significant consequences based on performance. Observers have predicted that the accountability movement that has pervaded K-12 education over the past decade-and-a-half would, in time, arrive at the doorstep of postsecondary education. For most policymakers in the K-12 domain, strengthened accountability has become a precondition for funding increases. A similar political logic is now creeping into higher education funding debates, and higher education institutions seeking increased funding will have to accommodate the demands of the new accountability. The writer feels that the K-12 field has over-emphasized testing, and advocates that higher education leaders who do wish to have external measures imposed should embrace the new accountability movement and help shape it. Implications for post-secondary education are discussed.",

In the coming decade, meeting the human capital development needs of these firms and individuals will challenge New England's education and workforce development institutions. Indeed, education institutions need to likewise refocus on enabling the insight of individual learners. This article describes the forces that are driving the focus on the individual. It also describes the skills needs by individuals in order to cope with the demands of the innovation-driven economy. This article also suggests strategies for a new model of education that focuses on the individual learner: transformation of the senior year of high school; better integration of adult basic education, skills training and community college; and new tools to customize and navigate the higher education experience as a lifelong learning resource integrated with the workplace.

        "description":"The increasingly popular option of applying &quot;early decision&quot; (ED) requires a student to make a binding commitment that, if admitted to a particular college, she or he will enroll. Now offered by 184 U.S. colleges and universities, ED is a highly effective--and therefore highly seductive--tool for managing enrollment. This author argues, however, that it is not necessarily in the best interest of most students or their parents. A successful ED application commits a student to a particular school without knowledge of the likely financial aid package. Schools use different criteria to determine financial aid awards, and students who apply early sacrifice their ability to compare offers from multiple schools. Additionally, some institutions have discovered that their regular-decision applicant pool is stronger academically and more diverse than its early-decision pool. The author suggests that, if educators are sincere about broadening access to higher education for all, they need to lessen their reliance on early decision and instead encourage students, parents, and institutions to act thoughtfully and in the best interest of the student.",

At UConn, standard indicators of excellence such as SAT scores are at an all-time high across the entering class, and so is enrollment of historically underrepresented African-American and Latino students. UConn is also retaining and graduating minority students at rates that are among the nation's highest. The university has recorded a slight increase in the ethnic and racial diversity of the faculty. There is no magic formula for achieving inclusive excellence. In this article, the author discusses the following lessons from the UConn experience: (1) Diversity has to be a campus-wide priority; (2) An empowered, formal diversity infrastructure is essential; (3) Bubble-up energy and entrepreneurial strategies are essential to change; and (4) A shift in administrative systems is needed to accommodate the needs of historically underrepresented populations.",

        "description":"Undergraduate transfer is a messy and too-often frustrating part of college for faculty, staff and, above all, the students themselves. Students are discouraged by unclear and complicated curriculum requirements. Faculty are reluctant to accept courses from another institution and question the preparedness of transfer students. Advisors are diverted from assisting students by the administrative minutia of course equivalencies and articulation agreements. As a result, transfer is often perceived merely as a bothersome technical procedure and so it is devalued. This article focuses on vertical transfer from community colleges to senior institutions, as community college students still constitute the majority of transfer students and play a crucial access role for students underrepresented in higher education. It discusses a few of the practices and policies that could improve transfer rates for community college students to bachelor's-degree granting institutions.",

Half of the nation's nearly 1,000 community college presidents will retire over the next few years, according to some estimates. In addition, the senior administrators who might have been on track to assume these positions are themselves retiring, drying up the pipeline that used to ensure a steady flow of candidates from within, and creating vacancies in critical areas of campus leadership. Filling \"the leadership gap\" has reached a crisis point for community colleges nationwide.

        "description":"New England institutions have long been in the forefront of recruiting foreign students. Recently, the numbers of foreign students studying in the United States has declined partly as a result of visa problems, widespread perceptions that the United States no longer welcomes foreign students and increasing anti-Americanism abroad. The primary barrier to increasing numbers of foreign students, however, has been, and still is, lack of financing. Foreign students are not eligible for most forms of student financial assistance. The result is that a majority of international students in their colleges come from families that are able to pay full tuition. Studying at an American university has for the most part been a luxury item for non-U.S. families. The rapidly expanding middle class worldwide has largely been shut out of U.S. higher education because of financial constraints. However, this could change. The author states that a well-engineered cross-national student loan program could democratize and expand international student enrollment the way the early guaranteed student loan program expanded college opportunity for U.S. students. A number of fundamental changes abroad have made it possible to think about a loan program for foreign students coming to the United States.",

        "description":"One of the greatest challenges for a student today is how to live as a responsible citizen in a globalizing world. Today's interconnected world cannot afford bystanders or passive participants. It demands confident, skilled citizens who will make responsible choices that take into consideration how educators allocate resources and what impact their decisions will have on future generations. It is important to have citizens who make decisions marked by these characteristics: (1) intercultural understanding; (2) mindfulness; (3) partnerships; (4) pragmatic hope; and (5) social entrepreneurship. How can educators help students develop these capacities? Among other strategies, higher education must increase the number of students who study outside the United States as part of their formal education. Study abroad programs teach important intercultural and language skills, but the true success of a program occurs within a student, when she/he realizes that she/he can see the world from a different cultural viewpoint. This is true global citizenship. A study published in \"Transitions Abroad\" magazine by Mary Dwyer and Courtney Peters of the Chicago-based Institute for the International Education of Students documented strong and lasting impacts of study abroad. Years after students return, they continue to learn languages, are keenly aware of other cultures and are more confident and committed to a sensitive global point of view. There is a growing body of literature that documents these and other impacts. Yet far too few U.S. students study abroad--about 1 percent by most estimates--and the numbers are skewed to wealthier students from elite colleges and universities.",

Other students often find that they lack the language skills to qualify for many foreign programs or are unable to reconcile time abroad with curricular requirements at home. Less affluent students, moreover, often rule out foreign study from the start--as do many athletes, performers and campus activists who fear losing a competitive edge if they take time away from the local scene. Yet those who miss out on foreign exposure are often those who need it most. Fostering a globally sensitive public (and electorate!) requires not so much that French-lit majors spend a year in Paris, but that pre-med, pre-law and pre-business students are exposed to the sudden jolt of seeing their home culture in a new perspective, of encountering a different, wider world which stretches the mind and soul.",

        "description":"Conflict and inequality are growing overseas, and anti-American sentiment is growing with them. A recent survey of 350 returning study abroad students, conducted by the Glimpse Foundation, found that 37 percent felt discriminated against because of their identity as Americans, and 13 percent actually felt threatened because of their nationality. More than half the respondents to the Glimpse survey said that most locals who expressed negative attitudes towards and strengthen the United States differentiated between the American people and the American government. It is imperative that the United States reverse anti-Americanism while leading efforts to resolve the challenges facing the members of their global family. Americans are fortunate that the institution of &quot;study abroad&quot; is growing in popularity. It is one of the best ways to provide students with the knowledge and tools they will need to effectively mediate conflict and rapidly and compassionately respond to global crises. Study abroad students serve as &quot;de facto&quot; ambassadors for the United States while they are abroad, helping to explain their policies, politics and culture, and showing that there is often a difference between official America and Americans. Thus, to reduce global anti-American sentiment while leading efforts to resolve the challenges facing their global family, they must devote additional institutional resources to increasing study abroad participation and enhancing its value. They must also devote more resources to leveraging the knowledge garnered by those who study abroad and their enthusiasm for it. This will serve to open the eyes and minds of those who have not shared their experiences and inspire ever-more students to study abroad.",

        "description":"Many people in higher education are concerned about the declining numbers of foreign students attending New England colleges and universities. Restrictions on student visas since the September 11 terrorist attacks, along with increasing competition from higher education institutions across the country and around the globe, have both contributed to the decline. While New England higher education and economic leaders work to re-assert the region's magnetism abroad, there is also a need to refocus on the educational status of the 1.4 million foreign immigrants who already call New England home. According to a 2004 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, immigration is driving the region's population growth  and profoundly affecting the region's economic and demographic character. The first step to economic success for New England's immigrants is to obtain enough fluency in English to communicate easily. Language, however, is only one of the obstacles facing immigrants in American higher education. They are in unfamiliar territory and need special assistance  with such areas as admissions, financial aid, study skills, and career guidance. The author asserts that there is an obvious need for more ESOL programs, as well as programs designed intentionally to bridge identified education gaps and better prepare college faculty  to address the needs of foreign-born adult students.",

        "author":["Kennedy, Edward M."],
        "description":"In this new era of globalization, it is more important than ever for the American citizens to have a college education so they can obtain good jobs and have a fair chance at the American Dream, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to get such an education--including in New England. According to the most recent report of the College Board, the region's four-year colleges--both public and private--continue to be the most expensive in the nation. In this article, the author states that he welcomes the recent report by the secretary of education's Commission on the Future of Higher Education. He does not agree with all the commission's recommendations, but the report is helping create a better debate on higher education and its role in ensuring opportunity for all the citizens, and this discussion has great potential to improve the system of higher education. He supports the report's call for an increase in the Pell Grant, so that the average award will cover 70 percent of the typical tuition at a four-year public college. In New England, this increase would directly help more than 200,000 low-income beneficiaries of these grants--many of whom are the first in their families to attend college. After four years in a row of broken pledges from President Bush and the Republican Congress to raise the maximum Pell Grant, the commission's reaffirmation of this program as the foundation of the college aid system is a welcome development. However, he disagrees with the commission's suggestion that American citizens would pay for this increase by consolidating other federal grant programs. Thus, he states that instead of taking away funds that go directly to students, they should end the outrageous waste in the government's student loan programs, and use those savings to increase need-based aid.",

He particularly objects to the notion that college is simply high school for older kids. Approaches that have been used widely in the schools--such as high-stakes testing of general achievement--have limited utility in colleges where the academic aims and programs are far more diverse. Furthermore, metrics that are often cited in discussions of where higher education needs to improve may have exactly the opposite effect to that intended. The Spellings Commission and others speak of a need for universities to improve their graduation rates, but the metric often cited to measure this aspect of college success is outmoded and could actually lead to much lower accessibility, affordability and completion.",

For generations of New Englanders, a college education has provided the opportunity to fully embrace the American Dream.

        "description":"A college degree has become the ticket to the middle class. Yet, at the same time, the cost of achieving this milestone has increased considerably. For many students and families, the only way to meet the substantial cost of higher education is to take out loans. While some amount of debt may be acceptable--after all, it is important for students to be responsible for at least part of the cost of their educations--there is growing concern about the burden of college loans. There is little agreement about the significance of the increase in student debt. While some economists and other observers are concerned about the financial strain college graduates face, others believe the concern is exaggerated because earning a college degree is so valuable economically. Numerous studies document the fact that college graduates earn significantly more income than those with only a high school degree. But the debate about whether the value of a college degree justifies the increasing levels of debt obscures a critical point: many college students take on debt, but then leave college without earning a degree. Given that the debt burden has increased so rapidly in such a short period of time, the consequences of borrowing heavily to pay for college are not yet fully understood. However, the adverse consequences for students who do not finish their college degrees are clear. Growing expectations that students will incur debt to pay for their educations must be met with increased information about what students are buying.",

        "description":"In this article, the author explores ways to determine what students learn in college and how well colleges teach them. The author offers two markers--one for graduating students and one for the institution from which the students graduate. The first marker, a comprehensive examination in a student's major, would be required as a condition of graduation. The second marker would be comprised of a report from the institution, based on the transcripts of all graduates in a given year, that would cite the proportion of students who had reached key thresholds of essential knowledge and skills. Both of these indicators respect the central role of the academic disciplines and academic faculty in setting standards for degrees and letting employers know what they can expect of the knowledge and skills of all their graduates.",

        "description":"The number and complexity of state and federal regulations governing U.S. colleges and universities is on the rise. Consumerism, soaring tuition costs, burgeoning student loan debt and the high expectations of parents are all converging to put higher education under increased scrutiny. Two related issues: students feeling like they do not get their money's worth and dismay over excessive executive pay, exacerbate this situation. These two trends--educational malpractice and executive compensation--are interlocked. As students continue to pour money into their educations and take on mountains of debt, they increasingly feel as though they are not getting their money's worth. This discontent is fueled by stories about overpaid administrators who live the high life while students barely scrape by. The challenge for schools today is to find a way to break this cycle and avoid the litigation that will inevitably flow from it. In response, and in the interest of self-preservation, many colleges are adding layers of oversight to their executive compensation systems by using independent compensation committees, outside auditors and consulting firms. Meanwhile, Sarbanes-Oxley, the federal law designed to reform corporate America by enhancing \"transparency\" and accuracy in the accounting industry, casts a long shadow over the future of executive compensation in all fields.",

Like so many who have experienced success in the Commonwealth, and so many more who anxiously await their chance to do great things, Patrick understands the awesome transformative power of education. However, an extraordinary task lies ahead. Massachusetts has little connectivity and sporadic coordination between the three principal segments of the education pipeline. In this article, the author discusses the need for a new kind of conversation with the entire education community and the people of Massachusetts in order to build a coordinated education pipeline and develop policies that will address important educational issues.",

Initiative and creativity had shifted heavily from prospective grantee to grantor. As foundations embraced this funding-by-agenda, it burdened their relationship with colleges and universities, who still preferred to bring their own ideas to the table. Some cut back or completely eliminated their programs in higher education teaching and learning. They also turned increasingly to pre-college education, funding for which in absolute dollars increased twice as fast as that for colleges and universities between 1990 and 2004. Critics accuse foundations of myopia and too frequently abandoning programs. Foundation officials, however, prefer to talk about &quot;nimbleness&quot; and the ability to move quickly and address new issues, something they will be loath to give up. Universities, for their part, are not built to produce the quick results foundations often look for. In this article, the author hopes that foundations and higher education can improve their relationship, even around the thorny issue of teaching and learning.",

Instead of speed, RPM and engine temperature, dashboard reports display comparable measures of organizational performance and mission effectiveness. These key performance indicators (KPIs) are presented in consistent formats that enable institutional leaders to readily spot significant changes and trends. Like an automobile dashboard, these reports often display the equivalent of warning lights that flash on only when there is an impending problem or when certain variables stray outside of predetermined limits. In this way, the dashboard can serve as an early warning device alerting the board and senior administration when it might be important to dig deeper for greater insight. This article describes the two basic styles of dashboard reporting, namely, scorecard style and graphic style. It also discusses what to measure in a dashboard report and its benefits.

Classroom-level data were collected from teachers of a nationally representative sample of randomly selected classes in public and private elementary schools and randomly selected required health education courses in public and private middle/junior and senior high schools. Health topics analyzed included tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use prevention; accident or injury prevention; violence prevention; HIV, sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy prevention; nutrition and dietary behaviors; and physical activity and fitness. Participation in and desire for staff development on health topics were low. Staff development on health topics during the 2 years preceding the study was associated with teaching more health topics; for most topics at the upper grade levels, this association was independent of whether health education topics were within health infused classes or separate health education courses. At the upper grade levels, courses taught by teachers with degrees in health education were associated with teaching all health topics examined; however, for most topics, this finding was not significant when health infused versus separate health education courses were controlled.

As a stepchild of the medical and public health professions, we have inherited a preoccupation with physical health as the most worthy outcome measure for most of our programs. Yet other dimensions of health seem equally important and even essential to the overall well-being of program participants. There exists an opportunity for health educators to move toward models of health promotion that more fully appreciate the interconnectedness of various dimensions of health and that promote them evenhandedly. This article argues that spiritual health is an underlying dimension that contributes to social and emotional health, which in turn provide motivation for health behavior changes that determine physical and intellectual health. To the degree attained, physical and intellectual health become tools for realizing the purpose and meaning in life that the spiritual worldview portrays. Practical application of this model requires a partial break from the biological orientations of other health professions, new research agendas that clarify multidimensional health relationships, and new educational approaches that are capable of promoting positive outcomes in a variety  of health dimensions.

Also, published mail survey return rates significantly increased from 1990-1995 (M = 61.8%) to 1997-2002 (M = 65.5%). All of the journals had published a noteworthy percentage (10-26%) of their mailed survey research studies with return rates of less than 50%. Finally, there was not a significant association between sample size and return rates of published mail survey studies. Researchers reporting mail survey research results in health education journals should expect to have return rates of 60% or greater.

A content analysis of journals of the member organizations of the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations was conducted to discover whether there was a difference in the number of advocacy and policy initiative-related articles published between the 5-year periods immediately preceding and following this meeting. The titles and abstracts for all research articles and commentaries appearing in the \"American Journal of Health Education,\" the \"American Journal of Public Health,\" \"Journal of School Health,\" \"Health Educator,\" \"Health Education & Behavior,\" \"Health Promotion Practice,\" and the \"Journal of American College Health\" were examined using a 10-item descriptor code designed to measure advocacy and policy terminology. Intercoder reliability was 94%. Inference proportions analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the number of articles containing advocacy and policy related keywords (p less than 0.05) between the two time periods for only the \"American Journal of Health Education\" and the \"Journal of School Health.\" A variety of suggestions for increasing the number of advocacy and policy publications is recommended.

        "description":"This article describes the development and validation of an instrument designed to measure the concept of intuitive eating. To ensure face and content validity for items used in the Likert-type Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), content domain was clearly specified and a panel of experts assessed the validity of each item. Based on responses from 391 university students in the United States, the IES was evaluated for internal consistency and reliability using cross-tabulations, factor analysis, test-retest correlation coefficients, and logistic regression techniques. The factor solution isolated four factors that replicated scale construction, including intrinsic eating, extrinsic eating, antidieting, and self-care with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.42 to 0.93. Retesting after 4 weeks (N = 285) yielded correlation coefficients that ranged between 0.56 and 0.87. The presence of theorized relationships between IES scores and certain demographic and lifestyle variables (obesity, presence of an eating disorder, gender, and restrictive dieting) adds support for concurrent validity. IES subscales also correlated significantly with the Cognitive Behavioral Dieting Scale in predicted directions, suggesting convergent validity. Findings provide tentative support for the use of the IES in identifying intuitive eating attitudes and behaviors among college populations. Implications for practice, theory, and future research are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Results indicated that significant nutritional improvements in girls and physical activity improvements in boys were realized. The majority (76%) of participants expressed that their media messages had made a positive difference in their school and the program enhanced their advocacy skills.

        "description":"Promoting the development of positive interpersonal communication skills has been identified as one of the National Health Education Standards. The propensity to feel shame has been linked to ineffective conflict resolution and is a key component in the development of certain destructive behavioral patterns. This study sought to determine the differences between shame proneness and guilt proneness on measures of constructive and maladaptive responses to anger among a population of students at two large universities. The results of this study indicated that shame proneness was positively correlated with anger arousal, whereas there was no correlation between guilt proneness and anger arousal. Additionally, shame prone individuals were more likely to select maladaptive, nonconstructive interpersonal responses to anger-eliciting scenarios, while guilt prone individuals were more likely to choose adaptive, constructive responses. Although shame proneness has been identified as a factor in several destructive behavioral patterns, the core issue is the effect of shame on a person's ability to effectively communicate in interpersonal relationships. A discussion of shame and related skill development could be incorporated into existing interpersonal communication teaching strategies. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Data analyses were conducted to compare 20 years of pregnancy rates among girls aged 14-17 years for Bamberg County, the original three comparison counties, and the rates for the state of South  Carolina from 1981 to 2000. Bamberg County had 3 consecutive years statistically higher than the state and the three comparison counties from 1981 through 1983, but never thereafter. When regressing pregnancy rates on the passage of time since 1980, the state of South Carolina, Bamberg County, and Williamsburg County showed statistically significant declining slopes to their trend lines, whereas Lee and Clarendon Counties did not show any significant trend whatsoever. This data analysis documents the sustained reduction of adolescent pregnancies in Bamberg County among girls aged 14-17 years during the time period from 1981 to 2000, which are most likely attributable to the continued presence of the School/Community Program from October 1982 to the present time. Sustainability of the program is attributed to community readiness for such a program, adequate funding, staff stability, competent leadership, comprehensive program planning, policy changes, and implementation of theory-based &quot;best-practice&quot; interventions.

These variables included articles published; journal editorships; external funding of research; student activity; student/faculty ratio; mentoring and placement of doctoral students; and student support. Twenty-four of the 39 doctoral programs in health education participated in this study. Seventeen programs had at least 1 variable ranked in the top 10, and all but 1 program had at least 2 variables ranked in the top 20. Correlation analysis of the 7 variables provided additional insights. As in the Notaro, O'Rourke, and Eddy study, the faculty variables were not statistically significantly related to the student variables. Consistent with the literature, programs with a larger number of faculty tended to have a higher ranking than programs with a smaller number of faculty.

Reports indicate that even sub-clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression can negatively influence life satisfaction and performance. Mental health experts are calling for more efforts to address these concerns among college and general populations. This study examined the effect of two, 15-week courses for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms in functional college students. Twenty-seven participants in a mental health skills course practiced cognitive-behavioral, relaxation, and lifestyle skills. Eighty-six participants in a conventional, stress management course were taught stress theory and practiced relaxation and lifestyle skills. The Spielberg Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory II were used to assess the students' mental health before and after the intervention. An ANCOVA at posttest revealed significantly greater reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms among participants in the mental health skills course. Success with the cognitive-behavioral approach used in the course lends support for the recommendation that educators be trained to adapt some of these skills to classroom settings. Additional research is needed to isolate the most powerful components of the course. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

The association of participation in the extracurricular activities component of the DARE Plus project with adolescent substance use is investigated. The  intervention targeted the class of 2005 from seventh to eighth grade (1999-2001). As part of the intervention, students participated in extracurricular activities planned by peer leaders, and annual surveys measured substance use and psychosocial outcomes. After 2 years students overall and boys participating in extracurricular activities had significantly less alcohol use and fewer intentions to use alcohol than did nonparticipants. Asian American  participants had significantly less tobacco use and fewer intentions to use tobacco compared with nonparticipants. The results suggest an association between extracurricular activity participation in DARE Plus and lower rates of substance use, especially among boys, and suggest that such participation can be helpful for youth of varying ethnicities.

Because college marks a time when life patterns are established, a college population was chosen. A cohort of 524 northeastern U.S. college students completed the 48-item Life Attitude Profile-Revised (LAP-R) in the fall semester, 2002. Overall, results revealed that these students demonstrated a moderate degree of spirituality, with females indicating a higher measure of spirituality than males. Also, females in this study were found to have clearer goals and a keener sense about why they are \"here.\" Males, on the other hand, were less satisfied with life, suggesting that they were searching for their identity. These findings imply that health educators may need to help students, particularly males, search for and enhance their degree of spirituality in order to be healthier and to establish positive life patterns for adulthood. A \"spiritual norming\" campaign may be helpful for these students. (Contains 3 tables.)",

In this address, the author reflects on his life, acknowledges the individuals that contributed to his success, discusses the current condition of health education, stresses the need for a new health education paradigm, and talks about the future of health education. Dr. Glover hopes that the fundamental act of admitting that quality research and research training for health educators are critical for their future might set in motion the necessary chain of events and processes to solve or improve their current predicament. He encourages health educators to not only dream of the future, but also confront and plan for the future. He says changing one's thinking, adopting a new research paradigm, moving out of one's comfort zone, being open to the future, and dreaming of the future are supremely courageous paths to follow, for they are often met with criticism.",

One hundred thirty two program heads/coordinators of health education programs listed in the \"AAHE 2001 Directory of Institutions\" completed a mailed 45-item survey on hiring criteria and procedures. Results indicated that 90% of programs had conducted a search since 1995 with 71% hiring a faculty member. Twenty nine percent were unable to complete their search due to lack of quality candidates, funding issues or other reasons. While 62% required interview candidates present research at the interview, only 36% required candidates to teach an actual class. The hiring criteria perceived as most important were: desire to teach, health education doctorate, teamwork willingness, demonstrated teaching/presenting ability, and teaching experience. In addition, differences existed based on program type. Programs with graduate degrees had significantly greater numbers of tenure track positions and positions held by tenured faculty, individuals with doctoral/terminal degrees in health education, and individuals with CHES certification. Programs offering graduate degrees were significantly more likely to place emphasis on research experience while programs offering only undergraduate degrees were more likely to place emphasis on teaching experience. Based on these findings, programs may wish to examine possible incongruities between their hiring criteria and actual interviewing procedures. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Students were asked if they had ever had sexual intercourse (yes/no) and if they had participated in sexual intercourse in the last month (yes/no). Respondents also indicated on a four-point scale their response to the statement &quot;It is against my values to have sex as an unmarried teenager.&quot; Data were analyzed using a 2x4 (behavior x values) ANOVA for each of the three area specific self-esteem scores (peer, school, and home). Results indicated that students who had participated in sexual intercourse had significantly lower scores in school and home self-esteem than those who had not participated. In addition those who &quot;strongly agreed&quot; with the values statement and indicated they had not had intercourse had the highest school and home self-esteem scores. Those who strongly agreed with the values statement but indicated they had participated in sexual intercourse had the lowest school and home self-esteem scores. This behavior x values interaction was significant for sexual intercourse--ever, and for school self-esteem and sexual intercourse in the last month. No difference was seen in peer self-esteem scores by behavior nor were there behavior x values interactions. (Contains 2 tables.)",

An increase in cross-sectional surveys which was offset by a decrease in review articles over the study period characterized almost all of the descriptive study designs. Analytic study designs were represented primarily by clinical trials and quasi-experiments. Their use did not significantly increase over the study period. While descriptive statistics were present in over 83% of the articles, many other articles relied on statistics beyond the descriptive statistics, such as statistics associated with model validation (33.1%), the chi-square test (25.4%), ANOVA (17.2%), T-test/Z-test (16.9%), the Pearson correlation coefficient (15.3%), and the F-test (13.1%). Beyond these, no other statistical methods stand out from the rest as being favored among the authors of the \"Journal.\" Epidemiologic statistical methods were less frequently used. The estimated annual percent change in the percentage of studies not employing statistical methods was -12.71 (95% CI: -23.23, -0.76). A significant increase in use was observed for measures of central tendency/dispersion, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and the use of validity/reliability statistics for instrument validation.

Students (age 18-24) were recruited from a major university in the southeastern United States to participate in a Web-based survey during spring 2003 (N=440). About 21% of the students reported previous voluntary HIV tests. Reliability of the overall knowledge test demonstrated good internal consistency (alpha=0.71). Students scored higher on items related to HIV/AIDS in general (percentage correct=82.3%) and lower on items related to HIV testing (percentage correct=70.8%). Subjective rating on HIV testing knowledge (mode=low) was also lower than that of HIV/AIDS in general (mode=medium). Although analyses of knowledge and prior testing revealed significant associations, when using both objective and subjective knowledge in predicting prior HIV testing, only subjective HIV testing knowledge revealed a significant coefficient (odds ratio=2.63). Results indicated both objective knowledge scores and subjective knowledge rating were low. Continued efforts on HIV education and prevention are needed among young college students. HIV prevention programs focusing on encouraging HIV testing should pay special attention to participants' subjective knowledge related to HIV testing. The study has implications for using Web-based surveys to assess the effectiveness of Internet-delivered HIV prevention programs. (Contains 5 tables.)",

In some cases volunteer programs may simultaneously improve individual health, benefit the environment and increase the public's opportunities for physical activity. From a survey of 2,032 respondents, results suggest that volunteers are more likely to meet physical activity recommendations than non-volunteers. Moreover, those who volunteer on environmental issues are 2.6 times as likely to meet physical activity recommendations as those who do not volunteer for these issues. Policies that support volunteer opportunities involving environmental projects such as maintaining trails, planting trees and cleaning parks, may be important for individual fitness because of their potential for high levels of physical activity. Volunteer activities that produce personal health benefits fit well within the actions of a comprehensive health promotion effort and health educators are well positioned to partner with volunteer programs. Moreover, this promising practice serves as an opportunity for health educators to be effective consumers of health promotion research. Health educators are encouraged to seek partnership opportunities on future studies to clarify the role that volunteer programs requiring physical activity may play in promoting or maintaining health.

Participants completed a group-administered Theory of Planned Behavior-based questionnaire. The majority of the participants, 94.8%, reported that they currently drank some kind of milk. Of those who reported that they drank milk, 68.2% reported that they currently drank reduced-fat milk or skim milk. Attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were each significant predictors of intention to drink reduced-fat milk and together explained 62% of its variance. The strongest predictor was attitude, followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norm. Taste and possible health benefits were the primary predictors of attitude; parents, siblings and doctors' opinions predicted subjective norm; and availability of reduced-fat milk at home and school predicted perceived control. These findings may guide health professionals in planning programs intended to increase reduced-fat milk consumption among male adolescents. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Since Congress passed .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) as the national standard for impaired driving in October 2000, 28 U.S. States including Indiana have enacted .08 BAC law. This study investigated perceived impact of the .08 law among Indiana residents and their attitudinal and perceptional changes since the enforcement of the law. The focus of this study was to examine demographic differences in these changes. Using random-digit dialing  that included unpublished numbers and new listings, a representative sample of 525 adult Indiana residents ages 18 or older was interviewed. Of the total respondents, 61% (n=320) reported having 12 or more drinks in a year, 15% (n=81) reported a decrease in the number of alcohol drinking occasions compared to their drinking behavior before the passage of the .08 law and 30% advocated further reduction of the legal limit of impaired driving below .08 g/dl, which reflects the perception of increased safety. Even though 38% of the total respondents expressed that the BAC law should be enforced only when drinking and driving was a factor in an accident, 75% acknowledged that their driving skills became worse after consuming a couple of drinks. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses indicated  that gender, education and income were significant predictors for the majority of attitudinal and perceptional outcome variables regarding drinking and driving or .08 BAC law whereas race/ethnicity, age, employment status, religion and political views contributed little to the prediction.

        "description":"Rates of overweight children and adolescents have nearly tripled over the past 30 years. Many barriers exist to healthy eating and physical activity for children and adolescents, including factors in the school and community environment. It is these modifiable school environmental factors that led to the development of the Nutrition Friendly Schools and Communities (NFSC) model to prevent the development of overweight in children and adolescents. Development of the NFSC model built upon the Coordinated School Health Program, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, Participatory Research, and Empowerment Evaluation. The purpose of the NFSC environmental intervention is to actively engage the school community to prevent overweight in students through a multi-level participative intervention that facilitates coordinated changes in the school environment in the following areas: health education, physical education, health services, food services, school policy, staff wellness, psychosocial services, and family/community involvement. The NFSC model is the basis by which school communities develop a plan and evaluation that lead to a healthy school environment and prevent the development of overweight in children. A pilot study of the NFSC model is currently being conducted in eight low-income, minority, urban schools. This paper describes the development of the NFSC model and criteria.

The results indicate 10.3 % of college students (6.2% male and 12.6% female) reported ever having been diagnosed with depression. Of those ever diagnosed with depression, 39% were diagnosed in the last year, 27% were currently in therapy, and 34% were currently taking medication for depression. Results from the logistic regression analyses demonstrated that female, white, gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender, or those students in an emotionally abusive relationship were predictive for having ever been diagnosed with depression and current diagnosis for depression. Results also demonstrated that health educators and student health center medical staff are rated by college students as the most believable sources of health information. Health educators are on the first line of defense, along with medical professionals, for conveying believable health information. Health educators should be aware of the proportion of college students having ever been diagnosed with depression, inform students of the symptoms of depression, and encourage students to seek help from appropriate campus and community services.

Data were collected from a convenience sample of undergraduate students (n = 408) at a southeastern university. Students voluntarily completed a questionnaire in a regular classroom setting. The questionnaire elicited information regarding the frequency of attendance at religious services, perceived strength of religious feelings, perception of God's view of sex, and participation in the following sexual behaviors: sexual intercourse (ever, last year and last month), giving oral sex (ever and last month), receiving oral sex (ever and last month), and anal sex (ever). Data were analyzed using both univariate analysis (chi-square and analysis of variance) and logistic regression. Results indicated that religiosity variables, especially frequency of religious attendance and religious feelings, were significant predictors of sexual behavior.

The ordering of these statistical measures in terms of ease in understanding was total number of disease cases, risk ratio,  percentage of disease cases, ratio lifetime risk, lethality, and finally percentage lifetime risk. Students who identified total number of disease cases as the best statistical measure for motivating behavior change were also significantly more likely to identify that measure as the easiest, of those considered, to understand.

Such values as sanctity, equity, fraternity, paternity and liberty affect circumcision rates in America. The value of sanctity allows freedom of religious beliefs and traditions that often overcome medical impetus in decision-making with regard to circumcision. A lack in the value of equity allows socioeconomic status and cost to impact  whether or not babies are circumcised. The value of fraternity allows individual and population benefits through decreased urinary tract infections and decreased sexually transmitted infection transmission. The value of paternity allows the attempt to protect newborn males, an effort inherent with risk. Circumcision is an elective surgery, and the value of liberty continues to allow Americans to determine their own stance and action regarding circumcision. The use of this procedure must be evaluated on an individual basis. Unbiased, comprehensive preoperative information must be provided to ensure informed decisions. Education is the key toward a decision about the value of circumcision, and health educators play a pivotal role in the informed decision-making process.",

A randomized factorial design study was conducted testing a communication skills intervention against an information-based intervention, a combined intervention and a control condition. Parents receiving the communication skills intervention reported higher efficacy to communicate with the physician (p = 0.021). Interaction between the communication skills and information interventions were observed for specific treatment expectations prior to the visit (p = 0.049). The communication skills intervention was protective against antibiotic prescribing (p = 0.042). Satisfaction was positively associated with parents' efficacy to community (p = 0.002) and when an antibiotic was not prescribed (p = 0.005). Interventions using information to reduce antibiotic use may be based on the false assumption that such approaches are sufficient for motivating appropriate health practices. Using demonstrated behavior changes approaches to promote communication behaviors by parents might result in the dual benefits of reducing unwarranted antibiotic use and improving satisfaction with the clinic visit.

Body Mass Indices (BMI) were calculated from self-reported height and weight. Ninety-fifth percentile and above was classified as obese; [less than]95th percentile was classified as non-obese. After controlling for age, sex and race, odds ratios were calculated for obesity and hours/day of television viewing on an average school day. Five or more hours of television viewing on an average school day roughly doubles the risk of obesity. This holds for both males and females. Moreover, these data show a linear trend toward obesity as daily television viewing increases. These data confirm--at the national level--the earlier regional studies linking television viewing to obesity.

Several constructs of the social cognitive theory were used to design a classroom-based high school asthma education curriculum and to determine if the curriculum would improve asthma knowledge and attitudes among 10th grade students, as well as improve the quality of life, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors among asthmatic students. Using a nonequivalent control group design with delayed intervention (three-week delay) in one group, we surveyed a sample of 122 10th grade health academy students. Twenty-four students (20%) reported having doctor-diagnosed asthma. Statistical data analysis determined that asthma knowledge mean scores and self-efficacy mean scores significantly improved for students who received the curriculum. Most students held favorable attitudes towards asthmatics before the intervention, with a slight decrease in positive attitudes after the intervention. There were also slight, insignificant improvements in quality of life among asthmatic students. This study demonstrated that the asthma curriculum improved knowledge among asthmatic and non-asthmatic students and self-efficacy among the asthmatic students. Asthma education, based on a theoretical framework, can be effectively incorporated into a traditional high school curriculum. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In this study, we examined data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to determine whether alcohol-related risk behaviors among students are associated with population density. We found that in 2003, only driving after drinking alcohol varied by population density; that is, students in urban communities were significantly less likely to report this behavior than students in rural communities. Temporal trend analyses of 1993-2003 national YRBS data suggested varied patterns in alcohol-related risk behaviors among students attending urban, suburban and rural schools. Given that alcohol-related risk behaviors are high overall, these findings suggest the need to examine school and community policies and programs designed to discourage such behaviors in all population density categories.

        "description":"Culturally diverse students, as a collective group, are a sizable and growing population. Large numbers of students with language and cultural experiences different from the mainstream population will continue to enter schools in growing numbers throughout the next decades. Historically, their level of academic achievement has lagged significantly behind that of their English language-dominant peers. If schools are to meet the challenge of educating culturally diverse student populations, teachers must embrace instruction and curricula that engage and encourage all students. This article gleans from the discussed research ten strategies that all school health education teachers should utilize in their language- and learning-diverse classrooms that can increase the learning, achievement and success of English Language Learners (ELL) and other low-literacy students. Some of these strategies include: linking health concepts with the students' backgrounds, providing appropriate speech for ELL students, incorporating scaffolding techniques, using hands-on materials and/or manipulative for practice, clearly defining the language objectives, and providing multiple avenues for assessing learning. Many mainstream health education teachers who utilize these specific strategies report that all of their students experience a higher level of performance.",

This study examined the relationship between cheating and lying behaviors and constructs previous research has shown to be associated with health behaviors. Participants in the study were 700 students in grades 6-12 from a single southern school district. The questionnaire included items dealing with health and character issues, self-esteem, educational expectations/life goals, self-efficacy scale, and religious beliefs. Results indicated that substantial numbers of students had participated in the following undesirable behaviors in the last year: told lies to stay out of trouble (83.95%), told lies to keep someone else from getting in trouble (70.68%), cheated on an examination in school (47.54%), stole one or more items from stores (17.29%), and stole items from an individual (24.51%). Those who thought these behaviors were wrong were significantly less likely to have engaged in these behaviors. A variety of negative behaviors were related to religious feelings, religious behaviors and educational expectations. Logistic regression results indicated that, of the self-esteem subscales, school self-esteem made the most consistent contribution to distinguishing between students who had engaged in lying, cheating, or stealing and those who had not engaged in these behaviors. Results indicate a high rate of occurrence of some of these undesirable behaviors, highlight the relationship of the home, school, peers, and religion to these behaviors, and have implications for the development of intervention programming.

The field seems to be moving toward a skills-based philosophy, but the adoption of this approach is taking place with little discussion or analysis in the professional health education literature. The purpose of this article is to propose an integrated behavioral alternative to the present skills-based trend and to encourage the health education profession to examine school health education philosophy critically. The nature and scope of the educational reform that is sweeping the country makes the need for a critical examination of school health education philosophy, with accompanying dialog about goals and purposes, crucial to the growth and viability of school health education. \"...it is suggested that health education be concerned with cognitive development while leaving attitudinal development and behaviors to other institutions in our society.\" \"Although in the long run health education must contribute to people's health...its specific goal is to improve people's health behaviour and the measure of effectiveness is to be sought in changes of behaviour...\" \"I propose that health education be considered a process in which the goal is to free people so that they may make health-related decisions based upon their needs and interests as long as these decisions do not adversely affect others.\" \"Health literacy requires educators to switch from a content-driven to a skills-driven approach. Young people need to learn, practice and apply skills successfully, numerous times, with positive reinforcement and social support to maintain personal health and safety.\" \"The role of the health educator is to motivate students to put into practice what is learned in class, while at the same time teaching moral responsibility, conscience, and self-discipline.\" \"...we should be including not only self-help/self-care, but also the promotion of a healthful environment, a safer work place, a caring medical care system; the promotion of public participation; the development of healthful public policy, a community approach to health status improvement, a caring and sharing philosophy, and not a focus that is overly reliant on individual effort.\"",

Nearly three-fifths reported they \"walked or biked for at least 30 minutes at a time\" on 3 or more of the preceding 7 days (MOD). Those reporting VIG were more likely to be younger Caucasian males. Those reporting MOD were more likely to be younger Caucasian females. Gender, race, being an intercollegiate athlete, and belonging to a fraternity or sorority were predictors of VIG. Gender, age, race, and being an intercollegiate athlete were predictive of MOD. These results are in agreement with other studies on the correlates of physical activity among college students.

This study identifies alterable determinants of Pap smear screening for Latino women living in a rural area of California. It involved the design and pilot testing of a culturally appropriate instrument and the development of semi-structured interviews with 51 Latinas. Qualitative data were analyzed using NUD*IST. Results from this study indicate that the main factors identified by participants as hindering their decision to seek Pap smear exams were long waiting periods, a lack of continuity of care, a perceived lack of quality of care, language differences, and a lack of knowledge regarding how to access the health system. This article provides health educators working in health care settings with an analysis of the cultural and logistic factors influencing health-related decisions in immigrant and rural Latino populations.

Alcohol use is associated with high-risk behaviors and is a leading cause of death among adolescents. Research indicates that alcohol advertising influences drinking intentions for children and adolescents. Using content analysis of 486 advertisements, the focus of this study was to analyze persuasive themes and responsibility messages in alcohol advertising from a popular youth-oriented magazine over a three-year period. Findings indicate that product quality, humor, sex appeal, romance/relationships, and hanging out/partying were the most frequently used persuasive themes. Nearly 75% of advertisements included a responsibility message, but less than 1% included statements warning against underage drinking or encouraging the use of a designated driver. Chi-square analysis indicated a relationship between persuasive themes and the presence of responsibility messages. Given the susceptibility of youth to the emotional appeals of advertising, health education implementing media literacy and advocacy strategies can inform adolescents of the persuasive techniques and mixed messages used in advertising, and help develop skills to decrease their susceptibility to them.

        "author":["Balog, Joseph E."],
        "description":"Many health educators view health as a subjective, comprehensive and multidimensional construct, such as the WHO concept that defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. This paper, through a philosophical analysis, demonstrates that health is not multi-dimensional and is a natural phenomenon. A philosophical discussion contends that health must realistically and logically reside in the person and this requires it to be a physical state. This paper also illustrates that in the language of health, many health educators: (1) confuse what is desired and valued as a good life to mean what is good health; (2) fail to recognize the vital distinction between what affects health and what is health; and (3) inappropriately view health as a subjective human construct as opposed to viewing health as an objective phenomenon. To stimulate discussion, a philosophical analysis of health is presented about the meaning of health. This view argues that health is a state of physical well-being or physical fitness that is defined by how well the body is functioning in accordance with its natural design and how well this natural design affords individuals the ability to achieve essential functional objectives of humans on a biological and \"person\" level.",

Using a prototypical case example based on the authors' experiences with farm families through community health screenings, the learning theories of behaviorism, constructivism, transtheoretical model of health behavior change, and social ecological theory are examined. The four theories are described and the family's attitudes and health behaviors are interpreted from each perspective. Case-specific examples of how the learning theories can be used to motivate change and promote health-seeking behavior are provided. Guidelines are offered that have heuristic and practical utility for educators and students in applying learning theory to health promotion interventions. (Contains 1 table.)

Population level interventions that aim to moderate obesigenic environments have been proposed but remain largely unimplemented. Standard individual level interventions that focus on dietary restraint have been ineffective and in some cases harmful. Intuitive eating, an anti-dieting strategy that relies on recognizing and responding to internal hunger and satiation cues, has been proposed as an alternative approach to healthy weight management at the individual level--but it remains largely untested. This study evaluated the relationship between intuitive eating and various health indicators among female college students. As measured by the Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), it was found that intuitive eating was significantly correlated with lower body mass index (r = -0.576), lower triglyceride levels (r = -0.408), higher levels of high density lipoproteins (0.437), and improved cardiovascular risk (r = 0.425). Findings provide tentative support for intuitive eating as a positive approach to healthy weight management at the individual level. Implications and future research needs are discussed.

Benefits of individual membership may include continuing education, networking, leadership, professional recognition, advocacy, professional mobility, access to research findings, advances in the profession, service opportunities, and the ability to help shape the future direction of the profession. The purpose of this study was to analyze membership and involvement in professional associations and identify implications for marketing and sustained membership. The study sample was randomly selected from the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. database. The sampling frame was certified health education specialists living in the United States. Statistical analysis was delimited to respondents who were currently employed. Data were collected using an 88-item self-administered questionnaire. No dominant professional association exists at the national level as evidenced by the finding that together, APHA, SOPHE, and AAHE capture 55% of the national market. The most common reasons for membership in professional associations include: maintaining CHES certification, advancing the profession, and networking. Based on survey findings, health educators must recommit themselves to increased involvement in associations, and professional associations must take a proactive marketing position to strengthen current and future membership.

To date, research studying parental involvement in their children's schooling included elementary through middle school aged populations. There have been a few studies that explored parental involvement of preschoolers. Yet relatively few studies have investigated the African American parents' motivation for involvement in their young children's education. This research intends to fill this gap. It explores parents' motivation to be involved in a family education program, and examines their views about their children's education. Because of the significance of parental involvement, it underscores the importance of continued attention to more research in this area and careful delineation of conceptual and theoretical foundations to inform educational practice. This research draws upon theory to support the findings. Recommendations are provided to further program effectiveness and practice, as well as encourage parental involvement, inform program development and strategic planning. (Contains 1 table.)",

Some suggest that the problems associated with the academic under-achievement of many African-American students are perhaps the most pressing issues facing both educators and researchers. Much research has ensued designed to understand and intervene in the academic challenges of many African-American children. However, despite decades of discussion and governmental intervention, the academic achievement gap persists. It appears that most educators are far too ignorant as it pertains to the nature of the problem and how to meaningfully intervene therein. What teachers need to know is that the African-American historical culture--the culture that continues to influence African-American thought and behavior--has characteristics that encourage African Americans to resist the American educational process. Further yet, the African-American culture that was founded during the American slavery of the African caused the African American to believe in his/her inherent intellectual inferiority--which exacerbates and perpetuates the obstinate, unforgiving, academic achievement gap.

        "description":"One of the most serious problems plaguing in the field of gifted education is the need for the development of appropriate programs and identification procedures for gifted and talented students from different culturally and diverse backgrounds. Therefore, there has been increased attention and efforts devoted to the academic needs of gifted and talented children from different culturally and diverse backgrounds. One impediment to good teacher judgment about gifted and talented but culturally different students may very well be negative teacher attitudes toward children from diverse cultural backgrounds. Social class may also serve as a basis for stereotyping and several investigations have documented the negative stereotypes which portray lower-class students. In a study that investigated the role of the student socioeconomic status (SES) and teacher efficacy in the special education referral decisions, it was found that student SES and teacher efficacy interact in their influence on special education referral decision. Additionally, children described as low SES were more likely to be referred for restrictive placements in special education programs than their peers who described as high SES in the case study. It is apparent from the review of the relevant literature that SES was a significant factor that affects teachers' educational decision making. Additionally, previous research studies which examined the role of socioeconomic in gifted education were limited to relationships data. No empirical study has been found that investigated the effect of the child's SES on teachers' referral and recommendation for placement in the gifted and talented program. Therefore, the particular focus of this study is to examine the effect of SES on teachers' eligibility decisions in the gifted and talented program. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the student's SES on teachers' referral and recommendation for placement in the gifted and talented program.

        "description":"Concern for the status of linguistic minority education in Idaho provided motivation to investigate the perceptions of the inservice educators who work most closely with a large proportion of English language learners (ELLs) in the rural state's public schools. This study sought to learn directly from the state's ELL educators what they perceived as the greatest challenges and needs for improvement of ELL education. The investigation aimed to directly solicit solutions and priorities from participants in order to design professional development for the short term, and to rethink teacher education in a proactive mode for the long term. The study found that the greatest challenges affecting ELL education were educators' qualifications, understaffing of ESL and bilingual educators, and extra duties. Inservice practitioners need professional development to compensate for knowledge and skills not obtained during the teacher certification process, yet needed in today's educational context. Practitioners voiced a need to hire more specialists, and to provide all educators a multicultural education and training in ESL methods as a means to acquire more assistance from mainstream teachers. As demographics of English learners increase and shortages of ESL and bilingual educators continue, all educators need the requisite knowledge and skills to effectively educate linguistic minority students. Teacher education programs can proactively impact ELL challenges by modifying course offerings to include minority parent involvement, ESL methods, and sheltered instruction for all pre-service teachers. The success of ELL students cannot remain the sole responsibility of ESL and bilingual educators in the era of No Child Left Behind.",

        "description":"New England's reputation for world-class educational excellence is well-earned but tenuous, especially as a changing world demands increased levels of learning for a much broader population. People know the current K-12 system is not producing enough students with the knowledge necessary to succeed in college. Too few enter higher education. Too few of those who do matriculate persist through to graduation. By some estimates, only 18 of every 100 students who enter ninth grade graduate from college with at least an associate degree, the minimum level necessary to be competitive in tomorrow's world. Education reform efforts, meanwhile, have been well-intentioned, but alarmingly incremental in their gains. The slow pace of progress, coupled with a need for higher levels of achievement from many more of the learners, leads to a sobering conclusion: a new approach is needed. The obsolete nature of current school structures is evident in the way large groups of students with the same birthdays move from subject expert to subject expert in incremental blocks of time, in the way success is measured by seat time and rote return of information, and in the way what is learned during the &quot;school year&quot; is lost during the summer, perpetuating the difference in learning levels for various socioeconomic groups. In this article, the author calls for a reinvention of how citizens are educated rather than continuously trying to improve the existing education &quot;systems.&quot;",

        "description":"Between 1994 and 2003, employment in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields grew by a remarkable 23 percent, compared with 17 percent in non-STEM fields, according to federal data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts continued strong growth in STEM job openings through 2014, with emphasis on life sciences, environmental sciences and engineering. The median salary of STEM workers is 66 percent higher than that of non-STEM workers, according to the National Association of Colleges &amp; Employers. Clearly, STEM workers fuel the economy not only with high incomes and spending, but, more importantly, through innovation and entrepreneurship. Yet there is a growing gap between the supply of students graduating from U.S. college science and engineering programs and demand for STEM workers. This is exacerbated by international competition. If the United States is to preserve its scientific and economic leadership in the global knowledge-based economy, schools must increase the number of college graduates trained in STEM disciplines. That means creating and sustaining a STEM pipeline stretching from pre-kindergarten through grade 12 to college and on to industry. National Science Foundation (NSF) studies indicate that three factors contribute to building a strong pipeline: (1) early exposure to STEM careers via role models and mentors; (2) solid K-12 math and science preparation; and (3) effective college retention programs.",

Working in collaboration with nearly 50 professional engineering associations, universities and corporations, WGBH is developing an extensive multimedia campaign emphasizing ways the engineering field helps improve people's lives.

At the same time, globalization, diversification and civic engagement were gaining prominence as stated goals of higher education institutions. The Worcester State College created an undergraduate course called \"Microfinance: Prospects for Prosperity\" which features traditional academic components including exploration of the historical development of microfinance and various models ranging from Muhammad Yunus's Grameen model to village and community banking structures, group lending and individual loans, among others. Additionally, consideration is given to criticisms voiced about whether microfinance is an effective tool for poverty alleviation and whether, as some skeptics have wondered, microfinance generates any lasting impact on economic growth and development. But the course is also uncommonly hands-on. Students build upon the outreach of the college through the development and implementation of real microfinance projects, initially abroad, but more recently in the Worcester community. Students have become entrepreneurs of both social and material capital. Called upon to envision and implement their own microfinance programs to improve the lives of the disadvantaged at home and abroad, they created a WSC-based organization called \"MEET: Microfinance, Empowerment, Education and Training.\"",

        "description":"One of the most significant and important challenges facing any president of a Catholic college or university is maintaining and enhancing the religious identity and mission of the institution in the midst of the pluralism that exists on every Catholic campus in the United States. Catholic colleges and universities are at an important crossroad, a place where they have never been before. The shape of Catholic higher education is a picture that is being painted, in part by the different ways in which institutions of Catholic higher education express their Catholicity. Some express it with a progressive approach focusing on service and issues of peace and justice, others with a traditional approach focusing on reviving the Catholic intellectual tradition. Is one form of expression better than another? This is essentially a subjective question. But this expression of Catholic identity should be based in honesty. If an institution claims to be Catholic, then it should be so in more than name; its religious heritage should not be used merely as a marketing tool or to convince benefactors to part with their money. The identity of the institution should be the very lifeblood of everything that takes place there--impacting everything from curriculum to hires, programs to policies, and resource allocation to strategic decisions. The challenges currently facing Catholic higher education can be traced to the late 1960s when profound structural changes impacted the religious orientation of Catholic institutions.",

        "description":"Since the founding of Framingham Normal School in 1839 as the first state-supported school in the United States for training teachers, Massachusetts state colleges have evolved in response to the changing needs of the regions they serve. The Massachusetts state Legislature and Gov. Deval Patrick are now considering whether to move from the existing state &quot;college&quot; system to a state &quot;university&quot; system. The state colleges (Bridgewater State, Fitchburg State, Framingham State, Mass College of Art and Design, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Salem State, Westfield State and Worcester State) have undergone several name changes in their histories--from &quot;normal schools&quot; to &quot;teacher's colleges&quot; to &quot;state colleges&quot;--to reflect their changing educational roles. Each transition has allowed the colleges to better serve the changing needs of their students, communities and economies. This latest proposed change would similarly enable the colleges to better fulfill their historic mission. The proposal is designed to expand the &quot;system's&quot; range of degree and program offerings based on changing needs.",

        "description":"In &quot;Pushing Plastic,&quot; (&quot;The New England Journal of Higher Education&quot;, Summer 2007), John Humphrey notes that many college administrators justify their credit card solicitations by suggesting that credit card access will help students learn to manage their own finances. Instead, credit card debt will teach thousands of students a lesson they will never forget. The &quot;earnings premium&quot; enjoyed by college graduates is well-documented: college graduates earn significantly higher annual incomes than high school graduates. So should educators really be concerned about the ability of college students, with their higher income potential, to pay their credit card bills? Should a state treasurer's office dedicate time to improve the financial knowledge of these privileged young adults, when many underserved Americans are marked with poor credit to the point where they may be out of rational financial options? The answer is yes. A number of groups help people who are unbanked by traditional financial institutions due to their poor credit histories. College students, meanwhile, are a demographic that has proven particularly naive and inexperienced in personal financial decision-making.",

A follow-up to a similar study the institute conducted five years ago, the new research is based on enrollment data from colleges and Maine public high schools, surveys of more than 3,000 Maine parents, students, young adults and educators and group interviews in 19 high schools around the state. The researchers were surprised to learn that despite steady increases in the proportion of graduating seniors planning to enroll in college, actual college enrollment stayed flat in the first part of this decade, then began to decline. In 2001, 64 percent of Maine's high school graduating class reported intentions to enroll immediately in college, and 62 percent actually enrolled within one year. By 2005, 70 percent of graduating seniors statewide intended to enroll in college, but only 60 percent enrolled within a year.

Studies of global workforce competitiveness regularly point  toward the goal of nearly everyone achieving skills and knowledge commensurate with at least two years of higher education. According to this author, educators have increased equity at the K-12 level for those least-served by their public education systems by demanding that the same standards be used for all learners. Recent workforce projections, the explosion of online coursework, industry-based learning, the evolution of community  colleges, and the fact that technical trades now demand a much higher level of literacy, problem-solving and other high-value skills, are all trends that may force acceptance of a greater variety of outcomes and a more authentic and honest appreciation of a variety of vocations. The author states that educators, philanthropists and concerned citizens must begin to ask the hard questions about what it really means to educate the largest majority of students. Demanding accountability may be a step in the right direction, but innovation, differentiation, and the highest quality education possible should be the ultimate goal.",

        "author":["Kleniewski, Nancy"],
        "description":"Southeastern Massachusetts is home to six public institutions of higher education. In 2003, at the invitation of Bridgewater President Dana Mohler-Faria, five of them joined together to form a regional collaborative called CONNECT. (The original members were Bridgewater State College, Bristol, Cape Cod and Massasoit community colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. The sixth, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, joined in 2007.) The collaborative's goals are to improve the institutions' services and increase their efficiency by combining resources. The organizing principle is meetings of counterparts--chief executive officers, chief financial officers, human resource directors, etc.--who share ideas and identify collective projects. The CONNECT chief academic officers identified the group's top priority as smoothing the process of student transfers among institutions. They agreed that students faced two types of challenges in the transfer process: administrative challenges and academic challenges. To reduce administrative challenges, the four-year institutions  agreed to create &quot;transfer coordinator&quot; positions to help transfer students navigate their new campuses. To reduce academic challenges, the institutions sought to ensure that community college students would master the same basic skills and knowledge, cover similar  foundational work in their disciplines, and experience equivalent academic expectations as in a bachelor's curriculum. The chief academic officers decided that these issues of curriculum and evaluation standards could be best addressed through faculty dialogue around course goals, syllabi, and evaluation methods. The chief academic officers chose to begin the faculty dialogue with the institutions' first-year writing courses. They reasoned that writing is the bedrock skill in any general education program and that writing instructors were already practicing assessment  (as distinct from grading) through the placement process. The charge to the group was threefold: identify common outcomes for the first-year writing/composition courses, develop a common evaluation scheme, and disseminate this common framework to writing instructors at all of the campuses. The Writing Project experience points to several ingredients for a successful and lasting collaboration among different types of institutions. First, peer-to-peer interaction with others in the discipline is a powerful tool for faculty collaboration, reducing barriers between two- and four-year institutions and between adjuncts and full-time faculty. Second, a focus on common student learning outcomes and successful pedagogy allows all instructors to address a common goal: creating a good teaching and learning environment. Finally, leadership must come from the top, with the blessing and financial support of presidents, provosts, and deans.",

More than 60 percent of last year's high school seniors said they preferred student and faculty blogs to other information sources, according to the National Research Center for College and University Admissions. More than 80 percent of high school students indicated they would consider reading or responding to an instant message from a college representative. Meanwhile, 57 percent of online teens have used the Internet to access information about postsecondary education, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Studies show that parents are also using new media to navigate the college-going process. What might college access marketing campaigns that incorporate new marketing techniques look like? This article describes a few possibilities, drawing on some  for-profit campaigns and other \"social marketing\" ideas outlined by Spitfire Strategies in a research report prepared for College Goal Sunday 2006.",

Statistics show that youth who do smoke report having their first cigarette while in middle school, thus this is a critical opportunity for prevention (Eissenburg & Balster, 2000). This project helps expand current knowledge of adolescent smoking prevention programs by demonstrating an understanding of adolescents' preference for and acceptability of the Internet in the delivery of a smoking prevention intervention. A qualitative usability study was conducted among middle school students using focus groups. Results found that the Internet is a good choice for delivery of a prevention program due to its accessibility, including the availability in most schools. Elements of interactivity and expert-trusted guidance were identified as appealing. In addition, the use of pictures and graphics in conjunction with text, can be useful in reaching students with varied learning styles. By using this non-traditional approach, health education and promotion can work in parallel with the schools, parents, and community in the delivery of effective smoking prevention programs delivered via the Internet.

Most 1800 kcal menus were found to be filling whereas most 1400 kcal menus were found to be non-satiating. The major suggestions made that would not adversely affect the dietary goals included providing more food in some of the breakfast and lunch menus and less in many of the dinner menus, reserving cooked breakfast for the weekends, and eating salad without oil dressing. The suggestion to include more salad with avocados and guacamole would be appropriate provided these ingredients are eaten in moderation. The subjects made a number of comments that may challenge the dietary goals. They were not willing to choose low-fat milk and drink enough milk, prepare egg dishes without egg yolk, and choose corn tortillas rather than flour tortillas. They also suggested providing some high saturated fat and high cholesterol desserts and entrees and believed that certain low-fat foods are less affordable than the high-fat counterparts.

Subjects had highest levels knowledge on items related to commonly discussed methods of transmission such as shaking hands or touching, using needles to inject drugs, and multiple partners. However, subjects were less knowledgeable about methods of transmission that are less commonly discussed such as transmission from a mosquito or other insect, transmission from a toilet seat or transmission at a restaurant where the cook has AIDS.

A survey questionnaire was administered to a purposive sample of 743 Chinese Americans, ranging from ages 21 to 73. The questionnaire measured self-efficacy, fat-related dietary behaviors, demographic factors, and variables from social psychological theories. In the U.S.-born sample, self-efficacy was the premier variable contributing to 33% of the variability of behavioral intention. In the foreign-born sample, attitude, overall health concern, and self-efficacy contributed to a total variance of 58% for behavioral intention. In this group, attitude, perceived barriers and self-efficacy contributed to 19% of the variance of a combined index of fat reduction behaviors. For the entire sample, self-efficacy was significantly related to this dietary index (r = 0.36, p less than 0.001). First generation individuals scored higher on behaviors related to replacing high-fat foods with fruit and vegetables, and self-efficacy items related to low-fat food purchase. Second generation individuals scored higher on self-efficacy items related to using less oil in food preparation. Nutrition educators need to acknowledge the role of self-efficacy as a salient predictor of dietary behavior in Chinese Americans. (Contains 4 tables.)

Consequently, the same individuals who had a limited capacity to read information from traditional sources will have similar difficulties reading information on the Internet. This study examined three well-known Internet sites for readability. Results of the study indicated that the average reading level for all three sites exceeded the level intended for public consumption of written information. Results of the study indicate that health educators need to be aware of the reading levels of the health information they are placing on the Internet. If the level of health information material is above the comprehension level of the general public, many individuals will be at a disadvantage in comprehending health information required to make personal health decisions.

The assessment of the impact of these interventions is limited. This study assessed the impact of the Pyramid Challenge nutrition software program on nutrition knowledge levels of students enrolled in traditional personal health courses at The University of Alabama (UA). An experimental group consisted of students enrolled in two sections of the personal health course designed to relate directly to UA's \"Healthy Campus\" initiative. The control group consisted of students who enrolled in three other sections of personal health at UA. The integration of the Pyramid Challenge activity into a personal health course yielded no significant difference in nutrition knowledge between groups. However, this use of technology was an effective instructional methodology in that it allowed students to focus more closely on their personal eating behaviors and to design strategies to modify those eating behaviors without adversely influencing knowledge gain.

The response rate was 89.7%. This survey found that 75.2% of the participants tried cigarettes at least once during their lifetime, over half had their first cigarette and alcoholic drink before age 15, and over 80% had their first cigarette and alcoholic drink by age 18. During the month preceding the survey, 50.6% consumed five or more alcoholic drinks on a single occasion and 8.1% carried a weapon at least once. Twenty-two percent had at least three servings of fruits and vegetables the day before the survey, 35.3% engaged in vigorous physical activity on three or more of the seven days preceding the survey, 66.9% rarely or never wore motorcycle helmets, 13.4% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 3.9% had an STI. Results were analyzed by sex, age, and hometown. Results show that many Chinese college students have engaged in behaviors that put their health in danger. Effective health education programs are needed to reduce health risks leading to deaths and disabilities among Chinese youth. (Contains 10 tables.)

Results of the focus groups indicate that these students had minimal access to technology at home and within primary and secondary education. The use of technology by these students at the college level was minimal and was linked to e-mail use and the Internet primarily.

This study examined the association between several common youth risk behaviors, including cigarette use among Asian American adolescents, using data (N=408) from the 2001 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). The weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) to adjust the standard error estimate of the multistage sampling. The main outcome variable was cigarette smoking behavior (past 30 days), reported as a binary (dichotomous) variable. The significant predictors from the univariate model were alcohol use, marijuana use, academic grades, multiple sex partners, and weight (p[less than]0.01). The multivariate logistic regression revealed that Asian American adolescents who engaged in alcohol use (OR=10.43, 95% CI=5.02, 21.68), used marijuana (OR=4.90, 95% CI=1.91, 12.59), and had mostly C or lower academic grades (OR=5.86, 95% CI=2.66, 12.90) were more likely to report cigarette use. Common risk factors and adolescent behaviors play a role in cigarette use, and this information can be applied in developing health education programs for Asian American high school students.

Data were collected from 115 study participants in a rural California county. Findings from this study suggest that clients who had shamans conduct the rituals at their own homes and those who used live animals were significantly more satisfied than those had to travel to meet the shaman and those whose shamans' use dead animals.

Finally, ideas are presented about how democratic thinking might impact programs of study in health education enroute to health living, social responsibility, and active citizenry.

A quantitative survey examining health promotion activities, needs, and theoretical constructs was developed, translated and administered to thirty-eight health professionals recruited from five different counties in Transylvania. Following this survey, five focus sessions were conducted with small groups of health care professionals to elicit descriptive information concerning the health promotion activities, needs, and theoretical approaches currently in use. Health professional responses were analyzed using JMP statistical discovery software, version 4.0.2. Contingency analysis utilizing the Chi square statistic (Likelihood ratios and Pearson's coefficient) were ran for all variables. These are reported and include such items as types of health education/promotion professionals, contact hours with clients by type of professional, enablers of health promotion, barriers to health promotion, and health educators experience with western theories of health education and promotion. Our findings indicate that Romanian health promotion practices represent approaches and strategies that focus on the individual level and the intrapersonal dynamic. Based on this field research, current approaches put the responsibility for health behavior squarely on the individual. Consideration of other variables such as the environment, cultural differences, and the need for community action must be developed to continue improving the health education/promotion infrastructure in Romania, particularly in rural village settings.

Recently, Southeast Asia has become a rising concern for health care professionals in the field of infectious disease (UNAIDS, 2004). Most of Southeast Asia is experiencing surging prevalence and incidence rates of HIV infection. One particular country of interest is India. India's population has surpassed one billion, making it the world's second most populated country. India's large population exacerbates the problematic scenario of HIV sero-prevalence rates that are increasing throughout the country and region (De Cock &amp; Weiss, 2000; Rao, et al, 2004; UNAIDS, 2004). Youths in India lack knowledge about HIV and also have misconceptions about modalities of transmission, and many harbor negative attitudes towards those who test positive for HIV. In order to decrease transmission rates among youth, quality HIV/AIDS education must be implemented in a culturally relevant manner. The aim of this review of literature is to provide a synoptic view of the HIV/AIDS problem in India, focusing on the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the country's youth.

Participants (N=43) were recruited through Asian community networks, Asian Community Cancer Coalition, health clinics and newspaper advertisements. Demographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, mediating variables including self-efficacy and risk perception, smoking cessation and reduction rates, stages of change, tobacco use history, smoking behavior, and program satisfaction were evaluated. At baseline, no participants were in the action stage, whereas 57.7% were in the action stage at 1-week and 61.5% at 3-months follow-up. At 3-months post-intervention follow-up, quit rate was 59%. The psychosocial profile of smokers showed that they were more likely to be receptive about cues, more likely to perceive smoking risks, and less likely to avoid health messages that are inconsistent with their own behavior. Participants reported low levels of distress and moderate levels of self-efficacy in quitting. Overall, the cons of smoking exceeded the pros. A culturally appropriate smoking cessation program for Asian smokers can effectively move smokers between stages of change. (Contains 3 tables.) [Abstract provided in both English and Spanish.]",

The ethnic groups represented in this study included Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Asian and Caucasian. Questionnaires based on the Action for Healthy Kids Healthy Schools Summit Survey were sent to 168 schools on Oahu. The return response of the surveys was 79% with 132 schools either returning the survey or being interviewed by a follow-up phone call. Statistical analysis utilizing ANOVA identified any significant differences among the districts, school levels, and ethnic groups. Further analysis using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Post Hoc Test indicated specific differences after significant ANOVA was found. Based on data collected in this study, it would appear that fewer than half of the schools were in the process of making health and physical education culturally sensitive, and that state health education standards were mostly being implemented at the middle and high school level. Elementary schools that were &quot;in progress&quot; for implementing health standards and adopting physical education standards should be given assistance from the district level. Additional assistance should also be given to elementary schools that were &quot;in progress&quot; for testing health topics and providing uniform assessment in physical education. Hawaiian schools on Oahu were contributing to the physical activity of students by offering physical education classes, however, this could be greatly improved by inclusion of daily physical education taught by certified instructors at all levels especially elementary.

        "description":"As the use of instructional technology continues to escalate, it is not surprising that universities are attempting to reach new student markets by using technology. Many of the benefits and barriers to asynchronous distance education (ADE) have been examined over the years; however, few have explored these constructs from the student's perspective. This manuscript points out some benefits of ADE: lower costs, increased flexibility, greater convenience, higher return on investments, and expanded opportunities. It also addresses possible obstacles: administrative policy and infrastructure issues, quality of technical instruction, inadequate support services, and intrinsic factors affecting student performance. An analysis of these pros and cons is a vital part of planning effective ADE. Suggestions for methods to improve the viability and quality of ADE from the student's perspective are offered using examples from the discipline of health education. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Materials from CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Internet were collected to conduct the open coding of the SWOT analysis. Strengths of health education in India include an elaborate tiered infrastructure, well trained workforce in health education, resources for information dissemination, school health education programs, and ability to conduct systematic needs assessments. Weaknesses of health education in India include focus on only knowledge-based interventions, primary reliance on print media, inability to reach rural and vulnerable areas, no quality assurance, no promotional avenues for health educators, no organization, and outmoded training of health educators. Opportunities include need to involve folk media, enhance participation of unconventional functionaries such as religious leaders, traditional healers, traditional birth attendants (dais), build systematic patient and worksite health education, apply theoretical approaches such as social marketing, involve physicians, and organize health education and health educators in India. Threats include criticism as motivational manipulation and delivery of health education campaigns as techno-managerial, vertical programs without building the infrastructure at the grassroots level.",

        "description":"Sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic (Taylor et al., 2003; UNAIDS/UNICEF/WHO, 2000; Eaton, Flishera and Arob, 2002; Prat, et al., 2000). Nigeria is one of the most afflicted sub-Saharan nations (UNAIDS, 2002). Rivers State, a major industrial area of Nigeria and the nerve center of the oil industry, represents a cross-section of Nigeria. The median sero-prevalence of HIV in the state has been estimated at 8 percent (Rivers State HIV/AIDS Control Program, 2002). The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary data on HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and opinions among young people in the state. A 28 item, English-language questionnaire was pilot-tested and administered to secondary school students in the state. There were fairly equal numbers of male and female respondents with a median age of 19. Although 93 percent of respondents had heard of HIV/AIDS, it did not appear to improve their knowledge and perceptions about the disease. One-third to one-half of respondents believe that a person can get infected with HIV through mosquito bites; believe that an infected teacher or student should not be allowed to continue teaching or attending school and have not talked about HIV/AIDS with their boy friend or girl friend or their parents. About 60 percent of respondents admitted that none or few of their friends used condoms in sexual encounters. The results of the study are consistent with similar studies in sub-Saharan Africa (Eaton, et al., 2002; Volk and Koopman, 2001; Adih and Alexander, 1999). Several sociocultural and religious constraints are inferred. Among other strategies, the need for sustained culturally sensitive educational intervention to decrease the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the region is stressed. (Contains 11 tables.)

This study investigated the degree to which three friendship variables (ability to make friends, level of involvement with friends, perceived friends' involvement in exercise/physical activity) was associated with physical activity participation in a sample of 2,519 secondary level students from Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. In general, results showed that overall participation in physical activity was lowest among adolescents who said that making new friends was difficult, who were less involved with friends, and who reported that no or only some of their friends participated in exercise/physical activity. Conversely, adolescents who said that making new friends was easy, who were more involved with friends, and who reported that most of all of their friends were more likely to engage in physical activity themselves. Although physical activity participation among girls was lower than boys, the association between the three friendship variables and participation in physical activity was found for both boys and girls. The results of this study suggest that school health educators should give serious consideration to including friendship skill-development strategies in the mix of strategies currently used to improve participation in physical activity.

Adolescents 13-18 years old (182 females, 394 males) from randomly selected schools in La Paz completed the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Frequencies and logistic regression were used to identify factors--including academic performance, violence, and sex--associated with suicidal attempts. One fourth  (26.9%) of females and one in ten males (8.9%) attempted suicide at least once. Depression was highly correlated with suicidal attempts. Additional risk factors for females included ethnicity, low academic performance, violence (including forced sex), and drinking. Females who experienced forced sex and who drank 20 or more days in their life were 20.1 (95% CI: 2.3, 178.7) and 37.3 (95% CI: 4.7, 297.2) times more likely respectively than females  without these risks to attempt suicide. An additional risk factor for males included being threatened or injured with a weapon. For parents, school administrators, policy makers and program planners this study represents an important step toward identifying risk factors for attempted suicide and for developing prevention programs.

There was a large disparity in response rate between the three survey methods. In-class administration had the highest response rate (66%), followed by postal mail survey (23%) and web-based survey (10%). Based on the results, we recommend in-class survey administration with random class selection for conducting survey research on college campuses.

Thirteen pupils attending school in a rural area were monitored with accelerometers during the study weeks. The intervention consisted of modifying regularly scheduled recess period for a month. Data from two school days during the third week were recorded for analyses. Analyses indicated that, according to the recommended 2 x 15 min recess schedule, children spent on average from 16.9 [plus or minus] 5.7 min to 22.8 [plus or minus] 3.7 min each day in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at recess; that is, 16.3% to 20.0% of their daily MVPA (comprised between 103.4 [plus or minus] 32.5 min and 113.9 [plus or minus] 32.5 min). This level of activity increased with the increased recess duration. A 1.2% increase of the time spent at recess resulted in a 6.6% increase of their activity (average 23% to 26.5%). It appears that a more appropriate reorganization of school schedule, including recess period and proper physical education classes, may be beneficial for school children to experience adequate amount of physical activity.

Previous research has highlighted the importance of understanding geographical and sociocultural factors in the spread of HIV among this population. This paper reports an exploratory case study which assessed the role of social capital in health and HIV awareness among girls and young women in a rural, isolated community on Andros Island, Bahamas. We examined features of rural community life such as social networks, community engagement, safety and trust in relation to the health and HIV/AIDS awareness of school-aged girls living in this environment. Using focus group discussions and structured writing exercises, we collected information from 18 schoolgirls aged 9 to 16 years about community structure, friendship networks, participation in community life, and issues of safety and trust. We further explored concepts of health and perspectives on HIV/AIDS. Findings revealed a close-knit community in which girls were social as well as economic participants. Girls felt safe, trusted their elders and had an awareness of health and HIV related issues. These social capital elements can play an important role in HIV prevention for girls in the rural caribbean. (Contains 1 table.)",

This research study was conducted to uncover attitudes toward maternal drinking and awareness of alcohol-related birth defects within the semi-rural Northern Rivers area of New South Wales (NSW) Australia, December 2003 to April 2004. A pilot survey was conducted using a sample of convenience to gain initial insights into these perceptions at the local level. 162 people took part in the survey, with 57 declining. Findings: 69.8% of respondents answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the survey question, &quot;Should women drink during pregnancy?&quot; Overall responses to the survey showed a general trend in favour of drinking 4-8 glasses of beer or wine per week during pregnancy. Analyses of gender, age and level of education revealed that a moderating relationship exists between alcohol attitudes and level of education, with education negatively related to recommended alcohol quantity, and positively related to whether the respondent knew about alcohol-related birth defects. Discussion: These findings support the recommendations of both the National Alcohol Strategy, 2001-2003 and the NSW Alcohol Summit (2003) by suggesting that education remains an important consideration in terms of mapping effective attitudinal change. Recommended that an accurate measure of Australian alcohol-related birth defects be sought, and educational programs used to raise social awareness toward maternal drinking issues. Further research should seek a more representative sample and investigate urban/rural differences. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Students of color are consistently underrepresented in honors and gifted programs nationwide, and even high-achieving students share many of the risk factors with their low-achieving peers. The study presented in this paper employed mixed methods to investigate the relationship between the design of a rigorous college preparatory program, the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IB), and the socioeconomic status of the students the program serves. The paper begins with a brief overview of the literature that documents the academic achievement gap among high-achieving Latino and African American students, as well as the literature on intervention programs designed to ameliorate these gaps. Following a description of the methodology, it presents the recruitment and admission practices employed by the program studied. The paper concludes with a description of the academic and social scaffolds developed and implemented by local IB teachers that directly support students' academic achievement. The study found that an open admission International Baccalaureate program was successfully attracting and retaining African American, Latino, and Native American students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Findings are attributed to IB teachers' deeply held belief in the ability of the students to meet the rigor of the program. Implementing a rigorous academic curriculum was only the first step in the process of raising the academic achievement of Latino and African American students. This IB program also has instituted academic and social support mechanisms to keep students motivated to pursue the challenging curriculum. (Contains 7 tables and 2 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Early entrance from secondary school to university, based on the principle of optimal match, is a rare but highly effective educational strategy for many gifted students. The University of Washington offers two early entrance options for gifted adolescents: the Early Entrance Program for students prior to age 15, and the UW Academy for Young Scholars for students after Grade 10. This study assessed the elements of optimal match that are best suited to different age groups. Four cohorts of Early Entrance Program and UW Academy students were surveyed on various themes, including their assessment of the transition and support  services available to them, their satisfaction with the degree to which they had accelerated their education, their experience with family and friends, and their assessment of their own talents and abilities. Results suggested that similarities and differences in accelerative components exist for students of different ages. All early entrants need a period of intellectual preparation in a supportive and rigorous environment; a peer group; a home-base; communication with parents; a faculty and staff who enjoy teaching, advising, and mentoring gifted young scholars; and a welcoming university or college environment. However, programs for younger students need to provide more intensive academic  transitioning during the first year, and programs for older students must balance students' competing needs for independence and guidance. Adequate preparation of parents and the institutional environment also are important to the success of early entrants, regardless of age. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Context: Psychosocial exposures commonly show large variation over time and are usually assessed using multi-item Likert indices. A construct requiring a five-item Likert index could possibly be replaced by a single visual analogue scale (VAS). Objective: To: a) evaluate validity and relative reliability of a single VAS compared to previously validated Likert based items and indices measuring the same construct, b) detect possible statistically significant differences in absolute levels between the single VAS and Likert items and indices respectively. Design: Cross-sectional study conducted in May 2004. Methods: 805 participants responded to a web-based questionnaire including both VAS and Likert based items. Intraclass correlations were utilized to assess agreement between VAS and Likert scales/indices and Marginal homogeneity tests were utilized to detect possible differences in absolute levels. Results: Moderate to strong correlations were found in responses between VAS and Likert based items and indices, and significant differences in absolute levels in seven out of eleven scales. Conclusion: Single VAS questions can, in some cases of uniform construct, replace a single Likert item and also be comparable, but not interchangeable, with multi-item Likert indices.

This paper presents the views of primary school teachers in Malawi regarding their potential role in HIV/AIDS prevention. Data come from two focus groups with 12 male and 12 female primary school teachers attending a teacher training college for certification. Teachers were deeply concerned about the impact of the epidemic on themselves, their families, and the nation. Teachers expressed willingness to be HIV/AIDS prevention leaders for young people and for their communities. However, they identified many personal and system barriers, including: risky personal behaviors which made some teachers poor role models; negative societal attitudes of stigmatization, denial, and reluctance to discuss sex with young people; and inadequate teacher training and ongoing support. Recommendations include: providing behavioral change intervention to reduce personal HIV/AIDS risks of teachers, enhancing the importance of school-based HIV/AIDS prevention through strategies such as making HIV/AIDS prevention part of the examined curriculum, expanding training and ongoing support for teachers regarding participatory teaching strategies as well as content, and involving both teachers and communities in the development and implementation of HIV/AIDS programs in schools, and with students.",

During the SARS outbreak in Singapore in 2003, a six-lesson elearning module on SARS was developed for a large university population of 32,000 students. The module was developed within 2 months by 12 academic staff from medicine, economics, basic science, health promotion, microbiology, epidemiology and public health with support from 2 IT experts and 2 support staff. To ensure coverage of the entire student population, all students were required to complete the module within 9 months of its implementation to fulfill the graduation requirement. About 5,000 (16%) students read the module within the first month and almost all (96%) within 9 months of its implementation. The majority (86%) of the students who took the module for credits passed the module. Using this online format, health information was disseminated rapidly and efficiently to all university students during the SARS outbreak. This module could be adapted to other institutions with Internet support to disseminate timely health messages efficiently should an infectious disease outbreak occur.

Results of the study indicated that mother's education, the socioeconomic status of the family and the mother's knowledge of health issues all influence children's school enrollment. Mothers who were able to correctly identify when during their ovulatory cycle they could conceive were 1.5 times (p-value =0.012) more likely to have their children enrolled in school. The odds of children being enrolled in school also went up with increases in the mother's education and the family's socioeconomic status, and decreased for girls.

Those who do not possess key cognitive abilities, including understandings of conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle, are at a disadvantage when attempting to master mathematical concepts and skills that require early abstract thought. Recognizing the need to address this gap, this study examined the effects of an intervention designed to teach children conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle. The study included 78 kindergartners enrolled in a culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse metropolitan school district. Students were randomly divided among one of three groups: cognitive intervention, numeracy instruction, and art instruction. Instruction for each group was matched in number, timing, and extent of sessions. The study found that kindergartners who received the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher on measures of cognitive ability than those in the comparison group who participated in the art instruction or those who received numeracy instruction. On the Woodcock-Johnson III Applied Problems scale, those in the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher than those who received art instruction. Those in the cognitive intervention and those in the numeracy intervention performed similarly. These results suggest that it is possible to provide instruction that enhances the cognitive abilities of kindergartners who do not possess key reasoning abilities.  In addition, there is evidence that promoting early abstract thought can enhance kindergartners' mathematical abilities. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The Civic Leadership Institute (CLI), a 3-week residential program for gifted adolescents, is a service-learning program created to help academically talented students explore complex social issues that are faced by communities and society today. Class activities are comprised of rigorous academic coursework, community volunteer service, meetings with top community leaders, seminars on specific topics of interest, and rich residential and recreational experiences. This study examined how students perceive and evaluate their service-learning experiences with the CLI program using surveys from program evaluations and narrative comments from 230 gifted high school students who participated in CLI at two different sites in its first 2 years. Overall, the students indicated positive perceptions of the CLI program and were satisfied with its components, particularly the service projects and various field experiences. Overwhelmingly, they perceived that the coursework combined with hands-on experiences  enhanced their awareness of civic issues, increased their motivation to engage in social issues in their communities, and allowed them to gain a new understanding and respect for diversity. Suggestions from students included more frequent field experiences, service projects tightly linked with academic content, and meetings with local community leaders.  Because this study is the first evaluation of the CLI program, a longer term follow-up study with students who have participated in CLI and comparisons between students who have participated and students who have not participated in the program are needed to corroborate the positive perceptions found among this first cohort of student participants.

It is well documented that many students are not prepared for the rigors of postsecondary education and FYE programs are designed to supplement the necessary academic and life skills. These academic and life skills range from knowing the location of the library to seeking out appropriate personnel when personal issues arise. Evaluating programs developed to address such a wide range of knowledge and skills is an obvious challenge, especially when each FYE is customized  for each corresponding university or college. In the case of one FYE program at a large university, evaluation of student Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors (KAB) provided a conceptual model to examine the program as a whole. This particular study revealed the following about the FYE program: (1) The KAB approach is pragmatic and efficient; (2) FYE programs are capable of increasing knowledge, which is a principle objective of the courses; (3) The FYE program impacted attitudes associated with academic and life skills; (4) Males and females participate and respond to the FYE differently. For example, females reported significantly higher attitudes than males; and (5) The study of FYE Programs overall is highly complex. Further longitudinal studies focusing on retention and attrition are needed.(Contains 8 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The world has a population of 6 billion. India alone has a population of 1 billion. This is despite the fact that India was the first country in the world to have a population policy. It is important to understand the factors that led to this population explosion and the complex links between population growth rates and levels of development. Indeed, many feel that the family planning program shows little evidence of concern for the poor women it is supposed to serve. India was one of the first nations to officially launch a family planning program. A modest beginning was made in 1952 and IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device) was initiated in 1965. About 100 million married women throughout the developing world have an unmet need for family planning. About one-third of these women, an estimated 31 million, live in India. Unmet need for family planning is estimated to affect 16 percent of married couples in India. This paper gives a historical perspective of India's Family Welfare Program focusing on the role played by IUCD. The Program has gone through various revamps shifting its initial target oriented approach to a more client centered approach. The National Population Policy 2000 resets the objectives of the program given the scale and diversity of India's population making it pro-poor, pro-women and pro-nature. However, poverty, illiteracy, and a shortage of resources remain the main barriers to the promotion and wider acceptance of family planning.",

        "description":"Background: The total number of people with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection in India is estimated to be 10% of all global cases. People living with HIV in India often experience discrimination while receiving health care due to inadequate knowledge and fear among health care professionals. Data presented in this paper represents the first phase of a six-year study being conducted at a Medical College in Mumbai, India. Information from this phase of the study will be used to demonstrate the need for an HIV-specific training module for the first year medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 first-year medical students in Mumbai, India to assess knowledge and attitudes as they relate to HIV infection. A self-administered survey was distributed among the medical students at a medical college in Mumbai. The survey sought student responses pertaining to knowledge of HIV risk and transmission, and attitudes towards HIV-infected people. Results: A response rate of 87% was obtained (174 out of 200). Overall, females showed less knowledge pertaining to issues related to human sexuality and HIV transmission when compared to their male peers. Anal intercourse was reported as a risk for HIV transmission by 3% of females as compared to 20% of males (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, 28% of females reported no relationship between the risk of contracting HIV and the type of sexual intercourse compared to 3% of males (p less than 0.05). In general, there were considerable misconceptions regarding the spread and risk of HIV transmission among all medical students. Sixty six percent (66%) of females were comfortable having HIV infected doctors and nurses (co-workers) in clinics and hospitals compared to 36% of males. Forty-four percent (44%) of the medical students preferred not being friends with HIV infected individuals. Sixty-two (62%) percent of the students favored abstinence only messages for prevention of HIV among teenagers. Discussion: Knowledge regarding risk and routes of HIV transmission was lacking among the medical students. Attitudes of the students toward HIV-infected individuals could be best described as ambivalent. However, female students showed more positive attitude towards HIV infected people than their male peers. Conclusions: Based on our findings we recommend the development and integration of a HIV training module in the first year medical curricula in order to address gaps in knowledge and provide training for the development of positive altitudes and tolerance toward HIV infected people.

        "description":"This study examined the use of rubrics in scoring a performance-based assessment. After receiving a health lesson of ways to have a healthy brain, fifth grade students were given an assignment to illustrate and write a booklet that demonstrated their knowledge of the topic. From students' responses the researchers constructed four sample papers based on their work that demonstrated varying levels of knowledge about the brain. A \"true\" score for each sample paper was the result of the researchers' agreement when the papers were scored independently using rubrics. Then, sixteen pre-service teachers assessed the four sample papers without using a rubric and a second time using a rubric developed by the researchers. Those 16 scores were compared to the \"true\" scores for each paper. Inferential statistical analyses indicated the scores produced without using rubrics significantly inflated students' scores for three of the four papers. Analyses of the scores produced when using rubrics indicated no significant differences across all four papers. Thus, the pre-service teachers' assessment for the four sample papers was closer to the \"true\" score when using rubrics. The results suggest the need to develop and use rubrics to ensure the reliability of assessments addressing critical thinking skills. (Contains 3 tables.)",

It is the most frequent malignancy in women, where it accounts for 38.5% of all female cancers. About half (43.7%) of all breast cancers are locally advanced. We recruited 183 primary care physicians in Pakistan and invited them to attend educational conferences using an educational module about breast cancer risk factors, diagnosis, and management. We tested the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of physicians. Knowledge was tested before and after the educational module. Data analysis determined the effect of demographics, medical education, and prior training of physicians on modulating the differences in knowledge between pre-test and post-test evaluations. Our analysis showed a statistical significance in overall improvement for all knowledge based questions in detection, management and referral of breast cancer (P=0.0001). The additional knowledge provided from the continuing medical education sessions contributed to improvement in knowledge of the physicians. Improved knowledge about early breast cancer detection may improve patient referral and survival. Results from this study could be used to guide the implementation of future cancer continuing medical education programs for primary care physicians in developing countries.

Data was collected from 576 adolescents, 13-18 years of age, from six schools in La Paz, Bolivia, using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Findings indicate that males were more likely than females to report having ever engaged in sex, initiated sexual activity at age 14 or younger, and had two or more sexual partners within the three months prior to the survey. For both sexes, those who initiated sexual activity at an early age were more likely to engage in a variety of risk behaviors, with alcohol as the most significant risk factor. The likelihood of engaging in sexual activity is associated with age, low academic performance, substance abuse, violence, depression, and suicidal tendencies. The more frequent the occurrence of these risk factors, the higher the chances of engaging in sexual activity. Future research should examine efforts to simultaneously reduce multiple risk factors and to determine how adolescents' views on reproductive issues influence sexual initiation and patterns of sexual behavior over time.

This study examined the impact of menu rotation on the selection of Internet-based parent-child feeding behavior education and behavior change modules by participants in the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program across seven states. Five modules were rotated over a course of 4 weeks, each having the opportunity to be listed in all positions in the menu sequence, resulting in a significant (p less than 0.01) difference in module access. Modules listed in first and second position observed greater access than the other modules, with the exception of the module \"make meals and snacks simple,\" which retained consistent access trends regardless of position. Overall, modules in the first two positions observed the greatest access, regardless of module title.

New waves of Hmong immigrants are re-settling in the US. Over 15,000 Hmong have come to the US from Thailand as refugees since summer 2004. California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are the States with the highest Hmong populations in the US. Minneapolis, Fresno, and Sacramento are the metropolitan areas with the highest number of Hmong residents. Health issues such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B carrier status, asymptomatic splenomegaly, sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, injuries related to agricultural occupation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lower immunization rates, and cancer, pose major challenges for health education practitioners. Genetics, problems with access to health services, and diet-related issues appear to be important contributors for morbidity and mortality in this population. Although the Hmong born outside the US account for less than 0.5% of the foreign population in the US, they are an important group from a health education perspective.",

In order to assess the awareness and knowledge of expectant mothers about NNJ, women who registered for antenatal care at a tertiary health facility in the South-western part of Nigeria were consecutively recruited and interviewed by means of a questionnaire. There were 189 participants whose mean age was 30.1 plus or minus 5.2 years. Median parity was 2. Twenty-five (13.2%) of them completed primary education while 88 (46.6%) attended a tertiary institution. All the 189 participants have heard of NNJ, mainly from co-workers - 77 (40.7%) and hospital staff - 73 (38.6%). One hundred and seven respondents (56.6%) knew how to check a baby for NNJ correctly while only 12.2% knew some causes. Ninety-five (49.7%) did not know any danger sign of NNJ and 58 (30.7%) erroneously believed in the efficacy of drugs. Similarly 28 (14.8%) respondents wrongly believed in the use of unproven local remedy. None of the 189 would-be mothers knew any effective preventive measure. It is concluded that expectant mothers do not have adequate knowledge about NNJ. This can hinder effective management of jaundice in their unborn children.

Nepalese are a small minority group most often categorized in the U.S. under the Asian and Pacific Islanders cluster. A modified BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) survey was used to facilitate comparison with U.S. national data. One hundred and ten people attending an annual Nepalese convention completed the survey. Results indicated that although smoking behavior of Nepalese was similar to that of Americans, cancer screening and exercise behaviors varied significantly. Several methodological issues with regard to data collection were encountered. Most notably, the respondents skipped many BRFSS questions. This raises some significant questions about the representation of Nepalese Americans and other Asian and Pacific Islander groups in the national BRFSS data. Under-representation of Nepalese may be masking significant health problems among members of this so-called &quot;model minority&quot;, and in effect limiting their representation in the national health care agenda. Different and varied methodologies need to be employed to better understand the health care needs of this and other Asian and Pacific Islander groups. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

Utilizing an observational cross-sectional design, data were collected via a self-administered survey from 84 Chinese-American children ages 6-18. The survey employed items from the Health Behavior Questionnaire and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Logistic regressions were used to examine the correlates of physical activity. Findings revealed that among children nine years or younger, those with high self-efficacy were six times more likely to engage in sufficient moderate physical activity than children with low self-efficacy (OR=6.6, 95% CI=1.27-33.80). Among participants older than nine years, those with high self-efficacy were almost nine times more likely to engage in sufficient vigorous physical activity than children with low self-efficacy (OR=8.7, 95% CI=1.35-56.05), and those with positive social support were almost eleven times more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity than participants perceiving negative social support (OR=10.90, 95% CI=1.02-116.37). The findings of this study address the association of social cognitive factors with participation in physical activity. Results from this study indicate that socio-environmental factors in addition to personal factors may increase the likelihood of participation in physical activity among Chinese American children.

BODY ELECTRIC connects youth in 27 high schools with health and education communities in the largest rural geographic education region in a Midwestern state. The three-phase prevention plan designed to increase resiliency and reduce risk behaviors among adolescents begins with biennial regional administration of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, with added questions designed to identifying the top health concerns of area youth. In the second phase, these health concerns are crafted into prevention messages by youth, using the arts as a medium of expression. University interns, local artists, and community health and prevention professionals mentor the students with their project ideas. On completion, students present their work at the biennial BODY ELECTRIC Arts and Health Festival. A comprehensive media plan forms the third phase of the program, featuring a prevention communication network of original broadcast programming that links student messages to a wider community. A region-wide tour of the arts/prevention project collection is delivered to schools and communities in the area providing another venue for the student-produced arts and health messages. Preliminary evaluation data were included to show the success of the program. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"Around the globe, people with HIV/AIDS are increasingly those who are most marginalized within their societies and with least access to health education and prevention efforts. Rising HIV infection rates within underserved populations demonstrate a vital need to critically reflect upon the nature and practice of HIV/AIDS education and prevention. Online learning is increasingly being used as a way of bridging gaps of space and time between health educators/ providers and training resources. While the majority of the literature cites little or no difference in learning outcomes between in-person and online courses, the processes by which students learn in these two teaching mediums are markedly different. It is essential to identify those aspects of online education that promote critical reflection so that they can be incorporated into the best practices of distance learning and used in training future health educators and providers. This study examines discussion forums of online AIDS education courses conducted as part of a graduate level health education program. It explores the nature of critical reflection in online discussion forums, details the ways in which students engage in reflection, and makes recommendations for fostering reflective thinking as part of asynchronous health education training.

This study was conducted to measure the perceptions of risk, barriers, and self-efficacy of HBV screening and vaccination in Chinese immigrants. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 429 Chinese Americans in New York City. A pilot-tested questionnaire in Chinese was used to collect information about demographics, acculturation, and health risk perceptions, barriers, and self-efficacy related to screening and vaccination. While 89.3% of participants thought that HBV would harm them if they contracted it, only 32.8% believed that they were at risk for getting it. Participants were more likely to get screened if their physician suggested it, they thought it was a serious disease, would cause harm, and they discussed it with their spouse. Participants were less likely to get screened if they were afraid they had HBV, did not know a screening location, and it was not suggested by their doctor. Participants were less likely to get vaccinated if they did not have time, did not know a screening location, and the physician did not speak their language. Our findings suggest that community-based, culturally appropriate interventions for Chinese Americans and health care providers might increase screening and vaccination rates. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The number and average duration of periods of activity by intensity were calculated for each child during a 30 minute recess: rest or mild physical activity (less than or equal to 2.9 METs), moderate physical activity (3.0-5.9 METs,), vigorous physical activity (6.0-8.9 METs) and very vigorous physical activity (greater than or equal to 9.0 METs). Boys and girls spent about 50% of the recess in physical activity. Physical activity was characteristically done in very short bursts with intervals of rest or mild physical activity. The number of episodes of physical activity of all intensity levels was lower in older children while the inverse occurred at rest or mild physical activity. Boys engaged in higher intensity activity than girls and in general spent more recess time in physical activity.",

        "description":"A video game called &quot;Re-Mission&quot; has recently been investigated with adolescent and young adult cancer patients enrolled in a multi-site randomized controlled evaluation of the game as a psycho-educational intervention. The main focus of the trial was to determine effects of the game on self-care and other health-related outcomes. It was also considered valuable to evaluate participants' perceptions of the game as (1) acceptable as a treatment-related activity for young cancer patients, and (2) credible as an intervention designed to change patients' knowledge, attitudes and self-care behaviors relating to treatment. Although the cancer-related content of the game is informed by surveys of cancer professionals and patients themselves, acceptability and credibility with end-users have been important factors influencing the usability and efficacy of a range of psychological interventions. As part of the multi-site trial, 197 patients with cancer, between the ages of 13 and 29, were assigned to the treatment group. Most patients (148) completed a 9-item acceptability/credibility rating scale following 3-months' access to Re-Mission. These &quot;completers&quot; played Re-Mission more than the other patients, but did not differ from them on gender, age, or prior game experience. Responses to the questionnaire were analyzed as two factors representing acceptability and credibility. A mean rating for acceptability (4.1 on scale of 5) indicated a good level of acceptability, and mean rating for credibility (3.7 on scale of 5) indicated a moderate level of belief in the game as an effective intervention. Correlation analyses showed that whereas acceptability and credibility ratings were not significantly associated with educational level, both were significantly (p less than 0.01) and positively correlated with amount of time spent playing the video game during treatment (acceptability: r=0.26, credibility: r=0.25 ). The findings indicate that the self-care intervention video game would be a useful addition to the psycho-educational resources available to treatment teams. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

Though it is an important teaching method it also has its limitations. Aim: To create an alternative method for teaching pathology using web based, interactive computer technology [i.e., computerized FLM (compFLM)] and to evaluate its effectiveness in pathology teaching compared to conventional FLM (convFLM). Method: ConvFLM materials were selected from the pathology museum while compFLM was prepared using digital photographs of potted specimens and java script which was then uploaded into the institute's intranet. A class of medical students was divided into two groups, each exposed to either type of FLM in the female reproductive block (FRB) with a cross over in the subsequent musculoskeletal block (MSB). Students completed a questionnaire and were subjected to an assessment at the end of each block, consisting of multiple choice questions (MCQ), computerized objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and conventional-style OSCE questions. Results: Analysis of examination results showed neither teaching method to be superior. However students found compFLM more interesting, user friendly and easily accessible. Conclusion: Computerized FLM has many advantages. However it cannot replace conventional FLM and both techniques would be complementary in effective learning. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Objectives: Comprehensive training in the area of tobacco control and prevention has not been available to public health students receiving professional degrees. This study describes findings of a project designed to develop and evaluate an integrated approach to the education of Masters of Public Health (MPH) students at the University of Iowa about tobacco control and prevention. Methods: A review of tobacco use, control and prevention content in public health courses was conducted. A plan to integrate new content into six required core courses in the MPH curriculum was developed and implemented. Students' knowledge of tobacco control and prevention was assessed using a pre/post-test evaluation developed by the MPH program core course instructors. The pre-test was administered to a cohort of incoming MPH students in order to assess their current tobacco knowledge. A post-test was administered to this same cohort directly prior to graduation but following the completion of all core courses. The pre- and post-tests results were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the integrative approach to student learning. Results: Integration of tobacco use, control and prevention content and assessment of student knowledge were successfully accomplished in all six core courses in the MPH curriculum. Student knowledge (n=37) increased significantly (p less than 0.05) from pre-test to post-test as measured on 14 items that performed well or moderately on three criteria. Conclusions: Findings indicate that tobacco content can be included and, more importantly, integrated into each of the core areas of public health as defined by the Council on Education for Public Health. Integration of tobacco content in all core courses improved MPH student knowledge of tobacco control and prevention. Constructing effective measures of student knowledge in this domain is challenging. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"A variety of developments in nursing education in Australia including some innovative and exciting models, educational enterprises between education and industry, and evidence of developing strengths in research and professional alliances on a national level have been discussed recently. This paper presents Simulation to Practice as an example of an educational program that can maximise skill mastery for nurses in mental health fields as practised by Deakin University in Victoria, Australia. The program is multimodal and is under-pinned by a problem-solving approach and has an online presentation. The extension of nursing skills through this approach encourages nurses to take theoretical skills to practice during these scenarios which help student nurses to gain experience through simulated real life characters. These sessions, while challenging at the time, were highly valued by students and seen as a beneficial part of their learning as a beginning nurse and often instrumental in moving comprehensively trained students into mental health careers.",

The 2003 CHINA GSHS employed a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a representative sample of junior middle school students in Grades 1-4 in Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan and Urumchi. A World Health Organization (WHO) developed survey was used to collect the data among 7,393 students. Results showed that 14.6% of students drank at least one alcohol drink on one or more of the past 30 days, 7.1% were at risk of becoming overweight, 25.9% did not have habit of washing hands before eating, 17.8% seriously considered attempting suicide during the past 12 months, and only 12.2% of students were physically active 7 days during a typical week for a total of at least 60 minutes per day. Additionally, 6% of students missed classes or school without permission on one or more of the past 30 days, 48.1% of students had been taught about HIV or AIDS during the school year, 6.2% of students smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days, 18.4% of students were involved in a physical fight and 20.6% were seriously injured during the past 12 months. Finally, 93% of students were taught how to prevent Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during the past school year. Results also indicated there were many different problems on health behaviors and protective factors of school students among four cities. This was the first Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) conducted in China and it is expected the results will be helpful in providing data for program development and making policies concerning school health and health education. Additionally, the data will be helpful for international comparisons between countries. (Contains 11 tables.)",

In addition, the secondary purposes were (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of email prompts at increasing motivation towards physical activity and (2) to evaluate the awareness of the email campaign. Extension agents from the state of North Dakota (N=81) participated in a physical activity behavioral intervention study. Participants were grouped into an intervention group (N=39) that received bi-weekly physical activity electronic mail (email) prompts spread over 16 weeks, and a control group (N=42), that did not receive any intervention. Data on physical activity motivation and email message awareness were collected through standard questionnaires. Physical activity levels were measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). Data were collected at two time points: mid-fall or pre-intervention and early spring or post-intervention. Over the winter season, both the control and intervention groups experienced an overall decrease in physical activity as measured by IPAQ (-317.0 MET-min/wk vs. -208.2 MET-min/wk, respectively). However, those in the intervention group who were able to recall the tag line were more active than controls. The significant difference in physical activity level between participants at the two extremes of the awareness levels indicates the potential efficacy of an email intervention campaign toward increasing physical activity.

WV and Mali students made comparisons of diet, physical activity, BMI, and blood pressure gathered from study participants. Full IRB approval was provided by West Virginia University for this human subjects study. The mean systolic blood pressure for the Mali participants was significantly lower, especially when compared to African-American youth (p=0.0008), as was the mean BMI scores of Mali participants (F [subscript 1, 77]=11.43, p=0.0011). Student investigators analyzed results with guidance by university faculty and showcased their results to peer-audiences at school, for local community events, and at annual Symposia. The University partnership provided opportunities for secondary students and their teachers to discover the role that environment plays in influencing health via authentic research and exposure to international public health strategies. Viable alternatives to unhealthy behavior were shared. Results point to the importance of a nutrition-dense diet (low in fats and sugar) combined with simple walking, as beneficial for all humans. Such comparisons can enhance science education, global health awareness, and empower young adults to alter their unhealthy behavior so as to avoid chronic disease in adulthood. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The average age of the students was 16 years. Females and males were represented fairly equally (52% &amp; 48%, respectively). The Ghanaian adolescents consumed an average 3 servings of fruit, 2 servings of vegetables, and 3.4 servings of milk each week. They also consumed candy and soda (snack consumption) 2.4 times per week and fried foods 4.8 times per week. This study also showed that nutritionally adequate foods were available in boarding school dining halls and Ghana's adolescents made food choices that may be detrimental to their health.

Due to its complex nature, successful treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach with nutritional, psychological, medical, pharmacological and dental therapies. Despite bulimia nervosa's growing incidence, many health care professionals fail to detect the condition in their patients. In addition, professionals lack adequate training in interdisciplinary health care delivery. As part of a larger federally funded Interdisciplinary Health Care for Rural Areas Project, the purpose of this study was to conduct focus groups with patients' and providers' to examine professional skill needs in four domains including the detection, intervention, assessment and interdisciplinary treatment of bulimia nervosa. Based on thematic analysis of transcripts from four focus groups, both the patient and professional participants indicated a need for more professional training in all four domains. The professional participants especially lacked an understanding of the interdisciplinary health care model. In addition, participants indicated interest in the use of online case based learning opportunities when available to advance their knowledge about bulimia nervosa.",

This low rate of breastfeeding may be a result of refugee women's lack of public and social support and access to health professionals. This study identifies Iraqi refugee women's barriers to breastfeeding, as well as the amount of breastfeeding education and support they received. Analyses are based on a cross-sectional survey of 80 Iraqi refugee women, currently residing in Amman, Jordan, ages 18 years of age and older who had given birth within the last year. Results indicated that the majority of these women did not receive education or assistance about breastfeeding from health professionals, family or friends before or after giving childbirth. Furthermore, relatives and friends not healthcare professionals were identified as having largest influence on the decision to breastfeed. In view of these women's unique situation, the development of a peer counseling program to meet the educational, health and social needs is recommended. Further investigation into how peer counseling programs can be used to help women in refugee situations is needed. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"Peer-led programs that employ classroom-based group exercises have been shown to be the most effective in preventing adolescent tobacco use. In addition, health promotion programs that include cultural referents have also been shown to be advantageous. The purpose of this study was to test the interaction between the method by which leaders and peers are assigned to cooperative groups and the cultural relevance of the curricular materials. Sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to one of three group assignment conditions (random, teacher and network) and one of two anti-tobacco curricular programs (universal and culturally-specific). Follow-up data on 1235 7th grade students in 14 schools were used to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Results indicate that the interaction between the network condition and culturally-relevant curriculum most significantly reduced the likelihood of 7th grade smoking (OR=0.32, p less than 0.01). The primary conclusion is that peer-led health promotion programs not only have to consider the selection of peer leaders and the assignment of students to those leaders, but also the cultural relevance of the curricular materials. This study supports the view that social networks influence behavior and that network-based information along with culturally relevant curricular materials can be used to increase program effectiveness.

        "description":"Preparing health educators in today's technology-driven society requires faculty to adopt new teaching strategies which motivate and engage the \"Web 2.0 generation.\" Blogs are popular online forums for both scholarly and non-scholarly communication. Currently, there are no published studies assessing the utility of blogs in health education. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore faculty and students' perceptions of blogging as an effective teaching and learning tool within an online health education course. Students enrolled in both sections of an undergraduate online women's health class (n=52) were asked to complete an online survey regarding their perceptions of blogging as a teaching and learning tool. Overall, both instructors and students were satisfied with blogging and found it to be an effective teaching and learning strategy. Results of this pilot study showed that blogging can enhance peer interaction, allow for synthesis of course content, and help sustain student engagement in the online health education classroom. In the near future, blogs may serve as important channels for health education and advocacy beyond the virtual classroom. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

However, this progress has not been accompanied by the same advancement in the health informatics field whose applications have become a necessity for hospitals in order to achieve important objectives such as enhancing the quality of healthcare and reducing the time and cost for healthcare delivery. In this paper we introduce a new masters program in Health Informatics in a newly founded Saudi university specialized in health sciences. The program, which is the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia and the region, was designed based on the recommendations of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). The program has gone through the first assessment with the help of the first group of graduates. The results are presented in this paper. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

While the crisis will significantly affect all six New England States, it will be most acute in the three northern states, as the competition for qualified high school graduates begins to intensify. The New England states, including its colleges and universities, will soon be competing aggressively for a dwindling number of prospective students. This article observes that colleges and universities will need to target specific markets over the next decade to attract students through &quot;differentiation.&quot; Those institutions that can carve out a unique niche will be in the best position to withstand the coming crisis, while those that employ a strategy that makes them look like &quot;all things to all people&quot; are likely to struggle to maintain enrollments.",

        "description":"Massachusetts alone needs an estimated 5,000 nurses, and the shortage is deepening. Nurses are retiring and quitting faster than new nurses can be trained. In this article, the author describes Bunker Hill Community College's Welcome Back Center, a workforce development program that has thus far helped 47 internationally educated nurses from 29 different countries to obtain licenses and return to work. In partnership with Roxbury and Massachusetts Bay Community Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Boston, the program is currently working with more than 400 nurses from 72 countries who are legal residents of the United States. While all were nurses in their own countries, the steps required to obtain their United States licenses, including learning English in some cases as well as miles of bureaucratic red tape, are time-consuming. An internationally educated nurse who enrolls in the Welcome Back program full-time could be licensed and working in a hospital or a clinic in as little as a year. Most, however, work full- or part-time jobs--and may need two years or more to complete the program on a part-time basis. Either way, the program puts experienced nurses to work in less time than training new nurses; the fundamental nursing credential, an R.N., takes two years of full-time study.",

In this article, the author discusses PBL, a student-centered approach to learning that is grounded in real-world situations. PBL involves four basic stages: (1) problem analysis; (2) self-directed learning; (3) brainstorming; and (4) solution testing. Exactly how PBL is implemented depends on the context in which learning is to take place and the preparedness of the student. In its purist form, PBL involves presenting students with an authentic problem prior to any instruction of preparation. The idea is to use the problem to introduce the concepts and problem-solving skills necessary to solve the problem.",

        "author":["Merisotis, Jamie P."],
        "description":"In his recent speech at a Harvard commencement ceremony, Bill Gates said that &quot;reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.&quot; He recognizes that the problems of global health in this world, the challenges of alleviating poverty and despair, and the wide disparities in educational attainment require significant investment by those with the capacity to change lives--the philanthropic sector, government, and private industry. Gates made clear that, despite his own unique experiences, he understands that higher education is critical to reducing inequities because there is clear evidence that it has enormous individual and public benefits that more than compensate for the up-front investment. These important public and private benefits of higher education represent critical pillars in the foundation of an innovative and qualified workforce, a secure economy, and a robust democracy. This article discusses some of the tremendous demographic changes that pose critical threats not only for higher education but for society as well. The author states that higher education can reduce inequities by looking at the experiences of minority-serving colleges and universities and by examining the large-scale changes taking place in higher education in other parts of the world.",

In addition, significant increases in spending by students and taxpayers have not moved the needle: the percentage of adults with a college degree has changed little over the past decade. New England must act now to boost productivity because key trends suggest that only little time has been left. This article presents the four converging trends that spell serious trouble for New England's higher education and underscore the need to think in terms of productivity. These trends are: (1) The leveling off of educational attainment; (2) The old inequities faced by the new population; (3) The turning point about to be reached by higher education finance; and (4) The rising public anxiety and political pressure for change. A list of three fundamental commitments for advancing productivity agenda are also presented.",

They suggest that  all segments of New England education should work more closely together so that more children, especially urban and rural students, could complete college degrees. Nationally, the State Higher Education Executive Officers association, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the National Governors Association have defined higher expectations around preschool through &quot;grade 20&quot; collaboration, and, with the Nellie Mae Education Foundation, have invested $10 million in the New England states. The authors reviewed how the six New England states began persuading higher education to work with the early childhood and K-12 systems toward the the &quot;P-20&quot; goal.

Data were obtained from 1,092 elementary school students who completed a 24-item questionnaire designed for this study. Results indicated more older students smoked than younger ones and boys significantly outnumbering girls. Most of the students believed that people smoke for pleasure and relaxation or due to psychological problems and that people do not smoke primarily because of health or aesthetic reasons (smelling badly). Students' attitudes towards smoking were significantly related to their parents' educational status or the students' smoking behavior. Furthermore, students' negative attitude towards smoking was strongly associated with their age. Finally, it was found that age and parental educational status affected students' knowledge of the health effects of tobacco use. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"The research literature on gambling behavior indicates that American Indians (AIs) suffer from pathological gambling at a greater rate than the majority population. The literature also suggests that dispositional factors, such as sensation seeking, can influence gambling. However, situational factors, such as the payback percentage of a slot machine, may not. The present study recruited 12 AI and 12 non-AI participants to play a simulated slot machine in three different sessions. Half of the participants in each group were high sensation seekers. The other half were low sensation seekers. Across the three gambling sessions, the simulation was programmed to pay back at a rate of 85, 95, or 105%. Results showed non-significant differences in gambling behavior between AIs and non-AIs and between high and low sensation seekers. Participants were, however, sensitive to percentage payback, playing more trials and betting more credits when the percentage was 105% than when it was 85 or 95%. The present results question whether ethnicity or certain personality characteristics, in and of themselves, are predictive of differences in individuals' gambling behavior. Results also suggest that people's gambling behavior is sensitive to winning and losing, but not to losing and losing even more. Implications for the study of gambling are discussed.

Being able to perceptively read the critical cues in a learning environment allows teachers to recognize present problems, anticipate potential problems, link immediate problems with previously successful solutions, and make exceptional in-class decisions. Four features distinguish what expert teachers see: (1) focusing on events relevant to student performance and learning, (2) making inferences from observations, (3) being alerted by atypical occurrences, and (4) observing with a critical eye. Because the skills of an expert are learned rather than inherited, anyone can increase their expertise by learning the skills of an expert. To do so requires knowledge of the skill and practicing that skill until it is mastered. The article offers specific suggestions for practicing the perceptual skills of an expert teacher.",

Results: Exploratory principal components analysis indicated a three-factor structure (conformity, coping, and positive reinforcement motives), with the positive reinforcement motives of enhancement and social motives not separating into the expected two distinct factors. Moreover, community informants (e.g., school personnel) anecdotally indicated possible wording problems with some of the social motive items for the cultural group. A qualitative methodology--focus group interviews with Mi'kmaq adolescents--was used to  explore potential reasons for these observed differences in the structure of drinking motives from previous findings in the majority culture (i.e., a measurement problem vs. a real   difference in the structure of drinking motives in the Mi'kmaq culture). Conclusions: Qualitative findings support the interpretation that a true social motive for alcohol use does not exist in this cultural/age group and that drinking in social contexts for this group seems less motivated by social affiliation than by enhancement motives (e.g., drinking to party).

Physical therapists and educators have consistently advocated the importance of being involved in a range of movement activities and games.

Children with Down syndrome (DS) often have a variety of health related problems and movement difficulties that may limit such opportunities. This article briefly outlines the perceptual-motor challenges typically faced by children with DS. Then, a framework for enhancing motor behavior using creative dance and Laban's concepts of movement is presented. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Huge puppets can communicate spiritual and moral authority, which is all the more easily accepted because it is delivered with a sense of playfulness. Giant puppets also create unique movement possibilities. This potent combination of symbolic meaning and choreographic challenge make the use of puppets a valuable tool for teaching African dance, and for creating a sense of unity in an educational setting. This article explores the educational advantages of using puppets in the dance studio, and explains how dance teachers can make giant puppets with their students. The puppets can help to convey choreographic principles, cultural context, the power of ritual, and an interdisciplinary approach to artistic problem solving. These gains are directly related to the goals in the &quot;National Standards for Dance Education&quot;.",

Negative experiences resulting from poor sportsmanship may lead children to limit their participation in sports or drop out all together. Parks, recreation, and tourism professionals may look to systems modeling to help develop programs and policies in the hope of counteracting this trend. Systems modeling is an approach used in management that describes a set of interrelated elements and their connections. The current problem with unsportsmanlike attitudes and behaviors in youth sport leagues presents an excellent opportunity to use systems modeling in studying the effectiveness and feasibility of specific policies designed by parks and recreation professionals to increase sportsmanship within their leagues.

It also presents an integrated review of the sportsmanship literature and current research regarding the definitions, benefits of moral education, and the influence of coaches, parents, and peers. The practitioner's roles in educating and assisting athletes, coaches, officials, and parents about sportsmanship issues, such as the pressure to overemphasize winning, are examined.

Specifically, it describes \"Medicine Ball for All,\" a physical activity program designed to provide children and teenagers with a meaningful learning experience that is consistent with their developmental needs. The article focuses on developing a safe, successful, and inexpensive physical activity intervention for school-age youths using medicine balls. This novel program consists of a variety of medicine ball exercises designed to improve physical fitness, enhance self-confidence, and increase sensory awareness through visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation. Instead of isolating fitness components, \"Medicine Ball for All\" integrates strength, power, flexibility, endurance, agility, balance, and speed into one creative program. The article summarizes the results of a research study designed to assess the effectiveness of the \"Medicine Ball for All\" program.   That study (further detailed in EJ768178) found that the study group participating in a medicine ball training program made significantly greater gains in all fitness tests compared to the control group. With the current focus on physical education programs to develop and enhance health-related fitness, physical competence, and positive attitudes about physical activity, \"Medicine Ball for All\" activities can be a worthwhile addition to any physical education program.

This analysis focuses on a male European American preservice teacher, who is practicing teaching at a school with 3% African-American, 3% Asian, 91% European American, 1% Hispanic American, and 3% multiracial students. Examination of the video reveals communication to be the main theme, which functions in the contexts of language and culture, in addition to space usage, culture, and power. How the social class environment influences the physical education program is also analyzed.",

To provide all students with a quality instructional program that meets individual educational needs in the context of political and social justice, a culture of collaboration, community building, and reflective practice is needed. The areas of socio-educational cultural change discussed in this article are (1) program administration; (2) evaluation; (3) instruction and curriculum; (4) long-term planning; and (5) storytelling. For physical education to be truly inclusive, educators must think of it as a community of learners with many kinds of diversity. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

However, there are ways to safely, successfully, and meaningfully include children with severe disabilities in GPE. A model can be designed to make sure the child will be able to work on his or her physical education goals and objectives while interacting with peers without disabilities in a way that will not disrupt the general program. The purpose of this article is to detail specific strategies that allow a student with severe, multiple disabilities (SMD) to be included in GPE. These strategies revolve around three major themes: (1) identifying and selecting appropriate goals and objectives for the student with disabilities and then finding ways to help the student achieve these goals and objectives while in GPE; (2) making the GPE setting safe for the student with SMD; and (3) facilitating social interaction between students with and without SMD. Specific examples of simple modifications that allow the student with SMD to be safely and meaningfully involved in GPE will be presented throughout.",

The pioneers of public education--among them Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, and John Dewey--argued that schools were, in fact, essential to the health and well-being of the republic. This is because relevant, problem-posing, multi-faceted education--democratic education--is central to democratic life; it is necessary for enfranchised citizenship, and for teaching students how to play an active role in the economic, cultural, and political life of the nation. A democratic state requires the education of critical, thoughtful citizens who can define their own purposes and are able and willing to act upon their ideas. In this article, the author discusses what Social Foundations teacher educators can do to support the development of teachers attuned to and grounded in an education for democracy. She also discusses how they can make their \"own\" (teacher education) classrooms more democratic.",

        "author":["Books, Sue"],
        "description":"To the now-expansive literature on the causes and consequences of segregation in schooling and of inequality in educational opportunity in the United States, the author would like to add a call for more attention to the politics of school districting--that is, to how and why districts are created, in the service of whose interests, and with what consequences for students.  Towards that end, this article reconstructs the solidification of a school district in upstate New York, the Spackenkill Union Free Schools, a six-mile-wide district in the town of Poughkeepsie. In a battle with the New York State Education Department in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Spackenkill schools succeeded in avoiding consolidation with their poorer, larger, and far more diverse neighboring district, the Poughkeepsie City Schools. (The town of Poughkeepsie includes both the city of Poughkeepsie and the community known as Spackenkill.) In this article, she recounts the story of Spackenkill's pursuit of &quot;independence,&quot; as reconstructed from newspaper articles written at the time, school board minutes, and personal conversations with the president of the Spackenkill Board of Education and a Poughkeepsie resident who lived through the struggle. She then offers an analysis of the ideals and interests that shaped the district's conflict with the State Education Department. Finally, she comments on the significance of this small chapter of social history for reformers still working towards desegregation and more equal educational opportunity. (Contains 4 notes.)",

        "author":["Kang, SoYoung"],
        "description":"The author introduces this article by saying that there is a very intimate relationship between how caring the teacher is and the knowledge that students gain. Actually, it is not limited to student-teacher relationships only but also student-student relationships. Knowledge is something people acquire as they build relationships and have interactions with others and the world around them. When people talk about someone becoming a \"knower\", they tend to focus mainly on the pure knowledge they gain, instead of looking at the journey toward that knowledge. Care theory plays an essential role in the process of learning and the author argues that teachers or other care givers should pay close attention to this process rather than focusing mainly on result centered education measured by grade point averages. The author theorizes that many teachers used to think it was inappropriate to notice the race of their students, because popular theory dictated that teachers focus more on student uniformity and less on their uniqueness in order to teach effectively. This article, however, expresses the author's desire to encourage teachers, here in the U.S. where there is such great ethnic and cultural diversity, to become more color conscious in their classrooms and acknowledge the differences of defining caring between White, African American, and other ethnicities in order to become a more effective, caring teacher. As a native Korean, the author decides to include Korean perspectives of caring since it brings yet another meaning to caring due to the influence of Confucianism embedded in the society. In this paper, the analysis and comparisons of White, African American, and Korean perspectives of caring across different boundaries are provided, along with the author's concrete explanation of care theory, and another perspective. The author concludes by saying that teachers need to teach students to value other peoples' differences, and the importance of of multicultural caring.",

The paper outlines three common figuring metaphors that impede the adoption of such a theoretical discourse and shows how Actor-Network Theory (ANT), more recently developed in the nascent field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), reframes sociological theory--and specifically, what it means to be a \"social actor\"--to allow for a more comprehensive accounting of the interactions of humans and nonhumans in the fabrication of the social. A corollary aim of the paper is to highlight the role of nonhumans in contemporary educational concerns. The paper also offers a range of different examples to illustrate its points.

History books tell of American Indian students being locked in week long routines to keep them out of mischief, underfed to break down resistance and being given deadening rounds of simple, repetitious chores bereft of challenges to numb their intelligence, and taught dominant western values and language. Possibly, too few people are aware that assimilation of American Indians continues in the country today in multitudinous forms, including Indian boarding school residential environments. The assimilation of American Indians entails the replacement of tribal sets of beliefs and actions directly linked to the beliefs of distinct tribal groups with Western sets of beliefs and actions. This study attempts to take into account the interplay of inner psychic conflicts of American Indian boarding school students in Indian boarding school environments; interactions between aspects of the school environment; the broader environment, such as the government and/or the media; and cultural and political beliefs complex process of assimilation that occurs in Indian boarding school residential settings. There are several elements in this study that mark it as unique: (1) It focuses on boarding school residential practices rather than academic educational practices; (2) It also accepts the risk of attempting to analyze inter-psychic conflicts in the context of cultural, political and social contexts; and (3) This study also takes a historically dynamic approach in its methodology.",

In this study, the author attempts to focus on what is known about successful Black teachers of Black students to: (a) contribute to the ever growing literature about successful teachers of Black students for the benefit of teachers from various ethnic backgrounds; and (b) outline several salient suppositions that may help in advancing the research and theory about successful teachers of Black students. Based on the findings of the study, the author focuses on Black teachers' experiences and success both pre and post desegregation for insights about how all teachers can deepen and broaden their knowledge and understanding to better meet the needs and situations of students at present, particularly among Black students.

Genograms are family trees that identify emotional relationships and intergenerational family patterns. When combined, practitioners can synthesize the information to demystify the intricate web of social systems and the tension and strain between families and other systems such as schools. For the purposes of this paper, ecomaps will portray genograms in the center to symbolize a family system, as a sort of snapshot in time. This paper illustrates six typical yet successful cases at an alternative school in which ecomaps were used as an interdisciplinary method of communication among systems when working with families in the school community. The ecomap provides a common language and understanding of problem-saturated families by depicting families and students as participating members of the school community who have feelings, emotions, and relationships that may influence the students' ability to perform in school and become productive citizens.

To provide evidence of the ESECI's reliability and validity we distributed the ESECI to the students and teachers/staff at one urban elementary school in a Midwestern city. There was a significant difference in student perceptions of student to student interactions and relationships across grade levels. Schools could use the ESECI to pinpoint areas where changes need to be made in order to enhance a school's sense of community. (Contains 4 tables.)",

In this study, we explore schools' practices and policies with respect to parental involvement. This study was carried out at four elementary schools in the Netherlands. Interviews were conducted with the schools' principals concerning the schools' experiences with the parental involvement of diverse groups of parents. The results of this study indicate that school administrators recognize difficulties in getting immigrant parents involved in their children's school. The two main barriers to getting immigrant parents involved in the schools were language problems and culture differences between the schools and families. The four stories of these schools reveal one basic dilemma that underlies the schools' perspective of parental involvement: should schools expect parents to comply with the schools' expectations and culture, or should the school take parents' expectations and cultures into account? Schools differ in their view of the right balance between school and family culture. It is suggested that schools share their experiences in networks that can help them to enhance the involvement of diverse groups of parents. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

Previous studies have shown that, building on a history of segregated schools for Black students staffed by Black teachers in which strong school-family-community relations were essential for the survival of their schools, Black principals understand the predominantly disadvantaged African American students and families they serve and communicate well with them. The danger of this analysis in the present context of urban diversity is that it leaves open the question of whether Black educational leaders understand and communicate well with other ethnic, socioeconomic, and linguistic groups. The present study shows how an African American principal, building on a practice of school and community leadership in separate Black education that involved extensive engagement with White school district officials and other individuals and groups, was able to facilitate communication between disadvantaged Black families and middle-class White teachers and school district officials, with the result that all stakeholders worked together effectively to develop policies and programs that improved student behavior and academic achievement.",

The study compared each of the subgroups' perceptions respectively regarding: (a) the child's reading level; (b) family reading practice; and (c) the perceived barriers and opportunities in families' decisions to help the child become a better reader. Survey questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from each subgroup. Responses obtained from the surveys and interviews were compared to determine whether or not respondents had a shared understanding of what families believed and practiced. Findings indicated a mismatch among a majority of the respondents, suggesting a lack of shared understanding. However, in those instances where all three respondents agreed on a variable (e.g., reading to or with a child regularly), children were scored as reading above or at the class average. These shared perspectives provided frameworks for increasing mutually shared views regarding ways to assist a child to become a better reader. Differences in beliefs reflected processes unique to the African American adult family member, the child, and the teacher respectively, as well as pointing out conflicts in home and school relations. Several factors which could account for disagreement among the respondents were explored. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"The present exploratory study examined the involvement of 77 Mexican-origin fathers in their school-age (grades 4-6) child's education. Fathers were classified into one of three groups based on their linguistic acculturation status. The three groups were predominantly English-speakers (n = 25), English/Spanish-speakers (n = 27), and predominantly Spanish-speakers (n = 25). Five analyses of covariances (ANCOVAs) were conducted using the following father involvement dimensions as outcomes: Perceptions of School, Positive Contacts with Teachers, Attitudes Toward Parental Responsibility, School Involvement (e.g., participation in school activities and events), and Home Involvement (e.g., helping with homework, developing an environment conducive to education). Family socioeconomic status was included as a covariate in all five ANCOVAs. Results indicated that Spanish-speaking fathers reported more negative perceptions of their child's school, less positive contacts with their child's teachers, and were less involved in their child's school than either English/Spanish-speaking or English-speaking fathers. No group differences existed on the other two father involvement indices. Interpretations of the study's results and research implications are presented. (Contains 3 tables.)",

While focusing on social capital in the form of parental participation, the article goes beyond a functionalist approach of the social capital theory as adopted by Coleman, whereby the social networks within parent groups and between parents and teachers are viewed as providing common positive outcomes for everyone in the school. Instead, while acknowledging the inherent advantages of parent-school social networks, the article looks at social capital theory from a conflict framework wherein ends are not the same for everyone in the school body. This review thereby discusses how different groups of parents compete for power to define schools' functions. In the process, some powerful groups of parents enjoying strong social capital can lead schools to take actions that neither benefit the school as a whole, nor are they in the interest of children whose parents do not share the same social relationships. The review, therefore, argues for treating groups of parents differently instead of uniformly as one homogenous entity, based on their varying levels of social capital vis-a-vis schools.",

        "description":"Using data from Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this study examines the social disparity of family involvement. A total of 4,405 students from 140 Hong Kong secondary schools participated in the first cycle of PISA study identifying four types of family involvement: cultural communication, social communication, homework supervision, and cultural activity. Multi-level analysis was used to examine the major family factors related to these types of family involvement. Consistent with previous research, working-class, immigrant, and single-parent families tend to have lower levels of parental involvement. The effect of these structural factors decreased after family resources, family network, and family norms entered into the multi-level regression model. It can be argued that the social disparity of family involvement is mediated by the deprivation of useful resources, lack of network, and low educational aspiration of the disadvantaged families. The results also suggested that it is not only cooperation between home and school, but also connection between parents and their children's peers that provides the necessary chemistry for success. Educators, parents, and policymakers should be aware that family networking should be extended to include the peers of the teenagers if they want to enhance family involvement in education.

Unfortunately, school-home relationships often have been ignored or underdeveloped. Disconnections between home and school may be especially acute in urban areas where school personnel may not understand the culture of the students and families with whom they work. In the Indianapolis Public Schools, a large urban school district in the Midwest, efforts to better connect families and schools are occurring through the implementation of a school liaison program. The school district set out to deliberately create this program in order to bridge the gap between schools and families, with particular attention given to parents from diverse backgrounds with children who are receiving special education services. The initial intent was to allow participating families to drive the design of the program, and it appears that the district has been successful in achieving this objective. Program services and activities include conflict resolution, cultural brokering, direct support, and referral. The design of the school liaison program is described and the activities and skills of the liaisons are presented through the voices of the families that this program has served during its first year of operation.",

We distributed games integrating math and U.S. geography to 30 parents with children aged 7 to 13. Over four months, we followed the extent and nature of families' playing of the games. Families with children under 10 were more likely to continue playing over time; parent education and occupation did not relate to extent of play. Parents described a rich, shared educational experience that they and their children shaped to their interests and interaction styles; some drew a sharp contrast with homework. Although all parents believed the games promoted learning, only one related this learning to potential benefit in school. In light of parents' stated distinction between educational game playing at home and homework, we conclude by considering ways to establish and investigate the impact of a culture of families' engaging in math-related activities for fun at home.",

Reflecting on a two-year family literacy project, we consider the possibilities and pitfalls of the projects' design and implementation. The work described in this article takes a stance that is both critical and grounded in the notion of \"funds of knowledge.\" We propose a framework to assist in the creation and evaluation of family literacy projects and examine its application to our own efforts. Finally, we suggest that those preparing or administering a project designed to promote family literacy consider more rigorously the membership of a planning team and the impact that team can have on the project.

        "description":"S. Redding noted the many challenges facing research and researchers in family-school-community involvement, and he presented a call to \"rally the troops\" to respond to a series of concerns. The issue of control over defining the role of schools should be a shared enterprise among the family, the school, and the community, with the individual child as the center. This paper presents reflections on past developments providing the background and reasoning for contemporary practice of family-school involvement across America. The paper provides analyses of research and thought in order to present four recommendations for future directions in development and research for family-school-community involvement programs. The first two recommendations focus on \"explicitly\" incorporating family-community involvement knowledge, skills, and values into preservice teacher and administrator licensing programs and studying the resulting effects on aspects of these programs. These recommendations are crucial to implementation of family and community involvement practices as the teacher and the principal serve as key agents for positive family and community involvement in schools. The third recommendation promotes studying the effects of family involvement in character/civic education on student outcomes. The fourth recommendation encourages research on the effects of tying community organizations, including health and social agencies, with the school. Each of these recommendations should serve to point out areas where family-school-community involvement research would be both timely and fruitful.",

        "description":"This quasi-experimental study (based on parent self-selection) examines the effects of a parent involvement program on kindergarten children's English language skills. This program was implemented as one component of a Migrant Even Start Family Literacy Program. The study was conducted at a rural Midwestern elementary school with 14 kindergarten children of families participating in the parent involvement training program, and 15 kindergarten children from families not participating. This study followed these children through the end of first grade. Findings indicate that by the end of first grade, children from families participating in the parent involvement training program scored significantly higher on language measures than children in the control group. This suggests that equipping migrant families with new abilities to nurture their children's language skills leads to positive language outcomes for their children.

In 2002, a new school replaced an outdated structure. During the planning stage for the new school, community members and agency professionals, along with educators, developed and implemented programs to both support families and engage them in their children's education. Utilizing qualitative research methods, interviews, observations, and document reviews were conducted with the intention of investigating the impact of efforts undertaken to involve parents at the new school. The study found that the development and implementation of intentional parental involvement strategies positively influenced the level of parental involvement. In addition, participants perceived numerous benefits to students and families resulting from strategies implemented and the related involvement. Parental involvement strategies also influenced educator's perceptions of acceptable parental involvement behaviors, with interviewees recognizing a broad array of behaviors as involvement in education.",

In this paper, I argue that research and practices focusing only on this narrow definition of parent involvement may not be culturally sensitive approaches to supporting the home-school connection. The existing literature addressing Asian American parent involvement suggests that indirect practices at home, such as structuring the child's time, are more common among Asian American parents and more consistent with Asian cultural values. I analyze how this type of involvement during the early school years may be particularly helpful in facilitating continuity during children's transition to first grade. (Contains 2 endnotes.)",

Many educators provide guidelines on how to approach project work with children and assert its benefits in various areas of children's learning and development. Yet few empirical studies investigate what parents think about their children's learning through projects. In this case study, we intend to fill this gap by exploring parents' perspectives of the project approach in a second grade classroom in which a majority of the students were from low-income families. Our analysis revealed the parents' undisputed positive perceptions of project work, which overall included (a) increasing motivation, (b) building a community of learners, (c) utilizing children's strength, (d) improving academic achievement, and (e) encouraging parent involvement. We conclude with implications for early childhood research and practice, particularly for collaboration between teachers and parents. (Contains 1 figure.)",

The language of teaching and learning is strictly English, and most teachers cannot speak or understand Xhosa. Additionally, some Xhosa-speaking learners cannot clearly articulate their thinking and reasoning in English. The study demonstrates two mathematics classroom interactions and illustrates how language plays a pivotal role in classroom discourse. The findings of the study suggest that working with peers in Xhosa may facilitate learners' skills and development of conceptual understanding of mathematics. Furthermore, the study shows that requiring verbal discourse in the classroom to be only in English limited the learners' success in displaying their mathematical understanding, which in turn made them appear to be lower achieving than those who spoke only in English.",

The program was designed on the basis of a collaborative model of university-school partnership, and the program itself featured relationship-building between families and schools. The research examined the implementation of the readiness program across sites and examined potential  outcomes by following the children into kindergarten. Results on implementation showed that parents' goals differed according to whether families spoke English as a first or second language and that teachers' goals evolved over time to emphasize partnership rather than direct instruction. Results also suggested that directly assessed outcomes were tied to the quality of interactions among teachers, parents, and children, as well as to other aspects of program quality that varied across sites. Direct outcome measures also revealed differences between child participants and a comparison group who did not participate in the school-based readiness program and between families who spoke English as a first or second language. The interpretation of the findings on implementation and outcomes is discussed from the standpoint of methodological alternatives to randomized, control experiments. A case is made for examining multiple measures that tap context and process variables that may mediate and moderate connections between programs and outcomes. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)",

Two secondary schools with numerous partnerships were selected within a southern Ontario school board characterized by economic and cultural diversity. Drawing on the within- and cross-case analyses of documents, observations, and 25 semi-structured interviews with 2 principals, 1 office manager, 8 teachers and 19 community partners, the process of creating partnerships is discussed from educational and ecological perspectives. The findings indicated that the majority of the partnerships were teacher-initiated, and the liaison types sought were based on their determination of their students' and programs' needs. The most effective partnering strategy was to promote the benefits of liaising from the initial contact. Meetings in person and the negotiation of partnership activities created &quot;win-win&quot; relationships. The influence of school and community contexts on partnership development is also discussed. The principals' support created school cultures that built staff capacity and were conducive to partnerships. The nature of the community influenced the types of partners available for collaborating. Issues of partner proximity, limited time and money, and personal capacities were potential challenges to partnering, while networking facilitated the process. The article aims to assist both educators and researchers to better understand the partnership process and to enable educators to effectively establish partnerships with community members.

This article explores this question based on the experiences of two teachers involved in a multi-year study focused, in part, on school-family connections. Findings emerged from data collected during numerous visits made to the students' homes over two to three years, formal and informal interviews with the families, and the teachers' weekly reflections about their teaching and  the students' academic development. They also reflected after each of the family visits, focusing their reflections on what had taken place on the visit, what they had learned from and about the family, and what this new knowledge meant for teaching that particular child or the class as a whole. The teachers' goal was to help students achieve academically by providing effective instruction that linked students' learning in school to their background of knowledge and experiences. The teachers' reflections helped them focus on whether and how they were reaching that goal and on what modifications might be needed.",

        "description":"Although outcomes for alternative schools may be mixed, it is generally agreed that counseling, therapy, group work, case management, and family-community involvement have been credited in some effective programs. This study examined program evaluations from 1994-1999 for an alternative school for chronically disruptive students (599 students, ages 9-22) that was funded by a state grant to assure safer, drug-free public schools. School-based mental health services were mandated by the grant. Annual program evaluations and positive outcomes were necessary for continued funding by the state. Psychosocial (self-esteem, depression, locus of control, and life skills) and educational outcomes (grade point averages and attendance) were examined at entry and exit. In addition, 90- and 180-day follow-ups were conducted for educational outcomes. Although educational outcomes improved during assignment to the alternative school (greater than 70% passing), in the 90- and 180-day follow-ups student grade point averages improved but were not passing. Notably, student dropout for alternative students was an average of 8% 180 days after the assignment compared to the school district's 45% dropout rate. The focus of this study was to determine whether the alternative school was a viable family-community intervention for improving social functioning and educational achievement for chronically disruptive students, whether these interventions were effective in improving school safety, and whether the program missions were consistently accomplished during the five years of implementation and one year follow-up based on the program evaluations.

Based on interviews and observations focusing on ten mothers' involvement in their children's education, we offer a framework that expands typical characterizations of parent involvement. This framework privileges practices that are both traditionally visible and invisible to the school and highlights how parents act as \"intellectual resources\" in their children's education (Civil, Guevara, & Allexsaht-Snider, 2002). Our findings offer evidence that traditional understandings of parent involvement may overlook ways that low-income parents deliberately involve themselves in their children's education. Our findings also identify challenges that these parents face in relation to their children's mathematics education. Some of these challenges were due in part to stereotypes held by practitioners about the families they serve in low-income urban schools. (Contains 1 endnote and 1 table.)",

Many varying service-learning projects were performed. The student teachers' insightful written reports described important outcomes in terms of new knowledge acquired, a deeper appreciation for the circumstances of others' lives, and greater acceptance in their placement communities.

The within-program control group alternative permits a comparison between those who receive more of a treatment and those who receive less. For this evaluation, students were divided into two groups based on the number of hours of tutoring they received. Tutored students were more likely to increase their grade to passing than could be expected by chance. Students in the group that received more tutoring were more likely to pass than those who received less tutoring. The within-program control group design gives us confidence that tutoring of middle school students by  minimally trained community volunteers can be effective. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

The greatest challenge confronting the nation remains within large urban metropolises where large numbers of minority students attend underfunded and low-performing schools with low standardized test scores and high dropout rates. African American children and youth constitute over 50% of all students in urban school systems.  The social work profession has a long history of advocacy with urban minority students dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. Yet, the appropriate body of knowledge that either conceptually or empirically documents practice methods by school social workers practicing within urban school settings with African American students does not exist. In a solution-oriented presentation with implications for school social work practice, advocacy, and research, the author will first review past and present education reform measures. The discussion then turns to ways in which the social work profession can address major issues of education reform with a clear understanding of the educational needs of urban African American children and youth using macro, mezzo, and micro practice measures.

Many schools have goals to reduce student truancy and to help chronically absent students attend school regularly. Few studies, however, have focused on whether or how family and community involvement help reduce rates of chronic absenteeism. In this longitudinal study, data were collected from 39 schools on rates of chronic absenteeism and on specific family and community involvement activities that were implemented to reduce this  serious problem for student learning. Results indicate that school, family, and community partnership practices can significantly decrease chronic absenteeism, even after school level and prior rates of absenteeism are taken into account. In particular, communicating with families about attendance, celebrating good attendance with students and families, and connecting chronically absent students with community mentors measurably reduced students' chronic absenteeism from one year to the next. Also, schools that conducted a greater total number of attendance-focused activities were more likely to decrease the percentage of students who missed twenty or more days of school each year.

The question guiding this research was, &quot;Did the adoption of a constructive-collaborative model involving a university-school partnership and based on strengthening school-family relations promote the professional education of teachers, and if so, how?&quot; An investigative and formative model was adopted based on practical rationality. Termed &quot;constructive-collaborative,&quot; it was chosen to promote and analyze interactions established between the university and school communities. Teaching conditions, school organization and functioning characteristics, and school practices were taken into consideration. It was assumed that teachers construct a knowledge base in the course of their professional development. In analyzed situations, we observed broad parental support for initiatives carried out by the school, as evidenced by large-scale participation in program activities. This response, in turn, generated great enthusiasm among the teachers, resulting in the continuation, improvement, and expansion of successful practices and programs. However, frequent changes in some local educational policies, implementation of new objectives in the schools, as well as the school district policy by which teachers are annually relocated (at present) were some of the observed difficulties in solidifying school-family connections.",

Findings indicate differing opinions among parents and school staff in the areas of understanding Hmong culture, multiculturalism and cultural  sensitivity, Hmong students &quot;model minority&quot; or &quot;at risk&quot; educationally and linguistically, the role parents play in school involvement, and the construction of race and ethnicity of Hmong students. Neither of two typical Asian stereotypes was attributed to Hmong students, and the prevailing perspective of the ethnic groups was that of &quot;foreigner.&quot; Conflicts with work schedules and language barriers are common constraints to parent involvement in the classrooms. Hmong parents are deeply concerned about their children's education and expect the school staff to be accountable for student achievement.

        "description":"Although the mixed heritage population of the U.S. continues to grow, few (if any) attempts have been made to examine educational needs specific to this group of children, especially from the family's perspective. This article uses ethnographic data to examine the experiences of one mixed heritage family--with an African American father and a Chinese American mother--in an urban middle school. The data revealed that the family experienced several sources of tension from the school, from the child, and from interracial differences concerning the educational needs of their child. Specifically, the data revealed that interracial differences within the family were influenced by situational complexities. The article suggests the importance of understanding and addressing these tensions and complexities in reaching out to mixed heritage students and their families.",

Through a school-community partnership known as the Texas Alliance School Initiative, two sample schools collaborated with the El Paso Interreligious Sponsoring Organization, a local faith-based institution, to facilitate parental engagement with the school and to meaningfully connect the school to its community. This yearlong study sought to examine the impact of the Initiative as a conduit for school improvement and constructive partnerships. Qualitative research methods were used to collect and analyze the study data. Results indicate that the Initiative significantly impacted parent leadership, self-confidence, and community activism. School personnel reported strengthened bonds with parents and the community. Parent centers, parent academies, and parent educators were described as integral to the Alliance School concept. Research participants also cited institutional borders, such as contrived collaboration, constrained professional discretion, limited institutional capacity, and conflicting organizational agendas as potential problems with the Initiative.",

Independent-samples t tests were then used to assess whether there were any differences in achievement as reported in national test scores among students with a perception of a high level of parent involvement, students with a perception of a low level of parent involvement, and homeschool students. The findings of the study were that the perception of a high level of parent involvement does have a significant impact upon achievement. Students who perceived a high level of parent involvement performed significantly better on the national ACT exam than students who perceived a low level of parent involvement. There was no difference in academic achievement between public school students who perceived a high level of parent involvement and homeschool students. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Specifically, this research uses Connelly and Clandinin's epistemology of &quot;teacher as knower&quot; as a way to frame the voices of the instructional aides.

        "description":"Family literacy programs reflect a recent trend in educational reform that has proven to be a successful educational model for all members of the family unit. Based on the literature that links family involvement to student achievement, these initiatives focus on empowering parents of school children. These programs have been particularly beneficial for linguistically and culturally diverse families, since they provide opportunities for adult family members to acquire English language/literacy skills while gaining access to the sociocultural knowledge required for them to assume greater roles of involvement in their children's education. This article examines specific key elements considered essential in the effective implementation of family literacy programs. Insights from the authors' experiences with implementing family English literacy programs for over 20 years in the South Florida area include the role of needs assessments, recruitment and retention, curricular design and curricular materials, personnel selection and staff development, and interagency collaboration. Given the current emphasis on these types of programs, it is imperative that issues of implementation be addressed in order to maximize the success of these initiatives.",

Although the teaching of character waned from the 1960s through the 1980s, the rise in violent crime and a general feeling by the public that American children suffered a crisis in morals led to a resurgence of character education programs across the nation, with most states either mandating or supporting such education. Today, many schools are engaged in formal programs such as \"Character Counts!\" or the Heartwood Institute's \"An Ethics Curriculum for Children.\" Other school systems use individually tailored programs. At the heart of most programs lie core principles such as honesty, respect, self-discipline, and perseverance. Parental and community involvement are also common components of the various programs. The Internet hosts numerous sites featuring character education ranging from bibliographies to web sites designed specifically for interactive use by children. Enormous responsibility is placed on teachers to provide an effective character education curriculum, but formal training in character education is limited.",

Integration is claimed to engage students by providing opportunities to work on a few cross-disciplinary objectives, to apply knowledge across the subject boundaries and to work on tasks with meaning and relevance. While these curriculum goals enjoy a certain popularity among middle school reformers and curriculum integration adherents, in practice, the prevalence of integration is patchy and provisional. In this article, we (re) examine two of our studies of middle school integration over the past decade to explore the reasons for this apparent disparity between the rhetoric and the reality. In our re-search for integration, we look back at our data to identify enabling and inhibiting conditions for curriculum reform and develop a list of key program characteristics. Finally, we look forward, drawing on the notion of institutional resilience to speculate on the reasons why some middle school programs seem to flourish while others wither. (Contains 2 tables.)

Beane's model is highly responsive to the educational and developmental needs of young people. In contrast, multidisciplinary curriculum design (Jacobs 1989) may result in significant but largely unrecognised drawbacks when it is implemented in the middle grades. This paper critically examines the theory of the integrative and the multidisciplinary models of curriculum integration with respect to middle level curriculum reform in Australian schools.

Despite moves towards middle school reform and improved literacy standards, there remains a gap in literacy provision for young adolescent learners, particularly those defined as &quot;educationally disadvantaged&quot; or &quot;at risk&quot; (DEETYA 1998, Masters &amp; Forster 1997). Many literacy intervention programs offered to underachieving adolescents fail to articulate to mainstream curriculum and assessment practices, or to scaffold students adequately in meeting the literacy demands of an increasingly abstract and specialised curriculum (Christie 1990, Unsworth 2001). These often lead to a differentiated and limited curriculum which may compound educational disadvantage and maintain stratified outcomes. This article investigates a mainstream and intervention literacy pedagogy designed to improve the outcomes of disadvantaged learners while at the same time accelerating the progress of all students in the middle years.

        "description":"This paper explores various epistemological paradigms available to understand, interpret, and semiotically depict young people. These paradigms all draw upon a metadiscourse of developmental age and stage (e.g. Hall 1914) and then work from particular epistemological views of the world to cast young people in different lights. Using strategic essentialism (Spivak 1996), this paper offers four descriptions of existing paradigms, including biomedical (Erikson 1980), psychological (e.g. Piaget 1973), critical (e.g. Giroux & MacLaren 1982), and postmodern (e.g. Kenway & Bullen 2001). While some of these paradigms have been more distinct in particular cultural, historical, and political contexts, they have overlapped, informing each other as they continue to inform our understandings of young people. Each paradigm carries unique consequences for the role of the learner, the teacher, and the curriculum. This paper explores contemporary manifestations of these paradigms. From this investigation, a potential new space for conceptualising young people is offered. This new space, underpinned by understandings of subjectivity (Grosz 1994), assumes sense of self to be both pivotal in generative learning and closely linked to the context and its dynamics. We aver that such a view of young people and educational settings is necessary at this time of focused attention to the middle years of schooling. In so doing, we explore the potential of classroom life and pre-service teacher education constructed within this new discourse of young people. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"As a new reform in Australian education, middle schooling has been gaining momentum. The rationale behind middle schooling is to bridge the traditional primary-high school gap and provide a more developmentally appropriate educational experience for young adolescents. Middle schooling in the USA has gone through a &quot;boom-to-bust&quot; cycle and is currently undergoing a &quot;reinvention&quot; as research on practice and reporting of research on practice has, in the most part, been ad hoc and piecemeal. If Australian middle schools are to avoid the boom-to-bust-to-reinvention cycle experienced in parts of the USA (Beane 2001), then a more systematic approach to researching practice is required. Research-based criteria for systematic study and improvement of middle school practice have been identified as (a) &quot;acceptance&quot; as part of &quot;planning&quot; alternative practice, (b) &quot;effectiveness&quot; as part of &quot;implementing&quot; alternative practice, and (c) &quot;sustainability&quot; as part of &quot;evaluating&quot; alternative practice.

        "description":"Mathematics games are widely employed in school classrooms for such reasons as a reward for early finishers or to enhance students' attitude towards mathematics. During a four week period, a total of 222 Grade 5 and 6 (9 to 12 years old) children from Melbourne, Australia, were taught multiplication and division of decimal numbers using calculator games or rich mathematical activities. Likert scale surveys of the children's attitudes towards games as a vehicle for learning mathematics revealed unexpectedly high proportions of negative attitudes at the conclusion of the research. In contrast, student interview data revealed positive associations between games and mathematical learning. This paper reports on the methodological dilemma of resultant conflicting attitudinal data related to game-playing. Concerns arising from the divergence in the results are raised in this paper. Implications based on the experience of this study may inform educational researchers about future methodological choices involving attitudinal research. (Contains 5 tables.)",

A survey task to construct a graph to represent data about temperature change over time was administered to 133 students in Grades 3, 5, 7, and 9. Four response levels described the degree to which students transformed a table of data into a coordinate graph. \"Nonstatistical\" responses did not display the data, showing either the context or a graph form only. \"Single Aspect\" responses showed data along a single dimension, either in a table of corresponding values, or a graph of a single variable. \"Inadequate Coordinate\" responses showed bivariate data in two-dimensional space but inadequately showed either spatial variation or correspondence of values. \"Appropriate Coordinate\" graphs displayed both correspondence and variation of values along ordered axes, either as a bar graph of discrete values or as a line graph of continuous variation. These levels of coordinate graph production were then related to levels of response obtained by the same students on two other survey tasks: one involving speculative data generation from a verbal statement of covariation, and the other involving verbal and numerical graph interpretation from a coordinate scattergraph. Features of graphical representations that may prompt student development at different levels are discussed. (Contains 8 figures and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Meaning-making is vital in the realm of principalship. It serves as the fulcrum of one's practice which eventually leads to seeing the light and appreciating the serendipity of principalship. While explicit knowledge abounds in the literature and is communicated in professional development programs, the role of the principals' tacit knowledge derived from their experiences, day-to-day dealings with the school's stakeholders, observations, insights, and reflections are vital inputs in understanding the dynamics of school principalship. This narrative inquiry is an attempt to capture the tacit knowledge of a Filipino secondary school principal whose experiences were limited by the absence of a formal academic preparation in school management but illumined by her &quot;leadership reflective space&quot; (&quot;LRS&quot;) which enabled her to surface the serendipitous language of principalship.",

With this conception of the prototypical students or group, he teaches only one-third of students to reach a level of achievement. At the end of semester, most teachers give their grades, generally reflecting students' IQ scores, according to a normal distribution curve. There are good learners and poor learners, faster learners and slow learners in any classroom, mainly due to their inborn abilities or environment. We believe that all people are created equal, and deserve equal educational opportunity. Therefore, educational outcomes should be equal for all students in general basic education. Equality of learning outcomes and vertical equality in the learning process are very hard to achieve. Nevertheless, it has to be an ideal goal of schooling and a long-range objective of education reform. In accordance with the goal of schooling and education reform, the principal role of teachers should be teach all students to master their subject.",

        "description":"The primary purpose of this exploratory study is to identify variations in the ways in which individual teachers in different educational contexts interpret their curriculum and plan their lessons and in particular to explore the possibility that cultural differences as identified by Hofstede (1991) may be a contributing factor to understanding how teachers understand their work. &quot;Educational reform&quot; has become a catchphrase in the Anglo-American world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and England and Wales, as well as in the Confucian Heritage Areas such as Mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Across the world, the educational reform measures being implemented are surprisingly similar. This paper describes a study of how geography teachers in Queensland, Australia, Hong Kong, and Changchun, China, plan their lessons and curriculum. From classroom observations and interviews with the teachers involved, we confirmed marked differences in each location regarding their cultural traits of power distance, individualist and collectivist preference and uncertainty tolerance, and that these traits appear to be highly influential in their curriculum planning. Despite the small scale of this study, we contend that there are good reasons for caution before national education systems import policies and curriculum reform initiatives from other countries for unthinking adoption.

This study explores the conceptions of excellent teaching held by 20 middle school teachers in the north of China.

Four main themes were found: (1) caring for students, (2) guiding students' all-round development, (3) connecting school knowledge/work to other areas, and (4) planning and preparing structured lessons. In contrast to other Western and Chinese descriptions of excellent teaching, these teachers were much less transmission, examination, or professionally oriented and exhibited much more nurturing, facilitative, and apprenticeship characteristics.

Eighteen reform documents issued in the two countries by national governmental and non-governmental organizations since the 1980s were selected and analyzed. It was found that while both Korean and American documents seem to draw on elements of the functionalist (or trait theory) conception of professionalism, Korean documents put more emphasis on issues related to the power/autonomy of teachers. Regarding cross-country influence, Korea seems to have appropriated ideas and moved toward the structures and practices evidenced in the U.S.A. during an earlier period.

        "author":["Forlin, Chris"],
        "description":"Together with the many advantages incurred by educational reform there are concomitantly a number of challenges that have to be addressed. In the field of special education there have probably been more changes in the past decade than in any other area of education. In 2006, Hong Kong is undoubtedly at the cusp of major changes which continue to reflect the paradigm shifts occurring internationally. One area of concern for all is the issue of support for learners with special needs. It is clear that as more learners with disabilities are included in regular classes support services are moving relatively quickly from a withdrawal one-on-one intervention model that is no longer viable, to increasingly providing support in class by co-teaching, or even redesigning support so that it is aimed at the teacher rather than the child. Additionally, support services are becoming more sophisticated as parents demand greater attention to the specific needs of their child and as they expect educational systems to provide the most up to date practices. For every child with a special need there are many stakeholders who seek to provide some form of support. This can become quite overwhelming, staccato in its implementation, and demanding in the extreme, thus resulting in a disjointed unworkable approach. This paper will consider how support can be redesigned to provide a more collaborative, collegial and cohesive approach that is manageable within the current transformations that are occurring in Hong Kong.

It compares the multilevel growth parameter estimates and potential predictor effects obtained using LGM, HLM, and LPAMS. The purpose of this multilevel growth analysis is to alert applied researchers to selected analytical issues that are required for consideration in decisions to apply one of these three approaches to longitudinal academic achievement studies. The results indicated that there were no significant distinctions on either mean growth parameter estimates or on the effects of potential predictors to growth factors at both the student and school levels. However, the study also produced equivocal findings on the statistical testing of variance and covariance growth parameter estimates. Other practical issues pertaining to the three growth modeling methods are also discussed. (Contains 4 tables, 1 figure and 4 notes.)",

The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of &quot;manpower-centered education.&quot; In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it &quot;competency-based education.&quot; In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is self-actualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions.",

        "description":"This study looks into issues pertaining to the policy of including native English-speaking teachers (NESTs) in elementary schools in Taiwan, i.e., NEST programs, from the perspective of the teachers involved. Through data gathered from interviews and classroom observations, this qualitative study examines the necessity of NEST programs and reveals the challenges facing NESTs and local English teachers as they negotiate the process of working together. It shows that while a NEST program is not a centralized language teacher policy in Taiwan, its necessity remains a moot point. Moreover, working with Taiwanese homeroom teachers presented challenges to the NESTs, and the local English teachers considered that working with inexperienced NESTs presented unwanted challenges. Finally, suggestions on NEST programs are discussed. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between different levels of organizational commitment (compliance, identification, internalization) of teachers and their different conflict management strategies (compromising, problem solving, forcing, yielding, avoiding). Based on a questionnaire survey of 418 teachers, this study indicated that male teachers are more likely to experience commitment based on compliance, and are more likely to avoid conflicts than female teachers. As teachers get older they are more likely to experience commitment based on internalization and on identification, and they are more likely to use problem solving conflict management strategies than those who are younger. The results also revealed that both identification and internalization are significant determinants of the use of compromising and problem-solving conflict management strategies. Commitment based on compliance is the only significant predictor of forcing behavior. Commitment based both on identification and compliance are found to be the important determinants of avoiding behavior. Of these two, identification was found to be the most significant predictor of avoiding conflict behavior. Conflict resolution through yielding was not predicted by any level of organizational commitment. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Conceptual models of Field Experience have been developed in accordance to the paradigms addressing the professional development of teacher effectiveness, based both on external forces or internal reflective capability that will change a teacher. Simply put, a focus is placed upon teachers to change and grow. Field experience is not equivalent to student placement or teaching supervision, but is a device for teacher change at various professional stages.

        "description":"Adopting policies of decentralization has become more or less a universal fashion among governments. Institutional redesigning as regard to affirmative state is favored by the political left and right in capitalist democracies. However, their arguments revolve around the decision-making powers of ordinary citizens. Some academics argue that the &quot;People's Campaign for Decentralized Planning&quot; (PCDP) introduced in 1996 in Kerala, the south western state of India, is an extended version of democratic decentralization. They also describe it as Empowered Deliberative Democracy (EDD). Through a comparison of continuity and change aspects in the field of primary education based on programmes carried out in two districts of Kerala (India), this paper analyzes the democratic decentralization policy initiated in the state. The paper concludes with insights related to the need for the redefinition of the process of initiating and sustaining educational changes in a decentralized fashion in Kerala. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In response, the Education Sector strengthened the teaching of values on national ideals and Filipino heritage. One reform was the offering of Moral Education as an independent subject in the secondary education curriculum. In support of this, publishing companies developed textbooks on Moral Education, which teachers used, aside from the prescribed textbooks. To determine the extent and nature of the inclusion of national identity in these textbooks, this study analyzed the content of 12 sample textbooks. Findings suggest the need to improve the content of textbooks in terms of the values relevant in developing citizens with a strong sense of national identity needed for national development.

There has been much development in both research and practice in the 1990s and 2000s relating to bullying in Korean schools. Most Korean research on bullying, however, has almost exclusively focussed on verification of the facts that bullying or peer rejection is a widespread phenomenon in schools. This study, however, is mainly concerned with how to tackle effectively the bullying problem on the basis of Christian educational philosophy. To do this, this paper suggests a four stage approach to dealing with bullying: namely, clarifying the Christian school ethos, leading to determine the school's bullying policy. With the bullying policy, school anti-bullying programs could be developed in order to create a bullying-free school environment. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

Among these, the suitability of the curriculum was the most significant predictor. Furthermore, the path analysis for learning and research indicated significant mutual causal relationships between research progress and supervisor's advice. The level of Japanese language skills is not necessarily required to receive advice from their supervisors, although Japanese language skills help to understand the content of classes.

This claim is explored through investigating the manner in which a selection of history textbooks in use in US and Japanese schools invites students to understand the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Linking narrative with historical analysis, the paper presents evidence which suggests that US and Japanese children are provided with a narrow view of the past which in promoting a sense of unity and patriotism limits the development of a critical historical consciousness.

        "description":"Learning no longer takes place as effectively as it did before in most current Korean classrooms. Many teachers have voiced concerns about a notably reduced level of students' interest in and enthusiasm for learning school materials, lack of students' attention to their lectures, and lack of students' involvement in classroom activities. This negative change, which has been observed since around 1997, is often referred to as &quot;school collapse&quot; in Korea, meaning classroom breakdown. The paper investigates the factors that have lead to the phenomenon of the school collapse, introduces the 7th National Curriculum as one of the new reform approaches of the Korean government, and makes some suggestions to ensure more autonomy and diversity in classrooms to promote effective teaching and learning.

Employing standard benefit-incidence analysis, this paper empirically examines how public education spending is currently distributed in Yemen. It also considers the extent to which the distributional benefit to the poor should and can be improved, focusing on possible changes in cost sharing for higher education and on associated changes in budget allocations. The findings support the government's decision to increase cost sharing while maintaining a high overall level of public education spending and provide a benchmark from which to monitor the impact of this and other education spending decisions on the poor.

Premised on this inconsistency of results and gaps in knowledge of this field in Cambodian education, this study was conducted in order to examine the effect of pupil factor on their mathematics achievement. The data were collected from pupils by means of questionnaires and a mathematics test. After controlling such factors as pupils' poverty during the research design, the results of the stepwise regression analysis showed that pupils' interest in mathematics was a significantly positive contributor to their performance. Pupils' absence frequency, gender, grade repetition and preschool attendance had significantly negative effects on their mathematics outcome. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

Professionalization and bureaucratization are simultaneous processes. Teaching as an occupation has grown from a state of idiosyncrasy to a profession with defined boundaries. However, achieving system efficiency and technical rationality, both features of bureaucracy, could undermine or suppress teachers' individual autonomy. Thus, bureaucratization supports professionalization by raising the status of teaching, but undermines professionalism by constraining teachers' autonomy. The article examines the changing pattern of stratification and how it shaped the relationship between the professionalization, bureaucratization and professionalism of teaching in Hong Kong. It argues that teaching cannot be a true profession without realizing professionalism, and that teacher education has a central role in the drive towards it. (Contains 8 notes.)",

The following issues emerged as areas of particular importance to future research in distance learner support: 1) the lack of research on cost-effectiveness; 2) the lack of empirical research; and 3) the need for a learner-centered approach in designing and implementing learner support. These issues are discussed in detail to enhance our understanding the role of learner support in post-secondary level distance education programs. It is further argued that future research should focus more on developing and refining methods for cost-benefit analysis of learner support, developing a general framework of the learner support model in dual-mode institutions, and developing systematic methods to identify, analyze, synthesize, and assess the needs of distance learners.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that dynamic assessment based instruction increases children's learning by using a quasi-experimental research design in Korea. In this study, dynamic assessment is defined as a measurement method of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) as well as the qualitative and quantitative diagnostic information for individual children. In addition, dynamic assessment based instruction is defined as a teaching method using the diagnostic information types in order to increase children's learning. In this study, 59 children between the ages of 4 and 5 participated. Three types of number concept achievement tests (pre-test, parallel test, and post-test) for each age group were developed and the content validity, face validity, and split-half reliability were examined. After conducting the pre-test, the children of each age group were divided into an experimental group and a control group. Dynamic assessment based instruction regarding number concepts was undertaken only with the experimental group for 4 weeks. Both groups took a post-test after completing the 4 weeks of classes. The ANCOVA technique was used for data analysis. The result of this study shows that dynamic assessment based instruction has a significant effect on children's learning of number concepts (in the case of 4-year-old children, F = 12.34, p less than 0.01; 5-year-old children, F = 20.03, p less than 0.01). Therefore, dynamic assessment based instruction should be used widely for children's cognitive learning. (Contains 4 figures and 13 tables.)",

For voters to ask these questions of their members of parliament and for them subsequently to make headlines in newspapers, these questions clearly strike a chord with many members of the voting public. In this article, the author discusses this phenomenon from her perspective as a public servant and from a broader perspective as a mathematics educator and teacher. It is not her intention to provide definitive answers, but merely to raise awareness, explore the topic, and make suggestions for solutions in the hope that teachers and educators can gain a better understanding of the issues and why they are issues. Thus they might be able to provide informed responses to the community and parents when the issues are raised. (Contains 2 notes.)",

Between 5 and 8 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 14 have a particular type of cognitive deficiency that limits their aptitude to acquire knowledge and understanding of fundamental ideas in numeracy. Increasingly, researchers in the cognitive sciences are studying this deficiency under the name dyscalculia, a disorder in which normally intelligent children demonstrate specific disabilities in learning mathematics. Teachers need to be informed about dyscalculia so that they can implement strategies that intentionally and explicitly accommodate students who have this disorder. This paper defines dyscalculia, considers the origins of dyscalculia in psychological, biological, and pedagogical contexts, describes the criteria required to diagnose students with dyscalculia, and delineates practical methods and instructional designs that can be implemented in the classroom to address the specific learning needs of dyscalculic learners.

        "description":"This article considers steps towards making a numeracy-across-the-curriculum policy. Numeracy means more than the kind of everyday arithmetic a person (a competent independent adult) needs to handle whole number (and simple decimal) calculations; e.g., money, time, and simple measurement. Importantly, aspects of numeracy arise in any everyday task or question which involves mathematical thinking, including logical reasoning, critical analysis, categorisation and sorting, and problem-solving. Numeracy also includes spatial thinking, visual representation, analysis of cause and effect and randomness in events, and data-handling, which arise in many seemingly non-mathematical parts of the school curriculum, the non-mathematics key learning areas such as Science, Social Sciences or Humanities, Arts, Technology, Physical Education, and Languages. In this article, the author presents the Erehwon (Secondary) School Numeracy-across-the-Curriculum Policy as an example. He discusses numeracy across a sample Key Learning Area (KLA) such as the Arts.",

However, as concerns vocational education, empirical verification of the assumptions which form the basis of this shift in didactic theory is largely lacking. This article aims to help reduce this deficit and may serve as a basis for a critical questioning of the viability of common assumptions. (Contains 2 figures and 10 footnotes.)",

Most jobs call not only for knowledge and specific technical competencies, but also for a certain level of social and emotional skills enabling workers, for example, to work in teams, to motivate themselves when confronting problems, to solve interpersonal disputes, and to tolerate high levels of stress. The best way of developing socio-emotional skills is through experience, appropriate training and practice. For this reason, we argue that the time spent undergoing on-site training is a perfect opportunity for tutors to help students and recent graduates to develop their socio-emotional skills.

It is mostly used for individual courses and much less for curricula although, seen from the point of view of competence, this could be the most interesting level.

The discussion is centred around the way in which education and vocational experience contribute to the process of producing useful skills in the job market or, conversely, of making them obsolete. The data comes from a survey of five banks in which we asked supervisors to assess the skills of 600 employees (counter staff and customer managers). It is a hetero-assessment based on a list of skills and behaviours. The central theme of this article is to draw attention to the process of the invalidation of acquired knowledge which individuals can be faced with and the role which banks accord to the two sources of human capital. The complementarity or substitution of sources of skills acquisition is thus proposed on a case-by-case basis. (Contains 4 tables, 1 graph, 11 footnotes, and a Bibliography.)

As concerns the structurally oriented method of imparting VET, which underwent this change early on, it is necessary to differentiate the category of knowledge, above all with respect to practical knowledge and practical concepts, and also as a basis for domain-specific VET research.

Following Kane (1992), the validation of statements about teachers' competence is regarded as the evaluation of interpretive argumentation. Based on contemporary insights into teaching and learning, an interpretive model of competent performance is described which, rather than being prescriptive in nature, offers scope for various forms of responsible professional performance. Consequences of professional performance for students/class/organisation are the basis of the model. Acceptable interventions and underlying decision-making processes as well as the associated parts of a professional knowledge base are derived from the consequences. The consequences of these insights for developing domains of competence and collecting evidence are discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"In 1996, a new curricular framework for vocational education in schools called &quot;Lernfelder&quot; (learning arenas) was implemented in Germany. In the concept of learning arenas learning situations in schools have to be related to work activity in a particular occupation. For this reason work process orientation currently plays a significant role in German curriculum development. However, there is not just one approach on how to transform work activity into vocational curricula, but various competing approaches. In this paper two important approaches are characterised and strengths and weaknesses of each are identified. Summing up, it may be said that the work-oriented turnaround in German curriculum development has not yet fully happened. Problems of analysing work situations in companies, transforming work process knowledge into curricula and assessing competences which students or apprentices have acquired are still being solved.

Participants could work 4 hours every weekday in a workplace where they could earn about $10.00 per hour in vouchers; they were required to provide routine urine samples. Participants who attended the workplace and provided cocaine-positive urine samples during the initial 4 weeks were invited to work 26 weeks and were randomly assigned to an abstinence-and-work (n = 28) or work-only (n = 28) group. Abstinence-and-work participants had to provide urine samples showing cocaine abstinence to work and maintain maximum pay. Work-only participants could work independent of their urinalysis results. Abstinence-and-work participants provided more (p = 0.004; OR = 5.80, 95% CI = 2.03-16.56) cocaine-negative urine samples (29%) than did work-only participants (10%).

Results showed that following acquisition with the target set, both responses generalized across questions and teachers for all participants. Following IDK training, some undesirable generalization of IDK to known questions occurred for 3 participants. Training of IDKPTM with the addition of a restricted reinforcement contingency was sufficient to establish correct answers to a portion of previously unknown questions.

In one condition, teachers set a goal for student behavior and received daily written feedback about student performance. In a second condition, teachers received daily written feedback about student performance as well as their own accuracy in implementing the intervention and would be able to avoid meeting with a consultant to practice missed steps by implementing the intervention with 100% integrity. This latter package increased treatment integrity the most above baseline levels. Higher levels of treatment integrity were significantly correlated with lower levels of student problem behavior for 3 of the 4 teacher-student dyads. Three of the 4 teachers also rated both feedback procedures as highly acceptable. Implications for increasing and maintaining treatment integrity by teachers via a consultation model are discussed.

        "description":"The conceptual basis for many effective language-training programs are based on Skinner's (1957) analysis of verbal behavior. Skinner described several elementary verbal operants including mands, tacts, intraverbals, and echoics. According to Skinner, responses that are the same topography may actually be functionally independent. Previous research has supported Skinner's assertion of functional independence (e.g., Hall & Sundberg, 1987; Lamarre & Holland, 1985), and some research has suggested that specific programming must be incorporated to achieve generalization across verbal operants (e.g., Sigafoos, Reichle, & Doss, 1990). The present study provides further analysis of the independence of verbal operants when teaching language to children with autism and other developmental disabilities. In the current study, 3 participants' vocal responses were first assessed as mands or tacts. Generalization for each verbal operant across alternate conditions was then assessed and subsequent training provided as needed. Results indicated that generalization across verbal operants occurred across some, but not all, vocal responses. These results are discussed relative to the functional independence of verbal operants as described by Skinner. (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)",

However, no applied studies have evaluated the effects of postsession reinforcement on choice between concurrently available reinforcers, even though basic findings indicate that this is an important factor to consider (Hursh, 1978; Zeiler, 1999). In this bridge investigation, we evaluated the influence of postsession reinforcement on choice of two food items when task responding was reinforced on progressive-ratio schedules. Participants were 3 children who had been diagnosed with developmental disabilities. Results indicated that response allocation shifted from one food item to the other food item under thinner schedules of reinforcement when no postsession reinforcement was provided. These findings suggest that the efficacy of instructional programs or treatments for problem behavior may be improved by restricting reinforcers outside treatment sessions. (Contains 3 figures.)",

An expert panel interview and structured criterion visual inspection were used to evaluate treatment effects across measurement methods. Results showed that treatment analysis interpretations based on both discontinuous recording methods often matched those based on frequency or duration recording; however, interpretations based on MTS were slightly more likely to match those based on duration and those based on PIR were slightly more likely to match those based on frequency.

        "description":"Least-to-most prompting hierarchies (e.g., progressing from verbal to modeled to physical prompts until the target response occurs) may be ineffective when the prompts do not cue the individual to attend to the relevant stimulus dimensions. In such cases, emission of the target response persistently requires one or more of the higher level prompts, a condition called prompt dependence (Clark & Green, 2004). Reinforcement of differential observing responses (DORs) has sometimes been used to ensure that participants attend to the relevant stimulus dimensions in matching-to-sample (MTS) tasks (e.g., Dube & McIlvane, 1999). For 2 participants with autism, we embedded an identity-matching task within a prompting hierarchy as a DOR to increase the likelihood that the participants attended to and discriminated the relevant features of the comparison stimuli in an MTS task. This procedure was compared with a traditional least-to-most prompting hierarchy and a no-reinforcement control condition in a multielement design. Results for both participants indicated that mastery-level acquisition of spoken-word-to-picture relations occurred only under the identity-matching condition. Findings are discussed relative to the use of DORs to facilitate acquisition of conditional discriminations in persons with autism or other conditions who do not attend to the comparison stimuli.

In reading both the research and the current policy environment, the authors identify several fundamental reasons why it is so difficult to develop the knowledge needed to inform policies that might enable standards-based reform to succeed. First is an inadequate conception of the goal of the system and how proficiency should be measured. Second, research shows that the teaching side of the teaching/learning interaction in instruction is crucial. Third is the need to solve the problem of finding real-school settings for conducting multivariate research and, more particularly, development at a scale and duration that will produce usable, proven knowledge, tools, and policies for teaching practice. However, none of these three concerns can be addressed effectively unless those who fund and manage education research take a much more strategic view of what they are doing. By \"strategic\" the authors mean that funders and managers should focus on the key goals of practice or on particular big problems that seem to impede attainment of those goals.",

        "description":"Many school leaders today, not to mention many teachers, view &quot;accountability&quot; as a loathsome political monster. Looming over educators, insensitive to the many problems they face, it wields the carrot of rewards in one hand and the club of sanctions in the other. Some educators even blame accountability for perverting their noble purposes, twisting their sensibilities, and corrupting their integrity. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) accountability system seeks to improve all children's education by identifying schools that need improvement and taking corrective action. As nearly every school leader knows, the system stipulates that all students should achieve a state-defined &quot;proficient&quot; or better level in mathematics and language arts. Annual, measurable standards in those two areas must lead to 100 percent proficiency by 2014. Leaders also know that NCLB requires schools to meet specific &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; (AYP) goals based on the percentage of students achieving at or above state-established proficiency standards. Improving education today requires an entirely different view of the matter. This article discusses that instead of viewing accountability as a straitjacket that hinders teaching, school leaders and teachers should embrace the opportunity to show various constituents the positive results. That will require two fundamental changes: new courage to ask difficult questions constantly, and new skills to find honest answers to those difficult questions. If educators make accountability their responsibility, the benefits to all students will be immediate, highly visible, and most impressive.",

The free-market argument claims that the more sophisticated, complex jobs generated by an avalanche of new industries will be won by a well-trained, highly educated labor force, while the less-complex jobs will be left to workers in less-developed nations. If this free-trade utopia were to emerge, the responsibility for preparing such an advanced competitive workforce would fall to America's schools. As such, America's schools must become more serious about teaching advanced knowledge to all or most students; otherwise, nations that are pressing their students to reach higher academic standards will take the new jobs, and our students will fall behind. To understand this pressure for world-class schools in a &quot;flat world economy,&quot; it seems more important than ever to find out what advanced knowledge and academic skills leaders in business and industry expect from America's high school graduates.

        "description":"Students have problems in their lives, but can teachers help them? Should teachers help? The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act and its emphasis on standardized test results have forced school systems to produce high scores, and in turn school administrators pressure teachers to prepare students for taking standardized tests. Teachers may want to deal with students' problems, but a required curriculum emphasizing skill drills has compromised teaching time. Teachers are not free to determine what should be taught in their classrooms. Although many teachers are not comfortable with discussing students' lives in the classroom, others want to help their students solve life problems. These teachers try to modify rigid or scripted curricula to meet the needs of their students. This article discusses the work of Paulo Freire which described a method that teachers can modify to help their students. Freire's \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" challenged educators to include the lives of their students in developing literacy. To discover how teachers adapted Freire's critical pedagogy to their teaching situations, the author presented both Freire's ideas and her own explanation of critical pedagogy to approximately one hundred teachers who took her graduate reading courses over a two-year period (January 2005 to the third summer session in 2006) at Holy Family University. She conducted a survey of the fifty-four students who gave permission to use their responses. In general, the survey results revealed that to deal with problems in students' lives, teachers created lessons or units, used school units or assemblies, employed the help of guidance professionals, or adapted packaged program materials and methods. She discusses two programs used by several elementary teachers she surveyed: (1) Second Step Program; and (2) Responsive Teaching Program. Appended is: (1) Survey Results.",

        "description":"Although some consider the 12-step method of Alcoholics Anonymous to be the treatment of choice for people struggling with substance abuse, differing approaches have been developed within the area of addictions. Motivational interviewing (Miller & Rollnick, 2002), enacted within a stages-of change model (DiClemente & Velasquez, 2002), seeks to explore ambivalence and promote self-efficacy throughout the initial stages of substance abuse treatment rather than confront denial or highlight one's powerlessness over drugs. Theoretical and applied strategies are explored in an attempt to effectively connect these newer models of substance abuse treatment with therapeutic artmaking. A case presentation is offered to illustrate how supporting a client's emergent ambivalent thoughts may strengthen both continued recovery and maintained sobriety. (Contains 9 figures.)",

        "author":["McNamee, Carole M."],
        "description":"Recent advances in neuroscience describe the effect of experience on neural architecture. Paralleling these advances in neuroscience, recent explorations in the field of art therapy speculate on the relationship between specific therapeutic interventions and neuroplasticity, which underlies the changes in neural architecture. One such intervention, bilateral art, purposefully engages both left and right hemispheres of the brain, as well as multiple sensory systems, in responding to client-identified conflicted elements of experience. This paper summarizes experiences using bilateral art over an eighteen-month period with individuals at a university family therapy center. The bilateral art intervention was applied to a range of presenting problems including relationship issues, depression, anxiety, and trauma. Outcome measures include client reported scalings, as well as client-reported and/or therapist observed changes in behavior over time. Additionally, this paper presents indicators for the use of bilateral art an as intervention, as well as contraindications for its use. (Contains 4 tables and 4 figures.)",

This study, based in England, involved five clients, all older people with mental health problems, receiving art therapy sessions at home. The clients and caregivers were then interviewed to ascertain their views. This study indicated that clients and caregivers do feel that art therapy can be of benefit in the home environment. These benefits include an increase in confidence and motivation, with emotional support also being valued. The study concludes that an art therapist can work in the home environment as long as he/she is flexible, organized and assertive.",

Three central features of clay-work are highlighted: (1) procedural expression through touch, movement, and the three-dimensional aspect; (2) the reflection of construction and deconstruction processes; and (3) the regression process. The authors differentiate six therapeutic factors that emerged from a review of the literature: facilitating expression of emotions, catharsis, rich and deep expressions, verbal communication, revealing unconscious material, and concretization and symbolization.

        "author":["Frame, Phyllis G."],
        "description":"This paper illustrates the use of the MARI[R] Card Test, a transpersonal assessment tool which includes archetypal designs and color choices, as well as the drawing of a white and black mandala, or circle picture, for assessing the compatibility of two people in a committed relationship. In an informal pilot research study, 22 couples were given this assessment and interpreted according to seven comparison categories that might affect their relationship and compatibility. Unresolved prenatal and developmental childhood issues, the current primary treatment issue for each person, the dynamics of the couple's communication, areas of conflict or tension, and sexual issues were examined. Areas of commonality between the partners and personal strengths each person brought to the relationship also were identified. These seven categories were then related to the couple's choices on the card test. Two mandala drawings added insights and further information that complemented the interpretation of the test. One couple is presented in this article as a case study to illustrate the assessment technique and to highlight its value in working with couples. The Couple Compatibility Assessment can be helpful at the beginning of couple therapy because it provides nonverbal information that may not be available in a more traditional intake interview. This assessment can also be of use during and at the end of couple therapy as an indication of change in the relationship. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"Anthroposophy has made the spiritual a living experience by producing numerous practical applications, such as veil painting, initially created by Liane Collot d'Herbois (1988). Its theoretical framework has been substantially simplified by the author and crucial meditative and contemplative steps have been added. European and American transpersonal movements are briefly compared in order to introduce the author's Finnish background and other inspirations that led to the development of the meditative vail painting method. The meditative vail paintings created by this author are offered as visual manifestations of her spiritual journey. The meditative vail painting method is described here for those artists and art therapists who are interested in widening the scope of their projections, or their clients/patients' projections, in order to draw imagery from beyond their personal body/ego consciousness.

Although art therapy has been understudied in this context, it shows promise as a means of treating hard-to-treat symptoms of combat-related PTSD, such as avoidance and emotional numbing, while also addressing the underlying psychological situation that gives rise to these symptoms. In this paper, we establish a conceptual foundation for research about art therapy as a treatment for combat-related PTSD by situating art therapy within the context of other PTSD treatments, outlining a theoretical rationale for using art therapy as a treatment for PTSD, and clarifying \"best practices\" for using art therapy as a treatment for combat-related PTSD. We recommend group treatment in three stages and suggest that art therapists who treat combat-related PTSD receive specialized training in trauma intervention and PTSD theory.",

As a follow-up, the authors interviewed educators attending the 2002 Annual Conference of the American Art Therapy Association (AATA) to gain an understanding of their perspectives in three areas: emphasis on teaching qualitative and quantitative approaches, expected research competencies of graduates, and assistance programs needed to teach art therapy research effectively. Results from the study indicate that most participants perceive that qualitative research currently is emphasized more than quantitative research in art therapy education. Educators identified that the research competencies most expected from their graduates are the ability to read critically and to understand published research. Finally, with respect to teaching research effectively, most indicated that ongoing research education would support their teaching efforts. Implications for AATA and the profession are discussed.

To study the need for training in technology, surveys were sent to 177 current art therapy students and practicing art therapists resulting in a 32.2% return rate. The survey targeted American Art Therapy Association (AATA) members who were either current students or practicing art therapists. Credentialed professionals and students were randomly selected from the AATA membership directory. Questions focused on current use of technology (defined as computers and accessories, the internet, and digital-based tools) within art therapy practice, current and past training in technology use, the quality of that training, ideas about training needs, and demographic data. The findings of the questionnaire showed that those who responded had little formal training but in general were using technology in their practices. This points to a need for looking further at what types of training would best meet art therapists' needs and how best to accomplish this. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Case studies and therapeutic interventions which utilize computer art therapy are provided to illustrate how to incorporate these methods into the art therapy setting. By comparing the unique tools of various visual graphics and virtual sculpture programs to those of more traditional methods of art making, the author concludes that computer art making has become an integral part of the process of making art and is a valid medium for individual self-expression and art therapy.

From an in-depth review of the data, the authors identify seven prominent themes: (a) stressful living conditions in camp, (b) art and creativity for camp survival, (c) loss and deprivation, (d) separation or division of family and community ties, (e) disruption of identity, (f) resilience and reaffirmation of values, and (g) the need for legacy and social justice. The study found that participants' internalized shame from being labeled &quot;enemy aliens&quot; has evolved into an externalized concern for discriminatory actions against minority groups that are marginalized by war.

Postmodernism is defined by art that breaks or blurs the boundaries between product and process, individual and group creation, and artist and viewer. A discussion of contemporary artists who use a postmodern framework, including Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer, Nakahashi Katsushige and others, is provided as an example for how postmodernism may be applied to art therapy. A postmodernist perspective informs a multifaceted therapeutic approach which negotiates the border between individual integrity and community values, blurs the distinction between home and studio, and validates all forms of image-creation with the overall purpose of healing and social empowerment.

        "description":"Art therapists have long held that art production causes reductions in stress and elevations in mood (Rubin, 1999). The authors examined this claim in a randomized, controlled trial. Fifty adults between the ages of 18 and 30 were randomly assigned to either create an art work or to view and sort a series of art prints. Three measures of overall negative mood and of anxiety were collected before and after each intervention. Two-way ANOVAs (Group by Time) demonstrated significantly greater reductions in negative mood and anxiety in the art production group compared with the art viewing control group on all three measures (all p-values less than 0.005). These results demonstrate that the simple act of creating a work of art can produce dramatic reductions in negative mood and that these reductions can be attributed specifically to the production of art rather than to its viewing. A list of 60 art prints used in group view test is appended. (Contains 1 table.)",

Through the children's own voices and stories about their artwork, themes of danger, lack of protection, and vulnerability were elucidated. The study proposes that the Bird's Nest Drawing (BND) (Francis, Kaiser, & Deaver, 2003; Kaiser, 1996), and a Bird's Nest Sculpture (BNS) are valuable art therapy tools for understanding attachment schemas of children and their perceptions of their parental attachment-relationships.

A brief outline of principles that underlie the processes of existential art therapy and dream analysis is provided. These principles guide the development of relationships between art therapists and clients, and with visual artworks depicting dream images.

The first section sets out the dilemmas in this type of European comparative transition research and provides an overview of research to date. Welfare state and youth research are then used to combine the factors determining the transition experience into a model. The author outlines the conditions under which this model could deliver results that could provide guidance for changes in pedagogical practice. These considerations are illustrated using the example of the results from the Leonardo project &quot;Re-Integration.

For about 20 years now, they have been one of the most important measures to combat unemployment and exclusion from the labour market. But is training a successful and efficient policy to reduce unemployment, compared to other types of ALMP? We draw some conclusions based on a review of evaluation results. We then make recommendations for designing as well as evaluating training. We underline the need for ALMP evaluations to develop an insight into &quot;why&quot; training works (or not). Finally, we advocate a new approach to ALMP and training programme evaluation: a systemic evaluation of the effectiveness of a programme through its relation, interaction and complementarity with other programmes, institutions and main stakeholders in vocational education and training, employment and production.

It is therefore justifiable to ask whether public policy should either endorse the spontaneous distribution of training or take measures to correct it. This paper analyses the motivations and limitations of public intervention, focusing on the Italian case in which, in recent years, the system has changed radically as a result of opportunities offered to social partners to directly administer the financial resources available for continuous training. The paper argues that the policy instruments in Italy are not capable of providing a clear response to the need for the two forms of continuous training--collective and individual. Therefore, the paper proposes that a part of the funds be administered by the social partners specifically to promote collective training, leaving the public administration with the task of responding primarily to the demands expressed by individuals.

The national programme for developing pre-school, school education and training (2006-15), adopted in 2006 due to major public interest in this issue, aims to reform initial vocational training. This article presents the main pillars of this reform based on European strategic guidelines.

        "description":"The Romanian system of initial vocational education and training is examined from three different points of view: its relevance to the labour market; its relationship with other parts of the national education system; and its evolution from the past to the future. While there are some major current mismatches between the school system and the labour market, the longer-term perspective seems reasonable as there is a surplus of highly qualified graduates which may prove useful if skill requirements increase. Much has been done recently, with some success, to maintain a progressive vocational route, though the relationship between higher vocational studies inside and outside the university sector is not entirely clear. Romania's IVET system is largely school-based, familiar to some European VET traditions. Romania is participating in EU initiatives, where these can be used to promote modernisation nationally.

The main features of Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development are described as a basis for this before empirical results enable the author to make statements on the status of the moral competence to make judgments among business trainees. When fostering the moral competence to make judgments, attention should be paid in particular to certain development conditions: skillful appraisal, perceived conflicts, opportunities for communication, experience of cooperation, responsibility and opportunities to act. Information on a beneficial structuring of conditions in vocational colleges can be derived Fthe available empirical results on moral atmosphere in private and professional fields of action; this information is beneficial to the development of value orientation and the ability to reflect on moral matters.

        "description":"Increasing people's ability to solve complex problems is more and more often being seen as an integral part of vocational education. While there have been numerous empirically-based approaches to the didactic structuring of teaching and learning arrangements by which students' ability to solve problems can be increased, knowledge of how to evaluate a person's ability to solve problems is far more limited. There is a lack of testing instruments that are inexpensive to implement and evaluate and take account of the features of ill-defined problems as they occur in professional practice. This article describes, with reference to a pilot study, the further development of a method of measuring a person's ability to solve problems (AIT according to Sembill) which is reliable but too expensive to evaluate in practice. The new MAPS instrument (Measurement and Assessment of Problem Solving) is more structured in terms of both performance and evaluation. The results of the pilot study indicate a high level of reliability and validity of the new instrument, these results having to be confirmed in a follow-up study, the design of which is also presented in this article.

There has been growing interest among teaching researchers in exploring the influence of goals within the academic field. Much of the early work in this area of motivational research has been done with children, rather than with college students. Only recently have the theories been extended to college classrooms. Goal setting can dramatically influence students' self-regulated learning (Pintrich, 1995) and motivation (Ames, 1992). In this study, the author explores whether goal setting can serve as an effective motivational tool in enhancing their self-regulated learning process.",

Using the 2001 results of Kentucky's accountability tests (e.g., CTBS-5, KCCT), Chi-square analyses were performed to determine whether, when disaggregated by quartile (CTBS-5) or proficiency-level (KCCT), a significant difference existed for each school between the distributions of disadvantaged and minority students and those of their respective peers. Chi-square analyses were additionally performed to determine whether statistically significant relationships existed between exogenous school characteristics (e.g., school size, school poverty level) and the equity of student achievement. Results of the study indicated that a majority of elementary, middle, and high schools displayed inequitable student outcomes between disadvantaged and minority students and their respective peers on both assessments. Moreover, school size was shown to relate significantly to the equity of student assessment results at the elementary and high school levels.",

Several factors account for the decline of women in superintendency. Perhaps the most important reason there are so few women in the superintendency is that women enter the teaching profession to teach children. Based on the literature, a questionnaire was prepared and sent to all female superintendents in the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. Results reveal that female superintendents did not seem to indicate discrimination by their male board members or in the type or size of school district they would consider for superintendent positions. It is also found that some of the barriers to the superintendency for women include: lack of encouragement, lack of professional network, limited access to formal and informal training, exclusion from the &quot;Good Old Boy Network,&quot; and lack of influential sponsors.",

Overall, the results indicate that students are driven by their future plans, external influences, and their own personality. Thoughts to quit the program sometimes occurred, but students in our sample did not dwell on them. Additionally, they expressed few regrets regarding their decisions, despite the costs paid, the sacrifices made, the health endured, and the social experiences missed.

An experiment to address the problem of poor achievement in mathematics in Nigerian high schools was carried out in Edo State of Nigeria. Eighteen simple improvised geometric manipulatives were made from ordinary cardboard paper. The manipulatives were used in teaching students in experimental group. There was a control group of students which did not study with manipulatives. Scores were collected from mathematics test taken by students in both experimental and control groups.

Students (N = 309) enrolled in advanced undergraduate and graduate university courses were administered the Student Worry Scale. A factor analysis revealed three factors of student worries: worries about living conditions, esteem-related worries, and world-related worries. Worries varied somewhat by developmental level. Younger students were more worried about living conditions and how they were regarded, while older students were more worried about the state of the world. (Contains 1 table.)",

Data were collected through official documents, personal documents, and interviews. Influences by family members contributed significantly to the theme of human relations that arose from these data. The research participants reported that parents and grandparents, siblings, spouses, and children played active roles in learners' decisions first to enroll in the adult literacy programs and then to stay in them through to goal attainment. This original research report recounts these influences as grounds for recommending the consideration of family members in making programming decisions for adult literacy students.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between organizational health and the bullying that teachers experience in primary schools in Turkey. Two measurement instruments were used in this research. The Organizational Health Inventory (OHI-S), Hoy and Miskel, (1991) was used to measure organizational health. The Negative Acts Questionnaire (NAQ), developed by Einarsen and Raknes (1997) was used to measure bullying, the other variable of the research. The NAQ was adapted to Turkish for linguistic and cultural reasons. The OHI-S and NAQ were administrated to the 337 teachers making up the sampling of the research. In this study, Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for all variables. Later, by using the 7 sub-scales of the OHI-S as the independent variables and school bullying as the dependent variable, a multiple regression analysis was done. At the end of the research, it was found that from among the organizational health subdimensions, Initiating Structure (IS) 4.70 was more frequently realized, The Academic Emphasis (AE) 10.18 subdimension was less frequently realized and 50% of the teachers were exposed to bullying. Hence, there was a negative relationship between organizational health and teachers' exposure to bullying, and organizational health was an indicator of bullying experience. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "title":"Predictive Validity of Grade Point Averages and of the Miller Analogies Test for Admission to a Doctoral Program in Educational Leadership",
        "author":["Young, I. Phillip"],
        "description":"This manuscript evaluates the predictive validity of several predictors used to delimit an initial applicant pool of doctoral candidates at the department/program level. Particular predictors addressed in this manuscript are measures of past academic performance and of future academic potential. Past academic performance is assessed by grade point averages, while future academic potential is assessed by scores from the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) (Miller Analogies Test, 2004). With respect to future academic potential of perspective doctoral candidates, most doctoral programs require applicants to submit results from a standardized examination. In practice, these results are obtained through scores either on the GRE or on the MAT. Of these two measures for potential academic performance of perspective doctoral candidates in the area of educational leadership, research, to date, has focused only on the GRE. Yet to be addressed in this emerging research stream is comparable information about the MAT, and the focus of this manuscript is to partially fill this void in current knowledge. This manuscript does so in several specific ways. First, a compensatory model of decision making is used to assess the predictive validity of past academic performance and of future academic potential for admission to a particular doctoral program in educational leadership. The compensatory model assumes that high scores on one predictor can offset low scores on another predictor and is in contrast to a multiple hurdles model advocating a specific cut score on each predictor in isolation. As such, the compensatory model considers the unique contribution of each academic predictor in light of all academic predictors in combination through a linear equation taking into consideration the inter-correlation among predictor variables used to delimit an initial applicant pool. Second, to assess the predictive validity of past academic performance and of future academic potential for perspective doctoral applicants, field data are collected over a ten year period. Within this time-frame, actual applicants seeking admission to a doctoral program are classified according to their outcome status. That is, perspective doctoral candidates are classified as rejected, as accepted but not graduating, or as graduating. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This study examined smoking intensity among secondary school adolescent smokers. A total of 800 students, made up of 685 males and 115 females who have at least tasted a cigarette once, from twenty secondary schools (5 private and 15 public secondary schools) in Benin City, Nigeria participated in the study. A questionnaire was used in collecting data that were analyzed in this study. The questionnaire consisted of 7 sections: the demographic variables, Smoking stages, delinquency, alcohol use, school connectedness, family connectedness and peer smoking status. Two out of the three hypotheses tested were supported. Result of the multiple regression analysis indicated that delinquency and parents' smoking status independently predict smoking initiation, while depression was not found to initiate smoking among adolescents. Adolescents' whose parents smoke and had a strong family connectedness were found to smoke more during the addictive stage than those whose parents do not smoke. Female smokers were found to smoke more at initiation stage as a result of peer pressure and school connectedness. Males were found not to have greater smoking intensity as a result of peer pressure and school connectedness. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that the future of a successful treatment program by therapists for smokers lies heavily on knowing and identifying the stage of smoking the individual is, and how intense the individual's smoking level. This no doubt would help the therapists in tailoring specific treatment for specific individuals. (Contains 3 tables.)",

They were bored with books about &quot;frogs on logs,&quot; says then-new principal Cheryl Champion.    Since they were not engaged, they acted out. Harding's classroom life--and its test scores--had to improve. So Champion and her teachers began to look for ways to turn their school around. They had two ambitious aims: to improve literacy and school culture. Those are huge challenges on their own--how could Harding tackle both? Then the light bulb went off. In 2001, Harding teachers began a unique journey, combining lessons on reading with character education. With the help of a grant, they were able to find a reading program that matched these goals. Every class focused on the same themes--friendship, democracy, and individual perspective--using multicultural books, activities, and community service projects. Students who would have never left their hometown raised money for victims of Hurricane Katrina and wrote letters to soldiers overseas, and that was just the beginning. The result? Reading scores have climbed, moving the school from a state warning list to above average. On writing tests, Harding is the second-ranked elementary school in the district. Discipline referrals have been slashed. Thus, what can all people learn from a school that has made such a dramatic turnaround? In this article, the author presents some of the lessons Harding teachers have learned firsthand.",

Too many young girls are not getting the help they need. That's why teachers are so important. When it comes to learning disabilities, teachers are right there on the front line. They're often the first to spot a child's difficulties and to bring it to the attention of parents and specialists. It's important that they know the different ways ADHD may manifest in their girl students and the reasons they may miss it. Alarmingly, some studies estimate that as many as 50% to 75% of girls with ADHD are missed. Worse, girls with ADHD are diagnosed on average five years later than boys--boys at age 7, girls at age 12.

        "description":"Rafe Esquith has taught for 23 years at Hobart Boulevard Elementary School in Los Angeles. In a neighborhood plagued by gangs, guns, and drugs, his is a special classroom known as Room 56. Within its walls, children living in poverty play Vivaldi concertos, perform unabridged plays by Shakespeare, and go on to attend top universities. In 2003, President Bush presented Esquith with the National Medal of Arts. He is the only teacher ever to receive this honor (but hopefully not the last). In addition, Esquith is the author of &quot;There Are No Shortcuts&quot;. In his new book, &quot;Teach Like Your Hair's On Fire: The Methods and Madness Inside Room 56&quot; (Viking Penguin, 2007), Esquith reveals many of the techniques that have made him one of the most acclaimed educators of their time. But while his honors and books have pushed him into the public realm, Esquith's heart remains in the classroom. He still teaches every day in Room 56. In fact, his is one of the few education books written by &quot;an actual classroom teacher,&quot; as is stated on the cover. This paper presents a preview of what Esquith has to say about avoiding fear, building classroom trust, and what it means to teach with your hair on fire.",

Proponents of ramping up standards in early elementary education tend to focus on the numbers: more children learning to read or do math sooner must be good. These achievements, however, may come at the expense of other skills children need to learn, such as self-reliance, problem-solving, and spatial thinking. According to Anne Stoudt, a kindergarten teacher, the risk is children who are already burned out on school by the time they reach third grade. Play is how children learn, so, there should be more of it in the upper grades, not less in the lower.",

All that self-confidence, however, has not produced more capable students. The Brookings Institution 2006 Brown Center Report on Education finds that countries in which families and schools emphasize self-esteem for students--America for example--lag behind the cultures that do not focus on how students feel about themselves. A growing contingent of experts agree that in the classroom, self-esteem should be an outcome, not a method. \"Self-esteem,\" says Robert Brooks, Harvard Medical School faculty psychologist, \"is based on real accomplishments.\" It is all about letting kids shine in a realistic way. There is a correlation between self-esteem and grades; studies have shown that high grades do lead to high self-esteem. But rather than praising children for every effort along the way, they should be encouraged to focus on achieving particular goals and applaud that achievement. The danger of too much praise is that children may turn their focus to how good they feel and how to get more praise, rather than on what they are learning. Teachers should make sure that their primary focus is on student performance and improvement, rather than how the students feel about themselves. They must emphasize effort and specific character traits, such as persistence, helpfulness, and consideration. Students need to see that achievement is related to the effort they exert.",

Educators pay so much attention to decoding and fluency in the early years that children sometimes come to believe that flawless and rapid word recognition is the point. As texts get more demanding or unfamiliar, some of the \"good readers\" in classes begin to struggle, because they are not sufficiently engaged in constructing meaning. Lack of both engagement and intentional effort is a deadly combination, which makes it impossible for many students to be independent during reading. Thankfully, teaching comprehension is one of the most rewarding aspects of working with students in the intermediate grades. These students are capable of wonderful insights, terrific humor, and deep grief. They are also hungry for interesting information. Educators can help them get the most out of their reading by teaching them how to comprehend--how to manage a poem versus a novel or a textbook, for example. In this article, the author answers teachers' toughest questions about how to approach comprehension with their students.",

        "description":"Across the country, environmental education schools and the growing movement to get children outdoors are challenging the current &quot;indoor generation&quot; of kids. Martin LeBlanc, Sierra Club national youth education director, says the interest has never been greater. People have never been more aware of the fact that children are not getting involved with the outdoors. Even as No Child Left Behind decreases the time allotted for environmental education and field trips, research shows that children who spend time outdoors are healthier, happier, and smarter. With the global warming crisis looming, children who spend time outdoors may also be the ones who help save the planet. This article describes how schools are teaching their students to love and protect the environment outside their classrooms. It also discusses the benefits of using the outdoors as a classroom.",

While scientists are working to better understand how the Earth's climate will change over time, some effects are already evident: rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers and polar ice caps, changes in the distribution of plants and animals, increases in intense weather, and thawing of permafrost. As global warming is caused by an overabundance of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere, scientists suggest that it can be slowed by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and recapturing carbon dioxide (CO[subscript 2]) from the atmosphere. For average citizens, this means reducing the amount of energy they use in their daily lives. Kids--and teachers--can be instrumental in making a difference and changing the planet's future. This article presents some activities and resources that can help protect the planet. (Contains 9 online resources.)",

        "description":"The latest government data, analyzed recently by Howard Witt in an article in the \"Chicago Tribune,\" shows that black students are getting a raw deal in American schools when it comes to discipline. In the average New Jersey public school, reports Witt, African-American students are almost 60 times as likely as white students to be expelled. Nationally, they are three times more likely than non-black students to be suspended or expelled for the same offenses. The problem has gotten worse, not better: In 1972, black students were suspended at just twice the rate of other students. Today's numbers cannot be explained away by differences in class or income, since even middle-class and wealthy black students are being punished more often--and more severely--than their non-black peers. Problems of inequity based on race are not confined to discipline. Black students are far more likely than other students to be taught by inexperienced teachers, score lower on standardized tests, be referred for special education services, and fail to graduate. It is a difficult subject to confront. As the national population of students of color nears 40% while 80% of teachers are white, it is an issue schools need to take on. In this article, the author discusses how to address the low academic achievement and discipline problems of black students and improve the racial climate in schools.",

Some quickly reject the idea; they like what they do and don't want to be too far removed from the children. Some teachers decide not to enter administration because they don't want what they perceive as the additional stress or responsibility that comes with it. Instead, they may seek teacher leader positions that allow them to participate in decision-making within their school or district. Teachers may become department chairs, head up special projects, or serve on committees. When teachers do decide to explore the possibility of moving from the classroom to the school office, they may enroll in courses leading to an administrative certificate or degree, depending on state requirements. Every career has its positives and negatives. Like teaching, school administration is not for everybody, and simply succeeding at coursework doesn't mean the job is right. Not everyone who graduates with a teaching degree belongs in the classroom, and not everyone with an administrative certificate belongs at the helm of a school.

Students caught sneaking comics between the pages of bulky--and less engaging--textbooks were likely sent to the principal. Today, however, comics, including classics such as \"Superman\" but also their generally more complex, nuanced cousins, graphic novels, are not only regarded as educational tools by savvy teachers, they are also taken seriously as literature and an art form in their own right. Comic books can be a great way to pique reluctant readers' interest and challenge those students who are fluent in more traditional literature. Kids are at ease with combining visual and text information, and as new media becomes mainstream, comic books offer a way to reinforce traditional grammar and spelling within a layout that is familiar to kids. Teachers may have to challenge some assumptions before they use comics in the classroom, and make sure that they read every book before they use it in class. Just because a book is a comic does not mean that it is appropriate for young students. If teachers think it will be at all controversial with their class, they must consider using an excerpt, selecting a different book, or sending a note home to parents ahead of time. Some memorable end-of-year comic book activities that will engage reluctant readers or challenge high achievers over the summer break are provided.",

Teachers are expected to ease the transition of students from elementary to middle school. However, if you are an elementary teacher, you may not know what kids will be facing in middle school; and if you are a middle school teacher, you are not always aware of what skills incoming students have already mastered (or not, as the case may be). Currently, fewer than half the states require specialized preparation before teaching middle schoolers. The National Middle School Association (NMSA) believes professional preparation programs must teach teachers about the development and needs of young adolescents; address middle-level philosophy, organization, curriculum planning, and assessment; and require middle-level field experiences.

In a perfect world, every student would be academically prepared for the next grade, and there would be no need to choose between holding students back and passing them on unprepared. Of course, getting every single student caught up is easier said than done. A good start, though, is to provide interventions before a student falls hopelessly behind. Some measures, such as summer school and small class sizes, will have to be decided at the district or school level. A teacher, however, may be able to get a student started with other forms of help, such as before- or after-school tutoring, from the very beginning of the year.

        "author":["Gardner, Dee"],
        "description":"Fourteen collections of children's reading materials were used to investigate the claim that collections of authentic texts with a common theme, or written by one author, afford readers with more repeated exposures to new words than unrelated materials. The collections, distinguished by relative thematic tightness, authorship (1 vs. 4 authors), and register (narrative vs. expository), were analyzed to determine how often, and under what conditions, specialized vocabulary recycles within the materials. Findings indicated that thematic relationships impacted specialized vocabulary recycling within expository collections (primarily content words), whereas authorship impacted recycling within narrative collections (primarily names of characters, places, etc.). Theme-based expository collections also contained much higher percentages of theme-related words than their theme-based narrative counterparts. The findings were used to give nuance to the vocabulary-recycling claims of narrow reading and to more general theories and practices involving wide and extensive reading.

        "author":["Wright, Jan"],
        "description":"In March 2004, Stephen Ball and others presented a symposium at the conference of the British Educational Research Association (BERA) on the necessity of theory in educational research. Like Ball, I have observed that theory, not just social theory, is a difficult space and one that divides researchers (those comfortable with theory and those less so), within educational research. It is an aspect of educational research training that rarely receives the attention essential for &quot;quality&quot; educational research. In the context of the contemporary research assessment exercises, it is worth reflecting on the relationship between research informed by social theory and expectations of quality and impact. In this paper I revisit the argument made by Ball and others for the necessity of theory, and discuss its role in framing research questions, informing analysis, and promoting reflexivity on the significance and relevance of research. I illustrate this process by discussing the ways theory can assist in the generation of research agendas and questions. I conclude the paper with an example of how a team of educational researchers from Australia, UK and New Zealand have made use of social theory to inform an Australian Research Council (ARC) funded project investigating the recontextualisation of health knowledge in schools.

        "description":"Cosmopolitanism is a worthy educational goal, perhaps more important now than ever before. Its possibilities, however, cannot be adequately realised unless people develop a different way of thinking about issues of global interconnectivity and develop in students a set of epistemic virtues with which they can critically explore the ways in which global flows are now shaping, and will continue to re-shape, both their identities and their communities--their life styles as well as their life chances. In a sense, the students born in the twenty-first century in many parts of the world will inevitably experience \"actual existing cosmopolitanism\" based on a consumer culture and unreflexive acceptance of the dictates of the global economy. This cosmopolitanism is unlikely to serve them well. In this article, the author argues that what is needed is a different kind of cosmopolitan learning with which to challenge the hegemonic understanding of globality and forge a different social imaginary of globalization, based on a somewhat optimistic conviction about the creative possibilities of continuous self-examination and transformation. This will require not only relational and reflexive understanding, but also a different ethic towards intercultural relations that denies that cultures are fixed and essentially distinct, and insists that the relation between self and others can only be understood dialectically, and hopefully in ways that are cooperative.",

        "description":"A survey of university business professors focused on their use of individual assignments in courses and their views on cheating and its impact on student learning. Based on responses from 456 professors (37% response rate) from Ontario, Canada, it was concluded that most faculty believe that individual assignments are effective learning tools and that cheating on these assignments is a serious offence. They believe that cheating occurs widely, but continue to use these assessments, with some alterations, to ensure that students obtain learning benefits. The survey findings varied across disciplines and tenure status. A framework is proposed to explain the faculty perspective and the outcomes that professors experience. The adjustments they make to individual assignments are influenced by multiple factors that are internal (university policies and regulations) and external (internet usage) to the university. The discussion centres on the three stakeholders--faculty, students and administration--the need for culture change, and the role of honor codes in controlling cheating and supporting a learning environment.

        "description":"Worldwide, teachers' work continues to be the subject of discussion and debate, especially in terms of teacher competence and its appropriate appraisal. Available literature offers a number of perspectives of beginning teacher competence, yet the voices of beginning teachers themselves are not represented. This paper outlines the findings of a phenomenographic study that sought to uncover the conceptions of competence held by beginning teachers. The results of this study suggest that beginning teachers believe that teaching competence requires demonstration of thorough preparation, a sound knowledge base, effective classroom management, professional communication with a range of stakeholders, and an accurate sense of self-awareness in the role of teacher. These conceptions will be compared to a selection of the available literature about teacher competence and associated teaching standards. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

The solution, student engagement, is a contested concept, theorised in a variety of different ways within academic literature. To further understand this concept, a phenomenographic study was conducted to map secondary school teachers' conceptions of student engagement. Six qualitatively different ways of understanding student engagement were found. This research indicates that teachers do not hold similar understandings of what student engagement means. If the concept of engagement is to become educationally fruitful, the term must be more explicitly defined in educational research and government policy documents to promote shared understandings amongst stakeholder groups.",

This paper describes research conducted with 1050 students aged 12-15, in three North Queensland urban high schools to investigate issues related to Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at risk of dropping out of school before gaining adequate qualifications. A path-analytic model was developed to assess the influence of socio-demographic, structural family and behavioural factors upon low academic achievement, the strongest predictor of dropping out of school. The specific hypothesis tested was that challenging behaviour, indexed by suspensions, predicts low academic achievement or at-risk status, more strongly than SES or family structure variables. Results indicate that for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, suspensions are a stronger predictor of low achievement than socioeconomic or family factors. Moreover, a model testing low achievement as a precursor to suspensions was not supported. Suggestions for future practice and research are proposed. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

This study compared 725 Hong Kong and 575 Shanghai primary in-service teachers on their teacher efficacy. Two Chinese versions of the 12-item Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale were used in this study since some wordings of the Hong Kong version of the Scale (HK-TSE) were different from the Shanghai version (S-TSE) as a result of cultural differences. Basically, the Shanghai teachers reported significantly higher efficacy than did the Hong Kong teachers. After reviewing these quantitative results, 86 follow-up questionnaires from Shanghai in-service teachers who also participated in the first part of this study were collected. Results of this qualitative part showed that the three most commonly cited factors for the contribution of teacher efficacy were: respect and confidence placed in them by students and parents, the training they received from universities and the experience they gained from daily teaching practice. Though Hong Kong in-service teachers had lower efficacy scores than the Shanghai counterparts. (Contains 2 figures and 9 tables.)",

        "description":"In a series of investigations, the author and his colleagues have examined ways that students who once did poorly in school made progress and how their teachers nurtured their accomplishments. They have chronicled ways that successful teachers learned to understand why students are reluctant to do their work, how to help them think through their choices, and how to create classroom learning communities. These practices create \"academic momentum.\" In the physical sciences, momentum is \"a strength or force that keeps growing\". Athletes and coaches talk of momentum in sports. Advertisers try to create momentum for new products. Politicians try to strengthen momentum for candidates and ideas. In a school setting, momentum is the strength of a student's engagement with learning activities. Students with strong academic momentum approach new assignments with confidence. Based on previous experiences with similar tasks, they know they are likely to do well. If a task proves to be difficult, they know they have a repertoire of skills and strategies they can employ. Students with little academic momentum show little confidence and doubt their ability to do well. In some cases, they have internalized a sense of inadequacy that makes it very difficult to invest effort on assignments. To observers, they may appear \"unmotivated,\" \"turned off,\" or \"disconnected.\" In their studies, successful teachers have encouraged momentum with reluctant students in similar ways. This article describes these central dynamics and presents a case study to illustrate how one middle school team put research into practice. These insights suggest ways for other teachers and administrators to enhance their efforts to engage reluctant students more productively. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Although teen pregnancy and birth rates in the United States declined for ten straight years during the 1990s and were less than half of comparative figures from 1957, the year of the all-time high of teen pregnancy, nearly one in ten teenage young women still became pregnant in 2001, with half of these young women giving birth. Teen pregnancy statistics are particularly high for minority youth in poor and working class urban areas. Twenty-five percent of teen births occur to African-American teens, and twenty-eight percent occur to Latina teens, despite the fact that African Americans and Latinas each account for only fifteen percent of the total teenage population. While the largest overall percentage of births occurs to Caucasian young women, race and class further complicate the study of pregnant and parenting teens. Indeed, unlike White middle-class women who become teen mothers, Black pregnant and parenting teens are far more likely to face disapproval by the general public and experience poverty in their lives and the lives of their children. Young Black women who reside in geographic pockets of poverty in urban areas also have higher than average pregnancy rates. The perennial problems faced by young Black women who are either pregnant or parenting and who have been disadvantaged in public schools is a troubling phenomenon that merits further attention. This article will provide an overview of societal and school obstacles that African-American pregnant and parenting teens face, and discuss one particular school's innovative response to these teens. By examining how the Rosa Parks Academy and its teachers are employing culturally responsive pedagogy in their work with their students, it is hoped that educators in urban schools elsewhere can begin to consider new and alternative ways of thinking about the education of African-American pregnant and parenting teens, a segment of the overall student population that is currently underserved and disadvantaged in public schools in the U.S. (Contains 1 table and 3 notes.)",

Much of the literature around resistance tends to focus on strategies that multicultural educators can employ in overcoming preservice teacher resistance. However, preservice teacher resistance is not the only kind of resistance to multicultural education. Less well documented is the resistance to multicultural education from fellow educators who sometimes exhibit the same kinds of resistance as preservice teachers. While there is little literature concerning teacher/faculty resistance to multicultural education, even more sparse is any literature concerned with \"the effects\" of such resistance on multicultural educators. The small body of literature in this area, more often than not, has focused on multicultural educators of color and the resistance they face in teaching such topics and the strategies they used to counter such resistance. Rarely has there been any discussion on how multicultural educators cope and sustain themselves in the face of continual resistance. In fact, there is virtually no literature on \"how\" multicultural educators address these effects and the \"strategies\" they employ to sustain themselves on a daily basis. The purpose of this article is to address this void in the field by providing a theoretical framework of the ways in which multicultural educators might address such resistance so as to preserve themselves and keep from suffering some of the negative effects of continual resistance, such as despair, hopelessness, and burnout.",

        "author":["Madrid, E. Michael"],
        "description":"In 1931, the Southern California community of Lemon Grove served as the unlikely stage for a dramatic and significant civil rights court case. A group of Mexican and Mexican-American parents and their children won a major victory in the battle against school segregation and the notion of separate but equal facilities. The case, now commonly referred to as the Lemon Grove Incident, was the nation's first recognized court-ordered school desegregation case. The Lemon Grove parents' efforts and legal struggles involved more than 70 children of Mexican descent who were summarily directed by their school principal to attend a hastily constructed, two-room segregated school, the &quot;caballeriza,&quot; the barn, which was situated in the &quot;Mexican side of town.&quot; The Lemon Grove case is not well known and one could surmise that its most distinguishing characteristic is its obscurity. Similar to the post World War II landmark &quot;Mendez v. Westminster&quot; case, the Lemon Grove matter could be deemed an item of &quot;neglected&quot; history not only because of the public's ignorance of it, but also because of its absence from the public school curriculum. As with &quot;Lemon Grove&quot; and &quot;Mendez,&quot; many important historical events pertaining to the Mexican-American experience are not taught in the public schools. Moreover, the Lemon Grove case, albeit an item of unheralded history that has yet to be incorporated into the school curriculum, is a momentous and symbolic historical civil rights event that is one of countless and unique historical, political, and sociological elements that  constitute the Mexican-American experience.",

        "description":"Soon, the best athletes in the world will face each other at the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Many of them will sustain injuries, or seek to prevent them, and will be thankful that among their entourages are some of the best sports medicine professionals in the world. When an athlete collapses from fatigue, or something else, there will be a group taking him or her off the field; that group may include a doctor, an orthopedist, or a nurse. Backstage, the athletes will be relying heavily on physiologists, physical therapists, athletic trainers and nutritionists to keep them in top form. But what is sports medicine? Sports medicine specializes in diagnosing, treating, and preventing injuries that are sports or exercise related. The term \"sports medicine\" was first coined in 1928 at the Olympics in St. Moritz, when a committee came together to plan the First Congress of Sports Medicine. Specialization includes medical physician, physiology, physical therapy, orthopedics, sports nutrition, and biomechanics. Since injuries can be caused by a number of factors, sports medicine can include various specialties, including cardiology, ophthalmology, surgery, pulmonology, traumatology, or rehabilitative medicine. This article discusses high school and postsecondary programs, as well as employment prospects, for those interested in pursuing a career in sports medicine.",

        "description":"The seventh recommendation in ACTE's postsecondary reform position statement is to pilot innovative approaches to funding. Public postsecondary providers are expected to fulfill a number of educational missions linked to separate funding streams, such as academic coursework, workforce education and training, distance education and research. These diverse missions host a variety of outcome expectations that can challenge those involved in directing the institution. Thoughtful consideration of how postsecondary finance policy can be improved across programs is necessary. As education and policy leaders around the country examine demographic trends, learn more about the &quot;skills gap&quot; and strive to prepare students for the 21st century economy, postsecondary funding strategies are being examined as a tool for helping more students earn critical postsecondary credentials. These innovative funding approaches include: (1) efforts to cover noncredit courses in full-time equivalent (FTE) reimbursement to reduce the burden on institutions and students; (2) integration of categorical funding to enhance institutional ability to effectively deliver career-related credentials and meet diverse educational missions; (3) providing incentive funding based on course or program completion instead of enrollment; and (4) creating performance expectations for students moving along the P-16 continuum. Postsecondary funding pilot programs in Washington and Texas are described.",

Results: More sexually experienced youth believed that many of their friends were already sexually active, and reported talking with their parents about STD prevention than sexually inexperienced youth. However, more sexually inexperienced youth reported cautious premarital attitudes than did experienced youth. Conclusion: Attitudes and beliefs regarding adolescent sexual activity differ based on sexual experience status. Implications for health promotion practice are being discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

While attending health education centers located in Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, early adolescents (n = 737) responded to a questionnaire measuring stressors, coping, and self-harm. Approximately 19% of early adolescent students reported some type of self-harm. Those reporting parents as a source of stress more frequently reported self-harm, compared to those who did not report parents as a source of stress. The results of this study further evidence the problem of self-harm during adolescence. Due to the prevalence of self-reported self-harm and the long lasting consequences of self-harm, prevention or early intervention is crucial to the well-being of some youth. Self-harm, especially self-harm that includes the use of objects, and self-harm's association with parent-focused stress deserve further research. Suggestions are given for prevention/intervention programs among early adolescents. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Social capital, a reflection of the cohesiveness of social networks, is considered a significant determinant of health outcomes. Among social beings, lack of quality social connections correlates with poor health consequences. Membership in social networks and social bonds enhance individual's self-worth and self-esteem, and improve access to information, resources and support critical to well being. Moreover, communities with higher levels of social capital demonstrate higher levels of trust, reciprocity, caring association and a social environment that is conducive to health. Recent technological advances such as the Internet have largely replaced the need for face-to-face interactions. The increasingly fast pace of our society has undermined social relationships and thus is accountable for declining levels of social capital. As collaboration gives way to competition, autonomy, and self-sufficiency, individuals are becoming increasingly isolated with suffering health outcomes. It is essential for health educators to bolster levels of social capital through interventions that address declining social connectivity, by promoting healthy relationships and a greater sense of community. The purpose of this article is to discuss declining social capital and health outcomes in light of increasing automation in the United States and make suggestions for health education interventions.",

Within the three broad intervention areas of inappropriate behavior, academic learning problems, and interpersonal relationships, we provide a brief overview of a number of empirically validated practices. We argue that teaching students with emotional or behavioral disorders demands unique interventions that are beyond that typically available or necessary in general education. We conclude that special education \"is\" special for students with emotional or behavioral disorders and that it can be even more special with greater efforts at implementing research-based practices early, with integrity, and sustaining these interventions over the course of students' school careers.",

Those decisions include screening to identify, evaluating prereferral interventions, determining eligibility for and placement in remedial and special education programs, formatively evaluating instruction, and evaluating reintegration and inclusion of students in mainstream programs. Beyond those fundamental uses of CBM, recent research has been conducted on using CBM to predict success in high-stakes assessment, to measure growth in content areas in secondary school programs, and to assess growth in early childhood programs. In this article, best practices in CBM are described and empirical support for those practices is identified.

        "description":"Over the last decade, the field of early intervention/early childhood special education (EI/ECSE) has emerged as a primary service for infants and preschool children with disabilities and their families. Systems for providing early intervention for infants and toddlers exist in every state, and all state Departments of Education are responsible for special education for preschool children. In EI/ECSE, a unified theory of practice has emerged and draws from a range of psychological and educational theories. A strong, evidence-based set of practices that service providers and caregivers use to promote the development and well-being of infants and young children with disabilities and their families underlies this theory of practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the tenets of this theory and identify evidence-based practices associated with each.",

In this article, the author reviews research studies and research reviews that address this question. She argues that research evidence on the relative efficacy of one special education placement over another is scarce, methodologically flawed, and inconclusive. She also states that \"Where should students with disabilities be educated?\" is the wrong question to ask, that it is antithetical to the kind of individualized planning that should be embodied in decision making for and with students with disabilities, and that it fails to specify where, for what, and for whom. The author calls for new ways of thinking about the problem and of conducting research so that progress can be made on improving results for students with disabilities.",

        "description":"This study compared number sense instruction in three first-grade traditional mathematics textbooks and one reform-based textbook (\"Everyday Mathematics\" [EM]). Textbooks were evaluated with regard to their adherence to principles of effective instruction (e.g., big ideas, conspicuous instruction). The results indicated that traditional textbooks included more opportunities for number relationship tasks than did EM; in contrast, EM emphasized more real-world connections than did traditional textbooks. However, EM did better than traditional textbooks in (a) promoting relational understanding and (b) integrating spatial relationship tasks with other more complex skills. Whereas instruction was more direct and explicit and feedback was more common in traditional textbooks than it was in EM, there were differences among traditional textbooks with respect to these two criteria. Although EM excelled in scaffolding instruction by devoting more lessons to concrete and semiconcrete activities, traditional textbooks provided more opportunities for engaging in all three representations. However, EM emphasized (a) a variety of models to develop number sense concepts, (b) a concrete, or semiconcrete, to symbolic representational sequence, and (c) hands-on activities using real-world objects to enhance learner engagement. Finally, even though traditional textbooks excelled over EM in providing more opportunities to practice number sense skills, this finding may be an artifact of the worksheet format employed in traditional textbooks. At the same time, adequate distribution of review in subsequent lessons was evident in EM and in only one of the traditional textbooks. Implications for practice in accessing the general education curriculum for students with learning problems are discussed.",

By contrast, federal policy represented by the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) emphasizes both full certification and content knowledge. Our research was based on data from the Schools and Staffing Survey for beginning teachers in both special and general education (separately). Results showed that extensive preparation in pedagogy and practice teaching was more effective than was only some or no preparation in producing beginning teachers who (a) were fully certified, (b) secured in-field teaching assignments, and (c) reported being well prepared to teach subject matter and well prepared with respect to pedagogical skills. Thus, contrary to the USDOE perspective emphasizing preparation in content knowledge, extensive preparation in pedagogy and practice teaching contributed to the attainment of the two key NCLB indicators of a highly qualified teacher: full certification and in-field teaching.",

One of the most useful tools in this research is the risk ratio, which compares one racial/ethnic group's risk of receiving special education and related services to that of all other students. The risk ratio can be used to calculate disproportionality at both the state and school-district-levels. However, analysts often encounter difficulties in applying the risk ratio to district level data due to variable demographic distributions and small numbers of students in either the racial/ethnic group or the comparison group. We propose two modifications to the risk ratio for dealing with these problems.",

We provide the results of a systematic case analysis of all published Orton-Gillingham decisions from the original passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) through 2005. Results indicate that in the past 30 years, hearing/review officers and courts reviewed 64 Orton-Gillingham cases, with 77% occurring within the last 10 years. Unlike autism methodology cases, districts have won an overwhelming majority (75%). Although inconclusive, the addition of the terms &quot;peer-reviewed research&quot; and &quot;scientifically based research&quot; in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA may benefit parents in Orton-Gillingham methodology disputes, thus leading to increased litigation. This article concludes with recommendations for reversing the upward trend in the number of Orton-Gillingham reading methodology disputes.",

In this article, the author states that a course he teaches, \"Multiculturalism in Education,\" examines cultural differences as they relate to social inequalities in schools and in other educational sites. He teaches the course with the following goals: (1) to explore different analytical orientations concerning multiculturalism; (2) to examine cultural difference as a construct that \"marks\" individuals and groups of individuals; (3) to investigate the historical roots of inequality related to cultural differences; (4) to discuss identity as, among other things, a multidimensional construction, and to require each student to reflect on his/her own sense of identity; (5) to address issues of voice, representation,  and agency in educational settings; and (6) to examine applications of multicultural  education in an range of contexts. The intent of the course is to prepare students to work towards the transformation of society (and its institutions) in the interest of social justice for all. The author describes the benefits of a vicarious learning activity he assigns as an exercise in group identification, role playing, and  \"perspective taking.\" This activity will be a useful tool to those who currently strive to teach university students to understand and critically examine the existence of cultural diversity in our society.

A secondary purpose was to examine the effects of stimulus characteristics on responsiveness to the phonological awareness intervention via post-hoc analysis. A single-subject design was used to examine treatment effects among children with varying levels of communicative abilities. The PASS blending module was implemented with 11 children with speech and/or language impairments, following the establishment of a stable pretreatment baseline on a series of phonological awareness probes. After instruction, the children demonstrated substantial improvement in their blending ability, which appeared to be attributable to the intervention rather than environmental or maturational factors. These findings suggest that PASS blending training was an effective approach to phonological awareness instruction for the preschoolers with disabilities in our sample. Additionally, word frequency and neighborhood density were found to influence performance on some phonological awareness tasks. Specifically, children correctly blended high-frequency words more than low-frequency words, but they correctly blended words from lower-density neighborhoods more than words from higher-density neighborhoods. Findings are discussed with respect to predictions of the lexical restructuring hypothesis. (Contains 2 tables and 8 figures.)",

The observed prevalence of comorbidity coincided with estimates in previous studies. Parents of children with comorbid AD/HD + LD were significantly more likely than parents of children with LD-only to be contacted by teachers about behavioral problems at school. Additionally, students with comorbid disorders were more likely than students with AD/HD-only to show impaired academic outcomes. However, when compared to children with AD/HD-only, children with comorbidity did not show significantly impaired behavioral outcomes; and when compared to children with LD-only, they did not show significantly impaired academic outcomes.

We argue that many questions about RTI remain unanswered, and that radical changes in the proposed regulations are not warranted at this time. Since many fundamental issues related to RTI have not been resolved, a better strategy may be to more rigorously implement existing identification criteria (e.g., discrepancy and psychological processing deficits) in a structured psychometric framework.

        "description":"This explanatory sequential mixed-methods study explored how the encoding of text ideas is affected when students with learning disabilities (LD) take notes from Web-based text. In the quantitative phase of the study, 15 students took three kinds of notes--typed, copy and paste, and written--with each kind of notes addressing a different topic. After taking notes, students performed poorly on two immediate measures of facts learning. Cued-recall test performances were best for topics noted by writing, whereas multiple-choice test performances were best for topics noted by copying and pasting. Students performed worse on the cued-recall test when it was readministered four days later. In the qualitative phase of the study, followup interviews indicated students preferred copying and pasting their notes (for practical reasons) and found typing notes to be distracting, which made learning problematic. A textual analysis of students' notes confirmed that students took mostly verbatim notes when typing or writing, which has been linked to shallow processing, and perhaps further accounts for the low level of learning that occurred. The mixing of quantitative and qualitative data (in the qualitative data analysis phase of the study), along with learning and motivation theories, provides justification for teachers to instruct middle-school students with LD to use copy and paste to take notes from Web-based sources.

Participants were 87 students who scored more than 1.3 SD below the mean on a standardized reading comprehension battery and 500 typical students in grades 2 through 4. Results using linear discriminant analyses indicated that students with reading comprehension difficulties could be accurately predicted by low cognitive skills and high competitiveness. Using cluster analysis, students with significant deficits in reading comprehension were mostly assigned to a low skill/low motivation group (termed helpless) or a low skill/high motivation group (termed motivated low achievers). Based on these findings, it was concluded that motivation, emotions, and psychopathology play a pivotal role in explaining the achievement tendencies of students with reading comprehension difficulties.

Examining dropout behavior among Black, White, and Hispanic students, with a particular focus on gaps within groups and not just between Whites and minorities, shows a clearer picture of the achievement gap. The results of our study show multiple achievement gaps both between and within groups, ultimately concluding that within-group gaps were often more significant than gaps between groups. Through hierarchical linear modeling, we found two common predictors for all three groups--being held back and number of suspensions. Hispanic and White students showed three additional predictors in common--time spent on homework, gender, and family composition. White and Black students shared only one common predictor beyond suspensions and being held back: parental involvement. Black and Hispanic students shared no additional common predictors. Finally, race/ethnicity generally proved not to be a significant predictor of dropping out. Gaps within groups may be more significant than those between groups. Such differences further reinforce our concern about the practice of establishing policy initiatives that conflate all minority group students into a monolithic whole. Our research suggests that policy makers and school leaders should craft dropout prevention policies and programs with sufficient flexibility to allow school-level personnel to individualize said policies and practices based on local conditions.

There is little research regarding interventions to address these issues. The current study compared the effects of two programs designed to increase academic motivation. Forty-seven high school female athletes from culturally and linguistically diverse and economically disadvantaged backgrounds participated in the study. The programs were implemented over a 12-week period, 2 days per week within the school day. One group received instruction using a program that was designed by the school's physical education faculty. The other group received instruction using the Possible Selves program (Hock, Schumaker, & Deshler, 2003). The researchers investigated the effects of the programs with regard to the students' level of hope for the future as measured by the Children's Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1994), records of the students' grades and number of administrative behavioral referrals, students' self-reports about their participation, and researchers' evaluation of the students' goals. The results did not indicate a difference in the students' hopes for the future. There was little difference in overall grade point averages and no difference in behavioral referrals between the two groups. The students' perceptions of their participation in the programs were similar. However, the students in the Possible Selves group indicated that they received more support from an adult during their program, and they reported higher levels of effort toward academics than the comparison group. The most significant finding was a difference in the quality of goals written. The Possible Selves group wrote goals and action plans that were more specific and realistic.

        "description":"How should district and school leaders improve education for students traditionally underserved by public education: by increasing control over teaching and curriculum, or by empowering groups of teachers to have more collective autonomy, responsibility, and opportunities for professional learning? The second approach--promoting multiple trajectories of learning among groups of teachers--has advantages, as well as some challenges, as a means of closing various achievement gaps. Sociocultural theory informed our research, as it helped us envision how people who work together create opportunities for the adaptation and learning of new practices while increasing the likelihood that individuals internalize new skills and ways of thinking. Through the analysis of a conversation among teachers about Vickie, an English Language Learner, we examine the larger context of a school's reforms. This analysis illustrates both the possibility and desirability of helping teachers engage in multiple and evolving types of teacher learning in order to succeed with students like Vickie. Closing the achievement gap likely will require more than just choosing the right intervention and implementing it with fidelity. Conceptualizing the work of closing the achievement gap as requiring multiple, ongoing trajectories of teacher learning suggests what teachers, administrators, and district leaders can do to: foster and influence trajectories of teacher learning, promote internalization of new approaches, and sustain teachers' efforts to close the achievement gap in an \"exhausting and exhilarating process that never feels finished\" (Ellen, English teacher, Mountain High School, report to faculty meeting, August 21, 2003).

        "author":["Guskey, Thomas R."],
        "description":"The problem of achievement gaps among different subgroups of students has been evident in education for many years. This manuscript revisits the work of renowned educator Benjamin S. Bloom, who saw reducing gaps in the achievement of various groups of students as a simple problem of reducing variation in student learning outcomes. Bloom observed that teaching all students in the same way and giving all the same time to learn--that is, providing little variation in the instruction--typically results in great variation in student learning. Students for whom the instructional methods and amount of time are appropriate learn well, and those for whom the methods and time are less appropriate learn less well. Bloom believed that all students could be helped to reach a high criterion of learning if both the instructional methods and time were varied to better match students' individual learning needs. In other words, to reduce variation in the achievement of diverse groups of students and have all students learn well, Bloom argued that educators and teachers must increase variation in instructional approaches and learning time. Bloom labeled the strategy to accomplish this instructional variation and differentiation mastery learning. Research evidence shows that the positive effects of mastery learning are not limited to cognitive or achievement outcomes. The process also yields improvements in students' confidence in learning situations, school attendance rates, involvement in class sessions, attitudes toward learning, and a variety of other affective measures.

        "description":"A national literacy professional development project reduced the achievement gap for students experiencing difficulties in reading or writing in 91 of New Zealand's schools. It was based on two premises: coherence within and between the multiple levels of the schooling and educational administration systems, and a focus on evidence-informed inquiry into effectiveness at each level of the system. Over the 2 years of the project's operation, these two premises interacted in ways that led to ongoing problem identification. Examples include how students understood their learning, how teachers and school leaders taught these students, how professional development facilitators changed their approaches, and how the project leaders and policy makers developed new systems for learning. Solutions were actively and collaboratively sought at all levels. Research data included assessment of student literacy in reading or writing; participant observations of the project leadership operations; interviews with principals, literacy leaders, and teachers; scenario responses; and interviews with facilitators. An analysis of facilitator practice early in the project illustrates how project leadership responded to the problems identified. Ongoing learning resulted from the interaction between facilitator feedback to teachers and their reflective responses to the observations of that feedback. Important to the success of this program is the continued feedback, not only to teachers implementing change, but also to the facilitators and policy makers instrumental in the training of the teachers. This feedback, coupled with reflective practice, at all levels of the educational system provided the means for teachers to improve the success of all students in their classrooms.

The founders of Eta Gamma Gamma--William Bock, Warren Schaller, and Robert Synovitz--all displayed a critical characteristic of leadership by having and acting on a vision. Leadership has been defined by many in a variety of ways. Most would agree that good leadership requires passion, vision, integrity, communication and organization skills, confidence, commitment and creativity. Leadership is about change--motivating and inspiring people to change. Jim Collins (2005) describes leadership capabilities that follow a five-level hierarchy. Examination of these levels through the ESG lense suggests that all levels of leadership are being learned and modeled through teaching, research and service activities at the university, community, and national levels for both students and faculty alike. This article presents Jim Collins' five levels of leadership and discusses how Eta Sigma Gamma has created a \"culture of leadership\". (Contains 1 figure.)",

Given that the economic foundation of the approximately 600 schools and libraries affected was far from ideal before the hurricane, the prospect of recovery for technology and media infrastructures seemed dim. The authors set about this research with little or no knowledge of the impact of Katrina on technology and media infrastructures. It was the authors' intention to provide a descriptive snapshot of the damage done and the relief received. To accomplish this goal, an online form was created, and the technology contacts for school districts listed in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) zones for individual assistance were contacted. In these zones, FEMA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies, was providing aid to individual citizens and households in the form of grants, loans, tax relief, counseling, as well as emergency food and shelter. The link for the survey was mailed out to the technology contacts for each of the parishes/districts, and each district was contacted by phone and urged to participate. A total of 77 parishes were targeted, and of these, 41 responded. (Contains 4 figures.)",

        "description":"In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the district temporarily lost 100% of its students and  did not reopen a single school for more than two months. As it became apparent that the district was not prepared to bring the schools back from such a devastating blow, educators began to see a silver lining in Katrina's dark clouds. State School Board member Leslie Jacobs said, &quot;The Diaspora of New Orleans represents the opportunity to rebuild our public school system&quot; (Inskeep, 2005b). While some saw this as an opportunity to rebuild the system, huge segments of the population were living in Houston, Baton Rouge, Atlanta, and hundreds of other places across the country. With the low-income, non-white residents most often affected by the disaster, it fell to the educational organizations in the city to lead the debate over how the schools should be reopened. With leadership structures and educational platforms already in place, these stakeholder organizations (teachers union, school board, and the like) were well-situated to influence the course of events in the tumultuous few months following the storm. In understanding the ways in which various stakeholder organizations responded to Katrina, it should be possible to understand the reasons for the success and failure of certain groups. This may give some insight into the complex social and political forces that surround any effort to change urban schools. Understanding the role of stakeholder organizations in post-Katrina reforms is one small step toward the larger agenda of understanding how urban schools change. In this article, the author presents a study which examines the roles of five stakeholder organizations and their success in implementing structural reforms in the post-Katrina redesign of the New Orleans Public Schools.

        "description":"The &quot;anticipatory&quot; model of crisis management draws the attention of crisis practitioners and researchers to the precrisis phase of crisis management. The model views institutions' position as a condition that has implications for peoples' perceptions regarding the lack of control over factors such as policies, human resources, machineries or technologies, infrastructure, and relationship structure. The concept of &quot;control&quot; is germane in crisis management and must be established in crisis decision-making with vigilance. The &quot;anticipatory model&quot; fosters vigilant decision-making in precrisis, during crisis and postcrisis although the primary emphasis with the anticipatory model is on crisis prevention altogether. The anticipatory model is considered useful when evaluating crises relating to the management of hurricane Katrina and hurricane Rita that ripped through the Gulf Coast in the southern part of the United States within three weeks of each other. Almost two years later, the impact of the disaster is still being felt deeply by those whose lives were directly affected and stakeholders who have their opinions on what went wrong and what could have been done. The devastation to the Gulf Coast by these two hurricanes has been called &quot;the greatest disaster&quot; in U.S. history. This article explores hurricanes Katrina and Rita as two crises where both perception and construction of realities differed partly because of how and where people experienced the phenomena of the storms. The anticipatory model is reviewed and a study assessing the public's perception of these two crises and their management is described. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"The importance of multiculturalism in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina can be illustrated through a comparative view of the 1967 controversial, seminal, and Academy Award winning film, \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\". In the film, a multicultural cast starred in a groundbreaking tale of interracial marriage--then still illegal in some United States states--bigotry, and eventual, qualified tolerance. The film's plot concerned the turmoil that resulted from the definite answer to the question of whom was actually coming to dinner--a young White woman and her new fiance who was a Black man. The dinner was hosted at the home of the young woman's bemused parents who, though well-intentioned liberals, were trying to make sense not only of the pronouncement of a seemingly impetuous interracial love and impending marriage, but of their own race-bound preconceptions. During the story, the young woman's parents gradually soften their narrow-minded views, come to terms with their own biases, and abandoned their strong opposition to the young couple's interracial union. In the conclusion, they go on to behave in a racially tolerant manner; however, despite their apparent newfound enlightenment in the face of the imposed culturally diverse circumstances, the backdrop of cultural and racial intolerance had already been ostensibly sanctioned. This film revealed that the concept of multiculturalism was needed to provide a framework for effective inclusive and interpersonal interactions that would draw on their similarities and their differences to break down stereotypes and prejudices. In this article, the author examines the role of multiculturalism, schools, and teachers in using their similarities and their differences to create an inclusive, supportive and safe environment that is culturally responsive. Additionally, the article issues a continued call to action to teachers who are educating all students who are culturally, linguistically, racially, and ethnically diverse, particularly those upon whom Hurricane Katrina has wreaked havoc.

Unfortunately, the lessons learned from the educational responses prompted by the aftermath of Katrina are not nearly as positive as one would hope, nor are they the kinds of attitudes and actions that are most desirable or should be pursued in the long run if educators expect to produce positive effects for the children of Katrina beyond immediate reactions. Several of these lessons learned are suggested in this article for critical analysis, reflection, and reconstruction to generate better educational opportunities and outcomes for ethnically, racially, and culturally different students regardless of their specific circumstances at any particular point in time. These include the infeasibility of charity as pedagogy; the limitations of good intentions; the pernicious nature of racism; isolation and invisibility; and the certainty that some children are always left behind.",

        "author":["Marbley, Aretha Faye"],
        "description":"Throughout the country and especially in Texas, local communities opened their arms to hurricane Katrina evacuees. Like the federal government, emergency health and mental health entities were unprepared for the massive numbers of people needing assistance. Mental health professionals, though armed with a wealth of crisis intervention information, weren't equipped with skills for either anticipating or assessing the effects of the relocation of evacuees into local communities on the mental health of the humanitarian host communities. Yet, the response to the disaster was as unprecedented as the widespread devastation of the hurricane. Likewise, the generosity of people was unprecedented; individuals, the media, celebrities, businessmen, states, cities, towns, the international world, community organizations, faith-based institutions, public schools, colleges and universities all rallied around rescuing the refugees. Yet, despite good intentions and in spite of the massive efforts to get people to safety with food, water, and crisis intervention counseling, communities were stressed and strained. In Texas, government officials and local governments needed money to provide basic health and mental-health care for evacuees, but also accommodations for the new students placed in Texas' schools. As a consequence of the rapid depletion of the state's resources, responding to the disaster took its toll on Texas and Texas communities. For Katrina victims and the people and communities responding to the disaster, the psychological implications are yet unknown, but are guaranteed to be tremendous, now and in the months and years to come. Therefore, incorporating mental health services for individuals and communities that address race, class, and culture is a critical component of comprehensive crisis mental health services to the evacuees, their families, and the communities that housed them. This article introduces a crisis mental health service delivery model for addressing the devastating effects of disasters, like Katrina, on communities, specifically humanitarian host communities, a model that address inherent cultural issues.",

The group was developed to address the complicated issues presented when working with survivors of abuse who are court-mandated to attend counseling. The concept of \"gender entrapment\" (Richie, 1996) is offered to explain the survivors' circumstances. The author explores the benefits of utilizing the relational context, clinical training in art psychotherapy with special populations, and an implicit trust in the creative process in illustrating the positive effects of artmaking and group processes with these clients. Feminist frameworks are used to describe the population and address the complexities of healing from abuse within a context of oppression.",

        "description":"The current study focuses on data collected from children in the United States shortly after the Yugoslavia-NATO conflict. Fifty-six children in two Midwestern states were asked to draw a picture of peace and a picture of war. Two major themes, peace as interpersonal interactions and peace as negative peace, emerged from the qualitative analysis of the children's peace drawings and their accompanying verbal statements. Five themes were identified in the analysis of the war drawings and descriptions: war as activity, war as group conflict, death as a consequence of war, negative emotions related to war, and war as fantasy. Calculating t-tests for paired samples revealed that children included significantly more objects and more figures in their war drawings than in their peace drawings. However, there were no significant differences between the peace and war drawings regarding the number of colors or the percentage of space used. Developmental features of children's drawings are discussed and implications for researchers are presented. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)",

The families that participate in the programming offered by the Museum are living, and perhaps working and going to school, in the shadows of what used to be the World Trade Center. In an effort to offer a neighborhood center for families to collectively process the events of September 11 and to heal as a community, the Museum's director and staff reached out to its members and others in the community through the use of art and art projects. This brief report discusses the work the author did at the Museum with a parents' group with the intention of creating a healing place within the SoHo community. Examples of the art produced during this session, comments made by participants, and suggestions made to these parents concerning their own healing and that of their children are included in this discussion. The effects of posttraumatic stress and strategies for response through art therapy are addressed. (Contains 2 figures.)",

In the hope of encouraging art therapists to use this valuable resource, this paper presents examples of art expressions for professional processing by many art therapists working with various populations in different kinds of settings. In addition to spontaneous responses to strong feelings aroused by clients, systematic procedures are illustrated that were designed to deal with specific difficult reactions. Examples include identification and shock in work with adolescents; grief over dying children; dehumanization of developmentally delayed clients; dream work; exploration of racial prejudice; work with sexual abuse; poetry combined with art; utilizing clients' themes, symbols, styles, and materials; and selection of media to enhance particular ways of processing.

It isn't easy successfully competing with other jobseekers for those all too rare positions that pay a good wage, have reasonable hours, and offer employer benefits and prospects for advancement. This is a daunting undertaking for many individuals--and even more so for a young person who happens to have a disability. This article describes a program which was created to help high school students with disabilities identify career goals and then find, learn and keep jobs that match those goals. Career Connections, founded in 2001 with grants from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs, is a collaborative effort involving students, families, school staff, Grant Wood Area Education Agency (GWAEA) and community rehabilitation agencies such as Goodwill Industries of the Heartland and Advancement Services of Jones County. The program has expanded to serve 60 to 70 students annually from 21 Iowa high schools, with districts paying for program services. The program was developed on the premise that students with disabilities need extra training and support to be successful in the workforce. It has six program elements, each designed to answer a specific question that will help guide the student's career path.",

CTE institutions such as Blue Hills Regional Technical School, located in Canton, take students from grades nine through 12 and attract students from the towns in their district. They offer complete academic course offerings, along with sports and other extracurricular activities. Blue Hills offers 14 programs during the exploratory freshman year. Students spend the first half of the semester exploring all programs, then concentrate on eight programs and select a major to pursue during the second semester. The school also offers interdisciplinary activities so that students can see the need for reading, writing, and math. When they graduate from Blue Hills, they do so with a dual education: All state requirements are met for a high school diploma, and they receive competency recognition for their technical achievement. When compared to its sending districts, Blue Hills has a higher proficiency index and one of the lowest failure rates on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System.",

        "description":"The fourth recommendation in ACTE's postsecondary reform position statement is to ensure portability and transferability of credits and skills attained. All postsecondary learning has value that should be recognized. Students' progress toward completion of postsecondary credentials can be improved with clear, consistent policies that ensure full transfer and articulation of postsecondary learning. Successful strategies include common course-numbering systems, articulation agreements, and the transcription of credit for postsecondary career and technical education (CTE) certificate programs that are currently non-credit. Postsecondary education, including CTE, would benefit tremendously if states adopted systems to assess, measure, and document the educational progress of learners in ways that are clear and meaningful to students as well as to their employers. Transferability of credits and skills attained through postsecondary education calls for a re-examination of the ways that learning at the postsecondary level is measured and transcribed. Measuring competencies rather than seat time, or offering postsecondary credit for prior work experience, would enable documentation for what students can do and the skills they have attained. This article is part of a year-long series that closely examines the recommendations made in ACTE's postsecondary reform position statement and highlights best practices for implementing each of the recommendations.",

        "description":"Can all the universities that claim to be \"world-class\" actually live up to the claim? If they could, would that be desirable public policy? It could be that there are so many different meanings of \"world-class\" that the term in practical effect is an oxymoron: the definition of \"world\" is determined locally when conceptually it should be defined internationally. This paper discusses different kinds of institutional quality, how quality is formed and how it can be measured, particularly by comparison. It also discusses the subtle but fundamental differences between quality and reputation. The paper concludes with the suggestion that world-class comparisons of research quality and productivity are possible, but that any broader application to the \"world-class\" quality of universities will be at best futile and at worst misleading.",

Students living in suite-style buildings reported a greater sense of belonging, and higher activity levels than students living in dormitory-style buildings.

Yet very little has been documented on how programs for diverse groups of university teachers actually engage faculty in such reflection. This paper examines how theoretical constructs of reflective practice were applied in the context of an 8-month &quot;UBC Faculty Certificate Program on Teaching and Learning in Higher Education&quot; (FCP).  The &quot;Teaching Perspectives Inventory&quot; (TPI) was particularly useful for providing faculty cohort members with a means of looking more deeply at the underlying values and assumptions that constituted their philosophical orientations to teaching. Furthermore, a change in faculty members' TPI scores indicate that participants reflected more comprehensively on their teaching at the end of the program, than they did at the beginning of the program. Barriers to facilitating reflection included inadequate time allocation, unclear expectations and goals for reflection activities, and varying cultural norms for reflective teaching practices within academe.

        "description":"The study uses individual data from the Canadian Labour Force Survey to consider economic factors in university participation decisions by persons aged 17-24 from 1976 to 2003. The level of real tuition is one economic factor that may affect the university participation decision. There is also regional variation in the opportunity cost of university attendance; in the reduction in the probability of unemployment after obtaining a university degree; and in the proportion of university budgets used for financial support of students. In addition, there is some national variation by gender and over time in the return to a university education. This study finds that higher tuition levels in the 1990s did reduce the probability of university participation by persons aged 17, 18 or 19 relative to a province-specific trend increase in university participation. Before drawing a policy conclusion from this result, it would be necessary to consider what the trend terms represent in the university participation decision.

Francophone and Mixed-heritage students felt equally competent in the two languages, but Anglophone students reported much higher language competence in English.

Thirty-six medical students completed an e-mail survey exploring the transition from pre-medical to medical education, the use of learning strategies, and self-regulated learning practices. Their responses highlighted the challenges of medical education and the learning skills that lead to the successful mastery of course demands. Respondents identified volume of information as the major transition issue. Key strategies used were establishing balance, selectively targeting information, and controlling stress. Strong metacognitive abilities and other self-regulating activities were identified. Findings indicated that while students initially found the workload stressful, the implementation of specific learning skills facilitated the adjustment to medical school.

U.S.-based studies have also identified myriad personal and institutional factors associated with academic misconduct. Implicit in some of these factors are several institutional strategies that may be implemented to support academic integrity: revisiting the values and goals of higher education, recommitting to quality in teaching and assessment practice, establishing effective policies and invigilation practices, providing educational opportunities and support for all members of the university community, and using (modified) academic honour codes. There is a dearth of similar research in Canada despite growing recognition that academic misconduct is a problem on Canadian campuses. This paper suggests that Canadian higher education can learn much from the U.S. experience and calls for both a recommitment to academic integrity and research on academic misconduct in Canadian higher education institutions.",

        "description":"Canadian governments and various stakeholder groups are advocating greater interprofessional collaboration amongst health care providers as a fundamental strategy for enhancing coordination and quality of care in the health care system. Interprofessional education for collaborative patient-centred practice (IECPCP) is an educational process by which students/learners (or workers) from different health professions learn together to improve collaboration. The educational system is believed to be a main determinant of interprofessional collaborative practice, yet academic institutions are largely influenced by accreditation, certification and licensure bodies. Accreditation processes have been linked to the continuous improvement of curricula in the health professions, and have also been identified as potential avenues for encouraging educational change and innovation. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the characteristics of the national accreditation systems of select Canadian health professional education programs at both the pre- and post-licensure educational levels and to show how these systems support and/or foster IECPCP. A review of the educational accreditation systems of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work, occupational therapy and physiotherapy was undertaken through key informant interviews and an analysis of accreditation process documentation. The results of this comparative review suggest that accreditation systems are more prevalent across the health professions at a pre-licensure level. Accreditation at the post-licensure level, particularly at the continuing professional education level, appears to be less well established across the majority of health professions. Overall, the findings of the review also suggest that current accreditation systems do not appear to promote nor foster interprofessional education for collaborative patient-centred practice in a systematic manner through either accreditation processes or standards. Through a critical adult learning perspective we argue that in order for traditional uni-professional structures within the health professional education system to be challenged, the accreditation system needs to place greater value on interprofessional education for collaborative patient-centred practice.

Three possible forms of enforcement are identified as curricular occupation, language control, and conflict of rights; among these, the last is the most severe. In terms of rights, the issue of political correctness is usually framed as a conflict between expression rights and equality rights. In a university, restriction of expression rights is not justified. However, expression rights need not be characterized as conflicting with equality rights if both those charged with policing and those who charge them genuinely respect each others' expression rights.

In-depth interviews with 42 racially minoritized academics in Canadian universities allowed U.S. to begin to grasp the challenges faced by those who must negotiate the different spaces in an academy that is predominately white, Eurocentric and male. Using an anti-racist framework, we found that the level of inclusion that racially minoritized academics in our study felt within their workplaces depended upon their experiences with 1) acceptance (e.g., through hiring, promotion, and tenure); 2) visibility (e.g., in terms of perceived power in informal and formal work interactions); 3) support (e.g., via collegial and administrative encouragement, assistance, collaboration and resource support); and 4) mentoring (e.g., in terms of providing and seeking mentor experiences). Our findings suggest that the increasing presence of racially minoritized academics may better serve institutional purposes of portraying a mission of diversity than actually achieving a mission of equity.

        "description":"Despite a plethora of research on the academic misconduct carried out by U.S. high school and undergraduate university students, little research has been done on the academic misconduct of Canadian students. This paper addresses this shortcoming by presenting the results of a study conducted at 11 Canadian higher education institutions between January 2002 and March 2003. We maintain that academic misconduct does indeed occur in Canada--amongst high school, undergraduate and graduate students. Common self-reported behaviours were as follows: working on an assignment with others when asked for individual work, getting questions and answers from someone who has already taken a test, copying a few sentences of material without footnoting, fabricating or falsifying lab data, and receiving unauthorized help on an assignment. Possible factors associated with these behaviours include student maturity, perceptions of what constitutes academic misconduct, faculty assessment and invigilation practices, low perceived risk, ineffective and poorly understood policies and procedures, and a lack of education on academic misconduct. Canadian educational institutions are encouraged to address these issues, beginning with a recommitment to academic integrity. (Contains 4 tables and 5 notes.)",

The research sample comprised 140 students from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan who enrolled in graduate programs at two large Ontario universities. The research findings reveal the significant influence of academic, economic, environmental, and visa/immigration pulling factors as well as a set of negative pushing factors from third countries such as the United States. Activities related to internationalization of graduate education play a critical role in influencing the choice of a Canadian graduate school. The findings suggest that to attract the &quot;best and brightest&quot; international graduate students, policy makers and institutional administrators should focus on investing in research and ensuring the quality of graduate education while devoting efforts and resources to the internationalization of Canadian graduate education.

In support of this assertion, a number of issues are addressed, including the role and mandate of the university college, academic freedom and tenure, governance, administration, and the legal status under which it was constituted.

We argue that the individual return to education has to be analyzed from a multi-dimensional perspective, in relation to initial educational and career goals of graduates who have anticipated both intellectual challenges and economic rewards from their investment in education. The study reveals differences in outcomes (i.e., employment, earnings) by program type, gender and age. Our main conclusion is that graduates from applied education programs experience a more rapid integration into the labour market as compared to graduates from liberal arts education programs. Although earning differences by program type and age either decrease or even disappear over time, earning differences by gender are enhanced five years after graduation. Also, we conclude that graduates from applied education programs establish and accomplish more focused educational and career goals, while graduates from liberal education programs establish broader educational and career goals.

Two main theories, transformative learning (Mezirow, 1991) and faculty development (Ramsden, 2003) in the approach adopted for the CRIW (Saroyan & Amundsen, 2004) informed this study and its procedures. This theoretical framework is congruent with Bennett's (1993) developmental model of intercultural sensitivity. Data collection for this study consisted of pre- and post-CRIW questionnaires, interviews, and workshop artifacts. Interpretative qualitative analysis of the data showed that faculty engaged in the process at a very deep level and reported intellectual changes in their perspectives. Also, they demonstrated a willingness to change their conceptual and practical understandings of the process of internationalization of the curriculum. In conclusion, we found that the participants' transformation and perspectives were in line with the theoretical bases of the original intervention designed by Saroyan, Amundsen, McAlpine, Weston, Winer, and Gandell (2004). Also, this pilot project reiterates the need for curricular reform, faculty development, and institutional structures to support internationalization of the curriculum on a larger scale.

        "description":"Despite professors' education and socialization and the significant rewards they receive for research activities and output, the 80/20 rule seems to apply; that is, there exists a system of stars who produce a disproportionate volume of research such that most research tends to be undertaken by a small percentage of the academy (Erkut, 2002). Although a growing body of research seeks to address this imbalance, studies of research productivity have tended to reveal its institutional and non-behavioural antecedents. As a result, there exists very little research that considers the strategies that individuals employ to improve their personal research productivity. This exploratory, questionnaire-based study of a sample of Canadian professors attempts to address this gap by examining the relationship among a number of strategies, what professors report as being their average annual number of publications over the past five years, and their perceptions of their level of research productivity. Not surprisingly, in this study, we found that the amount of time that individuals invested in research activities predicted their level of research productivity. Additionally, strategically focusing one's research positively influenced journal publication levels, both directly and through its interaction with seeking resources (such as research grants). A strategic focus also positively predicted self-perceived research productivity through its interaction with managing ideas. Finally, although the perceived need to free up time from teaching and committee work was negatively related to journal publication levels, it was positively related to perceptions of productivity.

Considerable variation existed in the ease with which PLAR information could be located and in the quality of information provided. Universities were also found to vary widely in the supports offered to learners seeking PLAR, in the formality of their institutional PLAR policies, and in the extent to which the practice is institution-wide or restricted to specific faculties or departments.

For many years Nigerian universities have complained of being impeded in these areas because of the supervisory role of the National Universities Commission (NUC) which tend to encroach on their autonomy. In order to confirm this complaint and profer solution 280 university administrators and 100 university union officials from the 10 universities in the South-South Geopolitical zone of Nigeria were surveyed. An instrument known as the &quot;National Universities Commission Supervisory Role and Effect questionnaire&quot; was used for data collection. The chi-square statistical method was used for data analysis. The study revealed that the supervisory role of the NUC in the areas of funding, ensuring minimum academic standards, and political interference in the appointments of vice-chancellors and Governing Councils has been abused resulting in the poor management of Nigerian Universities. The paper subsequently recommended that these anomalies be eliminated through an amendment of the statute that established the NUC in order to give the universities the necessary autonomy for growth.

Considering the many challenges faced by teachers of statistics in higher education, there is a continuing need to evaluate and monitor teaching and learning at this level. The purpose of this study was to survey elementary and secondary teachers to determine their attitudes about statistics, their perceptions related to student attitudes and achievement, and their attitudes about their preparation and training. The findings based on the results of a survey suggest that although most of the teachers have overall positive attitudes about their statistics experiences, many were undecided about their experiences, and most reported that they need additional preparation and training. Implications are discussed from the results and suggestions are offered to statistics educators in an effort to improve and advance the teaching and learning of statistics in P-12 education.",

While the answers of teachers at the schools are naturally not meant to represent the entire American teaching population, they nonetheless can suggest what educators in different parts of the country--and those working with similar populations and school environments--perceive as the characteristics of contemporary civics education, and what can be done to improve its quality. In viewing the data, it is apparent that a consensus of the high school teachers from all three locations coincided with the reviewed literature--a concern about the lack of knowledge, attitude, and participation of young people necessary for the future growth of the American representative republic. Among their suggestions include: (1) proper instruction in citizenship from the home; (2) integration of a mandatory service learning component into the curriculum; and (3) improvement of civic awareness among students included &quot;teaching ethics in the early grades.&quot; A Survey is appended.

        "description":"This article describes the impact of receiving the Matthew Shepard Scholarship (a 4-year, full scholarship) on 8 students who were openly gay or lesbian in high school. Previous literature, while limited, paints a decidedly bleak picture of the prospects for gay and lesbian youth. However, this previous research is often based on students in therapy or otherwise exhibiting maladjustment and ignores those youth who are successful. Through a narrative structure, the 8 students described their experiences with harassment, fear, social isolation, and other difficulties before overcoming these challenges and being selected as a Matthew Shepard Scholar. In addition to the experience of coming out, receiving this award represented a further point of transformation in their lives. The honor and recognition of receiving the scholarship further magnified their confidence, aspirations, and educational opportunities. Educators often fail to recognize the talents and promise of gay and lesbian students. The narratives of these students serve to highlight the achievements, as well as the struggles, of gay and lesbian youth in our nation's high schools. The students' accounts of the scholarship suggest that educators and researchers should not be derailed by debates about sexual orientation, but rather, they should focus on their obligation to develop the potential of all students. In particular, educators should establish safe and nurturing educational environments by addressing harassment issues and establishing awareness workshops for faculty and staff. Through these efforts, the talents of students can be developed and their promise realized.",

        "description":"Career and technical education represents an important and understudied educational option for high school students. This qualitative study utilized data from one exemplary career and technical education (CTE) center to address the question of how talented and general education students' part-time CTE experiences differed from their traditional high school experiences. The secondary students in this study simultaneously attended both the CTE center and a traditional high school. Through interviews with students, a trend emerged: students explicitly compared these two educational experiences. Both talented and general students commented favorably on their CTE experiences and negatively on their traditional high school experiences. The four major themes from their comments included autonomy; effective, caring teachers; students with similar interests; and relevant content in an applied setting. Students appreciated the ability to choose courses and determine the order or type of assignments, to self-pace the curriculum, and to experiment with a profession (autonomy). They also commented on the presence of teachers who had high expectations, sought student's strengths, showed personal interest in the students, and had professional experience (effective, caring teachers) in the CTE setting. The student's perspectives included the observation that at the CTE center they were exposed to other students who demonstrated mature and committed behaviors, showed interest in their course of study, and participated in Career and Technical Student Organizations (students with similar interests). Finally, the learning environment at the CTE center offered curricular connections to the profession, hands-on learning, and professional treatment of students in a job-like setting (relevant content in an applied setting).

        "description":"As the field of education moves forward in the area of assessment, researchers have yet to come to a conclusion about definitions of commonly used terms. Without a consensus on the use of fundamental terms, it is difficult to engage in meaningful discourse within the field of assessment, as well as to conduct research on and communicate about best assessment practices. For this article, we reviewed journal articles, position papers, thought pieces, and classroom assessment textbooks, focusing on the definitions of the terms \"performance assessment\", \"authentic assessment\", and \"formative assessment\". We provide a summary of the literal definitions provided and the components, format, and intentions of each type of assessment. In addition, we underscore the important distinctions made by researchers in the field between performance assessment and authentic assessment. Some researchers suggest performance assessment and authentic assessment are synonymous,and others  view performance assessment as a component of authentic assessment. Understanding authentic and performance assessments is important to have a sound theoretical basis for decisions made within the classroom. The purpose and benefits of formative assessment represent another area of discussion within the field of assessment. Formative assessment may be used solely to inform the teacher, or it may be used as a powerful means of providing feedback to students, allowing students to alter their strategies to improve learning. We emphasize important distinctions between the formation of learning and the formation of behaviors or strategies that promote learning. Finally, to avoid confusion, classroom assessment should be classified based on the assessment's intended purpose. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Given that student retention is now one of the leading challenges faced by colleges and universities, research seeking to understand students' reasons for attrition is of critical importance. Two factors influence students' underachievement and subsequent dropping-out of college: self-efficacy and goal orientation. Self-efficacy refers to peoples' judgments about their abilities to complete a task. Goal orientations refer to the motives that students have for completing tasks, which may include developing and improving ability (mastery goals), demonstrating ability (performance-approach goals), and hiding lack of ability performance-avoidance goals). This study examined differences among goal orientations and self-efficacy using two distinct student groups: college students in good academic standing (GPA of 2.0 or higher) and college students on academic probation (GPA of less than 2.0). Results indicated that self-efficacy and mastery goals were positively related to academic standing whereas performance-avoidance goals were negatively related to academic standing. Students in good academic standing reported having higher self-efficacy and adopted significantly more mastery goals toward learning than students on academic probation. Among students who reported having high self-efficacy, those on academic probation reported adopting significantly more performance-avoidance goals than those in good academic standing. These findings suggest that teachers should identify those students with not only low self-efficacy, but those also adopting performance-avoidance goals. Teachers and administrators may be able to provide guidance to students who have beliefs and goals that contain maladaptive patterns of learning that sabotage their ability to succeed in school.

        "description":"Tiered instruction is grouping students for instruction based on their prior background knowledge in a given subject area. In this study, students were either in a control secondary science classroom or a classroom in which instruction was tiered. The tiered instruction was designed to match high, middle, or low levels of background knowledge on astronomy and Newtonian physics. The seven control classrooms received middle-level nontiered instruction, whereas the seven treatment classrooms delivered three levels of tiered instruction. The results of this study showed a significant difference between the scores of low background knowledge learners who received tiered instruction and low background learners who did not receive tiered instruction, indicating that tiered instruction may be especially beneficial for lower level learners. Through the implementation of this study, the researchers found that: (1) professional support for teachers is critical to the success of tiered instruction; (2) a strong background in the subject matter and a thorough understanding of the range of potential learning activities appropriate to the targeted levels of learners is essential; and (3) the implementation of a change of instructional and classroom organization, pedagogy, and expectations needs to be systematically introduced over time.

In this article, the authors report the findings of an ongoing collaborative effort between cognitive researchers and urban science teachers to align everyday teaching with standards, tests, and research-based pedagogy. They begin with an analysis of how the width vs. depth dilemma in science teaching manifested itself in yearly test scores and the achievement gap. They review the problematic issues of alignment among standards, instruction, and assessment. They argue that simply matching standards with so-called &quot;standards-based&quot; materials creates a false sense of comfort in a superficially aligned curriculum. They advocate for schools, districts, and even states to undertake the difficult but necessary planning process to create a framework of performance objectives to serve as the critical hinge linking standards, instruction, and assessment. Such curriculum planning must set as its first priority the goals of effectively cutting down the girth of yearly science content while efficiently managing the handoff of students between grade levels.

It is important to understand how teachers assess their students in response to these pressures. In this article, the authors report on findings from a year-long study of how teachers determine student understanding and why they employ the instructional and assessment strategies that they do. Qualitative data were collected on five science teachers from the Sonora Foothills School District, and are reported here in the form of individual case studies. The authors single out three important issues raised by their research: (1) the importance of recognizing the impact of political pressures on classroom teachers; (2) the importance teachers place on connecting teaching and assessment; and (3) the accountability dilemma and teachers' capacity to operate within a complex policy milieu.",

        "description":"Over the years, teachers and school leaders have engaged in some form of training beyond their formal preservice, university preparation programs. Whether referred to as in-service training, professional day, or staff or professional development, this activity normally had one purpose: to improve participant's knowledge or skills. With limited teacher time to attend in-service training and limited financial resources to pay for this training, districts are searching for training that provides returns on these investments in time and money: returns in terms of increased student achievement. In this article, the author discusses how to increase the chances that professional development will be transformed into increased student improvement by examining three issues: (1) Does professional development impact student learning?; (2) How can school leaders judge the effectiveness of their professional development program?; and (3) What professional development characteristics are linked to improved student learning? The author concludes that the right kinds of professional development for both teachers and school leaders can directly contribute to improved student performance. Schools can become advocates for investment in increased professional development by capturing evidence of its effectiveness to show a return in learning of their investment in time and money.",

In science and mathematics teacher pre-service and in-service preparation, these issues are paramount for institutions of higher education, especially in terms of the definition of a &quot;highly qualified&quot; teacher. Within this paper, the authors discuss the science and mathematics issues facing the nation. Specifically, they examine the literature supporting the major/minor teaching certification (with a major certification required to be considered highly qualified) and NCLB's effect on the state of Montana. Their review indicates that increased content knowledge does not of itself guarantee that a teacher will be better able to increase student performance. Instead, the successful teacher must also possess considerable background in communicating effectively to students. Following the U.S. Department of Education's strict definition of &quot;highly qualified&quot; goes against the evidence and may cause considerable conflict in states like Montana, where teachers are deemed to be highly qualified if they are teaching in their area of certification.

Iowa was one of the six Chautauqua sites which were modeled after a program for teachers from small colleges and operated by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In Iowa this new Chautauqua effort focused upon Science-Technology-Society (STS) materials and teaching strategies with primary attention directed to teachers in grades 4 through 9. The program began with 30 teachers enrolled in a program in one center and increased annually to number 230 teacher enrolled in five centers across the state. The program was expanded with funds from various of private industries and Title II projects. Over 15,000 teachers have been enrolled during last two decades. The focus and unique feature was the STS teaching approach as reform in science education. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Iowa Chautauqua Professional Development Program.

        "description":"With the dramatic growth of environmental science as an elective in high schools over the last decade, educators have the opportunity to realistically consider the possibility of incorporating environmental science into the core high school curriculum. Environmental science has several characteristics that make it a candidate for the core curriculum. It is: (1) important for students and society; (2) an opportunity for students to experience an applied science; and (3) a particularly engaging context for learning fundamental science. In this paper, the author considers the possibility of a reform with the goal of achieving widespread adoption of environmental science as a required subject for high school by arguing for the value of environmental science, examining the rationale for the status quo, exploring what a high school core curriculum that includes environmental science might look like, and considering which of the elements that would be required to implement this reform are in place. The author concludes that many of the elements to support broad adoption of this reform are in place, but several are not, so additional groundwork would need to be laid before a large-scale reform effort targeted at integrating environmental science into the core high school curriculum could be successful.

UbD provides a framework for study units rich in essential content, assessment practices and well-crafted activities. SAW and lesson study provide strategy to determine if both student work and teacher assignment meet intended goals and standards. The author discusses staff selection and training, including: (1) goal selection; (2) content topic identification; (3) unit study design; (4) creating a research lesson designed to integrate science process skills with content; and (5) presenting and observing the research lesson. Following final edits of the research lesson based on observation data, the lesson and study unit are distributed to each staff member teaching the grade level or planned course, with encouragement to revise the lesson to meet the needs of the individual classes, creating a continuing lesson study cycle. The experiment has sparked staff interest. As veteran teachers team with those new to the profession or teachers with varied content expertise, a broader and deeper understanding of content material is gained, that can be passed to students, leading to both improved teaching and increased academic achievement (Contains 2 figures.)",

But the question of the relative merits of these two different types of writing for student writers continues to be an issue of concern for teachers of composition, especially teachers of basic writing. In this article, I take another look at this important question. Using the psycholinguistic theories of Jerome Bruner and James Britton as the basis for analysis, I reconsider the Elbow-Bartholomae debate. Then, using data from a qualitative study of reflective journal writing I conducted, I argue that all students--and especially basic writers--need to reflect on their reading using personal, expressive language in order to acquire genuine academic discourse.

        "description":"In this description of a learning community for &quot;at-risk&quot; and basic writing students at the University of Wyoming, I outline the reasons our students resist academic writing prior to their entry into college--reasons largely unrelated to typical perceptions of at-risk students as &quot;lazy&quot; or intellectually less capable. For students who come from family or community cultures that are far removed from academic discourses and hierarchies, accepting a new form of writing--and therefore thinking--is akin to widening a rift between them and their home cultures. Because of this tension, faculty in the Synergy Program approach basic writing not as a deficiency in writing structure or mechanics, but as a deeply held attitude of uninvestment in the writing process. In an attempt to help students overcome this attitude of uninvestment, particularly toward writing projects involving research and clear thesis structures, Synergy faculty in the Composition and Critical Thinking courses collaborated in melding two courses that give students room to develop not only writing, but also reading and critical thinking literacies in a context that does not presuppose their investment in the process. The Synergy Program includes three courses in the fall and one course in the spring. In addition, students attend a one-day, six-hour summer orientation during which they gain an in-depth introduction to the program and form initial connections with faculty and peers. This article presents a learning community model for encouraging academic literacies that foregrounds students' anxieties about acculturation into academic modes of thinking and inspires ownership of course projects through ethnographic research and a capstone web portfolio.

        "description":"Service learning has been recognized as an effective pedagogical tool in the writing classroom. It has also served to help students develop an awareness of diversity and multicultural issues. In this article, the author examines the benefits of service learning in a basic writing course designed for students of color attending a disproportionately white institution. Students in this course are accepted into the university through the Contractual Admission Program (CAP), a program designed for students whose academic profile might otherwise impede their access to high education. Through a close examination of student journal reflections and class exchanges, the author argues that incorporating service learning in the curriculum helps students of color develop their reading and writing skills, understand the concept and engage in the practice of critical thinking, and recognize and analyze issues in a more rigorous way through class discussions and written reflections.

Relying on principles of universal design and on insights derived from his school's studio program about ways the institution's selective functions can impact curricular matters, the author describes how the basic writing course was merely retrofitted to an English Department's goals, rather than integrated into is mainstream business. In turn, the author suggests that historical studies such as this can help basic writing teachers excavate and reinvigorate democratic reform efforts often backgrounded in light of a school's elite reputation.

Monthly open-ended interviews and a questionnaire distributed three times during the academic year provided insight into the successes and struggles she was experiencing and the types of knowledge, expertise, and resources that were available or needed for effective teaching experiences. The beginning teacher identified a total of 58 successes and struggles throughout her initial year, with an equal number of each type by the end of the investigation.

The model embraces five components that: 1) situate faculty development in professional and ethical standards; 2) align faculty diversity competencies with the institutional mission; 3) embrace guiding principles for undergraduate education; 4) contextualize faculty development; and 5) challenge through reflective discourse.

        "description":"This study examined the comprehension subsection of Nelson-Denny Reading Test Form G (Brown, Fishco, & Hanna, 1993a) and some urban developmental students' performance on it. Three types of question-answer relations were identified using Pearson and Johnson's taxonomy. Students' performance was expressed in their scores on the three types of question-answer relationships so that comparison of their performance on the three types of questions could be analyzed. The largest portion of textually explicit (TE) questions reflected a stress on such basic reading skills as perceptual match and recall of details explicitly cued in the language of the text. Textually implicit (TI) questions and scriptally implicit (SI) questions are equally divided, which measure meaning construction and prior knowledge. The students scored highest on TE questions and considerably lower on TI and SI questions, indicating a general strength in locating explicitly cued text information and a common weakness in sense making and prior knowledge. Further analysis of each type of question yielded detailed information of some instructional value. The students' performance on TE questions indicated the effect of cued text expressed in different sentence structures and located in different positions relative to answers. Their performance on TI questions suggested limited vocabulary and inefficiency in understanding the author's message differently phrased. The students' performance on SI questions showed inability to read critically and a narrow knowledge base. The findings have instructional implications: these developmental students need explicit instruction in reading strategies, a broader knowledge base, and more sophisticated analytical skills.

        "author":["Paulson, Eric J."],
        "description":"The field of college developmental reading does not have a unified, agreed-upon approach to creating effective and efficient readers at the college level, as Reynolds and Werner (2003) have pointed out. For example, Keefe and Meyer (1991) assert the appropriateness of a holistic, whole-language approach for adult readers, while Bohr (2003) maintained that a constructivist approach can confuse college readers. Despite college developmental educators calling for learner-centered approaches like reader response (e.g., Chamblee, 2003), a direct instruction, skills-based approach has a solid foothold in college developmental reading programs. The influence of the latter is evident in even the most cursory glance at many college reading textbooks, which show a focus on word-level skill building, with exercises that emphasize analyzing the roots of words and defining and memorizing vocabulary items. When text excerpts longer than a paragraph are provided in these textbooks, they are often followed by discrete point questions about factual, objective aspects of the text. If we accept that to an extent, textbooks reflect the type of teaching going on in the classroom (Wood, 2003), then college developmental reading practice is often typified by a focus on word-attack strategies and discrete-skill building. In addition, college developmental reading is often seen as consisting of content-area textbook reading and study assistance--a way to \"get students through\" their other college courses. In some contexts, a focus on skill building can be beneficial for many aspects of students' academic lives given an appropriate metacognitive, strategy-construction approach. However, I propose that if we identify an important goal of developmental reading programs for college readers as providing a foundation for life-long reading, a study-skills approach to college developmental reading falls short. Instead, we must focus on encouraging and instilling in developmental reading students belief that reading has intrinsic value. It is through this approach that solid academic progress can be obtained as well.",

        "description":"Working from a cognitive perspective, a range of studies have supported the relationship between study strategies and academic performance of college students (e.g., Peverly, Brobst, Graham, &amp; Shaw, 2003). In particular, self-regulatory processes comprised of learner-directed activities geared toward promoting academic achievement have been linked to the use of study strategies and to the achievement of academic goals (Zimmerman, 2002).  Similarly, the neuropsychological construct of executive functioning describes independent and purposive behavior as comprised of skills in goal setting, planning, organizing and executing (Lezak, 1995). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of executive functioning as measured by the Executive Functioning Rating Scale (Lott &amp; Petersen, 1998) and self-regulatory processes and strategy use as measured in the LASSI (Weinstein, Palmer, &amp; Schulte, 1987). A secondary goal was to examine the relationship of executive functioning to students' perceptions of life problems. Simultaneous multiple  regression procedures indicated a good fit between the two constructs. Executive functioning was also related to students' perceptions of life problems. Implications for educators and support professionals as well as for further research are included.",

        "author":["Linderholm, Tracy"],
        "description":"In college-level courses, the vast majority of students read expository textbooks with a primary purpose in mind: to memorize and, hopefully, understand enough information to receive a particular grade on a course exam. Intuitively, this kind of reading is different than the kind of reading that these same students do when reading a novel while waiting for a friend in a coffee shop. As commonsense as this may seem, only recently has empirical evidence supported the notion that reading proceeds very differently depending on the reader's purpose for reading. To illustrate, readers have been shown to exhibit different inference-making patterns, which influence what is remembered from a text, as a function of their purpose for reading (e.g., van den Broek, Lorch, Linderholm, & Gustafson, 2001). Unfortunately, a sizeable number of students do not effectively alter their cognitive processing to meet specific educational goals. For example, many college students are used to reading in order to memorize the material, so they struggle when they are asked to generalize textbook concepts to new situations as is the case in applied courses such as educational psychology. That is, some students are reading for college courses with the incorrect purpose in mind. I wish to establish why it is important for study and reading skills instructors to consider the specific purpose for reading when advising college student readers. Thus, the focus of this paper will be to briefly review the empirical evidence that readers alter cognitive processing in accordance with the purpose for reading and to provide educational applications for this research for use by study and reading skills instructors at institutions of higher learning.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to explore the community response of how American Indian families adapt to having school age children with disabilities in two diverse American Indian communities. An ethnographic design was utilized to construct a taxonomy about family adjustment of American Indian families with disabilities. Community Assessment interviews were conducted with 143 community members in the Great Plains and Southeastern parts of the United States. A taxonomy of American Indian family adjustment to a child with disabilities was developed. American Indian families were described as adjusting to their child with disabilities in two ways: by constructive adjustment or limited adjustment. In the constructive adjustment, American Indian families believe that the child with disabilities is given to them for a reason. There is a purpose for the child being a member of the family. Because of this purpose, American Indian children with disabilities are included in everyday family activities such as going to the store, eating dinner together, attending ceremonies, going to pow wows, and going to social gatherings. These families are healthy and &quot;in harmony.&quot; In the limited adjustment, American Indian families become restricted in how they adjust to having a child with disabilities. Families may not know how to make changes within the family so that the child is cared for properly. These families may be &quot;out of harmony&quot; and need support to adjust.

Including the opportunity for movement in the activities the teacher introduces may also increase the distracted child's interest and ability to focus. The author also suggests trying to feature activities and projects that children of this age find meaningful, children are less likely to get distracted from something they are involved in or find physically challenging.",

        "author":["Hammon, Amber",

        "description":"This article discusses the story of a middle school teacher and her reading class frustrations. She faces the reality that her class of 23 students hates reading, despite her enthusiasm and attempts to motivate them. However, she discovered that the literacy program she was using was not the way she had been taught in her preservice classes or the way she wanted to teach. The current program assumed that the students were at an independent level so they needed very little encouragement to read. As a result, she spent the majority of her time in reading class dealing with disruptive students and students who refused to read or write. This article questions whether the structure of the reading class promoted failure or met the needs of the students. The authors suggest that a teacher must have some understanding of the needs of middle school students when making decisions about instructional practices. According to Irvin (1998), a teacher needs to accommodate the following needs of students: (1) the opportunity to work in groups (social needs); (2) a vehicle for connecting new information to what is already known, thus helping students to feel more confident about learning new material (cognitive and emotional needs); (3) experiences in abstract thinking that may help students move gradually from the concrete to the abstract levels of reasoning (cognitive and moral needs); (4) an opportunity to move and change activities (physical needs); (5) successful experiences, which help students feel better about themselves as learners (emotional needs); (6) motivation to learn because these strategies involve elements designed to heighten students' curiosity about the subject (emotional and cognitive needs). The authors conclude that teachers could influence their student attitudes toward reading in a positive manner by providing support and encouragement while actively engaging their students.

        "description":"As the search to increase the quality of individuals entering and remaining in the teaching profession, people are simultaneously faced with a teacher shortage, often leading to fast track certification and lateral entry programs circumventing teacher preparation. This article points out that the major predictor of teacher retention is job dissatisfaction related to a lack of materials and resources, lack of parental support, lack of administrative support, student misbehavior, time pressures, limited input into decisions, and low salaries. The author suggests three practices that may retain more good teachers longer in the profession which include: (a) increased support for teaching grounded in standards of best practice; (b) increased teacher voice and power; and (c) reconfiguring the teacher role to include more collegial professional growth within a learning community. The author concludes that listening to teacher's voices may be a better place to begin to address the teacher shortage over the long haul rather than focusing on short term, quick fix solutions.

Dana Center at the University of Texas at Austin for the U.S. Department of Education during the 2001-02 school year showed that elements of the middle school concept can lead to improved student performance, even in high-poverty schools. This article describes common elements of the middle school concept found across the study schools and discusses how the schools supported implementation of these elements. While Dickinson and Butler (2001) argued the middle school concept has experienced &quot;arrested development,&quot; the findings from the schools visited suggest that some schools are able to have success implementing elements of the middle school concept rather than the whole concept approach the authors advocate. In the seven study schools, only one school systematically implemented the middle school concept in its entirety. More commonly, these schools implemented different elements of the middle school concept at different times. What made the schools successful in this work was not that they chose to implement parts of the middle school concept but that they approached their work with care, thought, and a commitment to collaboration. Schools in this study selected areas of need to target first, adapted elements of the middle school concept to fit unique settings, and revisited their progress with these efforts.",

        "description":"Fifty years after the \"Brown\" decision, it is timely to examine whether society has supported middle level educators in creating schools where young adolescents living in poor communities do indeed attend schools that are socially just, diverse, democratic, and culturally relevant. In this article, the authors explore the significance of race and identity in the development of young adolescents and understand the impact of attending middle level schools with little or no diversity on the development of students. The authors look specifically at the demographic shifts in student population post-\"Brown\" and determine how these shifts have affected the creation of high-performing middle schools. Furthermore, they explore the issues surrounding identity development in young adolescents who attend \"de facto\" segregated middle schools. They explore ways that middle level educators in one segregated middle school are helping students develop positive self-identities and resiliency in order to be able to reach their dreams. Ultimately, their goal is to think about how to create middle schools that truly are academically excellent, developmentally responsive, and \"socially equitable\".",

Additionally, because of their frequent, recurring, and long-term contact with the young adolescents they teach, middle level teachers are in an excellent position to serve as primary agents in the identification of young adolescents who are victims of abuse and to report these cases to child protective services (CPS) as required by law. The purpose of this article is to serve as a resource for middle level educators, providing pragmatic guidelines and information to assist them in making appropriate ethical and legal decisions when working with victims of adolescent abuse and neglect. While position statements and other official documents and publications do not speak directly to the needs of abused adolescents, many teachers and other middle level educators have undoubtedly experienced the dilemma of suspected abuse in their practice. Here, the authors discuss how to identify the symptoms of abuse and neglect, and describe guidelines for reporting cases of suspected abuse. Recommendations for managing suspected student abuse and neglect are discussed.",

This article presents and discusses the three key issues for working with ELLs that can provide that starting point and provide direction for teachers. They are: (1) the amount of time required for second language acquisition; (2) the two jobs that ELLs are doing in the classroom; and (3) the use of multiple modes of input and output. Understanding these issues can assist in the search for more information on effective practices for teaching ELLs in content classrooms. Such understanding also encourages teachers to examine and integrate their current knowledge and practice into designing effective instruction for ELLs. (Contains 1 figure and 2 notes.)",

Johnson's slogan \"Relationships, Responsibility, and Results,\" which summed up what she learned from years of experience in public schools. \"Respect\" was later added to the slogan in order to support the new district-wide behavior initiative ending the use of corporal punishment and instituting a new structure for promoting self-discipline and positive student behavior. Three key resources used for creating a foundation in the middle schools were also presented: (1) \"This We Believe\" (2003) by NMSA; (2) \"The Quality School\" by Glasser (1998); and (3) Collins' (2001) bestseller, \"Good to Great\". Memphis' early success can be attributed to the core tenets in \"Good to Great\". Throughout the reform process, \"This We Believe\" and \"Quality Schools\" helped create Memphis' guiding principals and core foundation. (Contains 6 figures.)",

        "author":["Costello, Bill",

        "description":"The use of picture books as supplementary material for middle level classrooms is becoming more common. Picture books are being created specifically to address the needs and interests of middle school students. Society is becoming more visually oriented and the visual format of picture books appeals to adolescents, who today are exposed to various visual media, including television, video games, and computers. The brevity of text in picture books, while appealing to middle level students, does not indicate easier material and the readability of picture books often exceeds the age level for which they are intended due to their complexity of vocabulary and density of information. The purpose of this article is to provide essential criteria that a middle school teacher may use as a guide to self-select appropriate picture books for the content areas of language arts, social studies, science, and mathematics. General factors for consideration include a book's intensity of information, ability to meet high literary standards, and portrayal of diversity. By incorporating picture books in content area classrooms, teachers can provide a wider variety of reading material to enhance their curricula. Teachers should use the elements addressed in this article as guidelines and should consider those that are most appropriate for their purpose, and some guidelines may be applied across content areas. Four recommendations are suggested to educators who decide to employ picture books as a source of supplementary materials for their content courses. First, instructors should develop their own additional prerequisites that facilitate the achievement of specific educational objectives. Second, teachers should frequently read children's literature journals to learn about newly published picture books. Third, picture books can be incorporated in content area classrooms in numerous ways. Fourth, teachers should assess the usefulness of books presented in class so that ineffective books can be substituted with effective ones for subsequent lessons.

        "description":"Central Middle School, part of the Millard Public School District, is a grade six through eight urban school located in Omaha, Nebraska. Omaha has a metropolitan and surrounding suburban population of approximately one million. Along with approximately 800 students in traditional middle school teams, CMS also offers a Montessori mini-magnet and self-contained multi-categorical and behavior skills programs. Starting the 2005-2006 school year, an English Language Learner Program and the Millard Public Schools' Middle School Alternative Program were added. In addition to adding programs that serve students with unique learning needs, the socioeconomic and ethnic make-up of the school has shifted from a 94% white majority in 2000 to 80% in 2006. In this article, the author discusses the student advocacy program in the Millard Central Middle School. The program began by forming a committee of administrators, teachers, and parents to develop action steps for a strategic plan aimed at providing a supportive environment for middle level learners. Through group discussions and individual conferences, the teacher gets to know students on a more personal level. This one-on-one opportunity allows teachers to connect with students and provide support and encouragement. Furthermore, assessment of the program using informal feedback as well as an annual school climate survey administered to staff, parents, and students has shown that satisfaction in the school has improved. For the teachers, whose business of helping adolescents reach their dreams, failure is not an option. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This article describes an anti-bullying program with young adult literature as its  centerpiece that the authors created. It explores the nature of bullying and its emotional impact on the victims, focusing on its prevalence in schools, and then describes the comprehensive anti-bullying program instituted in grades 6 to 8 at Wood Oaks Junior High School (Northbrook, Illinois), in which young adult literature and other components are used to combat bullying. The goal was to develop a school-wide campaign against bullying that featured reading, discussion, and writing as its principal weapons. Criteria for selecting the stories were that they must contain memorable protagonists, engaging plots, and thematic material that empowered the victims of bullying. Beginning in 2000, to maximize the effect of the literature, school-wide anti-bullying events were annually scheduled. Several departments, such as social studies and foreign language classes, contributed to the program, discussing historical situations in which countries and peoples had experienced bullying, stereotyping, and prejudice and brainstorming ideas that could prevent this from occurring in the future. The principal of Wood Oaks worked with student volunteers to develop an anti-bullying code that is displayed in every classroom. It is concluded that fighting bullying through the use of excellent stories can be effective in weakening the power and presence of school bullies.",

        "description":"Throughout the early 1900s, the United States could either find technically skilled workers based upon their backgrounds or was able to train workers quickly. Farmers, military personnel, and other sources of skilled workers were available to fill the needs of the workforce. These sources of readily available skilled workers are no longer as common, and the educational system is not preparing the number of graduates seen during the 1970s and 1980s. A survey conducted by Jasinowski (2001) for the National Association of Manufacturers revealed that in 2001 more that 80 percent of manufacturers reported a shortage of qualified job candidates despite the recession in manufacturing and the economic downturn overall. Jasinowski further indicated that demographic experts predict that the industries in the US will need up to 12 million skilled workers before 2020, despite an increase in 18-24 year olds through 2015. In this article, the authors offer some insights and suggestions that will help ensure the future workforce in the United States be fully prepared to compete in the global market. They further emphasize the need for the establishment of a National Standard for industrial maintenance workers. This will help improve the processes for preparing students for the workforce and thus exposing them to industrial processes, tools, equipment, and the knowledge to enhance their skills and succeed in industry.",

        "description":"&quot;Work ethic&quot; is a cultural norm that advocates being personally accountable and responsible for the work that one does. It is based on a belief that work has intrinsic value to the individual. The concept of &quot;work ethic&quot; relates to the desirable work attitudes, values, and habits expected from employees. Positive work attitudes are attributes that are desired from every employed person, from the lowest level of employees to the CEO of the organization. This study investigated the relationships between demographic variables (i.e., gender, age, level of education, and length of full-time employment) and manufacturing employees' work attitudes as rated by their supervisors. The following questions were investigated: (1) What is the relationship between the demographic variables of gender, age, level of education, and length of full-time employment and work attitudes of information employees when their supervisors rated the employees' work attitudes?; and (2) What is the relationship between the demographic variables of gender, age, level of education, and length of full-time employment and work attitudes of noninformation employees when their supervisors rated the employees' work attitudes? Study results indicate that four characteristics of the Occupational Work Ethic Inventory (OWEI), &quot;Ambition,&quot; &quot;Teamwork,&quot; &quot;Dependability,&quot; and &quot;Self-Control&quot; are valid and reliable measures of work ethic, and that continued assessment of the existence of these work attitudes and habits in the work force will yield benchmarks to measure the strength of those characteristics, the workplace situations which seem to foster them, and the extent to which they can be taught or nurtured.

        "description":"The passage of the No Child Left Behind Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001 emphasized the growing concern in the United States that a need exists for highly qualified teachers, if children are to have a chance at succeeding in the 21st century. These pieces of legislation and philosophical change to learning have opened the door to organizations that offer national teaching certificates and educator assessment instruments. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence, Education Testing Services, National Evaluation Services, and others provide programs and services by which teachers can obtain highly-qualified status through national certification. Many national and state political and education leaders have wholeheartedly endorsed these certification programs as being the savior to American education. In this article, the author questions the integrity of these private certification firms concerning the effectiveness of teacher credentialing in hope of identifying the best teachers for student success. However, many school officials continue to support these education systems and initiatives even without significant statistical evidence that shows the programs lead to student success. The author discloses the fact behind these certification procedures and examinations used by the various states.",

The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 was born in controversy, and the passage of time has not lessened the controversy surrounding it. Initially, this act appeared to be legislation which would have little or no impact on career and technical education. Students who dropped out of school or who failed to achieve basic competencies could still expect to find gainful employment and, basically, enjoy the American dream. Many have shared beliefs that the failure was attributed to the system rather than to the students. Nonetheless, the intent of NCLB was closely tied to a desire to produce an adequate workforce of skilled laborers. This is certainly a core value which drives career and technical education (CTE) program planners. Therefore, CTE educators need to involve themselves in the drive to modify NCLB's assessment of outcomes and to define the criteria for teacher qualification. Common school and CTE educators need to participate in the clarification of the highly qualified teacher concept. Both groups must work together to create alternative assessments which can demonstrate both academic and vocational success.",

        "description":"Modular technology education (MTE) has grown considerably since the middle of the 1980s. MTE is defined as a curriculum provided by a commercial vendor in which students learn about an area of technology by: (1) participating in interactive media presentations; (2) following instructions in workbooks; (3) writing responses in student journals; and (4) experimenting and building projects. With the growth of MTE has come the decline of traditional and contemporary technology education laboratories. The problem examined by this study was the lack of data indicating the effectiveness of MTE related to student learning. MTE lacks quantitative research into the effectiveness related to the student outcomes of this teaching approach. The purpose of this study was to assess the educational effectiveness of MTE at the collegiate level by examining its relationship with student learning and outcomes. The research was intended to help school districts make educationally sound spending decisions related to the delivery of technology education. With little quantitative research into whether MTE is effective, school districts cannot make an informed decision about the future of their technology education programs. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The purpose of this study was to examine the Slovakian system of CTE within the nation's educational system and how the political, cultural, and economic conditions existing in Slovakia influence the country's CTE system. This study was an analysis of the organization of the CTE system in the Slovak Republic. CTE in Slovakia is dynamic and is undergoing changes because of the transition of a former Soviet satellite state to a democratic free-market economy. This political and economic shift over the past 15 years, coupled with changes in the global economy, the closing of inefficient industrial plants subsidized by the former communist system, and the emergence of the service sector, have changed the environment in which Slovak career and technical institutes exist. These economic conditions, combined with the need for continuing education and life-long learning experiences for experienced workers, have implications for the changes faced by United States and European industrial educators.",

Dewey described how schooling could lay the groundwork for understanding the practice and implications of producing for society's needs. He talked about the importance of technologically literate individuals and collective knowledge production in the development of thoughtful citizens capable of critical thinking. Furthermore, Dewey built his ideas on the concept that in a democracy, everyone is important and responsible to and for what is done in the name of progress. Many in technology education programs focus singularly on defining occupations as vocations related to work, or even industrial progress, rather than those activities in which individuals are engaged to construct their life and their society, which would include work. Thus, it is only by building on Dewey's notions of education through occupations that a more responsible route into the global society of the 21st century can be found.",

The CXC administers the mechanical engineering technology examination for secondary students in the Caribbean, which includes Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, Antigua/Barbuda, Belize, St. Lucia, and St. Kitts/Nevis. After conducting appropriate examinations, the CXC awards certificates to successful students. As one of the compulsory technical subjects in the Caribbean, students completing the mechanical engineering technology curriculum complete an examination once per year. A compulsory question on the engineering design component of the curriculum comprises 40% of the final score on this examination, and this compulsory design question has proven to be a continuing problem for students taking the examination. The purpose of this study was to identify teacher attitudes toward and perceptions of student performance on the design component of the CXC Mechanical Engineering Technology examination. While the overall performance of students on the CXC Mechanical Engineering Technology Examination has been favorable since the test was initiated in 1991 (76% of the candidates obtained passing grades), the candidates continue to perform poorly on the design component of the examination. These poor results on the design portion of the examination prompted an investigation to isolate teacher perceptions concerning student performance. Therefore, the problem for this study was to investigate why candidates taking the design component of the CXC Mechanical Engineering Technology Examination continued to perform poorly on the test.

        "description":"When educators, trainers, and human resource development (HRD) practitioners are asked to produce evidence that supports the productivity of the training enterprise, they are often frustrated by the lack of simple and effective methods for assessment. While administrators in an organization are likely to know exactly how much training costs, they may have little idea of its real value. This article examines several methods that have been used to assess the monetary benefits of training. Kirkpactrick's model classifies training outcomes into four levels (reaction, learning, behavior, and results) to provide a framework that explains evaluation. Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical issue for trainers and executives and it should receive more emphasis from educators than it has. Ten methods for calculating ROI are described in detail: (1) Kirkpatrick's Model; (2) Return on Investment; (3) The Time Value of Money; (4) Utility Analysis; (5) 360-Degree Appraisal Feedback; (6) Performance-Learning-Satisfaction Evaluation System (PLS); (7) The Balanced Scorecard; (8) HRD Benefit-Forecasting Model; (9) The Relative-Aggregate-Scores Approach; and (10) Unemployment Insurance (UI) Wage Studies. These approaches are being used more and more by companies to show that there is a high return on the investment made in training and development, and education should take note of this and become better at using these techniques.

Thus, implementing this technology as part of the technology education curriculum will provide students with many and varied opportunities to work with the new technology, learn about it, and become informed consumers on the introduction of this technology into society. As well, it will result in providing those interested in a career in technology with a broad range of knowledge and enable them to pursue specializing in biometrics. From an academic viewpoint, technology educators can use biometrics to inspire students into undergraduate degrees in technology. This article provides the technology educator with a primer on biometrics technology and ties the specific definitions and concepts to the International Technology Education Association (ITEA) Standards for Technological Literacy.

A survey of experienced distance learning faculty at a major eastern university was utilized for data collection. Initial survey items came from distance learning literature, as well as interviews and feedback from six faculty members experienced in televised instruction. At the request of the researchers, the university vice-president of distance learning identified a pool of experienced distance learning instructors from each of the colleges. Three faculty members from each college were then randomly selected. These 18 faculty members were contacted via an e-mail letter explaining the intent of the research and asking for their participation. Three faculty members from each of the six colleges agreed to review the duty and task statements on the survey instrument and to indicate if a task should be (a) retained as written; (b) retained with editing; or (c) deleted. All 18 participants completed and returned the survey. The majority of respondents indicated agreement regarding the tasks.

VR can range from simple environments presented on a desktop computer to fully immersive multisensory environments experienced through complex headgear and bodysuits. In all of its manifestations, VR is basically a way of simulating or replicating an environment and giving the user a sense of being there, taking control, and personally interacting with that environment with his/her own body. In this article, the author discusses the benefits of using visual technologies for teaching and learning in industrial education. Such a technology is virtual reality (VR). The capabilities and possibilities for VR technology may open doors to new vistas in industrial and technical instruction and learning, and the research that supports them. The emergence of desktop VR now makes it possible for industrial educators to add this powerful high-impact technology to their classroom instructional mix, and to build a unique research base in the field. Desktop VR may be a technology whose time has come for both research and practice in industrial education. With recent breakthroughs in technical and cost accessibility, the door to the world of virtual reality is standing wide open. For industrial teacher educators and researchers, it's only a matter of walking through. Furthermore, implications and recommendations for the use of VR technology as a  potential tool for technical and industrial training are discussed.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the student performance and student satisfaction in two courses offered by the University of Minnesota to in-service career and technical education teachers who were preparing to teach occupational programs at the high school or technical college level. The study compared the student performance and satisfaction in two WBI-enhanced classes with the performance and satisfaction in equivalent, traditional classroom versions of the same two classes. There were 22 students in the Web-base instruction (WBI) version of the methods course and 25 in the traditional version. Not all students completed the student satisfaction evaluations. To ensure that the instruction in the WBI-enhanced versions of the courses was as nearly equivalent as possible to the past traditional versions, two instructors with Ph.D.'s in education who had long histories of teaching the courses in a traditional manner, and who were interested in online instruction, re-formatted the courses for WBI. Each WBI course contained a detailed syllabus, instructional modules designed to lead students through the learning activities and related resources, project guidelines and expectations, and exercises that required students to participate in cooperative learning activities. Student satisfaction and student performance in both the WBI version and the traditional classroom version of each course were evaluated using the same criteria. The first measure addressed in the study was student satisfaction. The second measure the study addressed, student performance, was evaluated based on four different assessments used in each of the courses: two projects, a final test, and an overall final grade. The results indicated that students needed to spend an equal amount or more time on the WBI courses than on typical courses, but they did not tend to find the WBI courses more difficult. No statistically significant differences were found between the two versions of each of the courses on the student satisfaction measures. Implications, limitations, and suggestions in this study are also discussed. (Contains 7 tables.)",

Succession planning allows an organization to prepare for the absence, departure, death, retirement, or termination of an individual. It provides for continuity of culture and the evolution of necessary skills for an organization. For the National Association of Industrial and Technical Teachers Educators (NAITTE) as an environment consist of professionals, it is critical to ensure that the leadership possesses the desirable and appropriate \"genetic bits\" of both the needed skills and cultural norms that are positive to the stakeholders. In this article, the author explores the concept of applying the integrated task analysis and culture analysis modeled in the HRSP as an effective means of selecting the appropriate internal and external successor. Furthermore, the author proposes that it would be appropriate for the NAITTE organization to employ this process. Effective HRSP reduces turnover and increases the useful longevity of both leaders and other employees in organizations. This process addresses selecting individuals for future succession as well as maintaining current human resources and developing their future roles within the organization, whether these be educators, trainers, technologists, leaders, or managers.

A sample of all technology teacher education faculty members were asked to respond to a questionnaire consisted of open-ended free-response and Likert-type questions designed to elicit responses concerning the level of support for the content and professional development standards as well as responses concerning the current state and future roles of technology teacher education. Findings suggest that many technology teacher education programs are resisting curricular change due to a lack of support among departmental faculty members and the presence of more traditional laboratories and technical courses. While the data indicate that most respondents recognize the shortcomings of their respective programs, it is less clear whether these respondents are preparing to address those shortcomings. The author concludes, that technology teacher education programs have undergone substantial curricular and programmatic changes in recent years and have done so in response to the \"Standards for technological literacy\". While disagreement abounds as to the curriculum that should be implemented to reach the destination, almost all respondents agreed that the \"Standards for technological literacy\" are a worthy target for technology teacher education.

This assessment can help in planning the curriculum and in selecting appropriate instructional methods. Thus, research is needed to determine if there is a link between students' learning styles and their cognitive abilities such as spatial visualization. This article presents a study which determines whether novice drafters' ability to visualize three-dimensional objects and identify two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects were influenced by basic drafting instructional methods or the students' learning styles. The objectives of the study were to: (1) Compare novice drafters' spatial visualization ability with the methods of drafting instruction they received; (2) Compare novice drafters' spatial visualization ability with their preferred learning styles; (3) Compare novice drafters' spatial visualization ability with their prior instruction or experiences in drafting and/or art; and (4) Verify whether novice drafters' perceptual modality learning styles changed from pretest to postest. Study results showed a considerable difference in novice drafters' spatial visualization ability scores results when modality learning styles were addressed as part of the instructional process. The results also suggested that enrollment in prior CAD courses was not effective in developing novice drafters' spatial visualization ability. (Contains 7 tables.)",

The Subject Matter Expert (SME) COMlist is proposed as a tool that enables instructional developers to evaluate an SME's capability and suitability to support curriculum development. The COMlist provides a spreadsheet-based, single-entry scoring system that automatically calculates individual scores on six factors, provides an overall SME score, and generates a profile that illustrates an SME's strengths and weaknesses. The value of the SME COMlist is based on its simplicity of design, ease of use, and usefulness in selecting SMEs who can competently support curriculum development. This study argues that technical expertise is essential but not sufficient for providing the best support. The problem investigated here is the identification of an SME's personal and professional qualities that will provide the instructional developer the most efficient and effective support to the knowledge extraction process and subsequent revision and finalizing of the technical material.

The key that opens the door to that pathway is the verification of subject mastery via: (1) documentation of a learning period in the occupation; (2) documentation of related paid work experience beyond the learning period; and (3) successful completion of an occupational competency examination. For many years, those examinations were developed by personnel of the universities engaged in vocational teacher preparation under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Department of Education and a policy committee, the Pennsylvania Occupational Competency Assessment Consortium. The decision to deny or grant admission to a vocational teacher candidate rested upon a norm-referenced cut score. However, there has been an on-going problem with the traditional approach of setting cut scores for use by personnel of the Pennsylvania Department of Education in the certification of secondary-level vocational instructors. This article provides a discussion of a follow-up study, based upon the Walter and Kapes pilot study, which was conducted to extend the initial investigation of the viability of an alternate methodology for establishing cut scores for occupational competency examinations.

Two sample groups were utilized in this study, one PLTW teachers and the other non-PLTW teachers. In this study, a survey technique was used to ascertain the perceptions of Indiana's technology education teachers. The results of this study indicated that Indiana technology education teachers have embraced pre-engineering education, and that both PLTW teachers and non-PLTW teachers view pre-engineering education as a valuable component of technology education.

        "description":"Although there have been numerous changes within the workplace during the past century, employers continue to search for employees with a strong work ethic. Employers often cite a strong work ethic as the most desired characteristic in a new employee. Work ethic can be described as a set of characteristics and attitudes in which an individual worker assigns importance and merit to work. Those with a strong work ethic place a positive value on doing a good job and describe work as having an intrinsic value of its own. Employers seek employees who are dependable, have good interpersonal skills, and demonstrate initiative. Prior research has associated these characteristics with a high level of work ethic. Employers value a strong work ethic because of the economic benefits it provides to business. Businesses with employees who are committed to work have a market advantage. Furthermore, when a new hire does not have sufficient commitment to work and lacks dependability, interpersonal skills, or initiative the organization is at risk of losing productivity and profits. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in work ethic as measured by the Occupational Work Ethic Inventory (OWEI) for respondent jobseekers grouped by employment status, age, and gender of jobseekers. Levels of the first independent variable, employment status, were (a) unemployed (both long and short term), (b) employed full-time, and (c) employed part-time. The second independent variable, age, included groupings for (a) 16-29 year olds, (b) 30-39 year olds, (c) 40-49 year olds, and (d) those 50 years old and older. The dependent variable was work ethic, operationally characterized by (a) dependability, (b) interpersonal skills, and (c) initiative. This study addressed the work ethic beliefs of unemployed workers in order to contribute information to the field of workforce education. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Trade and industrial (T&I) teachers enter the classroom as content level experts who may have acquired their content expertise through a combination of formal industry training and informal on-the-job experiences. When they make the career transition from industry to teaching, they must acquire professional teaching competencies. Like the content competencies, these teaching competencies may also involve both formal and informal learning experiences, particularly because the majority of T&I teachers are employed by schools and begin teaching while simultaneously attending alternative teacher preparation programs. For new T&I teachers, formal teacher training in the area of pedagogy before entering the school workplace is the exception rather than the norm. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, this study aims to add to the body of research in informal learning by focusing on the school workplace rather than the corporate workplace. Secondly, this study builds on an exploratory study which discovered that informal workplace learning takes place with novice T&I teachers. The current study was designed to learn more about which teaching competencies new T&I teachers learn formally versus which they learn informally, and the relationship of the learning method to the teachers' perceived proficiency in core teaching competencies.

Over 1000 technology education departments are now including pre-engineering education in their programs. According to these authors, the time has come for the profession to agree that including pre-engineering education in technology education programs will benefit everyone. Technology education can benefit from the inclusion of pre-engineering education by increasing students' technological literacy, promoting increased academic rigor and relevance, and eliminating the view that technology education is unessential in school curriculums. The authors discuss the focus of technology education and the benefits of inclusion of pre-engineering education. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Each January, a meeting of the National School Reform Faculty (NSRF) enables educators to hone skills and deepen conversations they have experienced in coaches' seminars sponsored by NSRF Critical Friends Groups (CFGs). In this article, the author details that they use highly structured protocols to examine examples of their students' work and their own \"teacher\" work, e.g., lesson plans, assignments, and assessments. They discuss how all members of a CFG must commit themselves to other members' success as much as to their own; how their commitment cannot be the responsibility of the coach alone; and how the process creates a model of a functioning learning community. At the end of a recent meeting, the members of their group were enthusiastic, but also anxious. In this article, the author recalls sitting on the piano bench helping his six-year-old son with his piano lessons. For him, the episode on the piano bench symbolizes the hard work undertaken in their seminar groups. Much as his son accepted the challenges of piano lessons and his coaching, similar challenges had transformed them: the possibility of transformation proved to be the key to addressing  anxieties about taking the new learning home.

Each role has convinced her that racism and other forms of bias are the greatest barriers that everyone faces in making a positive transformation in educational experiences, especially when they involve poor, inner-city kids of color. She calls herself an \"inside-outsider\" because she is an insider (an educator working in schools) and also an outsider (a guest facilitator in schools where she formerly taught).  As a white teacher she is likewise a cultural outsider in schools where children of color predominate. Here, she talks about Jacqueline Jordan Irvine's \"Educating Teachers for Diversity: Seeing with a Cultural Eye\" which suggests that everyone can work to see with a \"third eye\"--an eye that \"sees a different picture and examines alternative explanations.\" She also considers reflective questions from Nancy Mohr and Linda Christensen's \"Reading, Writing and Rising Up\" would be helpful in developing the lens of her \"third eye.\"",

        "description":"In this article, the authors talk about the state of boyhood in education and explain the idea that not all elements of the brain--especially not gender--are plastic. They discuss the mismatch between boys and conventional education and how gender \"really\" happens in the brain and describe the three biological stages in which human nature hardwires gender into the brains. The first stage has been clarified by genetics research, the second by endocrinological research, and the third by psychological research. They argue that the current educational system often fails to accommodate the hardwiring of boys' brains and does not provide them with an appropriate system of learning. In an effort to help boys learn naturally, they urge adults to protect the minds of boys by working toward two goals: (a) expression and development of the natural self of the child; and (b) compensation for areas of inherent disadvantage or fragility.

They present the overall current statistics and common observations about gender gaps in schools. To mention a few, boys are becoming the second sex; girls are taking over the K-12 system; and girls constitute 57 percent of college undergraduates. Here, the authors examine the factors considered as the multifaceted causes of gender discrepancies, such as, (a) society's perceptions of boys; (b) educational expectations; (c) new state and federal testing policies; (d) school climate; (e) psychological and emotional differences; and (f) brain-based and biological differences.

The study utilized qualitative and quantitative methodology to gather information about incarcerated youth and their responses to young adult literature. The results of this study indicate that artistic response is another vehicle incarcerated male youth may use when responding to young adult literature. The findings did show that artistic response coupled with interviews provided a forum for youths to understand young-adult literature while they enjoyed an aesthetic activity. The youths also learned about themselves, including concerns and attitudes surrounding their situations.

        "description":"The aim of many educators is to help youth reach their maximum potential. The Clifton Youth StrengthsExplorer gives teachers a tool to help identify the talents of their students, as well as actionable suggestions for utilizing those talents. Such information can help teachers to individualize the ways in which they respond to youths, and the manner in which they can teach most effectively. In addition, it provides teachers and parents a common language, goals, and sets of action, all based on the unique talents of youth. The Gallup Organization, best known for its polls, has been involved in the measurement of human talents for several decades. Under the leadership of educational psychologist Donald O. Clifton, Gallup developed the Clifton StrengthsFinder, a Web-based talent assessment for adults. This article presents the goals of the StrengthsExplorer, which are as follows: (1) help youths identify their positive characteristics; (2) help youths improve their understanding of self; (3) help youths develop from their areas of greatest talent; (4) improve parents'/instructors' understanding of their children/students; (5) provide an opportunity for an important kind of communication between parents and their children (i.e., discussion of one's unique nature, the positive characteristics/gifts that one has, and how those can be developed); and (6) provide the theme-based language that youths and parents/ instructors could use to discover and describe positive characteristics. Among other things discussed in this article are the themes as to how the assessment measures talent, such as: (1) presence; (2) confidence; (3) competing; (4) relating; (5) achieving; (6) future thinker; (7) caring; (8) discoverer; (9) organizer; and (10) dependability.",

Although dozens of studies published in the past five years have demonstrated dramatic sex differences in autonomic function, the educational literature has not emphasized those studies and their potential significance for education.

The author explains that single-sex education cannot only improve grades and test scores but it can broaden educational prospects for both girls and boys. The author believes that it is a paradox: coed schools tend to reinforce gender stereotypes, while single-sex schools can break down gender stereotypes. (Contains 17 notes.)",

These reformers envisioned schools that were to be tuition free and open to everyone, places where rich and poor met and learned together on equal terms. Central to the concept of the common school is its symbiotic relationship with the community in which it is located. Common schools were funded and maintained by community residents who took great interest in their progress and pride in their accomplishments. Today, curriculum is controlled by the state and a school's effectiveness is measured according to criteria established by the federal government. Uniform testing and reporting requirements have turned superintendents and boards into little more than intermediaries between schools and enforcement agencies. Local control, once considered an indefeasible right, has suddenly vanished. The demise of the ideal of the common school is evident in the proliferation of specialized charter schools; in legislative support for vouchers and private school reimbursements; in the burgeoning businesses ministering to home schoolers; in the empty classrooms and broken windows of neighborhood schools. Common schools once stood for equal opportunity, community, and pluralism, yet American education has become selective, specialized, and caste conscious.",

        "description":"The author is an associate professor of animal studies at Colorado State University, but experienced learning difficulties in high school due to her place on the autism-Asperger's spectrum. She had uneven skills, and while algebra was impossible, she did well in courses in which she could use her visual-thinking and associative-thinking skills. Her visual thinking skills enabled her to excel at her chosen career of designing livestock equipment. The author describes how visual thinkers like her are good at hands-on work. While she finds mathematical word problems to be difficult, she can conceptualize research experiments only if she has a concrete example such as a weight gain and different breeds of cattle. She cannot think about experimental designs in the abstract. Her success in her career ensued not because she &quot;overcame a math deficit,&quot; but because she developed her area of strength -- visualization. There are three basic thinking types: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, and word specialists, and these thinking styles also occur in individuals with dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning problems. An autism researcher found that autistic children have difficulty making up new categories for objects. However, flexibility of thinking can be taught.  The author expresses concern when courses in music, woodshop, auto mechanics, and elective classes are no longer offered because these are the types of courses in which many students with uneven skills will excel and make themselves employable in good jobs. One size does not fit all, and different people have different types of thinking. The really good teachers try different methods and use the one that works for a particular child.",

        "description":"In this article, the author relates how a math-assessment software has allowed his school to track the academic progress of its students. The author relates that in the first year that the software was deployed, schoolwide averages in terms of national standing on the math ITBS rose from the 42nd to 59th percentile. In addition, a significant number of students became grade jumpers after the software had been installed. Because of the positive effects brought about by the software, the author concludes that the computer, the massive accumulation of performance data, and the descriptive power of standardized testing are among his most powerful allies as a teacher.",

        "description":"This article examines the explanations behind these questions: (1) Why do American teenagers behave the way they do?; (2) Why are many obsessed with the brands of clothes they wear, their lunchtime seatmates, the parties they are invited to, the latest popular music, the intrigues of school cliques, and who is hooking up with whom?; (3) Why do students in some schools rigidly segregate themselves by race and ethnicity and yet get along amicably?; (4) What causes castelike divisions?; and (5) Why are teenagers often mean and even cruel to one another? Studies reveal that answers to these questions has relatively little to do with family values, liberalism, progressive education, or what teachers do or don't do. Rather, teenager behavior is difficult because adults, especially parents and businesses, benefit from the present ways of organizing young people's lives. This article examines how peer status, consumerism; and educational reform influence teenage behavior.",

The classroom community can profoundly influence how students respond to these questions--with love, denial, apathy, or even violence. When students work together, they learn that grace, love, and profound gratitude can meet any challenge--even wrenching conflict, prejudice, or death. Creating authentic community is the first step in the soul of education. In this article, the author provides strategies on how teachers can integrate heart, spirit, and community with strong academics into their classroom. (Contains 3 notes.)",

Hovering parents are always on hand for every landmark moment of their children while dry cleaner parents show up only when an emergency is imminent. In this article, the author relates her own difficulties in dealing with dry cleaner parents. She relates how this type of parents are often the most abusive towards her and they tend to transfer the responsibilities of rearing their own children to the teachers.

Now that most schools in New Orleans have been obliterated, the author has fears about the future of public schools. She fears that the trend towards charter schools will further erode the ideal of all children learning together under one roof with equal chances for success.

        "description":"The U.S. public has consistently favored standardized testing in the schools, preferably with consequences (or &quot;stakes&quot;) riding on the results, ever since the first polls taken on the topic several decades ago. Results from different polls approaching the topic in different ways suggest that nearly all Americans would like to see high-stakes tests administered at least once at every grade level. With only a few exceptions, U.S. educational testing programs fall short of what the public wants, and short of what most industrialized countries have. The best testing regimes, such as one finds in many European and Asian countries, capture those benefits through multi-level and multi-target systems. This article discusses how an effective student testing system captures the complete benefits of standardized testing for all students. These benefits include: (1) &quot;Information&quot; that can be used for diagnosis; (2) &quot;Efficiencies&quot; from alignment, when the tests are matched to curricular standards and teachers teach those standards; and (3) &quot;Motivation&quot; to study and attain goals.

The problem is particularly severe in high-stakes situations. This essay provides a context for understanding standardized achievement testing, then presents and discusses threats to validity, many of which are currently unaddressed. The public and several constituencies support standardized achievement testing. Many educators, however, especially educators in testing, have argued consistently that test-score interpretations and uses are inadequately validated. Standardized achievement test scores provide one valid source of information about student learning if they corroborate other information about student learning. Unfortunately, so many factors undermine the validity of test scores that we should be very careful in the way we interpret and use them.",

        "description":"Tests of academic progress such as those enforced by No Child Left Behind Act are the only practical way to hold schools accountable for educating all children and are therefore essential to the twin aims of quality and fairness. Many of the complaints against the No Child Left Behind law pertain to the supposedly harmful influence of intensive preparation for the standardized reading tests. These objections seem justified only because there is a lack of fit between the kind of education that promotes significant progress in reading and the kind of education that the schools have currently devised in their unsuccessful attempts to raise scores on reading tests. In this article, the author outlines some of facts about reading tests that are not widely known yet but are needed to be familiarized by parents, teachers, and citizens who are interested in educational improvement. The author shows how standardized reading tests can foster a rich and formative education that meets the requirements of adequate yearly progress for all groups with flying colors.

        "description":"Code switching includes the use of complete sentences, phrases, and borrowed words from another language (Brice & Brice, 2000). It is a common linguistic phenomenon noted among bilingual populations. In order to code switch effectively, students must possess a high level of understanding of the 2 cultures, as well as a deep understanding of the underlying structures and purposes of 2 language systems. Code switching, rather than reflecting the traditional view of a disadvantaged and semiliterate background, actually reflects an intellectual advantage. However, code switching has not commonly been perceived as a positive trait by schools, teachers, or the majority culture. Assessments for nomination and identification of giftedness have traditionally been either single-language oriented or use concepts and behaviors that are reflective of the majority culture. This article explores some of the aspects of code switching and possible resultant behaviors of bilingual children who are gifted. (Contains 1 table.)",

Regardless of gender, gifted students had higher scores on adaptability but lower scores on stress management and impulse control ability compared to the normative sample. On moral judgment, gifted students were comparable to the level of individuals with master's or professional degrees, and they showed an above-average level of leadership compared to the normative sample.

Although much of this literature is prescriptive, some research reports spanning this time period are available. A perusal of research on TPD's applicability to gifted individuals indicates that the focus has been Dabrowski's notion of overexcitability (OE). This article reviews OE research, contrasts it with Dabrowski's approach to research with gifted individuals, and argues that researchers should emulate Dabrowski's approach in future investigations.",

Four major variables are identified that directly impact prevalence estimates: (a) the type of definition endorsed--disjunctive or conjunctive, (b) the number of abilities/characteristics included, (c) the minimum selection threshold chosen, and (d) the correlations observed between the abilities included. A range of values was determined for the last three variables. By combining these values, we produced four tables of prevalence estimates, which reveal how these variables interact and how they affect the \"how many\" question. The results show that both the type of definition endorsed for the giftedness or talent concepts and the selection ratio have a crucial impact on the prevalence estimates. The authors argue that gifted education will never be recognized as a proper scientific field unless its scholars reach a consensus on both the definition and prevalence issues.

Teachers rated more highly the children whose test scores were more consistently in the gifted range, but more than half of the children were underestimated by at least 1 teacher, especially where nonverbal ability was higher than verbal ability. Strengths in reading were more readily recognized than strengths in spelling and mathematics.

Testing, grades, and pacing overshadow the essential role of creativity involved in doing mathematics. Talent development requires creative applications in the exploration of mathematics problems. Traditional teaching methods involving demonstration and practice using closed problems with predetermined answers insufficiently prepare students in mathematics. Students leave school with adequate computational skills but lack the ability to apply these skills in meaningful ways. Teaching mathematics without providing for creativity denies all students, especially gifted and talented students, the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of mathematics and fails to provide the gifted student an opportunity to fully develop his or her talents.

Three patterns of responding emerged: persistent preference for choice (3 participants); initial preference for choice, which did not persist (2 participants); and preference for no choice (1 participant). Additional evaluations determined if preference for choice could be enhanced (Study 2) or established (Study 3) by including more stimuli from which to choose. Choice-link selections systematically increased for all participants when more items were available from which to choose. Study 4 identified the precise value of the opportunity to choose by progressively increasing the response requirement during the choice terminal links for 3 children and determining the point at which these children stopped selecting the choice link. All children continued to select the choice link even when the work required in the choice link was much greater than that arranged in the no-choice link. (Contains 1 table and 5 figures.)",

The victims of child abduction face the threat of physical and emotional injury, sexual abuse, and death. Previous research has shown that behavioral skills training (BST) is effective in teaching children abduction-prevention skills, although not all children learn the skills. This study compared BST only to BST with an added in situ training component to teach abduction-prevention skills in a small-group format to schoolchildren. Results showed that both programs were effective in teaching abduction-prevention skills. In addition, the scores for the group that received in situ training were significantly higher than scores for the group that received BST alone at the 3-month follow-up assessment.

We examined the effectiveness of interteaching relative to a traditional form of classroom instruction--the lecture. In Study 1, participants in a graduate course in special education took short quizzes after alternating conditions of interteaching and lecture. Quiz scores following interteaching were higher than quiz scores following lecture, although both methods improved performance relative to pretest measures. In Study 2, we also alternated interteaching and lecture but counterbalanced the conditions across two sections of an undergraduate research methods class. After each unit of information, participants from both sections took the same test. Again, test scores following interteaching were higher than test scores following lecture. In addition, students correctly answered more interteaching-based questions than lecture-based questions on a cumulative final test. In both studies, the majority of students reported a preference for interteaching relative to traditional lecture. In sum, the results suggest that interteaching may be an effective alternative to traditional lecture-based methods of instruction. (Contains 3 figures, 2 tables, and 1 footnote.)",

Most researchers have attributed the effectiveness of performance feedback to (a) its discriminative functions, (b) its reinforcing functions, or (c) the combination of the two. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the relative contributions of the discriminative and reinforcing functions of performance feedback by comparing a condition in which the discriminative functions were maximized and the reinforcing functions were minimized (i.e., performance-specific instructions without contingent money) with one in which the reinforcing functions were maximized and the discriminative functions were minimized (i.e., contingent money with no performance-specific instructions). We compared the effects of these two conditions on the acquisition of skills involved in conducting two commonly used preference assessments. Results showed that acquisition of these skills occurred primarily in the condition with performance-specific instruction without contingent money, suggesting that the delivery of performance-specific instructions was critical to skill acquisition, whereas the delivery of contingent money had little effect.

An observation system was developed that incorporated measurement of evidence-based compliance strategies and included the types of instructions delivered (e.g., integral or deficient directives, embedded directives, \"do\" or \"don't\" commands), the children's behavior with respect to the instructions (e.g., compliance, noncompliance, active avoidance, problem behavior), and the differential responses of the teacher to the child's behavior following an instruction (e.g., appropriate or inappropriate provision of attention and escape). After 4 classroom teachers were observed at least five times in each of five target activities, simple and conditional probabilities were calculated. Results indicated that (a) the frequency of instruction and probability of compliance varied as a function of activity type, (b) \"do\" commands and directive prompts were delivered almost to the exclusion of \"don't\" commands and nondirective prompts, (c) the likelihood of compliance was highest following an embedded or an integral directive prompt, and (d) although putative social reinforcers were more likely to follow noncompliance than compliance and were highly likely following problem behavior, compliance occurred over twice as much as noncompliance, and problem behavior during instructions was very low. Implications for using descriptive assessments for understanding and improving teacher-child interactions in the preschool classroom are discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

Early behavioral research indicated that skills needed in natural environments could also be trained in simulated settings. We compared job-site plus simulation training for teaching job skills to supported workers with autism to provision of training exclusively on the job. Job-site training occurred in a small publishing company during the regular work routine, and simulation training occurred in an adult education site for people with severe disabilities. Two pairs of workers received training on two job skills; one skill was trained at the job site and the other was trained using job-site plus simulation training. Results indicated that for 3 of the 4 comparisons, job-site plus simulation training resulted in a higher level of skill or more rapid skill acquisition than did job-site-only training. Results suggested that job-site training, the assumed best practice for teaching vocational skills, is likely to be more effective if supplemented with simulation training. Directions for future research include expanding applications of behavioral technologies to other aspects of the current support paradigm. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Thirty boys participated in the study. Fifteen of the children had been rated by their parents as hyperactive and inattentive, and 15 were age- and gender-matched controls in the same classroom. The children were observed in the classroom for three consecutive mornings, and data were collected on their activity levels and attention. The CTSC consisted of two tasks. In the delay condition, children chose to receive three rewards after a delay of 60 s or one reward immediately. In the task-difficulty condition, the children chose to complete a difficult math problem and receive three rewards or complete an easier problem for one reward. The children with ADHD features made more impulsive choices than their peers during both conditions, and these choices correlated with measures of their activity and attention in the classroom.

Within a multiple baseline design across subjects, 5 children, ages 4 to 7 years, were provided with temporary escape from dental treatment on a fixed-time schedule. The intervals were signaled by an electronic timer worn by the dentist. Clinically significant reductions were observed in physically disruptive behavior across all 5 children with the introduction of noncontingent escape, and verbally disruptive behavior was markedly reduced in 4 of the 5 children. In addition, the dental staff's use of physical restraint was reduced to near zero across all 5 children. The research extends the literature in both clinical dentistry and in applied behavior analysis by demonstrating that a dentist can easily and effectively implement noncontingent reinforcement to produce clinically significant and socially important changes in children's health behavior.

The arousal assessments involved measuring change in penile circumference to various categories of stimuli both appropriate (adult men and women) and inappropriate (e.g., 8- to 9-year-old boys and girls). This approach extends the existing assessment literature by the use of repeated measurement and single-subject experimental design. Data from these assessments were analyzed to determine if clear and informative outcomes were obtained. Overall, three general patterns of results emerged. Some participants showed differentiated deviant arousal or higher levels of arousal to specific inappropriate stimuli (\"deviant\" is a term used in the existing sex-offender literature to describe this type of arousal). Other participants showed undifferentiated deviant arousal, in which case they showed nonspecific arousal to inappropriate stimuli. The remaining participants showed no arousal to inappropriate stimuli but did show arousal to appropriate stimuli. Implications for assessment, treatment, and future directions are discussed.

We extended this work by conducting periodic assessments of preference for leisure activities over 3 to 6 months with 10 adults with developmental disabilities. Although previous research has collectively shown that preferences identified via repeated assessment are highly variable, our results showed that preferences were relatively stable for the majority (80%) of participants. In an attempt to identify some environmental determinants of shifts in preference, we provided extended daily access to high-preference items (preference-weakening manipulation) and paired access to low-preference items with social and edible putative reinforcers during brief sessions (preference-strengthening manipulation). Preference assessments continued over the course of these manipulations with 2 participants. Results showed that changes in preference across time could be produced systematically and suggest that naturally occurring changes in establishing operations or conditioning histories contribute to temporal shifts in preference. Implications for preference assessments, reinforcer usage, and planned attempts to change preferences are discussed. (Contains 1 table an 4 figures.)",

To promote frequent and accurate use of parents' names by teachers, the effects of a fully automated computerized assessment and programmed instruction (CAPI) intervention were evaluated in a multiple baseline design. The CAPI intervention involved assessment and training of relations among parents' and children's pictures and names, and produced rapid learning of parent names. The CAPI intervention also resulted in substantial improvements in the classroom use of parents' names for 3 of the 4 teachers; however, a supervisor-mediated feedback package (consisting of instructions, differential reinforcement, and error correction) was necessary to maintain name use for 2 of those teachers.

In initial tests, children emitted tacts only when the action was presented with the verbal antecedent. Thereafter, they learned to tact an action without the verbal antecedent and received tests to evaluate generalization to another action. Results indicated that in order to obtain generalization of tacting actions, it was necessary to learn to tact other actions without the verbal antecedent as well as learning to tact the action with the verbal antecedent. These findings have relevance for generalization of tacting actions from control by verbal antecedents to natural conditions and the production of spontaneous language. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"A mathematical model of operant choice, the generalized matching law was used to analyze play-calling data from the 2004 National Football League season. In all analyses, the relative ratio of passing to rushing plays was examined as a function of the relative ratio of reinforcement, defined as yards gained, from passing versus rushing. Different analyses focused on season-aggregate data for the league as a whole, game-by-game data for the league as a whole, and game-by-game data for individual teams. In all analyses except those for a few individual teams, the generalized matching law accounted for a majority of variance in play calling. The typical play-calling pattern reflected undermatching (suggesting imperfect sensitivity of play calling to yardage-gained reinforcers) and a bias for calling rushing plays. Bias was found to be a function of both the relative risk of turnovers and the relative variability in yards gained associated with passing versus rushing plays. The external validity of the matching analyses was supported by significant correlations between parameters of the generalized matching law and team success on offense and season winning percentage. These results illustrate the broad applicability of the generalized matching law to problems outside of the laboratory. (Contains 3 tables and 6 figures.)",

Next, they participated in a computer-interactive matching-to-sample procedure that trained formula-to-formula and formula-to-graph relations. Then, they were exposed to 40 novel formula-to-graph tests and 10 novel graph-to-formula tests. Seven of the 8 participants showed substantial improvement in identifying formula-to-graph relations; however, in the test of novel graph-to-formula relations, participants tended to select equations in their factored form. Next, we manipulated contextual cues in the form of rules regarding mathematical preferences. First, we informed participants that standard forms of equations were preferred over factored forms. In a subsequent test of 10 additional novel graph-to-formula relations, participants shifted their selections to favor equations in their standard form. This reference reversed during 10 more tests when financial reward was made contingent on correct identification of formulas in factored form. Formula preferences and transformation of novel mathematical and stimulus functions are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 9 figures.)",

A conditional discrimination procedure was then used to teach the contextual cues representing the arbitrary relations of \"greater than\" and \"less than.\" Following contextual cue training, participants were reexposed to the concurrent slot-machine task. After training of the contextual cues, a higher proportion of responses were made to the slot machine that shared formal properties (i.e., color) with the contextual cue representing \"greater than.\" (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Behavior analysis has been at the forefront in establishing effective treatments for children and adults with chronic tic disorders. As is customary in behavior analysis, the efficacy of these treatments has been established using direct-observation assessment methods. Although behavior-analytic treatments have enjoyed acceptance and integration into mainstream health care practices for tic disorders (e.g., psychiatry and neurology), the use of direct observation as a primary assessment tool has been neglected in favor of less objective methods. Hesitation to use direct observation appears to stem largely from concerns about the generalizability of clinic observations to other settings (e.g., home) and a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate and feasible techniques for conducting and scoring direct observation. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate and establish a reliable, valid, and feasible direct-observation protocol capable of being transported to research and clinical settings. A total of 43 children with tic disorders, collected from two outpatient specialty clinics, were assessed using direct (videotape samples) and indirect (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; YGTSS) methods. Videotaped observation samples were collected across 3 consecutive weeks and two different settings (clinic and home), were scored using both exact frequency counts and partial-interval coding, and were compared to data from a common indirect measure of tic severity (the YGTSS). In addition, various lengths of videotaped segments were scored to determine the optimal observation length. Results show that (a) clinic-based observations correspond well to home-based observations, (b) brief direct-observation segments scored with time-sampling methods reliably quantified tics, and (c) indirect methods did not consistently correspond with the direct methods.

Three elementary-aged students with a variety of emotional and behavioral problems participated in the study. Initial functional assessments indicated that social attention was the maintaining reinforcer for their verbally disruptive behavior. Baseline phases were alternated with phases in which attention was provided on fixed-time schedules in the context of an ABAB design. The results indicated that the provision of attention on fixed-time schedules substantially reduced the participants' rate of verbal disruptions. These decreases were maintained during initial thinning of the schedules.

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of and children's preferences for multiple schedules in which (a) two different stimuli, one correlated with reinforcement (S+) and another correlated with extinction (S-), were presented; (b) only an S+ was presented (i.e., no stimulus was correlated with extinction), and (c) neither an S+ nor an S- was presented (i.e., a mixed schedule). S+/S- and S+ arrangements were similarly effective for 7 children, but 3 preferred the S+/S- condition and 4 preferred the S+ condition. Correlational analyses suggested that children who responded more effectively given the S- (discrimination indexes were relatively high) preferred the S+/S- condition, whereas children who responded less effectively given the S- preferred the S+ condition. The implications of these findings for arranging multiple schedules for social responses are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

Females scored higher on emotional and sensual overexcitability (OE), and males scored higher on intellectual, imaginational, and psychomotor OE. When examined by orientation within gender, however, nonheterosexual females scored higher than heterosexual females in psychomotor, significantly higher in intellectual, slightly higher in sensual, and slightly lower in emotional and imaginational OE. Heterosexual males scored significantly higher than nonheterosexual males in psychomotor, higher in sensual, slightly higher in imaginational, lower in intellectual, and slightly lower in emotional OE. Each population appears to be unique, and sexual diversity is one factor that seems to have a significant effect on the lives of gifted students. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Research has established that gifted children often develop deep sensitivities to world issues and injustices at an early age (Piechowski, 1997; Silverman, 1993). Once provided with information, they become more intensely interested in and concerned with current environmental problems (Clark, 1992; Cullingford, 1996). Although ecology is usually part of the secondary public school curriculum, the subject is often taught in rote fashion (deBettencourt & McCrea, 2000). This article discusses why and how the moral development and affective needs of gifted students at the secondary level could be more appropriately addressed through a holistic approach to environmental studies and suggests some additional strategies that allow gifted students to advance their interest in ecological issues despite--or in deference to--the scheduling constraints imposed by the regular curriculum.

The use of this model in teaching is illustrated through a physics lesson of moire patterns using overlapping patterns found in our everyday life.

To differentiate between these separate although related models for serving students in a large Pacific coast state's public school setting, this study included the structural equations modeling technique Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Within the statistical model examined, student achievement on the API scores served as the dependent variable and student diversity as operationalized by using the number of students receiving free or reduced meals as the proxy for economic status was always included as a covariate.

Seventy-six students in a university learning support services program at a large Northeastern university participated in this two day study. On day one, participants viewed eight versions of an approximately 250-word passage simultaneously, each with a different combination of font size, margin width, and heading, and were asked to make a judgment about their self-efficacy for reading each. On day two, a few weeks later, the participants read and answered questions based on two passage formats, one that reflected their highest self-efficacy rated format and the other their lowest. A dependent samples t-test revealed that comprehension scores for the highest self-efficacy rated format were significantly higher than for the lowest self-efficacy rated format. In addition, a 2 x 2 x 2 randomized block factorial analysis indicated significant main effects for the presence of headings and the 12-point font condition, but not for margin width. We then make suggestions about how college faculty can offset students' negative self-efficacy for reading college material. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

However, research shows that the implementation of teaching mathematics thematically has not been widely adopted. In the present study, instructional, curricula and organisational factors that teachers perceive as obstacles to the implementation of a thematic approach to teaching mathematics were explored. Findings from interviews with 10 secondary mathematics teachers who were implementing a curriculum requiring a thematic instructional approach are reported. The findings of the study extend the literature concerning teachers' beliefs and practices in the teaching of mathematics, and broaden understandings of the issues surrounding the implementation of a thematically taught mathematics curriculum.

Our analyses show the co-existence of different models for both the interpretation and the use of classroom social norms and socio-mathematical norms. Valorising some behaviours over others appears as part of the discursive practices of mathematics classrooms. Local and immigrant students are not expected to behave in the same way, nor are they treated in the same way. The teacher and some students, who are familiar with the prevailing norms, cancel certain norms for a while in such a way that some immigrant students are excluded from fully participating in the mathematical discussion.",

Conditions facilitating or impeding access to such tasks at the upper secondary level were identified using qualitative data analysis techniques within this framework. Strategies employed in exploiting, or overcoming these conditions were identified. A well-developed repertoire of cognitive and metacognitive strategies together with a rich store of mathematical knowledge, real-world knowledge and experiences, and comprehension skills facilitated access. This was enhanced by metacognitive knowledge encouraging student engagement with the task and by students imagining they were in the task situation. Once moderate skill had been achieved in accessing these applications, coordination and integration of multiple representations, further cues, and mathematical processes and procedures became critical.

        "description":"An understanding of linear measurement depends on principles that include standard unit size, iteration of units, numbering of a unit at its end, and partial units for measuring continuous length. Children may learn these principles at school, for example through experience with informal measurement, or they may learn them through use of measurement in society. This study compared the application of these principles by children aged 8 and 9 from the Philippines and New Zealand. These countries were selected because they have quite different curricula, societal influences and economies. Ninety-one children were interviewed individually on a common set of unusual tasks that were designed to tap underlying principles. Results showed many similarities and some differences between countries. Most tasks requiring visualisation and informal units were done more accurately by New Zealand children. Some tasks involving the use of a conventional ruler were done more accurately by Filipino children. These differences appear to be related to differences in curricula and possibly to differences in societal use of measurement. We suggest that these results, like those of other writers cited, demonstrate the need for extensive work on the underlying concepts in measurement through work on informal measurement and a careful transition between informal and formal measurement.

Shared reading episodes were transcribed in their entirety and the data were coded according to a scheme developed by the authors (Anderson, Anderson, & Shapiro, 2004). All families except one engaged in mathematical talk although there was considerable diversity in terms of the amount of talk and the ways in which mathematical concepts were shared. The concept of size arose most frequently, next was different aspects of number, while shape occurred relatively infrequently. Results suggest that shared book reading holds considerable potential for parents to draw attention to mathematical vocabulary and concepts. (Contains 1 table and 2 appendices.)",

Data were collected via running records, researcher reflection notes, and video and audio recordings. Video and audio transcripts were analysed using a mathematical discourse and social interactions coding system designed by MacMillan (1998), while the running records and reflection notes contributed to descriptions of the children's interactions with each other and with the teachers. Teachers used an &quot;assisted performance&quot; approach to instruction that supported problem solving and inquiry processes in mathematics activities, and this, combined with a child-centred pedagogy and specific values about community learning, created a learning environment designed to stimulate and foster learning. The mathematics discourse analysis showed a use of explanatory language in mathematics discourse, and this language supported scaffolding among children for new mathematics concepts. These and other interactions related to peer sharing, tutoring and regulation also emerged as key aspects of students' learning practices. However, the findings indicated that multiage grouping alone did not support learning. Rather, effective learning was dependent upon the teacher's capacities to develop productive discussion among children, as well as implement developmentally appropriate curricula that addressed the needs of the different children.

        "description":"The assessment of children in their years before school and their first years of school has been, traditionally, informal. Further, assessment of children's mathematical skills at this level has been infrequent compared to social, emotional and physical assessments. However, there are contexts where reliable, valid, standardised data from assessment in mathematics are required. This paper outlines the development of two assessment tools for mathematics that were originally developed for such contexts. Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses enabled the construction of assessment forms that address the range of abilities of 4- to 8-year-old children, and provided the scales used for constructing formative and summative reports of achievement. A description of the development of the assessment tools and the IRT analysis that provides the reporting formats are presented together with some research uses of the tools.

        "description":"Mathematics teacher education programs are designed with an intention, explicit or implicit, to produce graduates who are competent in both pedagogic knowledge and discipline knowledge. This paper explores students' experiences in coming to learn mathematics and mathematics education. Using an example from a quiz question, supplemented with follow-up interviews with students, the paper raises questions as to the effectiveness of programs that adopt traditional approaches to the teaching of mathematics. It is shown how a functionalist perspective was adopted by many of the preservice teachers, which engendered a reproductive approach to teaching. The data raised concerns about preservice teachers' knowledge of volume, their pedagogic knowledge, and the role of the practicum on their learning. (Contains 1 table and 2 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Although sampling has been mentioned as part of the chance and data component of the mathematics curriculum since about 1990, little research attention has been aimed specifically at school students' understanding of this descriptive area. This study considers the initial understanding of bias in sampling by 639 students in grades 3, 5, 7, and 9. Three hundred and forty-one of these students then undertook a series of lessons on chance and data with an emphasis on chance, data handling, sampling, and variation. A post-test was administered to 285 of these students and two years later all available students from the original group (328) were again tested. This study considers the initial level of understanding of students, the nature of the lessons undertaken at each grade level, the post-instruction performance of those who undertook lessons, and the longitudinal performance after two years of all available students. Overall instruction was associated with improved performance, which was retained over two years but there was little difference between those who had or had not experienced instruction. Results for specific grades, some of which went against the overall trend are discussed, as well as educational implications for the teaching of sampling across the years of schooling based on the classroom observations and the changes observed.

        "description":"This article examines students' ability to use the balance model to solve for unknowns. A teaching experiment was conducted in four Year 3 classrooms. This experiment focused on exploring the application of the balance model as an analogue for representing equations and solving for unknowns. The teaching experiment promoted a shift by students towards viewing addition and subtraction equations in terms of equivalence, where the situation is viewed in a multi-directional way (i.e., balance). Initially the lessons were trialed by the researchers in two classrooms. The lessons were then implemented in a further two classrooms by two classroom teachers in conjunction with the researchers. Two weeks after the conclusion of the teaching experiment, a one-on-one interview was conducted with a random sample comprising twenty students with an average age of eight years. The interviews indicated that while the balance model did assist students reach solutions for finding unknowns, for some students further explicit teaching was required.

In a quantitative study of first year calculus students, we investigated two groups of students.

Performance data on their secondary mathematics and first year tertiary calculus were analysed. The study showed that there was no significant difference between the adjusted means of the entire group of first language learners and the entire group of second language learners. Neither was there any statistically significant difference between the performances of the two groups of second language learners (based on the adjusted means). Yet, there did seem to be a significant difference between the achievement of Afrikaans students attending Afrikaans lectures and Afrikaans students attending English lectures. (Contains 9 tables.)",

In this article we provide some of the relevant quantitative statistics and relate the stories of two particular women through excerpts from interviews, student artefacts, and participant observation data.

The first problem relates to teachers' sense-making of assessment data. Illustrative cases revealed that teachers' processes of interpretation of students' understanding, knowledge and learning of mathematics draws on a rich knowledge base of understandings, beliefs, and attitudes. Consequently, the process of sense-making of students' mathematical understandings involves ambiguity and difficulty. The second problem relates to ways of helping teachers adopt contemporary assessment approaches. A professional development activity served as the example examined. Three aspects of what the course instructor promoted with respect to contemporary assessment were analysed: (1) the assessment methods and tools advocated in the course, (2) the degree to which the integration of assessment with instruction was promoted, and (3) the purposes for assessment highlighted in the course. It appeared that attention was paid to the use of contemporary assessment tools, but this was associated with traditional assessment purposes. Learning to use the new assessment tool did, however, influence instruction and fostered greater integration of assessment and instruction than before--a characteristic of contemporary assessment. The article concludes with a discussion of the current expectation that teachers use assessment data to improve instruction. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

Via interviews and a paper-and-pencil test, I examined students' understanding of trigonometric functions for both classes. The results indicate that the students who were taught in the lecture-based course developed a very limited understanding of these functions. Students who received the experimental instruction developed a deep understanding of trigonometric functions.

        "description":"Out-of-school programs provide a context for enriching academic experiences. This study describes a 12-week after-school reading program, Project Expanding Horizons, which is based on the Schoolwide Enrichment Model-Reading (SEM-R) framework. SEM-R has three phases: exposure, supported independent reading, and choice. The exposure phase is designed to broaden students' literature experiences through short read-alouds. During the next phase, supported independent reading, teachers circulate and hold conferences with students as they read independently from self-selected books. Teachers give guidance to students in selecting books of appropriate challenge during this phase and promote thinking about reading through questioning and discussion. Finally, during the last stage, teachers give students a choice of a variety of activities related to their reading. The program provided wide exposure to books and emphasized individually challenging reading, including a specific focus on meeting the needs of advanced readers. In this study, the participants included 155 students in grades 3-6 from 3 demographically diverse districts. Average weekly gain scores in reading fluency were compared to grade-level national norms. Third and fifth graders showed statistically significantly higher gain scores than the national sample; fourth and sixth graders did not. These results suggest that participation in the after-school program may have contributed additional support to students' growth in reading achievement over the course of 12 weeks. Further analyses indicated similar gain scores across subgroups by gender, district, and entry reading level. Thus, this program shows potential benefits for both low-ability and high-ability readers. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"Recent changes in national and state mathematics standards have increased the level of algebraic thinking taught in younger grades. These changes have prompted more inclusive curriculum designs that open the opportunity to enroll in advanced mathematics courses at younger ages. Of particular interest to this study is the access to eighth-grade algebra, once traditionally reserved for select populations. This study examined long-term academic outcomes for students who did or did not enroll in eighth-grade algebra in one district that implemented an initiative to increase access. The outcomes of students with similar ability, as measured by preassessment in seventh grade, were compared. The groups performed similarly on end-of-course exams in high school math and the mathematics section of the SAT I. However, students who completed algebra in the eighth grade stayed in the mathematics pipeline longer and attended college at greater rates than those who did not. Because of the sequential nature of mathematics course work, students taking algebra at an earlier age have the opportunity to enroll in more advanced courses in the future. Results suggest the need for further exploration of how to provide access and promote enrollment in eighth-grade algebra for students who demonstrate readiness. (Contains 10 tables.)",

        "description":"In certain contexts, some academically advanced students employ coping strategies that manipulate the visibility of their ability. These strategies may include denying giftedness, hiding giftedness, gaining favor by helping others, denying the negative impact on peer acceptance, conforming to mask giftedness, and minimizing focus on popularity. The goal of the current study was to replicate previous research that revealed gender and age differences in coping strategy choice. The analysis of responses from approximately 550 students at a summer camp for academically advanced students revealed more similarities than differences among the subgroups of participants. As in previous research, girls were somewhat more likely than boys to engage in the stereotypically female role of helping others. In addition, older adolescents were significantly more likely than younger students to report hiding and denying their giftedness. Developmental differences between older and younger students may explain this finding, as well as the possibility of older adolescents identifying with a broader peer-base through participation in school and extracurricular activities and establishing greater independence from their parents. Finally, younger students were more likely to report that they minimize their focus on popularity. Although this last finding differs from previous research, it underscores the need for further research into the topic of social coping strategies among subpopulations of academically advanced students.

        "description":"Over a 4-year period, researchers measured several outcomes in 5 school districts initiating or enhancing character education programs. Based on student, teacher, and administrator surveys, there was a noticeable improvement in character-related behavior. In certain districts, suspension and drop-out rates also decreased after the implementation of the character education programs; however, the relationship between these behavioral indicators and character education was inconclusive. Character education programming had little impact on student achievement, perhaps because of the lack of a direct relationship between character education goals and student achievement goals. In addition, the research examined the relationship between the implementation level of the program within the school and the measured outcomes. As expected, schools with more fully-implemented programs experienced a greater improvement in perceived character-driven behavior and lower suspension rates than schools with less well-implemented programs. The highest degree of implementation in schools resulted when personnel at those schools embraced the program as their own. This underlined the necessity for gaining community and staff support for the implementation of a character education program. (Contains 7 tables and 8 figures.)",

        "author":["Kanu, Yatta"],
        "description":"As a consequence of the Civil Rights Movement and related social movements, the past 30 years have witnessed an unprecedented rise in higher education enrollments among ethnic minority groups, women, and low-income students, as well as increases in the financial aid available to these groups. However, certain ethnic minority populations, such as Native American and Native Canadian students, still experience difficulty in the transition from the K-12 school system to higher education, despite policies enacted to increase access. The research literature cites the disjuncture between the home cultures of these students and the environments of the school as a major cause of the failure of Native students to make the transition from the K-12 school system to higher education institutions. These findings have prompted calls for the integration of Native cultural knowledge and perspectives into the school curriculum. This Canadian study examined the outcomes of consistently integrating Native perspectives into the high school social studies curriculum throughout the 2003-2004 academic year. The teachers integrated Native cultural learning objectives, resources, and instructional methods. Critical elements of the integration processes that appeared to increase academic achievement, class attendance, and participation among Native students are discussed. Teachers can draw on these elements to implement effective teaching strategies for the preparation of Native students along the college pipeline. (Contains 1 endnote.)",

Accelerated Schools is a national endeavor that is designed to transform whole school communities. It views the community as being much broader. It includes students, teachers, parents, other citizens in the community, businesses in the community, and service organizations in the community. It is not only anyone who potentially has impact on the child, but also anyone who has any kind of interest in children or a financial stake through taxes in the school. Moreover, Accelerated Schools try to create an environment where the entire community takes responsibility and ownership for what is happening in the schoolhouse. They invest in the vision, in what they want the school to become, in how success will be measured, in the governance of the school, and in the school decision-making process.",

For the liberating, dynamic and emancipatory capacities of ICT use to grow, we need a different terrain, suited to a human and democratic vision for education.

        "description":"New normative ideas about flexibility, employability and lifelong learning are shifting labour market requirements as they induce flexible employment patterns and new skilling needs. While the model of a typical progressive career based on possession of a particular set of (occupational) skills has been largely undermined, employees are increasingly challenged to secure their employability by constantly adjusting their skills profiles and manage their own individualised careers. Such trends increasingly affect workers at all skills levels in both production and service sectors. Several indicators and studies support the hypothesis that a new entrepreneurial type of worker, characterised by individualised sets of skills, internalised control mechanisms and the prioritisation of transferable over technical skills, will gradually become the new prototype highly desired by managers and human resources development experts. Based on findings of the 5th EU framework project &quot;Vocational identity, flexibility and mobility in the European labour market&quot;, this paper argues that most employees in Europe at intermediate skills level are lacking the resources and capacities to fulfil the requirements of potentially developing into an entrepreneurial type of employee. The focus of this paper is the extent to which different national and sectoral contexts can create a supportive or an adverse environment for employees to develop the ability to deal with great changes at work.

In spite of this, senior staff continue to be optimistic about the role of behavioural and motivational training in the everyday realities of administration.

It has much more to do with a sequential strategic choice and illustrates behaviour by players facing reality, knowing how to act and react to their evolving environment and the difficulties of dealing with uncertainty, relying more on cognitive than calculated reasoning. This article demonstrates that continued education varies according to students' profiles (according to qualifications, specialisation and gender). It may involve a combination of training strategy and/or employability strategy, and of minimising risks (of failure at university) and maximising competitive advantages.

        "description":"This analysis of education policy constitutes an attempt to outline the problem of youth unemployment. Building on a recognition that structural change in the &quot;society of labourers&quot; has also affected the social entity &quot;young people&quot;, it shows the problems inherent in our concept of linear transitions to working life and the need to learn to live with imponderables, by gradually freeing ourselves of the illusion of full-time employment and of waiting for things to improve. The answer to the question of who is equipped to cope with life will ever less often be &quot;the person with a secure job&quot; and ever more often &quot;the person who is competent to handle transitions&quot;. So in the context of youth unemployment, what is needed is a change of direction, from a burden-oriented coping paradigm based on a deficit to a competence-oriented coping paradigm. However, all young people (and not only those belonging to special risk categories) need models and concepts of success for this new skill. This means that there is a socio-political task facing society as a whole, as well as a need for young people affected by unemployment to cope with their working career.",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the regulation of goal orientations and strong &quot;oughts&quot; in students with learning disabilities (LD). Participants were 132 Greek students with state-identified LD using the achievement-discrepancy criterion, and 538 typical students. The first hypothesis tested was that feeling obliged to engage in an activity is grounded on fear and is associated with a network of avoidance-related behaviors. Results confirmed this hypothesis, as the ought-self explained significant amounts of variability in task avoidance, performance avoidance, and fear of failure. The second hypothesis was that the ought-self was associated with failure to regulate. Student groups were formed based on their adoption of mastery, performance approach, task avoidance, multiple-approach goals, and strong &quot;oughts.&quot; Results indicated that students with strong &quot;oughts&quot; persisted significantly less than students with approach forms of motivation. Regardless of their lack of persistence, however, students with strong &quot;oughts&quot; were not inferior in achievement, nor did they display heightened negative affect. By modeling the relationship between goals, achievement and psychopathology, results showed that the ought-self was negatively associated with achievement and positively associated with indices of anxiety and depression. Mean group analyses pointed to salient differences between students with and without LD on motivation, achievement and psychopathology. (Contains 3 tables, 3 figures, and 2 footnotes.)",

Students were taught to collaboratively plan and revise their essays and independently write their essays using procedures articulated by Wong, Butler, Ficzere, and Kuperis (1996). Results demonstrated notable increases in students' written protocols on the quantitative criteria (e.g., number of words written, prewriting and composing times). However, only three of the five students made gains related to writing clarity and cogency. Students' performance improved from \"below basic\" to \"basic\" or \"proficient\" levels with respect to qualitative criteria (i.e., focus, content, and organization) on the statewide writing assessment. Although transfer effects to a different writing task, person, and setting were evident for all students on the quantitative criteria, these effects were mixed on the qualitative criteria. Social validity data indicated student and teacher satisfaction with the planning/writing intervention. Implications of the study for argumentative essay writing instruction are discussed.

Two hundred and twelve students answered self-report questionnaires on their learning styles. Results revealed that students with LD preferred to use more stepwise processing, including memorizing and drilling, than NLD students. In addition, students with LD reported a higher need for self-regulation strategies than their NLD peers, including controlling their learning process, self-orientation, planning, monitoring, and continuous evaluation of their learning process and results. LD students also claimed to lack regulation, noting their difficulties with the learning process. Findings are discussed in relation to how distance-learning universities can better cultivate the abilities of their LD and NLD students. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Linked student and school contextual data enabled the use of hierarchical linear modeling to complete the analyses and examine both student and school level effects. Fourteen student and three school level variables were found to be associated with students' reading achievement and twelve student and two school level variables were associated with writing. Significant variations between schools were also found for students with individualized education plans, English as a second language, or previous eligibility on the OSSLT.

In this study we tested a model hypothesizing that principals contribute to student achievement indirectly through teacher commitment and beliefs about their collective capacity. Path analysis of data from 205 elementary schools supported this hypothesis. Schools with higher levels of transformational leadership had higher collective teacher efficacy, greater teacher commitment to school mission, school community, and school-community partnerships, and higher student achievement. Increasing the transformational leadership practices in schools makes a small but practically important contribution to overall student achievement. (Contains 2 figures, 3 tables, and 3 notes.)",

She discovered that when she relinquished traditional autocratic control and allowed her students to collaborate interactively with classmates to achieve common goals, her students became more invested and engaged in their learning. She also discovered that when students participated in engaging learning activities in well-designed, supportive cooperative groups, their brain scans showed facilitated passage of information from the intake areas into the memory storage regions of the brain. Students experienced a greater level of understanding of concepts and ideas when they talked, explained, and argued about them with their group, instead of just passively listening to a lecture or reading a text. In addition, classrooms where students are engaged in well-planned cooperative work are more joyful places in which management issues diminish and students develop social and learning skills. Samples of cooperative projects that can be introduced in a classroom are provided.",

Not one in her class was an ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages) student. The lack of ESOL students at her school's GATE program was caused by the school's inability to identify its ESOL gifted students. The GATE program for the entire school district relied on standardized testing using the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT) as the primary indicator of intellectual promise. It is impossible for ESOL students, whose language skills range at the basic level, to score high in OLSAT. Because of this dilemma, the author proposed a GATE screening program for ESOL students at her school. In this article, she describes the successful results of this GATE screening program.

        "description":"Just within the past two decades, there has been a proliferation of a variety of literature, both academic and popular, regarding the underachievement and underrepresentation of African American males in U.S. schools. According to the literature, African American males have been disproportionately placed in special education classrooms and underrepresented in gifted and talented programs. Despite the efforts at broadening the definition to include multifaceted categories and criteria in the identification of giftedness, there is still a widespread underrepresentation of African American students in gifted and talented programs, by as much as 50% nationally. This article discusses the promise offered by one of the ability areas cited in the federal definition of giftedness--\"leadership ability\"--as a potential means of addressing the problem of underrepresentation. The article not only focuses on key mentoring initiatives, but also on promising national programs. The article concludes with practical recommendations for practitioners.",

In this article, the author shares ideas on how to help students master research skills. She also offers her own strategies on building an effective media center. Because contemporary librarians of today will no longer recognize the library of the future as the children of the future will use information in ways and formats that are unimaginable at the present time, the author also emphasizes the importance of honing students' problem solving skills and critical thinking skills.

The purpose of this study was to investigate principal leadership on gifted education in schools that were known to have high-quality elementary gifted programs. The participants of the study were two elementary school principals. Both principals were women who worked in remote and rural areas of Ohio. Results appeared to be affected by the demographics of the towns in which the schools were located. The size of the school and community impacted the delivery of services. Both principals made it clear that the attitudes and perceptions of their small communities affected aspects of how they administered their schools. Both principals recognized and encouraged the use of pretesting and compacting (one began as early as kindergarten) and differentiation in the regular classroom. These findings mean that services for gifted students should be part of the school's mission and be communicated clearly to the public.",

Eleven adult tutors received training in decoding and 3 basic and 3 higher level reading comprehension strategies consistent with the district's reading program and adapted to include increasing levels of challenge and support for English learners. Scores on a standardized reading achievement test and an assessment of reading fluency served as outcome measures. Findings suggest that tutoring in decoding and higher level reading comprehension strategies supported gains in reading achievement. Gifted students who are English learners appear to benefit from tutoring in decoding and the full range of lower and higher level reading comprehension strategies.

        "description":"Gifted students report that they are often perceived differently than nonidentified students (Cross, Coleman, &amp; Stewart, 1993); thus, they employ social coping strategies to manipulate the visibility of their giftedness. The Social Coping Questionnaire (SCQ; Swiatek, 1995) was designed to assess these strategies. This study's purpose was to examine the SCQ's factor structure with a sample of 600 younger (grades 5-7) and older (grades 8-11) gifted boys and girls in the U.S. and determine the tenability of the factor structure across age and gender groups. Participants' scores were randomly assigned to either exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings from EFA were tested with CFA. Together, these analyses revealed 6 factors. Factor loading patterns from multigroup analyses indicated differences between age and gender groups, and suggested that future investigations of gifted students' social coping strategies include careful examination of the data for factor structure changes that are unique to the sample.

The authors propose blending recommended assessment practices in early childhood gifted education and early childhood special education in a comprehensive assessment process. In doing so, unique needs of twice-exceptional preschool children may be better met. Interviewing family members and other caregivers to determine strengths and needs in daily routines and observing young children in play are two practices that provide critical information about the preschool child's developmental status, family priorities, and daily life. The authors conclude that routines-based assessment (RBA) and play-based assessment (PBA) provide perspectives that standardized assessments alone cannot provide and that RBA and PBA may be especially effective in identifying and subsequently meeting the needs of twice-exceptional preschool children.

Numerous instruments have been developed to measure functional outcomes and the quality of life of people who are visually impaired. The continued development and implementation of such instruments represents a major achievement in the coordination and standardization of measurements of functional outcomes. This article highlights a unique, objective method for assessing the mobility of clients who are visually impaired by using a combination of GPS (Global Positioning System), and accelerometer technologies.

The device was first tested on sighted infants, to demonstrate that this type of stimulation on the abdomen is pleasant and rewarding in comparison to visual and auditory reinforcement. The preliminary results of this research allow us to consider the possibility of developing practical visual-substitution devices for infants who are blind.",

        "description":"One of the most prevalent visual impairments of people aged 60 and older is age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which ranks third globally as a cause of visual impairment (World Health Organization, 2006). The purpose of this study was to conduct a tentative subjective assessment of eccentric viewing by persons with AMD. The authors recruited registered persons with bilateral AMD who had low vision and had received some instruction in the use of magnification devices. Results indicated that the themes pertaining to the subjective assessment of eccentric viewing that emerged from the data were related to instrumental and emotional support and the costs and benefits of acquiring eccentric viewing, which appear to be interactive. Although participants who lived alone found reading to be difficult, they felt that they benefited from eccentric viewing as a means of exploring their remaining vision and the possibility of optimizing their reading abilities, possibly because they did not have the option of changing roles to retain their dependence.",

Individuals who are visually impaired require various degrees of support and assistance in their daily activities. This assistance is frequently provided by a \"primary support person,\" who may be a family member or friend who assists with all day-to-day activities. In this study, a consecutive sample of 28 adults who reported being the primary support persons for individuals who were visually impaired was recruited through a low vision services clinic. The main support activities provided by the primary support persons included instrumental support, such as transportation, help with administrative tasks, and shopping and meal preparation. There has been little research on the individuals who provide primary support to persons who are visually impaired, so it is not clear whether these caregivers feel a sense of strain or feel burdened by their role. The study reported here sought to provide some preliminary data on the experiences of primary support persons of individuals who are visually impaired. The resulting scores on the administered Caregiver Research Assessment (CRA) indicated that, as an aggregate, the participants were feeling mild burden or strain in their role; however, they also had a fairly high level of self-esteem in their role.",

        "author":["Hughey, Matthew W."],
        "description":"On March 2, 1867, the Historically Black College or University (HBCU) Howard University (HU) was founded in Washington, D. C. Almost exactly one year later, the all white fraternity of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at the University of Virginia. Over 100 years later, on February 18 2006, fifty-five HU students became charter members of Pi Kappa Alpha (&quot;Pike&quot;), making the Pikes the first traditionally White social Greek organization to begin a colony at HU. Using recent interviews with HU students as a touchstone for analysis, this author presents a six-part typology of student ideological responses to the Pike colony. These responses are described nominally and arranged in order of ascending racial consciousness. The first is the &quot;Color-Blind Copasetic,&quot; who argues for a post-race political utopia. Next is the &quot;Agreeable Assimilationist,&quot; who views HU's predominantly Black campus culture as disingenuous and possibly misinformative. Next is the &quot;Campus Conventionist,&quot; who views non-Black changes to tradition as negative. There is also the &quot;Munificent Multiculturalist,&quot; who believes that racial diversity, no matter the form, is positive. In addition, there is the &quot;Radical Racialist,&quot; who expresses a dislike of the Pikes on campus because of their White traditionalism and racist past. Last is &quot;Antonio's Ghost,&quot; who believes that the Pikes can be used by Black students to advance Black interests. While these labels are surely reductive, they nonetheless capture a certain version of the HU student realities of culturally specific ideologies that make meaning and sense out of the HU Pike presence.

        "author":["Jean-Marie, Gaetane"],
        "description":"The social movements during the last 50 years of the 20th century were among the most tumultuous years for people of color. African Americans, as well as other groups, confronted obstacles on what they could be and do. African Americans experienced harsh treatments in educational institutions and had to develop unconventional ways to advocate for themselves and those in their community (Jean-Marie, James, &amp; Bynum, 2006). The purpose of this paper is to explore the experiences of three African-American women leaders in historically black institutions whose leadership practices advance social justice for African Americans who have limited opportunities to pursue higher education. They confronted and disrupted institutions thought to be responsible for their oppression (Jean-Marie, 2005). This paper documents how individuals committed to social justice and racial uplift connect their professional work with social and political activism in the quest for equality and justice for African-Americans and all people. The author presents in this paper women whose elementary and secondary educational foundations were formed in segregated schools (i.e., fewer resources, lack of funding, limited teachers and classrooms). The women leaders in this study come from a tradition of protest [that has been transmitted] across generations by older relatives, black educational institutions, churches, and protest organizations (Morris, 1984). To frame this article, the author interconnects the following theoretical constructs: (a) the symbolic and educational significance of historically Black colleges and universities (hereafter, HBCUs); (b) racial uplift and African-American women's involvement; and (c) the meaning and practice of social justice leadership. Findings of the study shows that these African-American female leaders in HBCUs represent the kind of advocacy and practice associated with social justice and political projects necessary in making and sustaining the concept of community/racial uplift.",

        "description":"Since their founding in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have represented the intellectual incubators, nurturing social-cultural environments, and professional launching pads of numerous black leaders, such as noted black theologian and revered Morehouse man, Howard Washington Thurman (1900-1981). This article examines the early history, environment, and leadership, of Morehouse College and how its Black male leadership shaped the life of Howard Thurman. The author also presents the student experiences of Dr. Howard Thurman, one of America's most influential theologians and preachers of the twentieth century and a founder of America's first interracial church, Church of the Fellowship of All Peoples in San Francisco in 1944. Morehouse College was an educational institution that served a full range of students, literally taking them from boys to men. Morehouse had established its reputation as the builder of men under the institutional leadership of John Hope. Morehouse served students from all walks of life and from all levels of preparation. It maintained an academy division until approximately 1930. The collegiate level curriculum reflected what was being taught at many White liberal arts colleges. For Thurman, Morehouse College provided the nurturing soil for his identity development as a Black man with intrinsic worth and dignity, and his future success and influence on others through his preaching, teaching, and writing.

        "title":"&quot;Keep Our Black Warriors out of the Draft&quot;: The Vietnam Antiwar Movement at Southern University, 1968-1973",
        "author":["Cox, Marcus S."],
        "description":"During the late 1960s and early 70s, the antiwar movement gained momentum and introduced a new wave of protest and demonstrations throughout the nation. At many colleges and universities, military training programs were discontinued or in jeopardy of losing their appeal. Much of the violence that did involve students on Black campuses directly related to civil rights protest or demonstrations involving administrative policies, not military training. Compulsory ROTC was only mentioned in addition to other civil rights issues and university complaints. This study attempts to document the anti-war and ROTC protest movement at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), in particular Southern University between 1968 and 1973. Between those years, the war in Vietnam caused many of the social and political problems in American society. The war unleashed political tensions between &quot;hawks&quot; and &quot;doves&quot;, generational divisions between young adults and middle-aged Americans, and political struggles between pacifist and cold warriors. On the campuses of Black colleges and universities, the antiwar movement divided the student body and faculty on many issues. Antiwar supporters focused on political and ideological reasons not to support the war or military training, while pro-military advocates concentrated on the social and economic advantages of military service. Despite all the oppositions, by 1952, 13 Black colleges and universities in nine different states submitted applications to the Department of Defense for the establishment of senior military training programs (Memorandum, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense to Major General Hugh M. Milton, 1952 December 22). African-American college presidents were particularly interested in: (1) Increasing the number of ROTC programs in colleges for Negroes and in high schools for Negroes in states where separate educational institutions exist[ed] for Negro and White people to the end that more Negro youth may receive the military training and acquire leadership benefits from such training; (2) Increasing the pay, benefits, and grants-in-aid to ROTC and NROTC students of all groups; and (3) Pointing up the military and citizenship obligations of person involved in the total ROTC and NROTC program. (Memorandum, The Executive Committee of the Conference of Presidents of Land-Grant Colleges for Negroes to The U.S. Office of Education, 1948 April 2). The establishment of military training programs on Black college campuses during the post-war era strengthened the link between military service and training as a citizenship obligation and the quest for African-American civil rights.",

        "description":"The change-over to a knowledge and service society means greater opportunities for the highly skilled. Participation in tertiary education is increasing in all countries, and it can be seen that graduates are being absorbed into knowledge intensive services in the labour market. The international trend towards making vocational education and training part of tertiary education is a response to changes in the demand for skills and to educational ambitions: post-training training is becoming more widespread. The vast majority of jobs will nonetheless continue to be for &quot;trained operatives&quot; with mid-level and lower-level skills. The decline in the production sector is reducing the scale of simple jobs and is hence a major factor in the increase in specialist training. Many service jobs may not demand lengthy job-specific training, but they do require generic basic academic and behavioural skills. The smaller the job-specific element of the job profile, the greater the element of generic skills required (such as team-working and customer and service focus). Such basic education and training for all young people is therefore becoming increasingly necessary for employability and as a platform for lifelong learning: general adult education (&quot;personality stabilisation&quot;) and the importance of job-specific in-service updating training are growing at all levels of the employment system.

        "description":"The article begins with the new media themselves and with the question of what technical potential the new information and communication technologies have and why they exert so much influence on the debate about learning and teaching. It goes on to show why a technological approach to e-learning not only has limitations but also involves risks. Consequently, it appears necessary to adopt a learning-oriented approach to e-learning. The hypothesis is that one must first understand learning per se in order to be able to promote e-learning. A heuristic framework model has been designed to show that technical decisions come at the end of a chain of decisions that relate, or should relate, primarily to education and teaching. It was only possible to discuss briefly the opportunities that e-learning offers for learning in Europe, if we assume a pedagogic approach. E-learning in Europe opens up new possibilities for various forms and methods of learning, but there are major obstacles if the emphasis remains on the technological approach. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Special international competence may help trainees find attractive jobs and may also strengthen their companies' position on the global market.

Such training modules away from home require special coordination with foreign partners and careful consideration of the curriculum, predeparture preparation, language training, organisation, supervision, monitoring and assessment. Valid certification of the intercultural learning progress, which should find wide acceptance by employees, seems particularly important in order to document the added value of training abroad for both trainee and employee.

        "description":"This paper examines an important development in Chinese higher education in the late 1990s and early 2000s, namely, its radical expansion of enrollment starting from 1998. After a brief review of the related literature on educational expansion, the paper analyzes the higher education expansion in China in detail. The paper argues that a variety of factors have led to the enrollment expansion, including the expectation to stimulate domestic consumption and to ease the immediate pressure on the labor market, the high public interest in and demand for higher education in Chinese society, and the political will of the Chinese government to develop higher education. The outcomes of the enrollment expansion are also examined. The paper argues that the expected short term impact of enrollment expansion on Chinese economy is not warranted by reality. Enrollment expansion has also put pressures on Chinese higher education to further reform its structure, curricula, and administration. More importantly, enrollment expansion has brought the issue of equity to the front. A table with the statistics of enrollment in higher education in China is appended. (Contains 15 notes.)",

This model, called Flexible Fixed Cost Quadratic cost function includes as output--full time equivalent degree program enrollment, and the two factor inputs--teaching cost and operating cost per student. Units of observation are the degree programs being offered by the sample HEIs. Results indicate that public and private HEIs exhibit structurally different cost functions, with the public sector enjoying markedly better cost efficiency and over-all scale economy.

In the wake of the political reform and social protest movements of the 1970s and 1980s that prompted Taiwanese educational reform, critics have charged that traditional curricula tend to reinforce the dominant national Chinese cultural identity. The purpose of this article is to review recent research on the complex ideological processes in Taiwan's school curriculum. The article begins with an overview of the political and social impact on social studies curricula in Taiwan from 1949 to the present, followed by a theoretical discussion of the interrelationship between school curriculum and political ideology using an analysis of Taiwanese textbooks as evidence. The article then suggests a number of classroom practices and methodologies for elementary and secondary school teachers in social studies classes.",

Defining the qualitative aspect of the inquiry was an in-depth interview with five (5) of the respondents chosen purposively to triangulate the data yielded by the questionnaire. Data were treated statistically and interpretively to describe the phenomenon under inquiry. It is interesting to note that while the nurse professoriate had shown a positive attitude towards research, variables such as time constraints, lack of research knowledge, research support structure and motivation hinder them from doing research activities.

        "description":"Student resistance can be a very important problem for the instructors in universities. Student resistance includes the conscious and preplanned behaviors towards the information presented to them in the classroom and the institutional practices. Typically, student resistance takes the form of passive or active non-compliance with roles and outputs expected of them as students. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of hidden curricula on student resistance. The research was conducted on senior undergraduate students in a Turkish University, in the Department of Psychological Counseling and Guidance. Given the exploratory nature of this investigation, a case study methodology was employed. Data was collected from official documents, class observations, and interviews. The results of this research indicated that the students demonstrated resistance to some dimensions of the hidden and delivered curricula. Specifically, while the students showed resistance towards the delivered curriculum and &quot;banking education&quot;, they did not show similar resistance to symbolic violence and the &quot;warming-up&quot; process.

We examined the differences between the aggressor/victim groups concurrently and two years later in third grade in terms of both mental health symptoms (severity and directionality) and school functioning (academic competence and school engagement). AV showed the worst results for mental health, academic competence, and school engagement concurrently and two years later. The role of first-grade teacher experience and education in predicting third-grade outcomes was also the subject of examination. Significant interactional effects were found between both AV and teacher experience and education. Most notably, the education level of first-grade teachers interacted with AV status to predict school engagement, such that the least engaged students at third grade were AV whose first-grade teachers had no schooling beyond a bachelor's degree.

In a medium-sized city, biographical narrative interviews and observation were used to three Chinese secondary EFL teachers, of three successive generations. An in-depth narrative analysis interpreting their metaphors, and constructing their life stories is employed to understand the biographical narrative data. It indicates how individual teacher's knowledge is both constrained and enabled by themselves and by the wider society they live in, and how change and continuity are intertwined in the teaching and learning practices of the three generations. This paper also addresses certain key issues in biographical narrative studies, namely subjectivity, representation, and cultural bearings, and teachers' knowledge, all of which constitute a form of pedagogy in educational research.",

Little is known about the application of this process to cross national samples. This investigation studied the circumscription process with a large sample of 733 South Korean students ranging from elementary school through college (192 South Korean 5th-6th grades from two different elementary schools, 181 South Korean 8th grades from two different junior high schools, 192 South Korean 10th-12th grades from two different high schools, and 208 from three different universities). A researcher-constructed instrument was developed which consisted of demographic information and 71 occupation names listed under each question. Seventy-one occupation titles were rated in desirability, masculinity vs. femininity, and prestige with 5-likert scales. The results are as follows: 1) boys and girls share the same perceptions of sex-types and prestige levels in all age groups, 2) occupational maps of the 71 occupations were different across the age groups, 3) South Korean boys pursue traditionally male dominant occupations and girls pursue traditionally female dominant occupations, 4) on the circumscription process, South Korean adolescents narrow their alternatives by high school. The gap between junior high and high school is the largest and subsequently when they enter the university, they widen their alternative zones once again. While much of Gottfredson's model was replicated with this cross national sample, the ages at which different developmental tasks occur appear to be at different times with this sample. This investigation contributes to the growing literature examining whether the career theories are universal or culturally specific. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

As for events related to other campus activities, major tendencies of the two groups were consistent for situational factors due to the influence of social values and campus cultures.

Interview responses were transcribed, categorized and thematised according to saliency, meaning and homogeneity. The findings of the study disclosed that, on the whole, while the subjects never had the opportunity to use the English language in Korea, they use it almost everywhere in the Philippines. Their difficulties exist both in daily conversation and in the academic setting. Such difficulties are attributable to both the subjects' and the Filipinos' different entry points in the learning and use of English. Despite cultural barriers in communication, however, the Koreans studying in the Philippines are instrumentally motivated to learn the English language. (Contains 3 tables.)",

A &quot;fusion of horizons&quot; occurs at the junction of two intertwined interpretations: one from our socio-historical tradition and the other from our experience of novel phenomena. I explored students' hermeneutic horizons in relation to Nietzsche's text &quot;Will and Wave.&quot; Data collection was through classroom observations, informant interviews, and an analysis of three students' interpretive essays. The results indicated that students experienced particular difficulties comprehending metaphors and the author's purpose. Comprehension was a painstaking effort for most students because of their perceived ambiguity of Nietzsche's message. Nevertheless, the text evoked personal stories and new perspectives for some students.",

There were 150 sixth-grade students, 66 boys and 84 girls, involved in the study. The researcher employed a multiple-choice geometry test to find out students' reasoning stages and a questionnaire to detect students' motivation in regards to the instruction. These instruments were administered to the students before and after a five-week period of instruction. The paired-samples t-test, the independent-samples t-test, and ANCOVA with alpha = 0.05 were used to analyze the quantitative data. The study demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference as in motivation between boys and girls, and that no significant difference was detected in the acquisition of the levels between boys and girls. In other words, gender was not a factor in learning geometry. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The objectives of this paper are firstly, to provide a review of existing literature on the study of motivational styles amongst students and secondly, to identify the occurrence of different motivational styles amongst students in Singapore,. The method of identifying different motivational styles was adapted from a procedure first developed by Craske (1988). The findings of this study indicate that although the distribution of motivational styles amongst the Singaporean students was consistent with that as obtained by Craske, there was a higher tendency for maladaptive motivation amongst the males than the females. In contrast, Craske found no gender differentiation, though earlier researchers had found that maladaptive motivation was more common among the females. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The case of Japan demonstrates that access to basic education at junior high school level is unequal and inequitable when considering private costs of education borne within and outside the school system. It was also found that household spending on supplementary education in public schools is likely to be determined by local implementation of education reforms. Current education reform with its absence of financial and technical support to schools under the guise of deregulation does not seem to generate good levels of choice nor does it seem to sustain quality and equity in education.

Through a survey questionnaire, teachers and students were asked their perceptions of the textbooks. Then a sub-sample of the teachers and students were interviewed to collect more in-depth data on their assessment of the textbooks. The results indicated that the textbooks assist the teacher in instructional planning and in preparing exams, and help the students deal with the content. However, both teachers and students point to problems in textbooks in terms of their physical aspects, content presentation and organization, language, teaching and learning aids, and their impact on students. The textbooks focus mostly on transmission of knowledge, and they are found ineffective in leading students to read the information with interest and develop an understanding of the content area. They are found ineffective in developing students' thinking skills and positive attitudes toward the subject. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In reality, the physical and psychic consequences of wars on children persist for some time after the war. In this regard, we must prepare the reintegration of these children into society. To reintegrate these children, we must think of both a general course of rehabilitation followed by special rehabilitation according to the child's needs. In this respect, initially, we must initiate psychosocial help to restore the psychological and social development of children and to mitigate the harmful effects of wars. We noted that the content of psychosocial assistance for the child victims of war depends primarily on their particular needs and cultures and their traditions. General rehabilitation must thus rest on the capacity of the children to overcome the difficult conditions in the aftermath of wars. In this regard, the communities, the families, the schools, the teachers and the children themselves must take part in the process of curing these children and their support. Here, we can use certain possible models of creative therapy. For example, the cultural media such as arts of interpretation and arts visual as well as the accounts of the children themselves, the creative word can decrease the psychological problems of the child victims of war and facilitate their rehabilitation in the community.",

Specifically, I was concerned with the deleterious effects of the interpretations and implementations of this policy. To make claims to fund special needs, school boards had to implement a highly impersonal bureaucratic process that separated the textual mode from the lived reality. The all-consuming process of identification and labeling of students guided by stringent Ministry-imposed criteria led to unwanted and unintended consequences. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"In this case study, I have examined teachers' use of co-teaching models to support students with learning disabilities in an inclusive elementary classroom. Co-teachers progressed from the developmental stage of collegial growth to the compromising stage (Gately & Gately, 2001), but struggled to achieve the third stage of collaboration. Teachers used several methods to support students' literacy: explicit prompt sheets, scaffolded mini-lessons, and interactional inclusion. Classroom structures and helping routines played key roles in maintaining teachers' availability to exceptional learners. The students with learning disabilities protected their social status in the classroom, a key factor in their decision to accept teachers' help. (Contains 3 notes.)",

Based on a series of interviews with Ministry personnel, we have described their current progress to include the new literacies, plans for the future, and the dilemmas and challenges in considering the demands of new times. We argue for a more balanced approach to assessment and accountability, one that recognizes the limitations of current public accountability measures and situates them within a broader assessment framework.

Results of multilevel modelling showed that the effects of pure mathematics were significant after adjusting for traditionally important student-level predictors of achievement and for school effects. The effects of mathematics courses varied significantly across schools. Students taking pure mathematics achieved higher in smaller schools, particularly schools with higher teacher commitment. Students taking applied mathematics achieved higher if they attended smaller schools. (Contains 4 tables.)",

They valued the flexibility and opportunity to engage in professional development while in employment. Frustrations included the added time commitment and their hesitation to impose personal timeframes on other participants.
