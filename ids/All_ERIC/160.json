        "description":"In April 1972, 198 institutions which had been classified in 1960 as women's colleges were invited to participate in a study designed to obtain information regarding current status, their plans relative to coeducation, and related matters. The instrument, a survey-Questionnaire, was completed by 82.5 percent of the participants. Results of the survey covered women's colleges in 1960, context and perspective; the 1960s, a decade of challenge and change; and patterns of enrollment, 1960 to 1970. (MJM)",

Implications indicated that colleges, individually and collectively, need to develop systematic programs for monitoring the incidence and determining the etiology of attrition.

In the major division of the program, over 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students annually use the program to achieve their educational objectives. Over 500 courses of study are currently available to regional citizens at the 71 publically assisted universities, colleges and institutes. The evaluation indicates that, while still small in gross numbers of students involved, the program has grown by some 400% over the past 5 years. The report further  indicates that, although the program is well-accepted and operating smoothly, the barriers of state borderlines and the local interests of the institutions serve as forces working against any major growth in the immediate future. A second problem facing the program is the question of the relationship between the legal residency status of out-of-state students and their tuition obligations to public institutions. (HS)",

        "description":"The philosophy behind and the rationale for faculty unionization is extremely complicated. Its steadily increasing acceptance throughout the nation is significant not only because of its budgetary effects, but also as a commentary on the methods by which the teaching profession has been managed and as a force that will have fundamental effects on those interpersonal relationships that are critical to the teaching and learning processes. The papers presented in this volume provide a variety of insights and viewpoints concerning the effects of faculty collective bargaining on higher education. Major topics covered by the papers are: (1) prospects and implications for faculty collective bargaining; (2) the effect of unionization on the collegial roles of faculty, students and  administration; (3) unionization and institutional planning; (4) education and social survival; (5) unionization and campus governance; and (6) the academic labor market in the 1980's.

The contents of this document focus on the purpose of the survey, a description of the survey method, and an interpretation of the results in a forecast of changes in postsecondary education. The forecasted changes find postsecondary education more readily accessible to all. More of the students will drop in and out of the system throughout their lifetimes and will participate in programs that lead to vocations. It is anticipated that after 1980 changes in competence and performance requirements will change to general acceptance of work or experience as substitutes for formal programs, and measures of actual competency will be used in place of fulfillment of attendance  requirements.

        "description":"In discussing the impact of contract compliance and the Equal Rights Amendment on equality of opportunity in higher education, the author focuses primarily on women employed as faculty members and staff at universities and colleges. The basic and fundamental fact is that women have been treated differently, and that is to say, less well, than men. Women are not hired and promoted at the same rate, nor have they been paid as well as their male counterparts in higher education. In October 1972, HEW issued the Higher Education Guidelines that called for (1) nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and promotion of women and minorities in higher education, and (2) affirmative action programs to assure that any discriminatory practices in existence will be eradicated. Colleges and  universities can now take one of two courses of action. They can either listen to the demands and charges of women and attempt to rectify whatever adverse conditions exist, or they can ignore such demands and face possible legal proceedings. (HS)",

To solve the political problem, the church-related colleges must persuade the legislatures, both state and federal, to include them in constitutionally permissible ways in substantial programs of public assistance to higher education. To solve the ecclesiastical problem, the church-related colleges must persuade the churches with which they are affiliated that despite the changes they have to make in order to satisfy the judicial and legislative branches of the government, they remain a vital and indespensable ministry of the churches, well worth their cost in terms of  personnel and money.

These students had a generally favorable opinion of the SUNY/B faculty they knew, and they expressed a somewhat more positive view of faculty in their own departments than of others. The academic activities that were the most important contributors to the students' academic education were: class lectures, general preparation for class, and, for those who experienced it, independent study. Of the campus services listed on the questionnaire, Placement and Career Guidance was the only service used by more than half of the sample during their senior year. The two functions that the sample said would be most important to the ideal  university were to seek and discover new knowledge and to impart existing knowledge. An ideal university would have a direct, intentional effect on some aspects of students' lives, but not on others. (Author/HS)",

Seven major hypotheses are discussed in detail that will either dissuade or encourage academic court litigation.

(2) Historically excluded constituencies will increasingly seek the aid of courts to gain access to campus decisionmaking. (3) Criteria that restrict access to higher education will be increasingly challenged and will be sustained only to the extent they reflect valid educational interests. (4) The financial plight of higher education will increasingly invite litigation over the allocation of resources. (5) As state aid  to independent colleges and universities increases, the constitutional distinction between public and private higher education will diminish. (6) The spread of faculty collective bargaining will reduce litigation by faculty but may increase litigation against faculty. (7) The high tangible and intangible costs of litigation will tend to deter resort to the courts by all parties, while the impact of each court decision will widen and the prospect of suit will accordingly shape conduct on the campus.

These trends are based on the college-age population, the proportion of the state budget going to higher education, the establishment of new social priorities, the role of the private colleges, the increasing tendency for those who want vocational skills, the promise of federal aid, the slowdown in enrollments, educational innovation and changing power relationships. The cumulative impact of these and other trends cannot be fully anticipated. The recommended central planning agency would coordinate all efforts in postsecondary education in addition to emphasizing a more cosmic and functional view of education. (MJM)",

The Commission, in this report, states that thousands of Connecticut citizens find directed learning beyond high school either inaccessible or inappropriate. In addition, the Commission is convinced that resources currently available within and through existing institutions, public and private, have the potential to provide the highly flexible instructional services required to implement new approaches to the delivery of higher education services. Therefore, the Commission recommends immediate creation of an  administrative entity within the state system of higher education with the obligation, power, and funding to encourage and counsel students, to evaluate nontraditional programs of learning and grant college credit, and to award undergraduate degrees on the basis of such credit. The Commisssion also recommends that particular encouragement be given to the development of a number of nontraditional educational practices including technological delivery of instructional services, credit for experience, and credit for off-campus study.

While concluding that a mandate for an across-the-board 3-year, 9-quarter is undesirable, the Task Force does recommend that support be given to the time-shortened experimental degree models submitted by the universities and community colleges. The Task Force further recommends that options for acceleration should be expanded and promoted at all levels. The  expanded utilization of acceleration options could result in substantial and significant savings and cost benefits to students, parents, and taxpayers. (Author/HS)",

Results indicate that education majors as opposed to science majors are: more likely to feel their parents' ideas were an important determinant of their career choice; more likely to be interested in working with or helping people; less likely to be career oriented; more likely to attach importance to a stable future in a career; more likely to get advice and affection from their parents; and their mothers are likely to do volunteer work or have hobbies.  Female high school students had attitudes and backgrounds more similar to the education majors than the science majors.

The Life Science Project of the Six Institutions' Consortium was therefore a unique departure from all extant programs in African and Afro-American Studies. Its focus featured research into the activities of black scientists, dead and living, that have yielded considerable impact on the life sciences and society. An invitational workshop, of which this document is the report, featured seminars, reports, discussions, exhibits and films that emphasized the contributions of black scientists to the Life Sciences and the considerations in these sciences that have special relevance to the lives and conditions of black people.  The proceedings of the major sessions of the workshop are offered in this publication for the benefit of all who are interested in encouraging the teaching, learning, and research and of the contributions of black scientists to the life sciences and society.

Office of Education to concern itself with the reforming of undergraduate education as it relates to the education of teachers. Part of the process of reform is likely to involve the federal government's granting of money to institutions of higher education, to state agencies, or to schools. The essays in this book look at the relationship between the reform of federal systems and the reform of local systems. They suggest several principles: (1) Security in federal funding fields is likely to be related to the prestige of a field and its having arrived at a routinized and relatively secure method of winning information and advocating policy. (2) If the federal government is  interested in encouraging institutions each to have a unified institutional mission and if it is interested in creating humane higher educational communities, then its procedures for funding ought to reflect and support that concern through the modification or abolition of the training-grant system. (3) As the federal government develops its interest in permanent institutional change, it must grant money in such a way that its funds tie into the full permanent governance systems of institutions so as to secure their long-term commitment to the goal for which funds are given.

The questionnaire employed several strategies for determining member needs and interests, and their perception of the role that the AGB should play in serving those needs and interests. First, a number of frequent concerns of trustees and presidents were listed, with the task for the respondent to rate not the importance of each, but rather their relevance for AGB attention. Second, respondents were asked to rate the desirability of present or prospective activities of AGB. Other questions were directed to reaction to content of AGB publications, meetings, and conferences, and to proposed new content. Finally, respondents were asked if AGB should take a  more active leadership role, one less active, or remain about the same. Respondents were also given the option of writing a general answer to these concerns. This document presents a summary of the responses to the questionnaire. (Author/HS)",

Some observers hold that the efficiencies associated with industry reflect methods and skills that are widely applicable and somehow lacking in the health field. Thus, the task force responsible for this report was charged with studying the use of quantitative methods within the curriculum for health administrators. The specific charge of the task force was: (1) to examine the existing curriculum pattern; (2) to develop a concept of what exposure to the area is indicated; and (3) to develop materials that assist the graduate programs in teaching effectively in the curriculum area. This report suggests that quantitative methods, one of  the key management skill areas, has been underrepresented in the curriculum in terms of potential value to health management. (Author/HS)",

The data consist basically of analyses of the distribution of men and women currently employed within each of the 4 employment categories. Further analyses include examinations of sexual profiles over time, studies of hiring and promotional patterns for men and women, comparisons of qualifications and salaries for female-typed jobs and male-typed jobs, and comparisons of the proportions of  women employed in specific areas to the proportion of women available in the work forces for those areas. The Task Force attempts to identify and define problem areas in which employment opportunities for women do not appear to be the same as those for men. Specific courses of action are recommended to implement changes in these areas. (Author/HS)",

A mathematical model is formulated that relates faculty size, promotion rates, and tenure and nontenure lifetimes to the proportion in tenure and the annual appointment rate. Real data from the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University is used to analyze the effects of several different appointment, promotion and retirement policies in that School. Equilibrium results are obtained to indicate what would happen if a given set of policies were followed for a long period of time and all behavioral parameters were to remain fixed. In  addition, a short-run analysis is performed to investigate the extent to which an undesirable faculty rank distribution can be changed over the next ten years under altenative personnel policies.

The conceptual framework is presented in 3 parts. First, a model of the bargaining exchange process is sketched out. Second, an input model describing the structures, processes and behavioral relationships (independent variables) affecting the operation of the bargaining exchange process is developed. Third, an output model identifying the expected consequences of faculty bargaining (dependent variables) is presented. While faculty organizations are likely to have important effects on institutions of higher education, the framework developed illustrates that generalizations concerning the extent of the impact of  faculty bargaining are extremely hazardous without determining the way in which forces internal and external to a particular system operate through the bargaining system parameters to produce differential collective bargaining effects.

The study indicates that discrimination in varying degrees does exist on the Indiana State University campus, a condition that has been declared unconstitutional by the Federal government. Recommendations are made to alleviate discriminatory practices at the institution. Among these recommendations are the following: (1) the university shall reassert its support of the Civil Rights Act, declaring that it shall not discriminate against persons on the basis of sex or marital status in hiring, promotion, tenure, salary, or in any other area; (2) the President shall require departments or schools with few or no women to examine the national  degree lists and actively seek qualified women when appropriate; (3) the administration should conduct periodic checks to see where women remain in rank longer than men in the departments and then examine the procedures and seek explanations to prove that discrimination is not at work in those departments; and (4) the university shall take immediate steps to remedy salary differentials that exist for women presently on the faculty when the salaries of women suffer by comparison with those of men with equal training, comparable contributions to the university, and length of service.

Hiring and promotion practices at BSC have been such that a clear pattern of discriminatory practices against women can now be established, a condition that is clearly in discord with federal legislation. This study compares the salary and rank status of women faculty at BSC to that of men. The comparison is made on the basis of such factors as academic qualifications, tenure status, length of service at BSC, and rank. It was found that in almost all cases the findings are unfavorable to women.

Recent federal legislation makes it legally as well as morally imperative that employment policies in higher education afford equal opportunity to women. Under the law, institutions under federal contracts must be able to demonstrate positively that no discrimination exists in any aspect of employment and that affirmative action is being taken to remedy the effects of past discrimination. This places the burden of proof on the administration of a college to provide evidence of its innocence, rather than the employee or the Federal government to prove the administration's guilt. This document presents a description of a method utilized at the University of South  Florida to find specific corrective measures to eliminate existing and to prevent future sex discrimination.

In addition, RRPM 1.6 generates information necessary for the preparation of instructional program budgets. Institutional data, either historical or projected, may be put into the model. The model then calculates the program cost information and implied resource requirements to undertake any given series of programs. RRPM generates 4 different types of  reports: (1) organizational unit reports providing line-item budgets for various organizational units within the institution; (2) program budget reports indicating the discipline or department contributions to various instructional programs; (3) institutional summary reports; and (4) formatted display reports that show all parameter data for the institution.

These interviews focused upon the expectations people have of the university, how they get information about the university, and how they perceive the channels of communication between the university and the community. Although each of the segments of the general public stressed different news media as their source of general and university news, all of the groups made great use of television as a source of general news. It was also found that the general public are divided in their opinions as to the roles a university should play. Most of the respondents had a rather vague idea as to what is  possible in terms of the contributions a university can make to society. It is concluded that if the community at large is to be asked to support the university, the community will have to be given a much broader understanding of the various possible roles a university might play. In addition, the community will also have to be made aware of what the ramifications are if the university assumes added roles or chooses not to become involved in some areas of endeavor.

The former include (1) a statistical analysis of the number and ranks of women in the university, by department, as compared to men; and (2) a study of faculty salaries at the University of Wisconsin. There is an urgent need to remedy this situation. Federal law requires that special efforts be made to correct existing inequities. This means that everyone concerned with employment should search more diligently  for qualified women, and that until existing inequities have been eliminated, priority must be given to employment and promotion of women over men equally qualified for specific posts in accordance with objective academic criteria. In addition, the right of women students to enter professions of their choice must be matched by a right to equal treatment with men when it comes to employment in the profession. (Author/HS)",

The management model chosen to accomplish this goal unites the management-by-objectives model and the participative management model, and is called &quot;humanistic management.&quot; The rationale for this management philosophy is based on three propositions: (1) Science-based management can be adapted to educational systems; (2) The human dimension of educational management is best reflected in the active involvement of the educational community; and (3) The scientific dimension of management and the human dimension can be united effectively through participative management by  objectives. The model is described in relation to the management functions of planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation. Four interrelated program objectives are: (A) to develop an operational management model; (B) to develop a management training system; (C) to develop a management guide; and (D) to disseminate the results of the total management program on a national basis. Four program projects, one for each of the objectives, are summarized. It is believed that active participation in the management program has the potential for the following benefits: (1) more effective educational programs for students; (2) more effective supportive programs; (3) a rational basis for the allocation of resources; (4) improved staff development and staff morale, (5) improved communication, and  (6) a means for demonstrating educational accountability.

CCAF plots the career education of Air Force enlisted personnel, using service instruction as a core and guidelines established by the U.S. Office of Education and other agencies for two-year occupationally oriented, associate level programs. Certificate programs require a 64-semester-hour minimum, which includes at least 24 semester hours of technical education related to an individual's Air Force occupation, 25 semester hours of related education designed for personal enrichment and to enhance supervisory skills, and 6 semester hours of military management instruction. The related education is obtained  primarily from accredited institutions during off-duty time. After the initial development of the 77 career patterns, the curricula were reviewed against specified criteria, modifications were made, and advisory panels were identified for each of the career patterns. Subsequent to an annual review by the advisory panels, career patterns are modified by Career Division analysts as necessary, approved by the Policy Council, and are incorporated into the CCAF catalog for distribution. The catalog provides all pertinent information regarding the CCAF program, including the awarding of the Career Education Certificate. Follow-up studies are conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program in preparing the personnel for the roles of technician and supervisor, as well as to provide for  continuous CCAF program development.

Student withdrawals in 22 participating community colleges are now being studied in Phase III; this report concerns Napa College only. An experimental and a validation study were conducted at the college. The independent variable was special counseling services. Students in the experimental  groups who received special counseling services were compared with those who received routine student services, the comparisons being made at the end of the fall and winter quarters. These comparisons showed that the students who had received special counseling services had a lower attrition rate, a higher enrollment rate, a higher grade point average, and completed more units. The validation study compared, at the end of the fall and winter quarters, the performance criteria of students identified by the NORCAL questionnaire as potential dropouts with students matched on ACT test scores and sex. These comparisons showed that those identified as potential dropouts had a higher attrition rate, a lower reenrollment rate, completed fewer units, and had lower grade point averages. The results  of the two studies show that special counseling does help potential dropouts and that the NORCAL questionnaire is valid. A copy of the questionnaire is included. (DB)",

In terms of goals, vocational-technical transfers expected to get a job, while arts and sciences transfers  expected to continue school. Sixty-one percent of the reverse transfers were happier in the two-year college.

Each core was comprised of freshman orientation, math, English, a social science (a different one in each of the four cores), and a core seminar. The variables assessed were grades, attitudes of students and teachers toward the core, and locus of control. Attitudes and locus of control were assessed via questionnaires two weeks after the beginning of the semester and a week prior to the end of the semester. The program did not appear to realize its goals; non-core students tended to  rate their class experiences as better or more valuable than did the core students. While teacher ratings were higher quantitatively than their student ratings, their qualitative comments reflected a much more negative feeling. Student ratings of one of the cores reflected a better experience for them. The core experience tended to stimulate internal controls. Recommendations were made for: the formation of core faculty teams, selection of students and faculty on variables other than interest, and orientation programs and open discussion periods.

For English placement, 31 different programs were listed, involving 101 different responses with 43 indicating satisfaction, about 43%. Much  dissatisfaction with matriculation testing was with its poor use for English placement. Other dissatisfaction involved high costs to students, excessive time involved in administration, and lack of correlation between standardized tests and students' ability to write. The testing program recommended includes a diagnostic grammar test, a diagnostic reading test, a diagnostic math test including general arithmetic as well as algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, and a written composition--to be completed in about two hours at a cost to the student of not more than $3.00.

Most of the 13 have taken place within the past five years. Only recently have most events become powerful enough to have an individual effect on library practice. It is at this point in time, however, that a true synergy of the influence of these events is rendering the current level of library-micrographic knowledge obsolete. The 13 events to be discussed within the framework of this  report are briefly presented. The author describes the many types of microforms, explains the differences between each type, and discusses the uses, benefits, and drawbacks of the various microforms. Included are a discussion of related technological events of the past decade and a list of microform equipment.

Information is available on the amounts of federal and state funds for financing public library services. What is not known at the national level is the various revenue sources either used or available to libraries operated at the local level for the funding of their operations. The task of collecting useful data on income sources for the over 7,000 public libraries and library systems throughout the country is a formidable task. If, however, the problem is approached on a systematic basis, then the prospects for collecting such data are encouraging. This study endeavors to develop a method to  accomplish that goal. The primary purpose of this feasibility study was to develop recommendations which the NCLIS could use in conducting a comprehensive study of funding sources for public libraries. (Author/SJ)",

Three of the major conclusions of this study are that: there is a need for much greater standardization of the types of information collected; standard definitions and guidelines for measurement need to be developed and employed; and serious consideration should be given to collecting key statistics and data directly, on a sampling basis, from libraries not covered by collecting agencies and organizations participating in the LIBGIS program.

        "description":"The Merrimack Valley Branch of the University of New Hampshire became acutely aware of the need for trained library aides to assist in the local schools, industrial and public libraries of the greater Manchester, New Hampshire area. The administration also realized that there were many people in the community interested in (1) furthering their education and (2) increasing their employment potential. They identified the major premise to be that a paraprofessional course of instruction could make significant and urgently needed contributions to New Hampshire's libraries when wisely and efficiently employed in a climate of constructive cooperation. In this way, the service process of a library can be enriched to different degrees by library assistants. They are not intended to  replace professional librarians, but to take their place in the total service aspect, as part of a carefully coordinated approach to assistance, which helps deploy the resource appropriate to the need of the clientele. In 1971, the Office of Education, Bureau of Libraries and Learning Resources directed their Title 11-B funding to provide more responsive library services to disadvantaged and minority groups by recommending training members of such groups as well as others so that they too might enter the paraprofessional ranks as library aides.

It is also clear that so far technology transfer has not been as successful as we would like to see it. NASA pioneered the technology transfer concept, yet NASA's major de facto effort has been dissemination of technical information and not transfer of technology as was proposed. The technology transfer process goes through four successive stages: (1) search, (2) adaptation, (3) implementation, and (4) maintenance. The search stage takes the generator and user from an unrecognized transfer opportunity to  establishment of a viable contact. Adaptation can be termed the &quot;go - no go&quot; stage, the point at which a decision is made to proceed with the technology offered or move into another area. The implementation stage is the time to marshal the needed resources -- capital, organization, and human. At the end of this stage the technology is transferred, and all that is needed from then on is to maintain it, evaluating all effects and benefits. (ED 056 699 is a related document.) (Author/NH)",

        "author":["Heilprin, Laurence B."],
        "description":"The literature of knowledge is a very large system in the cybernetic sense of intractibility to control. Improving access to it needs some simplifying theory. A step in this direction is a hypothesis constructed from basic concepts. These include cybernetic concepts of variety and requisite variety; a version of the mathematical concept of homomorphic mapping; and information scientific concepts: an invariant 3-segmented information science (IS) path, and short and long duration modes of message propagation. Since all disciplines are symbiotic, defining a distinct IS domain is purely pragmatic. However, the IS concepts do define a domain, which acts as a reference frame convenient for locating the substructures necessary for cognitive access to literature. The most critical  processes in access occur in our minds, not in data files. Access to knowledge requires completing an IS path--connecting two minds across a variable physical segment. The special problems of access to the literature of the social sciences and the humanities are chiefly those of small classes with large variety to overcome. Certain variety-suppressing devices should be particularly helpful at this stage. However, there is a large, long term cost for the disciplines and professions concerned.

It was recognized that new measures were needed to gauge effectiveness while eliminating extraneous factors. Specifically, these two phases reported upon here were designed to (1) identify measurement criteria which would discriminate among public library services, (2) develop an operational methodology whereby local librarians could collect the necessary data for processing and refinement, and (3) demonstrate that the measurement criteria could be put into a theoretical model which would provide a  professional basis for assessing the activity of basic programs.

The experimental training program emphasized participant involvement in  program development and evaluation, intensive training experiences in cross-cultural communication, and the presentation of information on a broad range of relevant topics.

Its purpose was to formulate goals, objectives, program description and evaluation for effective secondary school library service. The librarians of the high school district drafted this publication. Although initially directed toward the implementation of Planning, Programming, Budgeting System, their ideas have been influenced by the implications of the Stull Bill for library service. Items can be stated one way to describe the library programs, but stated another way become a job description for the professional librarian and the supporting staff. Because of the Stull Bill it was decided to use the job rather than the program description. Librarians from all the secondary  schools of the district worked together to present goals that would reflect a composite viewpoint of service in a building level library. Since every library is different, any librarian making use of this publication will need to select, change and adapt these goals and objectives to fit their situation. Also, it is acknowledged that library service must change, grow and develop just the same as the educational system within which it works. Goals and objectives need to be reconsidered and reevaluated periodically. (Author/NH)",

It was felt that many participants from this area had less exposure to the LTA training programs and needed a more general summary to show the situation of the LTA. Throughout the workshop several salient points were emphasized again and again: (1) the need to re-define the role of the professional librarian and that of the LTA, (2) the need for a specific salaried position for an LTA, and (3) the need for further education of those already in the library field to understand better the potential of the LTA. The workshop was quite successful both in attendance and in the outcome  of the meetings as evidenced by these proceedings. (Author/NH)",

Output from the study will consist of three summaries and a detail report. Each summary report consists of one page, and reflects all nineteen campuses. The detail report displays statistics on each  activity, for each media, for each campus. In addition to demonstrating current costs, the study should provide a basis for examining the cost-effectiveness of potential automation of various library activities. To accommodate this later application, the system makes extensive use of tables. Three programs are being prepared, to input the raw data and output the reports. It is envisioned that these programs may also be utilized for examining other library costs, such as circulation control, should that prove desirable. (Author/NH)",

Existing knowledge and techniques are inadequate to meet the screening and assessment problems of central integrative dysfunction, inadequate environmental support, and severe auditory impairment. Current theory strongly suggests that a continuum of language and related information-processing central dysfunctions underly a broad spectrum of psychological developmental disabilities. Within this continuum are many categories associated with disorders of language development in which it is difficult to distinguish causes and effects. Language dysfunction in its more  subtle forms is probably more widespread among children than is commonly recognized. Audiometry and optometry are helpful in evaluating only the first-stage sensory impediments to effective central information-processing operations. Present assessment instruments, including observational inventories, visual perception tests, and language performance tests, are generally too primitive to detect the subtleties of underlying dysfunctions in language development. New assessment methods are very expensive, but major support should be given to accelerating their development. (KM)",

The criterion variables used were the results of two administrations (at the beginning and end of the school year) of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. The predictor variables were number of siblings, father presence or absence, ATA rating of neighborhood, status according to the Head Start poverty guidelines, and race. The data supported both hypotheses: (1) that variables describing parents ability to attend to their children, combined  with a general social class variable, can be used to predict intellectual achievement; and (2) that, having developed a regression equation using ATA and social class variable, the addition of ethnic variables will not significantly add to the predictive value.

After baselines were taken on two categories of problem behavior (Pre-Academic and Social Behavior) the social contingencies were applied successively to each category. The Pre-Academic task was quickly established in the child when the mother applied these social contingencies. This result was replicated with requests for social interaction. In the final phase, cueing was withdrawn from both situations and the mother was able to maintain the child's improved behavior. An analysis of the mother's behavior suggested that her increased use of social punishment for inappropriate behavior was the key factor in the  child's increasing responsiveness. Follow-up seven months later indicated that the improvements maintained. (Author)",

        "description":"The methodology discussed is used in ongoing research to contrast the effectiveness of several patterns of parental authority with the same children at different ages. The first characteristic of these methods is the use of trait and behavior ratings to assess dispositional tendencies. The construct of a dispositional trait is used to account for continuity and stability within the personality. Situation, particularly a laboratory setting, can strongly affect behavior, but the extent to which an individual's behavior is situation-specific is itself a dispositional property. The validity of ratings partly depends upon the observer's ability to project himself into the position of the subject. The second characteristic of this methodology is the use of multiple stimuli and behavior  settings. The three measures used here are self-report, interview and observation. Self-report avoids the problem of observer reactivity, but not of response set. Interview is useful in conjunction with observation; the symbolic meaning to the parent or child of the observed behavior is explored. The observational procedures used are laboratory experimental procedures, structured observations, and naturalistic observation. Safeguards to protect against bias in naturalistic observation are: explication of expectations in clear hypotheses, definition of hypothetical constructs, direct confrontation during data collection in which staff members correct each other's biases, and use of overlapping and intersecting sources of data.

The playgroup met for about 2 1/2 hours each Monday and Friday in a room containing a variety of toys and play equipment, with parental supervision. The playgroup was videotaped for one hour each Friday morning. Behavior was analyzed by locating all clusters on the videotapes, coding their duration, participation, and then  searching each cluster for measures of social intent. Results showed that: (1) clusters did not vary significantly across months in frequency, duration or number of children participating; (2) type of play activity did not relate to month or cluster duration; (3) despite a significant increase in clusters forming about inactive children, those forming around active children remained in the majority in month 3; (4) vocalizations and toy manipulations did not increase as expected; they were frequent even during the first month; and (5) the extent and complexity of social behavior increased during the three-month period.

Across subjects (sex, ethnic group, and grade level) verbal measures were poor predictors of recognition accuracy. Across stimuli, amount recalled and recognition accuracy were both related to amount of organization. Recognition was also a function of the type of transformations on the target that were used as distractors. For all transformations there was a close match between ability to recognize a transformation and judgment of dissimilarity of the transformation to the target. The TORSCA multidimensional scaling technique was applied to the similarity judgments to obtain a representation of a memory space for the targets  and their transformations. The structure of this space was highly consistent across subjects and indicated that transformations on meaningful pictures can be related to each other in stable ways. (Author)",

The position is taken that current efforts in this direction are based on outmoded hypotheses. Programs over the past 10 years have denigrated poor children by saying that the mind is plastic and that everybody can and should be smart. It was believed that if these children were given the right experiences, they could be smart as their more fortunate middle and upper class counterparts. Other injustices done to these children was to hold that they suffer from sensory deprivation and to insist that their real problem was an intellectual deficiency. The current movement to institute nationwide preschool education is criticized. It is concluded that social policy can not be  constructed on the basis of questionable psychological theorizing.

Data were obtained by observation of teacher-child interaction and supplemented by interviews with directors and teachers. The groups of variables examined were: teacher performance, structural factors (physical space, administrative framework, and program format), and staff characteristics. Factor analysis disclosed four patterns of teacher behavior: encouragement-restriction, conformity to routine, group teaching, and independence training. The most stable features of teacher behavior were: (1) activity level, as indicated by amount of verbalization and number of communicative episodes; (2) emphasis on working with children  individually or in groups; and (3) frequent use of either encouragement, with accompanying lessons in consideration and creativity, or restriction, along with lessons in control and restraint. Few teachers made extensive use of both encouragement and restriction; rather, they utilized one in the absence of the other. Teacher behavior within a center was found to be associated with quality of physical space, size of center, characteristics of staff, and responses of children. (Author/KM)",

Four bilingual paraprofessionals were trained to interview parents, administer the pre- and post-tests, and operate the incentive systems at each of the schools. Of the four schools, parents of students in two schools were provided with cash incentives for attending each session. Children in two schools were involved in a progressive incentive system. For every four weeks, there was a subskills test (pre and post) and a different incentive plan, which progress from immediate reinforcement to delayed reinforcement to social reinforcement. Results  showed that: (1) there was no statistically significant difference on the improvement of intelligence scores regardless of the child's motivational style or the incentive system used; (2) the parent and child incentive groups performed significantly better than the child or parent incentive groups on the visual discrimination test; (3) when intelligence is held constant, there was no statistically significant difference between ethnic groups on the Clymer-Barrett Pre-Reading Battery, but there was a statistically significant difference between ethnic groups on the informal reading readiness subskill test of matching letters; (4) the parent group receiving incentives demonstrated greater attendance behavior than those parents who did not receive incentives.

Specifically three questions are investigated: (1) whether 3- to 5-year-old black ghetto children can be moved further along the continuum of sorting ability to sort in two short but intensive training period; (2) which teaching method is more effective--the verbal method in which the child is given practice in sorting with verbal rules and labels supplied by the adult or the nonverbal symbolic gestural method where the child simply imitates adult actions or pantomimes his own; and (3) whether two approaches are differentially effective  depending on the level of difficulty of the task, defined here as sorting by color (easiest), form (next difficult), and function (most difficult because most abstract). Ss were 123 black boys and girls from children's centers in Watts. Each child was seen twice individually and provided with a training period and refresher session between pre-testing and post-testing. Both types of training were shown to have a significant effect, but either type was as effective as the other for color and form. Verbal training was more effective for function sorting. Boys performed better with nonverbal training, and girls performed better with verbal training. (KM)",

        "description":"Age differences affect children's understanding and evaluation of television content, and these differences may be related to social behavior after watching television. One type of age-related changes concerns changes in the cognitive skills that children must use to comprehend content. Studies have shown that children as old as third graders remember little of a plot, that children's knowledge of the motives and consequences for aggression increase with age, as do their abilities to reconstruct sequences and identify causal relationships. These qualitative changes reflect cognitive growth involving learning of task-relevant cues, aspects of memory, improvement of selective attention and inferential abilities. A second type of age-related changes concerns changes in the bases  that children use for evaluating social acts in general. Studies have shown that children of different ages are likely to use different criteria for evaluating a televised model's actions; there is a major shift at about age nine or ten from consequences-based to motive-based evaluations of actions. These age differences should be a major concern in future work on the television viewing-social behavior relationship. For very young children, representations of aggressive acts they have seen on television often stand along as guides for later behavior, while older viewers are much more likely to have a representation of the action modified by knowledge of the motives and consequences associated with it. Studies of the idea of a cognitive mediator, a conceptualization of the mechanism for  the effect of a single television program, are underway. Apparently the temporal contiguity of motives, aggression, and consequences facilitates comprehension for younger children. (KM)",

        "description":"Recent studies suggest that the language deficiency often attributed to disadvantaged children, especially disadvantaged black children, is not a language deficit so much as a difficulty in dialect switching. The disadvantaged child's language patterns are different from the language patterns of the child from the mainstream of American society. A child's language may vary from accepted school language in vocabulary, pronunciation, or the manner in which the child puts words together in sentences. Non-standard English-speaking children are as linguistically competent in their language as standard English-speaking children are in theirs, but important differences exist between them in the uses made of their language. Teachers of young disadvantaged children should accept the  language they bring to school, respond to what they say without correcting them, and focus language teaching on extending their linguistic performance. Linguistic performance can be extended by conversing with the child, asking questions that encourage lengthy answers, and using classroom materials relevant to the disadvantaged child's subculture. Disadvantaged children need to be helped to use their language to label, describe, categorize, and generalize. Three aspects of children's verbal functioning that should be improved through a language program are: attention and auditory discrimination, explicit language use, and language structure and vocabulary.

        "description":"The specific research objective of this paper was to make racial comparisons on the consistency dimension of the projected frames of reference of adolescent males from the rural South. Data were obtained from a population of high school sophomores in 3 Texas and 2 Georgia counties. Complete data were available for 223 white and 192 Negro males. Findings indicated that a majority of both races had status aspirations which were of different levels, although few of either race were totally inconsistent. White males were more likely than Negroes to be consistent in their aspirations. Large majorities of both races demonstrated inconsistent anticipated frames of reference, although more distinct racial differences existed for the vertical dimension of the anticipated frames of  reference. A comparison of the 2 frames of reference revealed some horizontal inter-frame variation. Males of both races were less consistent in their expectations than in their aspirations, although this was true to a greater extent among whites than Negroes. Further research needs were other important status variables, e.g., material possessions, leisure time activities, residence, and additional research on consistency of the projected frames of reference of youth.

This testimony dealt with the devasting effect of common educational practices upon Mexican American children in the Southwest. The last witness, however, was the UCSD superintendent who described his district's bilingual program, its conception, and the results. The program was designed: (1) to enable the Spanish speaking child to progress normally by instruction in his native tongue while, at the same time, teaching him the English language; (2) to take advantage of his knowledge of Spanish language and culture to broaden the education of  all of the children, including Anglos; and (3) to create an atmosphere in the classroom conducive to more wholesome self-concepts and relationships among the students. Included were examples of the leadership exhibited by this district and suggestions for other districts attempting bilingual education programs, soliciting support from the community and beginning the program although conditions may not be ideal.

        "description":"From its inception, the United States has been faced with the problem of how to treat with the American Indian nations and tribes. This problem is many-faceted: who should deal with Indian affairs; how should the Indian be treated--as citizens or as independent nations; how should the redman be parted from his lands, which were coveted by the white settlers; and whether the government should civilize, remove, or exterminate the Indians. In 1789, Congress delegated Indian affairs to the newly created Department of War where they remained until 1849, when they were transferred to the Department of the Interior. In the years following the transfer, the Department of War began agitating for the return of the Indian Bureau. Various religious bodies, humanitarian societies, Indian  agents, and many of the Indians themselves joined forces with the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to oppose the transfer. Both factions accumulated thousands of pages of data, tables, testimony, and assorted documents to defend their positions. The controversy came to a head in 1879, then gradually died out over the next 20 years. The purpose of this thesis was to examine the transfer problem--its proponents and opponents, its implications, alternatives, and the views of some of the Indians themselves. (Author/FF)",

The sample consisted of 76 second year students; 39 students in a naturally assembled class were the control group, and 37 in another class were the experimental group. The main treatment experienced by the experimental group was a 4-day, off-campus outdoor education experience. Four scales were used to measure student perceptions toward the structure of educational experiences, the learning environment, student to student relationships, and student and teacher relationships. A pretest and 2 posttests were administered. It was found that the program contributed to statistically significant and favorable  changes in students' attitudes on 3 of the 4 scales related to conditions that existed in the professional education classes, that it had no statistically significant effect on attitudes concerned with student to student relationships, and that it may have caused a favorable change in attitudes toward what should be a desirable condition in the elementary school. Recommendations included that the interdisciplinary program should be expanded, that the study be replicated, and that different treatments be measured. (PS)",

        "description":"The monograph provides a brief framework for exploring individual differences of the American Indian student. The individualized program of teaching and learning is designed to account for individual differences in the broadest terms. Emphasis is placed on the idea that educators must address themselves to the knotty problem of changing the educational sequence for children into one of constant challenge with each day a successful day and without a daily frustration level which tends to destroy initiative and the desire to achieve. The authors believe a successful individualized program can be developed through the cooperative effort of all those who desire to improve Indian education. The individual child must be given the opportunity to develop the skills and concepts necessary  to live in a bicultural society. Teachers must be sensitive to and cognizant of ways to provide opportunities for the Indian child to identify with and feel a pride in his heritage. Four areas of consideration in designing an individualized instructional program are discussed: (1) the situation--education for the Indian child has failed because his cultural identity has been ignored; (2) the individual--the teacher must understand the setting out of which the child appears each day; (3) the involvement in curriculum development by parents, tribal leaders, educators, and curriculum designers; and (4) the program--techniques for teaching.

It is further concluded that, while the pattern of deprivation is similar in all parts of the state, the intensity of deprivation varies from region to region. Demographic data; the selection procedure; and attitudes toward life, school, cultural orientations, and vocational education (VE) are discussed for students, VE graduates, dropouts, employers, parents, and community and school personnel in the summary section. In the recommendations section is a discussion of &quot;The  Manpower Background.&quot; It is indicated that Mexican Americans are poorly represented in the statewide labor force and that, historically, there has been a gap between developing jobs and vocational patterns which would affect all VE students, especially the Mexican American VE students. General recommendations are made in the areas of career education, the organization and planning of vocational programs, post-secondary vocational/technical education, and communication. Some areas in which specific recommendations are made include the retardation of educational achievements, the Spanish language, bicultural courses, the tracking of students, role models, and agricultural migrants.

        "description":"In the last 20 years, progress has been evident in the increase of enrollment in all stages of education in Asia. Tremendous efforts have been made to provide primary education for the remotest villages in the Asian communities. However, the concept that primary education is a means for fulfilling the obligations of human rights and for making rural children literate is not adequate. In the 1970s, a different approach must be implemented in rural education. New innovations in curriculum organization; provision of modern equipment and materials, better textbooks, and instructional teaching aids; more creative methods of teaching; preparation of better teachers; and more efficient school supervision and administration are envisaged to be given more consideration in primary  education in rural communities. The following basic concepts should be treated as directives in creating a ruralized curriculum: (1) self-realization in the rural community, (2) economic awareness of the rural community, (3) social and cultural cognizance of the rural community life, and (4) civic responsibility toward the rural community. The rural communities will be the backbone of economic development in Asian countries for decades to come. Education can contribute to the needed rural reform and community development. (FF)",

The results were then compared with the answers of experts in the cultures.

The students comprised a homogeneous group for the representation of the values of the present generation culture.

Data reported in this paper were obtained from the first part of a larger 3-year panel study evaluating the effects of court-ordered busing on majority and minority student achievement. The sample consisted of 860 7th to 12th grade students in public schools in Waco, Texas, and a random sample of 380 dropouts from the Waco public schools during the 1970-71 school year. The specific variables identified were self-concept, racial/ethnic membership, family socioeconomic status, measured I.Q. score, parental authority structure, achievement value orientation, school racial/ethnic climate, school  socioeconomic climate, school status-inschool/dropout, and composite achievement score. It was concluded that school racial-ethnic climate exercised the largest effect on variance in Mexican American achievement test scores. With all other factors controlled, Mexican American achievement scores were higher in desegregated school climates while Anglo achievement scores were higher in segregated facilities. The factor which exercised the second largest effect on Mexican American achievement was self-concept, followed closely by measured I.Q. It was further concluded that segregated school climates produced more Mexican American dropouts while desegregated school climates produced more Anglo dropouts. (HBC)",

The findings indicated (1) that 4 out of 10 Indian households surveyed claimed that their total household income was below the $3,000  poverty line; (2) that Indian household heads under 35 were more likely to have high school diplomas than those 35 and over; (3) that well over 1/2 of the rural Indians surveyed resided in homes which were either deteriorating or dilapidated; (4) that the infant mortality rate among Indian children was significantly higher than it was among Michigan's population as a whole; and (5) that better than 4 out of 10 rural and 5 out of 10 urban respondents expressed a conviction that conditions would improve over the next few years. Recommendations and detailed findings relative to each area are provided. The questionnaire utilized in this survey is included in the appendix. (HBC)",

The studies were conducted in South Texas during the spring of 1967, in El Paso during the spring of 1973, and in Southern Colorado during the spring of 1969. The sample used in the South Texas study consisted of 596 sophomore Chicanos from 7 rural high schools in 4 counties close to the Mexican border. In the El Paso study, 310 Mexican American sophomores and seniors in 12 metropolitan schools in the El Paso and Ysleta school districts were interviewed. The Colorado study used 667 Mexican American students from 11 rural junior and senior high schools. The subjects were asked  to respond to a questionnaire on the use of Spanish. The comparison of the findings indicated (1) that the Chicano youths in Colorado use spoken Spanish less but read more in mass Spanish language publications, (2) that the Texas Chicanos use more spoken Spanish but read less in mass Spanish literature, and (3) that the use of Spanish over English is not meaningfully related to the levels of aspiration. The findings of each study are presented in tabular form. Related documents are ED 023 511, ED 023 512, ED 040 777, ED 051 943, and ED 053 852. (NQ)",

In the discussion of mental ability and development, and mental health, it is contended that Indians are simultaneously enculturated and socialized in 2 different ways of life: one being a contemporary form of our traditional life-styles, the other  being the mainstream Euro-American culture. These attempts at enculturation and socialization provide an explanation for the failure of Indian students to achieve in an academic environment. Other topics of discussion include \"Tribal Control of Indian Education,\"\"Motivational Factors for Education,\" and \"An Economic Development Program for the Reservation.\" The summary contains an outline of the tasks, their purpose, the anticipated results, and the implementation processes necessary to enhance the educational process for Indian students on a priority basis.

One area of concern in the development of a program for Native Americans is their high attrition rate in college. Specially designed programs for the Native American student could offer (1) Native American student orientation programs, (2) mini-workshops on note-taking, the use of the library, and research paper writing techniques, (3) academic, financial, and personal counseling services, (4) tutorial programs, and (5) social \"get acquainted\" activities. Another problem related to the development of NAS programs is the necessity of having a majority of faculty and staff of the same ethnic origin as the students. Once the program has begun to solve these 2  problems, a third problem results: too few Native American college graduates return to their home environment or reservation, or even find their way into Indian-oriented organizations--wherever they may be located. It is further contended that although the Indian student can become involved in such a program, the courses included in the curriculum must be academically sound and responsive to and reflective of the needs of its particular students and community. It is concluded that the finished product of NAS can only result through the initiative taken by Native Americans and educators to incorporate time-tried perspectives into the new academic perspective of NAS.

This absence of knowledge then causes adjustment frustrations for both the teacher and the students. Some suggestions for recruiting and producing better teachers of non-Anglos include (1) retrainig existing staff; (2) cooperating with colleges of education to help prospective teachers learn enough of an American Indian culture and language to deal effectively with children of that culture and language; and (3) taking as candidates people who are native to the area, familiar with the language  and culture, and accustomed to the isolation and distances involved in living and teaching on a reservation. Additionally, the origin, administration, and organization of the Navajo-Hopi Teacher Corps Program are discussed. A competency based teacher education program is noted as one of the outstanding features of the Teacher Corps Program.

Communications problems for Indian people are two-fold: the first emanates from within the individual tribal societies, and the second arises from the nature of mass communications today. Indian communications should function in an inward direction toward the  rebuilding of the tribal community and in an outward direction toward interpretation of the external society. The 2 immediate bases for media development in the immediate future are the preliminary network of communications already in existence and the media training programs in the Federal schools and universities.

The control group consisted of 100 children of the same age. The experimental group met 2 hours a day, twice a week. The first hour was devoted to cultural education and the second primarily to recreational activities. During the second hour, the children were taken 1 to 3 at a time to be counseled or tutored. They met in learning centers, partitioned to minimize distractions. Self-awareness sessions  were often included. Criticism was avoided and the child was allowed to express his feelings. Findings indicated: (1) that delinquency declined in the area serviced by ARRIBA, (2) that self-concepts of ARRIBA youths significantly improved, (3) that ARRIBA youths made significant academic gains, (4) that ARRIBA youths made positive gains as indicated by teacher assessments, and (5) that grafitti on community property apparently declined.

Different does not necessarily mean disadvantaged; the mono-cultural orientation of schools in the United States has perhaps needlessly created educational disadvantages for all pupils. The reaction of educators to the problems of under-achievement and alienation as they relate to racial and cultural minority groups has in the past been to intensify the use of traditional approaches. However, the special educational problems of culturally different populations require a new approach, and the minority groups themselves have very definite ideas about how the school should react to multicultural situations. These groups believe that the culturally heterogeneous school is  not totally dependent on pedagogical needs but must also be based on democracy and individual freedom. The problem of the education of the culturally different is the problem of educating all pupils in such a way that the school is both relevant to the individual and to the full heritage of the region and of the nation.

        "description":"Based on data collected in March 1972 and March 1971 by the Bureau of Census as a supplement to its monthly Current Population Survey, this publication reports on persons of Spanish origin in the United States. The data were derived from replies to a question on origin or descent and on replies to additional questions on other population characteristics. The sample was spread over 449 areas comprising 863 counties and independent cities with coverage in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The estimating procedure used involved the inflation of the weighted sample results to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States by age, rece, and sex. The independent estimates were based on statistics from the previous decennial  population census; statistics of births, deaths, immigration and emigration; and statistics on the strength of the Armed Forces. The tables give statistical data on such characteristics as demographic characteristics, age, sex, use of the Spanish language in the home, family status, size of families, place of residence, educational attainment, employment status, occupation group, and income. Demographic, social, and economic characteristics are presented separately and in some combinations for persons who identified themselves as being of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish origin.

Twenty-five people, mostly Indian, were surveyed using a semi-structured interview form. Comments were solicited following each of the structured questions. Some conclusions drawn from the study and from the review were: (1) The data indicated that 96% of the persons interviewed were interested in having 4-H clubs on the Reservation; (2) Respondents felt that individual development is more important than completion of 4-H projects; (3) Projects in which respondents were most interested included Crow legends, clans, environment, and native foods; and (4) It would be of value if Reservation  Extension staff had a background in human relations training or if they could attend educational conferences, do graduate work, or take part in educational courses related to Indian culture and people. Recommendations for improving this program covered encouraging Indian college students interested in youths to work on Reservations under the work-study program and involving Crow Indians in all phases of a program's development, its support, and its leadership responsibilities.

It is stated that the major barrier to the Indian's success in American society is the attitude of the Anglo towards the Indian. Thus, the programs and legislative proposals designed for the Indian are usually irrelevant to reservation life. Supported by statistics, this condition is apparent in health, education, economic development, and unemployment. Education is the prime concern in achieving a new Indian life style. Obstacles to adequate education are found in the home, the environment, and the educational process. Specific obstacles in the home include inadequate study facilities,  an oppressive social environment caused by crowded living conditions, inadequate income for clothing and recreation, and minimal educational heritage. The report concluded that non-Indians must be more responsive to a heterogeneous population and recognize the right of the Indian to decide his own future. (HBC)",

The maldistribution of resources is described by geographic and socioeconomic factors, income protection programs, schooling and vocational training, farm income supports, rural housing, and rural-urban allocations in Federal programs. The need for professional health and legal and social services is described, along with ideas on area development versus income  guarantees. It is concluded that the Maldistribution Thesis will not likely be put to an adequate test until the political climate in the nation, and particularly the South, shifts away from maldistribution and toward redistribution.

Hypotheses were formulated to determine differences in educational and occupational aspirations and expectations based on ethnicity (Mexican American and Anglo American), sex, grade level, and type of school program. Responses were analyzed using chi-square and analysis of variance. Findings concluded that students in all groups had high aspirations and expectations for education and  occupation. A statistically significant difference was found between Anglo Americans and Mexican Americans and between males and females. Generally, Anglo Americans had higher aspiration and expectation levels, as did males compared to females. A significant difference was also noted among the 3 school programs, i.e., the academic group was generally higher than the general and vocational samples. (Author/HBC)",

Individuals directly involved were trained to administer and interpret the Gesell Developmental Examination, which places a child in school by behavioral rather than physical or I.Q. age. The professional instructor was trained in: child psychology; curriculum development and curriculum trends; philosophy and techniques of organizing, conducting, and evaluating and  ungraded multi-age unit; and working with teachers and teacher aides. The second phase of training was for the associate teacher and teacher aides. This 19 week undertaking consisted of 6 major thrusts, such as determining specific teaching duties and implementing developmental grouping. The project provided 5 objectives such as (1) a new pattern for staffing rural elementary schools and (2) a new design for teacher education.

These pupils were specifically identified as migrant or non-migrant. These data were then mpared with the teacher's perception of the pupil as migrant or non-migrant. Summary data on the significant differences in teacher behavior indicated that more teachers in each of the categories of positive, neutral, and negative behavior interacted less with migrant students than with non-migrants. Twice as many teachers in the positive class and more than 3 times as many in the neutral interacted less with migrants. The totals of significant teacher behavior were almost equal in the negative category. It  was further concluded that teachers with a more direct teaching style tended to favor the non-migrant student. It was recommended that a replication of this study be conducted during the normal school year to ascertain whether the same results would be found and whether a study objectively identifying migrants and non-migrants would have similar findings.

Analyses are made in connection with placement status at each degree level, major curricula of favorable and unfavorable job climate, expected graduate shortage, student trends in schools accredited by the Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD schools) and non-accredited schools, starting salaries, and chronological  comparison. Job prospects for next year's graduates are characterized as excellent or good. Graduates of ECPD schools are more likely to continue further study in comparison with those from non-ECPD schools. The strongest demand is in civil engineering, followed by mechanical engineering; strong demand of women and minority members is found in all branches.

One first-semester mathematics class of 23 elementary education majors and one second-semester mathematics class of 31 elementary education majors participated. Four videotapes covering topics of addition, multiplication, subtraction, and order of integers were developed. Class activities for each of the four tapes included reading pre-tape information which included AOs, viewing the tape, post-tape activities and discussions, and a homework assignment. The effects of the level of abstraction of the  AOs on the learning of the students were measured by a portion of the final examination scheduled about two weeks after the instruction.

Results showed that as group size increased, so did the total group fluency, flexibility, and originality; however, groups with three members were statistically indistinguishable from groups with six members. In terms of flexibility, six-member groups generated no more categories of responses than did twelve-member groups.

The Hidden Figures Test (HFT) was used to provide measurement of the cognitive style of flexibility of closure; an achievement test was administered following the treatments and an alternate form administered at the end of the semester to measure retention. Results showed no differences between treatment groups on  achievement or retention and no significant interaction between flexibility of closure and treatment.

Ninety children, 30 from each of ages four, six, and eight, were tested. Six items were given to each child in four modes; for each item the child indicated a \"most like\" and a \"worst\" preference. Results showed there was no significant interaction between age and mode, that age had a significant effect on the \"worst\" preference scores but not on \"most like\" scores, that test mode affected both preference scores, and that for two of the test modes the mean scores based on number of times copies not topologically equivalent to the  model were selected as being \"most like\" the model were significantly above chance means of all age levels. The conclusion saw that the results do not support the theory that topological concepts develop prior to Euclidean and projective concepts in the child's representational space. (DT)",

Descriptions are included of course objectives, characteristics, structures, and content. As a two-semester course of study for science and engineering sophomores, most topics are on a level comparable to that of classical physics by Halliday and Resnick. Passages of four college-level physics textbooks are used as reading assignments. In the material development, emphases are placed on instructional objectives represented by core problems, an exposition through enabling and competence check problems, an iterative process of successive tryouts, and a self-instruction theory with minimum tutorial support. Contained in the whole set are 18 problems and solutions books, 72  study guides, 25 videotapes, 25 talking books, 25 illustrated texts, 12 quarterly diagnostic tests, remedial problem sets, one student manual, two instructor's manuals for course and laboratory, three laboratory manuals, and one enrichment volume. The course has been used for three years at the U. S. Naval Academy through an extensive trial-and-revision process. (Related documents are SE 016 066 - SE 016 088 and ED 062 123 - ED 062 125.)

Naval Academy. Following an executive summary, an introduction to course characteristics, and an overview of the project, statistical tests are discussed in connection with discriminant analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and step-wise regression. Sample data from one experimental group and two control groups, collected during the Fall 1969 tryout from weekly posttests, final examinations, and reported proctor time, are used together with background scores in statistical calculations. Relationships are determined between audiovisual and non-audiovisual groups and among the variables, and student  performance including differences resulting from individual test items is studied in relation to study guides. Learning category, confidence, and difficulty ratings are also analyzed. As a result claimed in Technical Report 5.6, this multi-media course is at least as effective as traditional courses. Besides 53 tables, the formula used in discriminant analysis and the learning category taxonomy in a problem form are given in the appendices.

        "description":"Two distinct strategies for teaching the solution to verbal problems were compared. Programs of instruction were prepared that reflected the Polya Method (read and understand the problem, plan for a solution, carry out the plan, and check the result) and the Dahmus Method (translate the verbal statements into mathematical symbols prior to solving the problem and checking the solution). A form of individualized instruction was used to present these programs to 53 ninth-grade algebra students classified into three ability levels based upon Algebra Prognosis Test scores. Following seven days of instruction, data were gathered on an investigator-constructed posttest and retention test which were scored on an equation criterion and a problem solution criterion. Results showed that  Polya Method students scored higher than Dahmus Method students on the equation criterion but there was no difference between the two groups on the problem solving criterion, that scores on both criteria are highly resistant to forgetting, and that ability level differences occurred.

Probabilistic automata were defined and tested for basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication exercises. Results of detailed application of the register machine models are unpublished and will appear subsequent to the date of this final report. The results of analyses indicate that the kinds of models  developed can be applied to learning and performance in elementary mathematics, and have implications for detailed pedagogical procedures of instruction in these basic skills.

S. experiments; the question of resources for future development of our own society; security needs; examination of differing viewpoints toward foreign policy; investment possibilities; and study of anti-Americanism. While geography supports the logic of unification that has made Americans and Canadians neighbors and allies, history and economics have not made the two countries amiable partners.

        "description":"This paper describes test development efforts for measuring achievement of selected concepts in social studies. It includes descriptive item and test statistics for the tests developed. Twelve items were developed for each of 30 concepts. Subject specialists categorized the concepts into three major areas: Geographic Region, Man and Society, and Map and Globe Study. The items were administered during early summer of 1970 to 196 girls who had just completed the fifth grade and during the fall of 1970 to 195 boys who had just begun the sixth grade. Some of the major conclusions are: 1) reliability estimates obtained for both total concept scores and total task scores are sufficiently high to warrant study of the dimensionality of these social studies concepts and the dimensionality  of the tasks when using social studies content; 2) the three area distinctions seem not to be important ones; 3) the difficulty item indices obtained indicate that these items are of appropriate difficulty levels for these subjects; and 4) almost all the items have desirable levels of discrimination indices when the item is both a part of a concept criterion score and a task criterion score.

It assumes that: 1) arting is an ultimate realm of man's experience; 2) it includes artistic causality, idiosyncratic meaning, and intentional symbolization; 3) it is a unitless psychic phenomenon of the artist's stream of consciousness; 4) the researcher must be close to the creating stream of consciousness; and 5) this demands a special participant observer role. The data are based on collections of artists' extended drawing series. Knowledge of their construction comes from shared histories stimulated by time-lapse records of drawing processes. The synthesized information is the  basis for exploration of modes of description and analysis. The emphasis is on qualitative description of the case as an idiographic history, not as a type. The world view and method is contextualism. The study explores 1) presentational modes close to the artist's stream of consciousness and 2) historical and interpretive modes twice removed from the creating stream of consciousness. It ends with a summary and critique of the delineated modes. (Author)",

A model for matching these teaching strategies to students in terms of their learning style is described and its construct validity is discussed. Principles of matching according to variation in conceptual level form the basis for this model. Coordination of teaching strategies with this conceptual level matching model requires that techniques be described in terms of their degree of structure. Problems in the implementation of this plan are noted and educational arrangements which are best suited to meet specific student needs are discussed.

One of a series of eight reports, covering the various disciplines, this study surveyed juniors and seniors in schools in four geographic regions who took either the American History and Social Studies test or the European History and World Cultures test of the CEEB during 1965-66. The report is divided in three major parts: an over-all view of courses in history and the social sciences which these students had taken; what was included in these courses and how, in brief,  some of them were taught; and what was the preparation of the students in the areas covered by the tests. Analyzed are periods of time covered, supplementary reading materials, grade level of course offerings, required courses, world areas studied, textbook use, and assignments. A followup in 1970 or 1975 is suggested for comparison and to facilitate the evaluation of the impact of changes and new materials.

The educational systems are examined within the following contexts: Literacy Training; Educational Levels (which considers the question of access to formal education); Comparison with European Societies in the Past; Comparison with Present-day European Societies; Performance of Educational Systems; Education, Urbanization, and Income; and Education and Social Structure. The concepts, changes and expansion of secondary education are discussed. The conclusions suggest that education should not be prolonged above the requirements of the economic system of a country, that funds needed to insure primary  education for the whole population should not be expended on unneeded secondary education, that upward social mobility is unbalanced when secondary education is provided to more individuals than can be absorbed by the economy. The capacity of political systems to absorb citizens demanding participation is considered: the expansion of education could contribute to social change and economic development which would alter the character of a political system.

The overall objectives of the program were to increase teacher capabilities and to incorporate selected concepts and methodologies from two national projects with the social studies courses of the Prince George's County secondary schools. The institute focused on two phases, the first being familiarization of the materials and teaching strategies associated with the High School Geography Project (HSGP) and the Sociological Resources for the Social Studies (SRSS).  The second phase concerned development of projects integrating materials and teaching strategies of the two curriculum projects into the local curriculum. Activities consisted of peer teaching of selected activities of the HSGP and SRSS, a retreat, work periods, and cluster/level meetings.

Although polarity in beliefs was expected, it failed to emerge, and, instead, there was merely a difference in scale position. The pacifist students emerged as distinctly worldminded and tended to favor a socio-psychological control of aggression while the ROTC students were neutral toward worldmindedness and  emphasized organization solutions toward aggression. However, a remarkably high level of agreement between groups was found regarding ways to achieve peace, the differences being matters of focus. The relationship of worldminded attitudes to peace proposal preferences suggests that the preference for direct control of aggression at the interpersonal and international levels is the minority orientation in the world today, mainstream peacethinking being primarily organizational in nature.

It is suggested here that those who are already doing this can contribute by offering suggestions to others trying to implement the world principle in their classrooms. Those who are not prepared to use this basis should be shown the opportunity it provides to integrate world views into provincial studies. Those who believe that it is too simple, should note that there is power in its simplicity. The provincial-universal principle can be tested by implementing the comparative-analytical approach in the social studies programs which will require defining the terms, describing the relationships, specifying  examples, and reporting successes and failures in efforts to implement the model. To illustrate the point of dealing with the local and the world principle, the author offers a comparative - analytical approach toward migration of the Mormon and Boer pioneers. In conclusion, a world curriculum for U.S. students allows for analysis and reflection, synthesis and re-synthesis, and further, can produce citizens of the world and citizens of the U.S. who are insightful and knowledgeable about cultures and mankind.

For example, the government of each nation within its own political culture is considered legitimate when the public's attitude toward the nation is positive. The public holds attitudes toward the process of selecting officials, certain obligations which the government has to its populace, guarantee of rights, and provision of goods and services. Although sometimes failing to provide output expected by the populace, the government still exists because, in many cases, effective political socialization  tends to keep a government legitimate during periods of crisis.

Educational problems such as unequal opportunities, undefined goals, inadequately prepared teachers, and confidence gaps exist. Although the primary responsibility for educational improvement rests with the citizens of each state, the state education agency has a major leadership role, in cooperation with local school systems, other educational institutions and organizations, other state agencies, the legislature, the governor, and federal education agencies. The state education agency can help establish goals and policies, needed  changes, determine priorities, and assist with implementation, evaluation, and accountability. The listed directions in which most state education agencies are moving are new and desirable. Citizens and their public officials need to join with educators at all levels to make fundamental improvements essential to meet the rapidly changing needs of society.

        "description":"In this paper the author questions whether teachers should be held accountable in social studies. Accountability is viewed by the majority of educators as having its own merit due in part, perhaps, to recent emphasis placed on behavioral objectives and the way in which these objectives allow for performance measurement. Care must be taken that what is measured is not meaningless information. However, the more relevant educational perceptions, skills, understandings, and conclusions emphasized in the new social studies are difficult to put into behavioral objective terms. It is advocated that educators be held accountable for their actions, rather than the actions of others. Teacher accountability should relate primarily to the skills or process dimension of social studies, to  arranging the necessary environment, and providing meaningful social studies topics from which students can make selections. When educators are held accountable for student actions, the thinking and actions of students become controlled to produce manageable, measureable behavior essentially at odds with the new social studies. In conclusion, the student, rather than the teacher, needs to be accountable for knowledge, skills, attitudes gained from the encounters planned by the teacher. (SJM)",

Inquiry as an activity of student investigation is examined. The distinction is made between student-centered and scholarly-based inquiry in social studies classes. Two perspectives are discussed--inquiry as a process and inquiry as described in terms of the meanings, conceptual structures, or understandings which the inquirer brings to and takes from his encounters with the data of experience. The author concludes his discussion with his definition of inquiry teaching as any and all teaching activities directed toward securing student inquiry. (SHM)",

An assessment of the University of Georgia Anthropology Curriculum Project's Race, Caste, and Prejudice (RCP) provides a case example of the use of this qualitative model in educational research. The researcher's assessment of RCP focuses on the category of classroom interactions--the sensitivity of students to material and situation, and class ethnic composition. It is concluded that information collected on interactions among pupils, teachers, materials and environment collected through qualitative research techniques renders practical and utilitarian value to educators.

Addressing three major points, the monograph discusses the types of situations calling for conceptual analysis, the definition of conceptual analysis, and aids for those interested in conceptual analysis. Conceptual analysis is called for when key concepts employed are either vague and/or ambiguous. Secondly, clarification of key terms is at the basis of sound research. The analysis of a concept is an act of investigation that focuses upon the use of language, and more specifically, upon the meanings which are implied in the use of language. Suggestions for those pursuing conceptual analysis are to locate a resource person skilled in the  clarification of educational concepts and to do reading on one's own. A brief annotated bibliography of books that provide insights into what conceptual analysis is along with insights into techniques and procedures concludes the paper. (Author/SJM)",

Such comparisons show the sameness of people yet show different cultural heritages and living styles. Population centers and their comparative study also lend themselves to an interdisciplinary and conceptual approach in the social studies. The exemplary unit, open-ended so that additions can be made by individuals using it, specifically compares Detroit with Montreal. Outlines are included on major objectives, central  concepts, knowledge and information, habits and skills to be achieved, values and appreciations of two cities, approach and introduction, content, selection of materials, important outcomes, culminating activities, and evaluation. The major portion of the document includes three appendices: A) Background information on Detroit containing history and a description as it is today; B) Current Bibliography of Children's Books and Trade Books on Canada and the United States; and C) A Description of Montreal.

Selected from over five hundred films previewed from 1969, up-to-date films were chosen that would help interpret the causes of war, increase awareness of the dehumanizing effects of war, or suggest alternatives to war as the means of resolving international conflict. The films are arranged by subject categories that cover such areas as international law, nonviolent social change, world development and world community, armaments and disarmament and international organizations, the social and psychological roots of war, conscience and war, area studies and democratic processes. A variety of program aids, useful to  high school and college teachers, include suggestions for planning film programs, model discussion guide and study units, a list of resources, and selected background readings. In addition, a film and book bibliography on peace is provided for elementary children. Annotations give detailed information on date of film, length of time to run, director, producer, and a brief summary of film. Feature and recommended films are identified, and all films are cross indexed by title. (SJM)",

        "description":"In this monograph, the author presents a thesis that a genuine, pervasive innocence of perception underlies mature productive originality, and that it is based upon progression from the sense of awe and wonder and the natural spontaneity of childhood into integrated adult functioning with fine command of ways and means acquired through discipline and technique. An overview of major findings resulting from previous researchers at the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research on highly creative persons serve as the base for theory. In a study of creative architects, findings show that for certain activities a specific minimum I.Q. is probably necessary to engage in the activity, but that beyond the minimum, creativity is uncorrelated with I.Q. Moreover, other research  findings suggest that it is a function of style or modes of experiencing that mark the highly creative person. Three stylistic variables of highly creative persons are that they are more perceptually oriented, intuitive, and are able to discern and to prefer more complexity in whatever it is that they attend to. To conclude, \"In the creative adult, the child remains fully alive.\" (Author/SJM)",

The units are intended to add to the secondary school program certain fields of instruction that are important to the development of today's students. The guide is in three sections. The first, &quot;Man: The Maker and Product of Culture,&quot; directs the students' attention to the distinctively human capacity for symbolic expression. Culture is seen as a relatively stable design for living and encompassing shared social values, a shared system of behavioral norms, and a common technology. The second, &quot;Man: The Social Action,&quot; examines the &quot;self&quot; as a product of symbolic interaction, with culturally defined expectations organized  about the performance of &quot;roles&quot;. In the third, &quot;Man: The Builder of Social Structures,&quot; man is seen as a participant in relationships, groupings, and social systems that have an intelligible structure which can neither be reduced to nor derived from a study of the behavior of individual actors. Teacher innovation is encouraged in usage of the units to achieve the objectives. The rationale, suggested activities, and emergent themes are given for each topic. A bibliography of Canadian learning materials, listing books, articles, films, and reference texts for teachers, is included. (JMB)",

Teams of specialists from eight states met for 3 days with consultants from the National Science Foundation, the Office of Education, and the National Education Association. Before the conference began each state submitted a brief report of what it had done concerning environmental education. During the sessions participants were asked to respond to 3 major objectives by identifying: 1) the contribution of subject areas to a comprehensive  program of environmental education; 2) the contribution of interrelated approaches to environmental education; and 3) new strategies of implementation and sources of funding for comprehensive environmental education programs. Responses to these objectives constitute the bulk of the report. Abbreviated versions of each state's report, and a list of conference participants are included. (Author/OPH)",

Varied methods included reviewing related literature, consulting theorists in this problem area, writing research memoranda, and trying out promising ideas. Findings show that there is little direct use by practitioners of the vast banks of educational research findings. Volume I of the report sets forth the conclusions and recommendations to emerge from substantive inquiry into the nature of the problem of knowledge utilization in education. The first part of the document offers a summary statement toward a reconceptualization of  knowledge utilization in education. Program strategy recommendations for action within institutionalized education and policy recommendations for agencies like NCEC to devote more attention to provide learning opportunities outside institutionalized education are offered. Also included in this volume are critiques of two scholars who offer their reactions to the report and recommendations. Related documents are ED 061 468, and SO 005 889 through SO 005 896.

        "description":"Supporting general recommendations of the main body of the study contained in SO 005 889, this report suggests ways of approaching a reconceptualization of knowledge utilization in education at the policy making level. Since education is viewed as a life long process, there is need to establish and maintain a mass media system (especially television broadcasting in its commercial and noncommercial forms) that utilizes in the development of its programs the kinds of knowledge that are crucial for the survival of society as a whole. Dangers of a technological bias may hinder rather than advance the cause of education if there is not a concern for individual human development and recognition of the potential needs of all members of society. It is recommended that the U.S. Office of  Education consider questions of mass communication development, use and regulation as integral parts of the larger question of equal access to and opportunity for equal education. Nine sections are provided on The Historical Framework, Current European Developments, Mass Media and Education, The Educational Nature of TV, Political Control of TV, the Underlying Philosophy, Improving the System, Suggestions for Further Studies, and Notes and References.

Major constraints are explained in terms of sheer numbering, standardized materials, State Boards of Education, Local School Boards, Community and Peer Social pressures, and teacher education.

It is hoped that this collection of articles,  which report on selected foreign initiatives and practices, may offer insights to U.S. planners in the field. The fourteen articles do not attempt to provide full analyses of these activities, but rather are intended to alert concerned American specialists about experiences in Sweden, France, Pakistan, and the U.S.S.R., and elsewhere. The articles draw heavily on foreign sources and are well-documented with references that provide useful starting points for any further analysis. (Author/OPH)",

Many people both in and out of the teaching profession are aware of the complex conditions required if the profession is to be accountable. To secure such conditions, teachers must have the major voice in deciding those matters that relate directly to teaching. Even then there must be recognition that the outcomes of education are dependent on many factors, some not wholly controlled by educators. The definition of accountability includes many dimensions and will require refinement. Questions remain regarding performance criteria and performance contracting;  criteria for evaluation of teaching ability or learning products; and questions of responsibility not only for basic reading and arithmetic skills but also for interpersonal behavioral skills, a broad range of subject matter content, and wholesome attitudes and values. Accountability needs to be considered in the broad context of accountability under what conditions, by whom, to whom, for what actions and outcomes, and to what degree and over what period of time.

Two consequences of this phenomenon are that reading ability is strongly and negatively related to the social class of students and teacher movement is negatively related to reading ability.

Because of this, it is important for teachers to consider the philosophical, psychological, and sociological ramifications of their teaching behavior and their organization of the curriculum and learning environment. Teaching behavior hinges closely on the learning environment. In this century, the learning environment is constantly expanding, and a confluent, pluralistic curriculum is the only alternative for including this environment into the school situation. The teacher must now be initiated into this new type of curriculum in order to prepare students for an expanding learning environment. An expansion of methods courses in teacher education programs is being implemented to develop this expanded learning  environment. Methods courses are being combined for flexibility. This flexibility allows the prospective teacher to work in learning laboratories, schools, and the community. Team teaching, special projects, and open-plan schools are being investigated. The methods courses focus on problem solving and creative expression. Self-evaluation by students in these courses promotes self-confidence and emotional growth which is necessary to facilitate change in curriculum. (BRB)",

Each of the 34 teachers was observed in live classroom teaching for 30 minutes on three different occasions. From the 102 observations and tape recordings, it was possible to obtain three different behavior ratings according to the Flanders System of Interaction Analysis and the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior. Statistical comparisons were  made to determine overall differences among the four groups. Results suggest a positive relationship between the concerns of teachers and subsequent verbal behaviors in the classroom.

Emphasis is placed on the origins, themes, methods of operation, and future plans for teacher centers. The origins include the revolution in teacher training underway in England, the stress placed on ongoing in-service teacher training in the United States, and the movement toward competency-based teacher education and certification. The major themes stress the felt needs of the teacher, a school improvement thrust, and a need to increase teacher competency. Three styles of operating teacher centers are discussed: the informal English style, the corporate style, and the competency-oriented style. A 29-item  bibliography is included. (MJM)",

Four groups of prospective teachers were randomly selected from a total population of 487 students. Each group consisted of 15 students--freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors--majoring in either elementary or secondary education. Five test instruments were used to measure the prospective teachers' open-mindedness, self-actualization, self-concept, relationship to students, and degree of inclusion. After pretesting, Group A was assigned field participation; Group B was given classroom experiences; Group C was assigned field participation similar to Group B; and Group D received  neither field participation experiences nor classroom experiences. Posttests using all test instruments were administered.

The conference, sponsored by the Physical Education Division of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, provided educators with the opportunity to examine major conceptual viewpoints of perceptual motor behavior, to review visual displays of many teaching methods for the benefit of perceptual motor performance, to hear research in progress that seeks new information needed to improve school programs, and to pinpoint conceptual issues in this field. Coordinating these objectives, the papers in this publication are divided into four sections: I--Foundations of Perceptual Motor  Learning; II--Practices: Action and Interaction; III--The Quest for Understanding; and IV--Resource Materials. A list of the conference participants is appended. (BRB)",

Interns were student teachers working toward their Ed.M. degrees; assistants were college seniors or parents supported in a college  program. The administration consisted of one practicing and one prospective administrator; the prospective administrator acted as team liaison to the community, the school, and the university. In-service team teaching started in September 1972; results are to be analyzed in terms of attitude change, student evaluation, participant evaluation, and climate analysis.

Students from different undergraduate majors were given 10 weeks of guided experiences in interviewing and program designing. This was followed by field experiences involving actual consultation with Headstart, preschool, or hearing and speech clinic cases. Students interviewed referral teachers for 1 hour, designed behavioral programs tailor-made for the referral cases, then reconvened with the teachers to instruct them on the implementation of the programs. All programs were designed so as to be implemented by the teachers themselves with their own resources. Follow-up data indicated that such programs were successful in  effecting the desired changes in the target children's behaviors.

The program was based on the concept that prospective teachers should be provided with extensive opportunities to work and observe in formal and informal educational settings early in their academic career. The following goals of TEE were based on this concept: a) to provide student teachers with the opportunity to evaluate teaching as a profession and b) to provide participants from the educational community with the opportunity to observe systematically and evaluate student teachers. TEE was divided into three phases: Phase I consisted of coordinated seminars, workshops, and demonstrations; Phase II provided the students with the  opportunity to investigate teaching skills and current trends in education; Phase III actively involved the teacher candidates in self-selected encounters. After completion of Phase III, the candidate determined his status in TEE.

The three components, faculty, students, and public school teachers, were dedicated to developing each child's psychomotor, cognitive, and affective domains. The program has resulted in the establishment of an ungraded primary school with a multimedia learning center, continuous in-service training for the Colbert teachers, and on-the-job experiences for various  graduate and undergraduate students and student teachers. Increased relevancy between theory and practice has been gained by both faculty and students through the restructuring of certain required elementary methods courses and through interaction seminars in which the specific needs of rural children are discussed. Early exposure to the classroom has also been beneficial to the undergraduate student. (Author/JB)",

Three questions were addressed: what contact with and information about Ritalin do teachers have; what attitude do teachers express toward Ritalin; and what professional behaviors do teachers report in regard to Ritalin use in classrooms. One hundred fifty teachers were selected from Grand Rapids Public Schools as subjects and were administered a questionnaire determining general familiarity with and attitudes toward Ritalin. It was found that teachers' contact with Ritalin was extensive, but their knowledge about the drug was questionable. Teachers were cautiously accepting of Ritalin but were in conflict about its use and the  inconsistencies involved therein. As professionals, teachers were shown to be relatively isolated from the medical profession, only receiving one-way communications about the drug from school system specialists. Implications of this study indicate the need for a coherent educational perspective regarding the use of Ritalin as a behavior modifier. (Nine tables of data are included.) (Author/JB)",

Emphasis during the junior year of the program was upon working with the individual pupil: first, as a tutoring one-to-one tutorial setting; then as a teacher in small-group activities; and finally, as an instructor of a class. The focus of the 2-quarter senior program was the socioeconomic setting and the effect of socioeconomic factors on the school: first, in a half-day teaching assignment divided in time between two schools in contrasting contexts (inner city,  suburban); then, in a full-day teaching assignment in single school, usually one of those from the preceding quarter's experience. Observations and audio and video tapes were employed throughout the program to aid the preservice teachers in evaluating their professional growth in classroom performance. Evaluation indicated that teachers prepared by the program were significantly better than conventionally prepared teachers. (Author/JA)",

A 4-year sequence of practicums was installed. Courses in community study were planned to help the student adapt to any community besides the inner city.

To gauge the differences between secondary and elementary school teachers in these relationships, a revised version of the Problem Analysis Questionnaire (1960) was used. Eighty-one teachers, 38 secondary and 143 elementary, completed the questionnaire which was centered on a problem with a student that had no satisfactory solution. The results showed the secondary school teachers scored higher on all levels than the elementary teachers. This implies that the secondary teachers were more aware of interpersonal teacher-pupil conflicts. The greater responsibility of a teacher in secondary schools, the greater interdependence in  the secondary school system, where communication is an issue, probably contribute to this result. Also, the culture of secondary schools provides more grounds for adult-adult interaction than the culture of elementary schools which is family-like. The results indicate that teachers should respond to the organizational and human context within which they work. (JA)",

The objectives of the program are to improve the knowledge and understanding of Texas teachers and students about other American cultures. Study teams of educators research and, in midsummer, travel to selected countries. (Past trips have included Argentina, Canada, Haiti, and Brazil.) On their return, reports are made and instructional programs of slides, movies, and tapes are developed for circulation throughout Texas and later to other states. The program contributes to teacher education in that the 98 participating teachers experienced an immersion in the 27 countries visited that would have been impossible if they had traveled as individuals.  (Included with this report are the script of a slide presentation entitled &quot;What is PROGRAMA?&quot; and a list of study aids produced by PROGRAMA. (JA)",

The allocation of resources is continually re-examined, using student growth compared with educational purposes as the guide. The Educational Accountability Act of 1971 of Florida has five major thrusts: (1) the development and implementation of education assessment  procedures; (2) the establishment of educational accountability in the public school system; (3) assurance that education programs in the state lead to the attainment of established objectives for education; (4) the provision of information for accurate analysis of the costs associated with public education programs; and (5) the provision of information for analysis of differential effectiveness of instructional programs.

Population-invariant item and ability calibrations along with the statistical equivalency of any two item subsets are supposedly possible if the item pool has been calibrated by the Rasch model. Initial research has been encouraging, but the relation of underlying assumptions and computations in the Rasch model to trait theory and trait measurement has not been clear from previous work. The current paper presents an analysis of the conditions under which the claims of objectivity will be substantiated, with special emphasis on the nature of equivalent forms. It is concluded that the real  advantages of the Rasch model will not be apparent until the technology of trait measurement becomes more sophisticated. (Author)",

The structure of the responsive evaluation follows the primary components of the instructional program. The choice of tests and other data-gathering devices is made based on observation of the program in action and interaction with various interested groups. Responsive evaluation is particularly useful during both formative and summative evaluation. The  principal stimuli of responsive evaluation are those of the program, including responses of students and subsequent dialogue. The responsive approach tries to respond to the natural ways in which people assimilate information and arrive at understanding. Program portrayal may feature descriptions of persons, often by case studies.

Are there differences in achievement between skills?; (2) What educational needs can be inferred for Massachusetts' students, based on basic skills testing?; (3) Do testing data reveal the influence of Federal programs?; (4) Does the product of education vary according to available resources--financial outlay, professional support, materials?; and (5) Are there regional variations in abilities and achievement? Aptitude and achievement data were obtained for 324 school systems, 1488 schools, and 85,382 fourth-grade children. The test instruments used were the Comprehensive  Tests of Basic Skills and the Short Form Test of Academic Aptitude published by CTB/McGraw-Hill. Three different reports of the test data were supplied to all school systems. The test data showed that the state as a whole exceeded the national norms; the mean &quot;obtained&quot; scores were significantly higher than the &quot;anticipated&quot; scores in all areas measured by the tests of basic skills. Highest scores were in reading comprehension and the lowest in arithmetic. From the test results, it was concluded that Massachusetts fourth graders are slightly higher than the national norms in all areas measured. Correlations between the subtest total mean scores by school are statistically significant and very high. Schools that did well on one subtest generally did well on all subtests. A survey of school  superintendents showed that 98% used the test data. (DB)",

The comparison was made for small samples for three distributions, including a normal distribution, a uniform distribution, and a skewed distribution. The properties of each test compared were the probability of a Type I error and the power against a location-shift alternative hypothesis. The present research indicates that the permutation t-test is an acceptable statistical procedure for the two-sample problem for the normal and uniform populations and suggests that it might be more desirable than the traditional Student's t-test when sample sizes are proportional to the means and the parent population is nonnormal and asymmetric. Further  research is needed before a more definite statement can be made about the permutation t-test when sampling from nonnormal populations. (Author)",

        "description":"A critical examination is made of standardized social studies achievement tests from a psychometric and reading perspective. Five major issues are identified that detract from the meaningful interpretation of student performance on standardized social studies tests. The issues discussed are (1) the reading dependency of social studies items, (2) the picture-dependency of social studies items, (3) the cognitive skills assessed by social studies items, (4) the lack of an adequate system of item development, and (5) the lack of content validity. Each of the issues is defined and related to test validity and interpretation. The central theme of the study is the inadequacy of the content validity of most standardized social studies tests. Unless test publishers specify more explicitly  the elements of content and types of behavior sampled on their tests, test users will have great difficulty in making meaningful interpretations of student performance.

The general objectives of the project were to meet the following needs of the enrolled retarded young people: (1) to improve self-image through activities to promote socialization skills; (2) to develop leisure time skills and independence; (3) for training in the use of community resources; (4) for travel training; (5) to improve employability potential through work experiences; (6) to orient new students to the Occupational Training Centers; (7) to provide vocational and  personal guidance; and, (8) to improve physical fitness. In order to evaluate the degree to which these objectives were met, repeated site visits were made to the two Summer Occupational Training Centers. It was found that the two centers had quite different approaches to meeting the objectives: whereas one center used a carefully preplanned and highly structured program featuring &quot;tracking,&quot; the other used a less structured, more flexible, and in certain respects, more creative program.

The primary purpose of the program was to assign educational assistants to help the kindergarten classroom teacher and to provide services for the children. The kindergarten educational assistants were assigned to work six hours a day, three hours in the morning and three in the afternoon. It was thought that the added adult would make it possible to provide individualized instruction within the classroom. The adult would assist the teacher in developing improved  attitudes, skills, and habits in accordance with specific objectives established by the teacher and group. As part of the project, services were also provided for the nutritional (lunch), emotional, and social needs of the program. The objectives for this project were established to accomplish: (1) Readiness for Reading in First Grade; (2) Listening and Speaking Skills for First Grade; (3) Beginning Reading for Individuals; (4) Personal Experiences; (5) Increased Self-Worth; (6) Social, Emotional, and Physical Growth; and, (7) Scholastic Achievement.

During the 1969-70 school year, 44 such ASSC's functioned throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Most of the programs operated three days per week from three to five p.m. Attendance in all cases was on a voluntary basis and enrollment was on a first-come, first-served basis with referrals made by the regular classroom teachers with parental approval. The primary curricula of the ASSC's involved remedial reading, remedial mathematics, language arts, and communications skills, especially for non-English speaking children,  and various Afro-Puerto Rican cultural programs in some centers. Some centers also offered library programs and a variety of dramatic, art, and music programs. The following procedures were used to evaluate the extent to which the program objectives were met: fifteen centers were visited and reported on. A total of 99 children were randomly sampled from these 15 centers for intensive study. The regular classroom teachers of the participating students as well as 47 ASSC staff members completed questionnaires concerning their impressions of how the centers were operating and made recommendations concerning their improvement.

About 184,000 low-income families participated in the program prior to October 1969. A national sample of 10,500 showed that family incomes were very low--less than 2,700 dollars, of which more than a third was spent for food. Most families were urban, members of minority groups, and had homemakers with relatively low educational levels. Food consumption practices of homemakers upon entering the program indicated that many families had poor diets. After six months of EFNEP participation, substantial improvements in food knowledge and consumption practices were evident, particularly in the consumption of foods in the milk and fruit-vegetable  groups. Homemakers with the poorest diets showed more improvements than those who had better initial diets. Homemakers receiving more visits from program personnel, a measure of intensity of program instruction, increased their consumption of foods in the milk and fruit-vegetable groups more than homemakers receiving fewer visits.

Consequently, the research proved more harmful than helpful, thereby providing no visible or appreciable payoff or benefits to the black community. Moreover, the perspectives of the white researchers were misguided and misfocused. Instead of defining a psychology of the black community and how it has managed to survive in this oppressive society, they focused almost exclusively on the pathology of the ghetto and made intensive and extensive analysis of the victims of the system. Bold strategies must be developed for bringing about an immediate and full cessation to the rape, exploitation, and plunder in the black  community by insensitive mercenaries who called themselves researchers. Black professionals and black people must maintain a constant vigil in order to prevent the continuation of the sacking and pillaging so rampant in the black community. An example of such a strategy is a community control group established in Boston in 1970 by the Boston Black United Front. [This document is reproduced from the best available copy.] (Author/JM)",

For example, any valid interpretation of the role of leadership in the process of school desegregation would have to take into account the initiatory action of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In direct opposition to the goals and actions of the NAACP, were racist groups and individuals who insisted upon the maintenance of complete, total segregation of schools. After carefully examining communities which have undergone the process of desegregation for almost 20 years, what has been learned that may help to make this  process more orderly and rewarding in the future? (1) Court decisions regarding desegregation must be clear and unequivocal; (2) There must be an attitude of compliance with constituted law on the part of top school officials; (3) The support of the white elite or &quot;power structure&quot; is essential; and, (4) There must be a well-organized, respected black leadership class.

Fifty students, 40 black and ten white, were selected for the program for high-risk minority group students, and granted admission to Shippensburg for the Fall of 1970. The Prep students spent six weeks on the Shippensburg State College campus, attending special classes in English, speech, humanities, science, and mathematics. In addition to the director of the Program, his assistant, and the instructional staff, 10 undergraduate &quot;tutor-counselors&quot; were available to help Prep students with their personal, social, and academic adjustment to college life. In order to evaluate changes in study habits and attitudes, the Brown-Holtzman Survey of Study Habits and  Attitudes was administered to the Prep students at the beginning and at the end of the six week Prep program. The Prep students tended to report more negatively on their study habits and attitudes at the end of the Program. This seems to indicate that the Program did not attain its goal, but it is possible that the negative change in scores does not represent an actual decline in study habits and attitudes but a more realistic self-report.

When its establishment was approved by the Toronto Board of Education, it was designed to exist as a distinct alternative to the regular secondary school program. However, to ensure that students would not lose a year of their education should they leave the program, the students are required to take languages, science, and mathematics from qualified teachers. These subjects are taught, however, in a different way compared to the regular methods. One of the aims of SEED is to offer the student a wide variety of studies in which he can participate. If a number of SEED students develop an interest which is not currently taught, they may  attempt to contact someone in the city community who is interested in teaching them. They, along with their newly-found resource person, or catalyst, design a course curriculum around that specific interest. Since SEED offers the student a chance to participate in his own education, a high level of maturity is necessary. There are over 60 non-credit catalyst-taught courses at SEED, over and above the &quot;core,&quot; traditional subjects given by the four core staff teachers. (Author/JM)",

The Bureau team agreed to organize data, formulate a series of specific models, test the models by means of a computer program, and present alternatives to the Superintendent. The four alternative attendance plans described in this report are offered to the Superintendent of the Bakersfield City School District for his study and consideration. The computer program enables the team to measure physical characteristics of the plans, and to ascertain whether, in  gross terms, they are feasible and consistent with the purposes of the study. Two of the plans that have been developed would retain the present grade pattern, kindergarten through grade six in elementary schools, and grades seven and eight in junior high schools. The other two plans depart from that pattern at the elementary level only, dividing the schools into primary (K-three) and intermediate (four-six). (Author/JM)",

Like words and phrases, behaviors carry specific meanings which may vary across cultures. When teachers are not aware of cultural differences, when they assume that a behavior has a particular meaning while students assume it has another, then there is a misunderstanding--a breakdown in communication. One basic reason for the failure of Puerto Rican students in mainland classrooms is the lack of communication between them and their Anglo teachers--due to a lack of crosscultural sensitivity. The purpose of this research project was to find evidence of culture conflicts, resulting in miscommunication between Puerto Rican students and Anglo students. Four classes in a Boston  public school were observed and tape recorded, and information compiled on Puerto Rican culture and the Anglo teacher subculture. The findings encompassed instances of miscommunication manifested by the behavior of the students and teachers which could be explained by their respective cultural norms.

Four waves of data were gathered from 2,213 boys comprising the sample, who were clustered into 87 different high schools throughout the country. Additionally, because of the special interest in the school environment, data were collected from the principals, counselors, and samples of teachers in the participating schools. The efforts reported in this study are based on the attempt to outline a practical procedure to be used in longitudinal analyses of Youth in Transition data, the major aim being  to develop a strategy which can be applied to most, if not all, of the analyses to be performed. The report develops a \"parallel prediction\" model for longitudinal analysis, which makes separate use of each repetition of the criterion dimension; it is contended that the proposed strategy is widely applicable in studies employing panel designs. The proposed model was applied to a limited set of analyses of the Youth in Transition data. Early identification of subgroups was seen to have a facilitating effect in longitudinal analysis.

In the second part of the report are recorded the strategies felt most effective in helping poor and minority group children to learn as described by the teachers who were cited as exemplary by their principals. These relate to such issues as teacher and pupil expectations, pupil motivation, self concept, self esteem, goal  achievement, physical environment, psychological and social environment, academic environment, and reading ability and programs thereof, and to \"de-fusing\" issues such as poverty, racism, bigotry, welfare, and abandonment.

As a result of the latter, the research reported in the study was done in a multi-ethnic working class ghetto-like neighborhood in New York City, about 45 percent black, 45 percent Spanish-speaking, and 10 percent white. Methodology encompassed participant observation with considerable time spent in the schools themselves, interviews with staff, parents, and children,  examination of peer effects in playground settings, and a full teaching schedule totalling about 26 full time equivalent months spent in the variety of field settings examined. Findings include aspects of authoritarianism in the schools, the undemocratic nature of schools, and the conflict between the symbols, ideals, and myths of the school and the political reality of the child's life.

The purpose was to examine the idea that schemas may be destroyed or modified by specific methods of interference using a retroactive inhibition model. Pictorial scenes were generated and shown to the children individually until a schema was formulated. These scenes were then removed, modified, and represented to check for schematic retention. Retention was tested by recall recognition. Temporal sequencing caused schematic loss. Irrelevant interferences produced the least amount of schematic loss. Both recalled and recognized schemas showed little effect of the interferences. Since all interferences were systematic  modifications of the original scenes, when S realized he was being presented a set of scenes, he substituted an anchor schema for the original. This anchored schema became the new schema, and the original schema was generally lost. Analyses indicated that children of this population may be less subject to losing schemas as to having them systematically modified by interferences which supplant the original schema. (Author)",

The inner-city child, whose basic skills are often less advanced than those of his suburban counterparts, drops further behind as he grows older. Furthermore, few programs are directed toward changing the basic attitudes and academic skills of high school pupils who have a history of underachievement. This report is an evaluation of a project that was conducted in the Summer of 1971 in the Atlanta Public School System, directed toward attitude change of underachieving high school and elementary school pupils. The project also attempted to effect a change in basic language study skills of these pupils by using the Youth-Tutoring-Youth (YTY) model, which is currently  being implemented extensively throughout the United States. The basic situation common to the YTY concept involves underachieving high school pupils teaching underachieving elementary school pupils. Preliminary findings collected by the National Commission on Resources for Youth, Incorporated indicates that both the tutor and the tutee gain valuable reading skills as a result of experience in the YTY program, noting that some tutors have gained as much as three years in reading skills over a period of one semester.

Robinson Elementary School during 1970-71 includes information on the following: (1) supporting programs and goals; (2) instructional program; (3) management and product evaluation, and cost effectiveness; (4) inservice and workshops, and, (5) conclusions and recommendations. There are many tables of statistics to substantiate the information. (Authors/SB)",

Forrest Elementary School serves a low-income community and receives ESEA Title I aid. Faculty planned to look at the effectiveness of its program in raising the reading levels of pupils in grades K-3, since it was noted that many of the students were reading below their assigned grade levels. With the initiation of the Peabody Rebus Reading Approach in the first grade, it was decided to study only the progress of the first grade pupils. The experimental approaches used were a basal reading approach using traditional orthography (BR-TO) and a basal reading approach using rebuses (BR-Rebus). The Metropolitan  Readiness Tests, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, and the Student Attitude Toward School Inventory were used as evaluative instruments. Findings indicated that the BR-Rebus method was not superior to the BR-TO method on both pretest and posttest; that first grade pupils had a positive attitude toward school; and, that attendance did not affect achievement.

The document presents only an assessment of the program's effectiveness insofar as achievement of product objectives (behavioral changes in students and other participants) is concerned, the processes or procedures used to achieve various program products having been assessed in an earlier report, the Interim Evaluation Report. Among the findings were:  (i) teachers felt that the learning of a second language for Anglos was enough of an advantage to the students to include them as participants of the ESEA Title VII program--and the evaluators felt that the program must enhance its efforts in this area; (ii) analyses of sociometric data did not yield clearly discernable results--it being not possible to argue that the program had generally improved mixing between Puerto Rican and Anglo children; (iii) in word knowledge, reading, and mathematics, it was found that the program classes showed a positive and, in many cases, significant growth; and, (iv) in general, there was no significant difference between the program and control children on T-tests done on scores for self concept.

Twenty-four school districts in California, Nevada, and Arizona participated in the training sessions. Evaluation and documentation was conducted by WRSDP and CRL, both informally during the training sessions, and formally by structured and open-ended questionnaires. The triad of volumes of the full report, of which this booklet is Volume 1, capsulate the activities of those who attended the training sessions.

Puerto Rican and Anglo students in the younger age groups had a daily Spanish lesson; Puerto Rican children were also given English as a second language (ESL) lessons. The older children attended their regular classes in the morning and were given subject matter lessons in Spanish as well as ESL and Spanish language lessons. The evaluation design for the program was modified several times due to time and money constraints; the evaluation as performed concentrated on the more traditional product evaluation as well as a description of procedures carried out to assess student change in the areas of language development and self concept and/or attitude towards education. Among the findings  were the following: (i) there was management which seemed to be aware of the problems in the program and which would take steps to make adjustments in the program; (ii) overall teacher performance was rated as quite satisfactory; (iii) course outlines were considered more than adequate when supplemented by Spanish language materials; (iv) the dissemination program aimed at the Anglo teachers had failed; and, (v) no significant difference could be made on the student self concept scales.

        "description":"This review focuses on 16 studies in which the effects of tutoring were measured using student achievement, being limited to studies appearing through 1969. Additional studies that the authors subsequently found are considered to still support the conclusions drawn in this review on the general characteristics of successful tutoring programs and successful tutors; and to support the value of directed, structured tutoring when pupil achievement is the criterion. In six of the studies examined in this review, posttest achievement scores for tutored pupils were found to be, in statistical terms, significantly superior to scores of control groups. However, since these results are frequently not presented as grade equivalent scores, it is considered difficult to assess the  effectiveness of tutoring in any educationally significant terms. In two other studies that were \"successful,\" nagging questions about the design and outcome measures had been raised; two additional studies which did not have control groups showed one group of middle school pupils as making reasonable progress in reading, and no gains at all in the second project. In five other projects, there were no statistically significant differences between the pupils in the experimental and control groups. Four studies which reported objective data on the effects of tutoring upon tutors were found to be inconclusive; objective measures of affective changes were either nonexistent or showed no significant differences due to tutoring programs.

This study is a direct result of the school board resolution. Among the findings were that: (i) district assignment and recruitment practices were seeking to maintain a pattern designated in the Montgomery v. Carr court ruling, and simultaneously attempting to improve faculty racial balance in employing new staff; (ii) blacks hold the lesser-ranked and lower-paying jobs among classified personnel positions; (iii) the proportion of blacks in administrative posts has increased somewhat in the past year, 1970-71;  (iv) there exists severe racial isolation in pupil assignment patterns--only five Dayton schools appeared to be nonsegregated; and, (v) the ongoing program is to be commended for its efforts in communication between staff, students, and the community. Among the recommendations were that all pupils in grades 6-8 should be assigned to middle schools, some of the older, less-suitable buildings be abandoned and those schools closed, blacks in the elementary schools be redistributed to a 44.9 overall average, schools be clustered by economic levels, and the assignment of elementary pupils be made in each of the clusters by the principals affected in cooperation with the central office staff.

        "description":"Variables expected to be associated with academic achievement were examined in a sample (generally exceeding 2500) from eight secondary schools in Baymon Norte, Puerto Rico. Concern was whether variables associated with academic achievement differed by sex or by socioeconomic status (SES). Multivariate analyses of variance with three factors of achievement, sex, and SES were made. High achievers tended to have accepting mothers, parents low on Hostile Psychological Control, and low on autonomy; and were more geographically mobile, had fewer siblings, were more intelligent, obedient, conscientious, artistic, group-mined, placid, self-disciplined, responsible, anxious (preocupado), mature, and less excitable. High schieving girls were less authoritarian, dogmatic, and test anxious,  and gave fewer false but socially desirable responses. Students whose academic achievements were consistent with their SES were more assertive, less bragging, happier, and more esthetically sensitive than those whose achievements were discrepant with their SES. Self concepts were higher for achievers, especially for low SES students in junior high schools, and for all students in high schools. Low achievers, especially boys, disliked school. High achieving boys and low achieving girls were more self sufficient, while low achieving boys and high achieving girls were more group dependent. (Author/RJ)",

The developmental reinforcement process is composed of a hierarchy of four levels. Development takes place in succession beginning with the primary level, proceeding to the social and symbolic levels, and ending with the abstract level. Each level in the hierarchy is dependent upon adequate development at the primary level. If the child does not learn to respond constructively to primary reinforcement, it is unlikely that he will learn to respond to reinforcement at higher levels. (Author/RJ)",

        "description":"Occupational orientation, one of several titles used for a movement that is affecting all levels of public education, is an area where industrial arts can play a significant role. There is a strong relationship between the two, and the implications for occupational education are important and valid for industrial arts in an era so profoundly affected by industry and technology. Educators must help individuals understand their potential, capabilities, and emotional and psychological qualities. Industrial arts can make a significant contribution by helping the individual to: (1) understand himself, (2) develop societal awareness, and (3) develop fundamental skills. Each of these areas deals with the general educational development of people with no specific identification of fixed  manipulative skills, jobs, or occupations. They are in essence broad areas of competence vital to effective occupational orientation. (Author/GEB)",

        "description":"In view of the continued growth of vocational education, vocational educators have recognized the importance of leadership and have initiated educational programs to insure that competent professional personnel will be available in the future. This review and synthesis paper identifies and examines such developmental efforts and analyzes the leadership role at national, state, and local levels with special emphasis on the lack of clear role definition at the local level. Major sections of the document include: (1) Vocational Education Leadership, (2) Educational Leadership and Vocational Education, (3) Leadership Development Programs, (4) Recruitment and Selection For Leadership Development Programs, and (5) Summary and Conclusions. Among the recommendations are: (1) Terms  describing functions related to leadership roles in vocational education at all levels need to be standardized, (2) Leadership development, instructional activities and procedures should be competency-based and not course oriented, and (3) More precise selection tools including the use of already existing tests and procedures should be adapted and/or standardized to use in the selection of candidates for leadership development programs in vocational education.

Comparison of the experimental county with several control counties showed that the expanded resources resulted in significantly increased services to medically disabled clients. The agency expansion resulted in the counselor having more time for providing services to his clients without lengthening the rehabilitation process. The increased funds and personnel resulted in a larger number of clients served, rather  than increased service costs.

This report indicates how manpower policies can contribute to stabilization of the economy. It is a preliminary effort to formulate an active program and to assess its costs and benefits. Shifting the trade-off between inflation and unemployment so that both are reduced can be accomplished in several ways: (1) reduction in the labor turnover rate, (2) increase in job search efficiency, (3) reduction in the responsiveness of wages and prices to the vacancy-unemployment ratio, (4) control of exogenous pressures toward inflation,  and (5) reduction in imbalances between compartments. Recommendations to improve the trade-off cover four areas: (1) job matching, (2) vocational counseling and employment opportunities for youth, (3) training and job restructuring, and (4) geographic mobility assistance.

This situation is compounded by a fragmented, disjointed, and uncoordinated educational system. The concept of career education is not a new or revolutionary idea; rather, it has evolved as a result of redirected educational goals, educational legislation, and research in human development. Career education has not been precisely defined, but it has been conceptualized as a systematic attempt to increase the career options open to students and to facilitate more rational and valid career planning and preparation. Career education is viewed as a developmental process beginning in kindergarten and extending  throughout a student's schooling. The student progresses from awareness and orientation to exploration and skill development in a continuous advancement toward a career. Currently, there are four alternative ways of delivering or facilitating career education goals, including school-based, employer based, home-based, and residential-based models. Each of these models is described, and several factors to be considered in undertaking this major redirection of the American school system are presented and discussed. (Author/SB)",

Vocational educators might contend that this is another stage in the developmental history of vocational education, while others say that it is a natural consequence of concomitant advances in education. Another influence was work done by the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. Career education movements in Europe and the Soviet Union influenced the scene world-wide, and a fifth explanation credits the United States Office of Education and State Education Agencies with strong leadership. Various approaches to career education focus on: (1) the philosophical commitment, (2) the essential components, (3) utilization of an educational delivery system, (4) education levels  from the elementary grades through adult education, and (5) a program which is concerned with outcomes. In the school-based model, career education needs to be integrated into the entire school curriculum rather than to be a separate course. Characteristics of schools with exemplary school-based programs, assumptions which mitigate the influence of career education, problems for implementation, and developmental needs are discussed.

The CDI consists of three factor-analytic scales, including: (1) Planning Orientation, which represents the degree of the student's awareness toward planning and choice, (2) Resources for Exploration, which assesses the quality or soundness of individually used and potentially available resources, and (3) Information and Decision Making, which samples the amount of  educational and occupational information and the use of the information for sound decisions. Test-retest reliabilities for the three scales over a short period of time were above .70, and reliabilities over a 6-month period were above .60, indicating that vocational maturity was a stable characteristic. Tentative results from content validity, criterion-related concurrent and predictive validity, and construct validity studies indicate that the CDI does measure important aspects of vocational maturity. Uses of the instrument for program evaluation, group assessment, and individual counseling are suggested. (SB)",

The five training sessions utilized demonstration and \"learning by doing\" techniques to teach participants how to organize inservice training and teach on the job. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, questionnaires were mailed to participants. Over 80 percent of the 429 respondents felt the program was outstanding or well done, and an equal number indicated that as a result of the program, patient care had been improved to some extent. The results indicate that the training should be continued and expanded, and that similar short seminars  in other aspects of human relations, supervision, leadership, and management should be prepared and offered in the health care field. Instruction cards, a job break-down sheet, certificates, a copy of the survey instrument, and other study materials are appended. (Author/SB)",

It was proposed that individuals will decide to leave a job when they perceive that a gain in achievement is possible. The analysis of the outcome of job shifts revealed that gain in prestige and income are determined by the achievement of the job left and a person's resources (education, family background, and ability), with the most important resource being the individual's education. It was also demonstrated that such structural constraints as level of employment and distribution of job opportunities may be measured by the amount of variance explained in the prestige or income of the  job entered. Finally, it was shown that the level of achievement increases with age and that the covariance between resources and achievement also increases. (Author/SB)",

This report examines the nature of this shift in training and its anticipated impact on future supply. Other important factors affecting the future supply of nurses are analyzed, including the relative economic attractiveness of nursing compared with other professions, the proportions of female high school graduates entering and completing nurse training, and the proportion of trained nurses who are not working as nurses. A labor supply function is derived, permitting projections of labor supply and labor force participation of nurses through the 1970's. These projections are compared with the expected demand for nurses.  (BH)",

To investigate the factors affecting the decisions, the processes that produced them, and the respondents' evaluations of the decisions and decision-making process, structured interviews were held with caseworkers, clients, and team members in Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit. Analysis of interview data revealed that the caseworker's decision to refer a client to WIN seemed most strongly influenced by her perception of the client's  motivation. The majority of the AFDC women thought they would be pressured or penalized in some way if they did not participate in WIN. Despite this feeling of pressure, 90 percent indicated they were &quot;pleased&quot; or &quot;very pleased&quot; over their referral to WIN. WIN team members were in agreement that the other staff members were their most useful source in acquiring information to help them do their jobs. These and other major results are discussed. (SB)",

For the purpose of the study, vocational success was defined either as successful graduation or successful graduation plus employment. The first sub-study investigated: (1) the ability of each of the separate scales of each instrument to differentiate occupational groups, and (2) the extent of difference between groups defined as successful graduates or as successful graduates employed in related occupations 1 year after training. The second sub-study investigated the ability of each total instrument to differentiate between occupational  groups, and developed a method of presenting data pertaining to a multi-scale test instrument in the form of a counseling aid. Results of these sub-studies tend to indicate that there are significant differences between the types of people who enter and succeed in different occupations, and that it is possible to cluster occupations based on the characteristics of people who enter them.

        "description":"This report, one of 21 case studies, describes the history of a recent educational product. The Cluster Concept Program, developed at the University of Maryland, is directed toward the preparation of individuals for entrance into a spectrum of occupations. Three clusters of occupations are included: (1) Construction, (2) Electro-Mechanical Installation and Repair, and (3) Metal Forming and Fabrication. The program is targeted for boys and girls in Grades 11 and 12 who want some occupational preparation while remaining in the main stream of the educational program. It aims at giving students entry level skills for a range of related occupations. Although the 4-year study ended in 1969, the original developers have conducted several related activities since that time. They include:  (1) assistance to schools, (2) further evaluation studies, (3) placement and performance research, and (4) development of additional clusters. (GEB)",

        "description":"The Pilot Training Project for personnel participating in Pilot State Dissemination Programs involved training of the three dissemination project staffs to carry out their dissemination functions. The program attempted to facilitate the use of tested educational research data by local educational agencies in their decision process. The staff members were trained in various aspects of need assessment, data retrieval, and information utilization. The training project utilized a training methodology based on a university extension model of information dissemination and utilization. The methodology consisted of meeting individual needs through a process of visitation with the project staffs in the working situation, presentation to them of relevant information, and involving the  trainees in the educational process through various interactive modes. This report documents the training program and develops information that would be useful to future training programs of similar nature. This includes the historical and conceptual antecedents to the program; its organization, objectives, and methodology; and the observations and experiences of the training staff. Specifics of the program are dealt with in the appendices. An outline of subjects dealt with by the training project is as follows: 1. Initial exchange of project proposals, 2. Pre-training site visits, 3. Initial one-week training session, 4. Combined site visit and on-site training program, 5. Third site visits in preparation for final training program, and 6. Final three-day training program.  (Author/DB)",

The participants, which may range in number from 18 to 75, each assume one of five decision-making roles: city or county politician, city or county planner, developer, industrialist, and air pollution control officer. An APEX game typically takes five sessions (cycles) of about four hours each; however, a minimum of three three-hour cycles is possible. A cycle, which represents a one-year period in the simulated urban environment, is composed of two major phases. The first is the game  simulation during which the students participate in their interacting roles making decisions and forming policy. In the second phase decisions emerging out of the game simulation are analyzed by a computerized system of integrated simulation models. This computer analysis indicates changes in the urban area and becomes input into the game simulation of the next cycle. The APEX computer program (not included in manuals) is in Fortran IV and runs on an IBM 1130-2B computer or IBM 360-50 or higher series computer. (PR)",

The first, \"The Costs of Illiteracy\" by A. Dale Tussing and Laurence B. DeWitt, attempts to describe these \"costs\" as the quickest way to demonstrate that this affluent, highly-educated society is confronted with a severe problem; the second, \"An Attack of Reading Disability: Some Policy Issues and Suggestions\" by Ralph Hambrick, Thomas B. Corcoran, David R. Fendrick, and Gerhard Kutsch, addresses the most obvious location of the problem: the schools. The third paper \"Breaking the Cycle of Illiteracy: Focus on Adults\" by Michael Marien and Roger DeCrow, suggests that the  solutions to a problem depend in good measure on its definition. It questions \"If adult illiteracy (parental) is the major factor in the reading disabilities of their children, can we successfully attack either aspect of the problem independent of the other?\" The basic conclusions are: policy formulation should precede program development and action, and policy analysis should precede policy formulation.

The emphasis on andragogy (the teaching of adults) focuses on the future adult students of Canada. Eight chapters examine such topics as: I. Definitions and Generalizations; II. The Changing Aims of Adult Education; III. The Canadian Adult Educand; IV. Student Orientation; V. Project Orientation; VI. Teacher Orientation; VII. Technological Orientation; and VIII. Possible Futures in Adult Education. The paper concludes that Canada must decide that the potential contribution to the community of the adult who has improved himself or herself is as great as the individual gain, and thereby accept  the necessity of investing publicly in adult education.

To achieve this goal: (1) An institution of higher learning provides regular college classes in a correctional institution. These credit classes are geared to the needs and achievements of the particular inmate populations; (2) A counseling program is developed which works to rebuild inmate self-concepts and to alter the self defeating behavior patterns; and (3) Social and cultural activities, not ordinarily available, are brought into the correctional institution to help  rekindle inmate interest for participation in society. Emphasis is placed on the continuation of NewGate support of participants after their release, by continued counseling, and by arranging financial assistance for those who continue their education.

        "description":"This study defines the role of the extension youth program aide in the food and nutrition education program as perceived by himself (herself), other paraprofessionals, and professional staff members of the Washington State Cooperative Extension Service. Data were collected from six groups through the use of a mail questionnaire. The six groups were: extension program aides, other program aides, extension assistants (youth phase), other extension assistants, county extension agents, and human resources staff. The respondents were asked to rate the importance of 17 selected functions as to how they felt they should be performed and how the functions were now being performed. The major distinction between the youth phase and the ongoing expanded food and nutrition education program  is the inclusion of volunteer leaders. Conclusions as a result of this study are: (1) The relatively low rating given the functions (teaching volunteer leaders how to work with young people, training and recruiting volunteer leaders) has implications for a need for improved communication and an extensive training program; (2) The paraprofessionals were fairly well agreed that they were placing emphasis on the functions which should be emphasized. The professionals agreed but to a lesser extent; (3) Although experience seemed to be related to rank order to a lesser degree than age and education, those with longer tenure rated those functions pertaining to volunteer leaders higher than those with less tenure; and (4) Level of education seemed to be less of a factor in ranking the selected  functions of the extension youth program aide by professionals than experience or age.

The findings in relation to (1) above are a firm grounding in economics, capable with figures but not necessarily a mathematician or statistician, have a logical mind, be able to sell analysis to decision makers, have broad experience in analysis, and know the uses and limitations of analytical techniques. It was found that there is no training program currently producing sizeable numbers of analysts with PPB analysis capabilities. Recommendations are as  follows: (1) Bureau of Training and Civil Service Commission top management should consider extending the Commission's leadership role in promoting sound PPB analytic training; (2) the 9-month Educational Program in Systematic Analysis should be refashioned to either provide for two separate tracks--one for younger Federal employees and one for mid-career executives--or should be specified as a &quot;mid career development&quot; program; (3) establish a separate &quot;PPB Tool Extensive&quot; course for beginning analysts in Federal service; (4) continue existing &quot;PPB Orientation&quot; and PPB Fundamentals&quot; courses, but expanded on how PPB fits into the real political world; (5) continue to develop and promote &quot;PPB Tool Intensive&quot; courses; and (6) establish programs to aid agencies in recruiting analytically  trained college graduates. Samples are given of existing university courses and PPB Tool Extensive Training program. (DB)",

        "description":"The influence of the Three Week Residential Seminar in PPB offered by the Civil Service Commission on the job performance, attitudes, and career development of participants who attended the first 15 seminars was studied. The seminar program was developed to retrain experienced analysts (financial, budget, and management) and PPB output user managers for immediate assignment in and near newly created PPBS units. Questionnaires were sent to 653 former participants, representing 90 percent of the 722 individuals who attended the 15 sessions from February 1966 through June 1967; the mean response was 79 percent with a range of 66 to 93 percent. The characteristics of the participants were as follows: average level of education was four and one-half years of college; average grade  level was GS-14, with a range from 9 to 18; average age was 44 years with a range of 24 to 67 years; the average years of work experience in the Federal government was 18 and the range was 2 to 40 years; and 25% had attended at least one additional course related to PPBS in the past two years. The results of the study showed that (1) a majority of the participants were directly engaged in some phase of PPB operation, (2) the seminars provided understanding of PPB concepts, (3) the techniques presented in the seminar had been put to use, (4) the seminar had stimulated self-development efforts related to PPB, and (5) 35% were able to describe specific job outputs traceable to seminar teaching. Statistical analysis of the results is presented in tables. Appendixes present the seminar  schedule, questionnaire, and guest. (DB)",

Adult education is interpreted as comprising all the deliberate and conscious efforts people make to enlarge and interpret their experience of life. All effective adult education is seen as contributing to community work, and all community work is considered a form of education. A short biographical sketch is given of Frank Milligan, and a summary of his values are quoted from Milligan's Wincham Hall report for 1935-36. Professional organizations that are contributing to the up-grading of the quality of service to the community by their members, and are concerned with protecting the material interests of their  members, are briefly described. Measures being used to train professionals in the Community Association Field are said to be inadequate to meet the need. It is stated that professional training must center on the needs and situations of the people who are to be served and not merely on the machinery and instrumentalities used to serve them. (DB)",

Evaluation is seen as an important social concern, as well as a field of study and an area of competence. Four types of evaluation applied to the Unesco program are context evaluation, input evaluation, process evaluation, and output evaluation. The steps taken in operationalization are: (1) developing a generalized system model for the program; (2) designing an appropriate evaluation system; (3) designing a data system. It is stressed that evaluation is a group task from planning through completion, with the evaluator fulfilling his special technical role. A data system for functional literacy is shown to include both numerical  information and documentation, with most of the data relating to four social configurations--individuals, groups, institutions, and sub-cultures--but with some of the data relating to tools, techniques, and artifacts that the four social configurations worked with to create development. In conclusion, it is pointed out that there is no complete evaluation system, rather, each project must build its evaluation system in terms of its needs, priorities, and resources. (DB)",

In the second study, Consumer Notes (a weekly television program for homemakers), a telephone survey conducted at the conclusion of the series and questionnaires completed by a panel of 30 homemakers weekly, at 13 weeks, and at the conclusion of the 26-week series were used to obtain evaluation  data. Two learning modules, one on soil nutrients and soil testing and the other on communication, were evaluated using three evaluation nodes: reaction panel, Field Test A, and Field Test B. Three constraints which affected the choice of the evaluation strategies were (1) the kinds of questions which the programmer needed to answer, (2) the methods and sources of data collection, and (3) the limitations of resources in terms of time, money, and staff.

The first section of the report, Classification, points out the need for in-depth screening of the inmate upon entry to the institution, with an assessment of his skills, educational background, and life record so that goals for a specific individualized program can be determined. In the section concerned with Education, the commission recommends that: a year-round program be instituted; inmates be allowed to rotate in education programs; classes be also provided in the evenings and on weekends; an incentive  program be explored; consideration be given to utilization of ex-offenders as teachers, consultants, and paraprofessionals; a reading program be developed; exploration be made of the need for improved testing methods for determining learning disabilities; a correspondence course be developed by the State; the availability of college programs be increased; the cluster concept in vocational training programs be utilized; educational facilities be improved; and a trade advisory council be established for each vocational course and prison industry. The State Use Industry, as viewed by the commission, is in need of modernization. Release Programs, the last section of the report stresses the responsibility of the State, the institution, industry, and the community in preparing the inmate for  re-entry into society. (DB)",

As of June, 1970 monthly turnover of clients stabilized at five percent, but there was a lessened percentage of persons in the less than $3000 annual income bracket. At the time that the first food records were taken, only 10 percent of the diets were considered adequate, while second records showed that 18-20 percent were satisfactory. The greatest improvements were in the milk and fruits and vegetables groups. The presence of older school children in the family had a positive effect on the dietary knowledge level of the  homemaker, which, in turn, had a positive effect on dietary intake. (CL)",

This was the Army's first effort to effect major training innovations in the conversion toward an all-volunteer Army. By the fall of 1971, this program was being used as a model for implementing the EVATP at other Army Training Centers. In developing the EVATP system, six established learning principles were applied to Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training to modify the conventional training system. Course objectives and performance tests used were developed jointly by Fort Ord and HumRRO. In a comparison with a conventionally trained group, independently conducted by the Infantry School at Fort Benning, EVATP graduates  performed significantly better on five out of seven BCT subjects, and seven out of nine AIT subjects. In general, these gains were shown by men at all levels of aptitude. (Author)",

In order to test this hypothesis, data pertaining to past and current methods of recruiting students to Adult Basic Education programs were reviewed; a predominantly visual-aural recruitment package was developed professionally and tested in the City of Springfield, Mass.; and actual and potential students were interviewed to assess the efficacy of the package. Data acquired was programmed utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences model. It was concluded that such a method of recruiting potential students is effective, since 19.8% of the individuals  enrolling in the Springfield Adult Basic Education program during the time of the experiment directly attributed their enrollment to the influence of the recruitment package. This contrasts with 8.1% of enrollments frequently attributed to the influence of the media. (Author/CL)",

Secondary objectives were to assist in developing low cost devices for one course and to determine the probably cost-effectiveness of a commercially available device in another. A method was developed which identified specific and differential needs for synthetic equipment in each course and determined suitability of existing equipment to meet those needs.

The general theme was to examine the influence which particular institutions have on people's lives and behavior, and the effect on the individual, group and community when these institutions lose power and influence in a rapidly changing society. The objectives for the series were: extension of vocabulary; critical awareness; use of concepts; and action. The project represented a new  approach to neglected areas of adult education, using local radio as a vital instrument of contact between educationists and those whose needs are overwhelming and almost totally unsatisfied.

Project Step-Up features a multifold methodological approach incorporating techniques from (1) life skills problem-solving; (2) programmed instruction; and (3) learning laboratories. This rationale led to the extension of the language laboratory into the community. The students are experientially prepared to assume productive roles in the alien Anglo culture through individualized programs of job and community related materials, techniques, and tasks aimed at making them as bicultural as possible. Because it is believed that decision making in the  language context is facilitated by contrasting the two cultures, the students are placed in contexts that allow them to collect cultural information, analyze it and act on it. Contrast is the catalyst for eliciting information about themselves in relation to both cultures. Contrast sets, a basic technique of linguistics, is thus extended to the notion of teaching biculturalism. (CL)",

Science reporting is no longer confined to reporting of findings and discoveries alone, but increasingly deals with questions about who gets research funds, what problems will be studied, and whether scientists should take part in public decisions about application of scientific findings and technology. Research on the communication process shows that there is exceptionally high public interest in health, medicine, and nutrition; that public use of science content in the  media is highly correlated with socioeconomic status; and that strong attitudes and high knowledge of mass media science content tend to go together. Research on understandability of science writing shows that numbers communicate meaning extremely well, and that new scientific terms may be introduced easily if they are used repeatedly and given a singular meaning.

The first problem involves the selection of potentially effective aides, and is followed by difficulties in the aide's family as they adjust to her job situation. The homemaker's aide is expected, after three weeks of training, to become a program salesman, social worker, confidante, referral agent, and change agent. Accepting her as a person and giving her job security are priorities in making her feel a part of the ongoing extension program. She must not be forced into the middle class mold before she is ready for it. The professional home demonstration agent also requires help as she is forced into the role of  supervisor of these aides. Aides that can assist with her former job with middle class women are a possibility. A paraprofessional organization would not serve the needs of nutrition aides as well as some of the currently available programs do. (CL)",

Interviews with professional 4-H personnel, aides, and leaders of other youth organizations were subjective in nature. Many instances were found where individual agents were making a strong effort to provide innovative programs, but most of them reflected local conditions so strongly that they could not be readily transposed to another situation. However, eight programs with wider possibilities were discovered. It was found that relatively little commitment has been made to urban 4-H programs by  Cooperative Extension, and that a regularly funded program is necessary to gain the confidence of people and to attract leaders.

Only the second of these was significantly accomplished. The integration of teaching and research in the program was carried out through four phases of activity: (1) careful selection of  student participants; (2) a preparatory seminar held during the semester preceding the summer field work; (3) field research during an eight-week period in summer; and (4) an analysis seminar held during the semester following the summer field work.

Subjects were 36 ninth-grade students of average problem solving ability as determined by IQ. Six treatment groups were formed by combining three types of series of instances, made up of good positive and good and poor negative instances, with a risk condition and a non-risk condition. It was hypothesized that if attention was increased, the combination good positive (GP) good negative (GN) series would be more efficient than GP only series or GP and poor negative PN series. It was concluded that generally a series of GP instances only are more  efficient for concept acquisition than a mixed series containing either GN or PN instances.

Of the studies reviewed, two seemed to offer ideas which could be of direct, functional benefit. One of these was a report of research which was unique in that it placed emphasis on the prevention of underachievement rather than its cure. The other report indicated that upperclassmen trained in group work would perhaps be the best qualified academic counselors available. However, it was the opinion of the author that taken in aggregate the research on group work with underachievers represents a fragmented, contradictory, incoherent hodgepodge of inconclusive data. The author  of one of the reviewed articles indicated that the lack of uniformity in the identification of \"underachievers\" causes the confusion in related research. He suggested that more exacting criteria for selection of the population to be studied must be established. (Author/BW)",

This paper does not present the methodology for the decision/selection stages in designing the actual instruction task, but offers references to other sources which give in-depth procedures. Rather, the purpose is the presentation of the management model rather than the developmental procedures. The instructional model is designed according to conclusions resulting from research studies investigating variables hypothesized to have a direct application to concept teaching. Although the model specifies concept teaching, other types of behavior could use the same sequence, and probably a typical instructional  lesson would include various types of behavior. The premises in this paper are that instructional design should be decided by theory as much as possible, and that design components should represent a parsimonious approach to development.

        "description":"This study of concept learning was intended to supply data concerning the interaction of different values of three variables with each other. These three variables which may influence concept learning are augmentive information, method of presentation, and instance difficulty. Three types of specific review (total, partial, and none) were used, two methods of presentation (simultaneous and sequential ) and two levels of task difficulty (easy instances and both hard and easy instances) were employed. Nine hypotheses were generated to examine the effects of these variables. Subjects for this study were 169 undergraduate psychology students at Brigham Young University. They were randomly assigned to one of twelve experimental groups or a control group. The results indicated that all  of the treatment produced some learning by the subjects. It was concluded that the most efficient means of promoting concept learning is to use both easy and hard instances with specific review. The method of presentation was found to be optional. It was also concluded that the three variables mentioned above do seem to affect concept learning. (Author/BW)",

The authors used a scale which measures whether an individual's self-concept is characterized by a mastery over his personal life or by a sense of futuristic fatalism. The research findings reported are based upon survey data obtained from over 3,300 students from Dade County, Florida, 930 graduating junior college students and 2,453 high school students. The results indicate that, excepting for some minority group students, the self-concept of high school seniors and junior college graduates is positively associated with their parent's socioeconomic status (as measured by income). It was also found that the more positive  a student's self-image, the more likely he is to have \"long-range\" educational plans. The authors conclude that research could be profitably undertaken to further examine the relationship between the self-concept of high school-age students and their educational plans and careers.

        "description":"This study explored the difference in intelligence among children from large families in relation to parent-child interaction patterns. The sample consisted of 56 children from large families living in Central West Virginia. The 56 children represented 20 families, all of which had five or more children, and were of similar economic circumstances. Measurement of parent-child interaction was accomplished using a locally produced scale which was administered verbally to the children and designed to measure a child's assessment of the quality and quantity of their parents' interaction with that child. The child's response to each question was rated into one of three categories provided by each item on the scale. The results of this study indicate the value of parent-child  interaction in facilitating the development of children's cognitive skills. The author concludes that programs such as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Project Home Start should answer many questions about the value of educating parents to be effective educators of their children.

For example, it was hypothesized that proportionally fewer internals experience romantic attachments. Moreover, among persons having been in love, internals were expected to have fewer romantic experiences and to experience romantic attraction as less mysterious, less volatile and less intense than externals. Finally, internals were expected to have a less idealistic orientation toward romantic love than externals. Subjects consisted of 255 undergraduate introductory psychology students. These subjects completed Rotter's Internal External (I-E) Scale as well as a Romantic-Love Questionnaire specifically devised for this study. The results  showed that internal-external control and sex of subject are relevant correlates of hetrosexual romantic love. The authors concluded that these results indicate the potential fruitfulness of correlation research on romantic love and its usefulness as an adjunct to experimentally-oriented and cross-cultural research approaches to this phenomenon.

While the author's major interest is in the field of learning in handicapped children, it is suggested that young normal children may also benefit from such applications. The measurement tool described is The Sampling Organizational and Recall Through Strategies (S.O.R.T.S.) test. It has been designed to diagnose specific levels of spontaneous grouping strategy generation in such a way as to predict an appropriate educational  intervention to enhance the use of conceptual strategies.

The only concrete reference to marital counseling was as an example of how the process model for defining and achieving educational accountability might be implemented. First, the increasing importance of accountability in the next few years was emphasized. Secondly, by giving an example of accountability theory in practice, it was shown that it is a nonthreatening issue  and worthwhile in the design and implementation of campus mental health services. Finally, it was noted that while the example of implementing the accountability model was concerned with marital counseling, this model is applicable for all levels and types of mental health interventions on the college campus.

In both samples (lower class and middle class) boys tended to view themselves as being less anxious than girls and girls reported they were better behaved than boys. Teachers' stereotypic self-concept scores did not  differentiate boys and girls. However, teachers did identify some items which differentiated in the middle class sample. Teachers appeared to greatly underestimate the differences between boys and girls in both samples.

The course, requiring about forty-five hours of participation, was started on an experimental basis with specially selected high-risk entering students during the summer of 1969. The main purposes of the course have been: (1) to help students adjust to college life, (2) to provide them with skills in self-exploration that facilitate their career planning, and (3) to increase their motivation in pursuit of their goals. This paper presents research data that were collected over a two year period to assess the effects of the achievement motivation course on several educationally relevant variables. It was hypothesized that achievement  motivation training would give rise to increased achievement motivation. The results generally supported the hypothesis, but it was strongly suggested that trainer and trainee personalities have to be considered to gain a more complete understanding of the effects of achievement motivation training.

        "description":"The present investigation extended the methodology to investigate the effects of viewed aggression on groups of two and four children. The present study employed a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design, using as independent variables sex of the child, group size (two or four children), and cartoon condition (aggressive cartoon, nonaggressive cartoon, and no cartoon). Forty-eight boys and 48 girls of kindergarten age were randomly assigned to the experimental groups. A factor analysis of the dependent measures identified four factors, accounting for 85 percent of the total variance, each of which responded differently to the independent variables. The finding that (a) transgressive-aggressive was not affected by viewing aggressive cartoons, and (b) that normative-aggression loads on the same  factor as normative-play, rejects the assumption that aggression is a single class of behavior and rejects the hypothesis that the effect of viewing aggressive models reduce inhibitions against aggression. The results are interpreted in terms of factors affecting levels of activity. (Author)",

The subjects consisted of forty-six female undergraduates enrolled in Introductory Psychology at the University of Toronto. They were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions comprising a 2 x 2 factorial design. Two hypotheses were initially entertained. First, choosing to agress may create greater personal responsibility for the aggressor than nonvoluntary aggression. The second hypothesis assumed that choice may primarily sensitize an aggressor to situational norms concerning aggression. If so, choice may curtail unprovoked aggression primarily when it is situationally defined  as being socially undesirable. The results of this study clearly disconfirmed these initial hypotheses concerning the effects of choice upon aggression. In conclusion, this study suggested that in general, portraying harming another as being socially undesirable tends to inhibit the amount of unprovoked interpersonal aggression. (Author/BW)",

In the present study adults were required to classify pairs of horseshoe stimuli as same or different. Response times were compared for stimulus pairs that varied in orientation (left-right vs up-down) and spatial plane of the pair (horizontal vs. vertical). Stimulus pairs in which the orientation matched the spatial plane of the pair (i.e., horizontal and left-right or vertical and up-down) took longer to classify than stimulus pairs in which these two variables were crossed. These results are interpreted as reflecting the necessity of synthesizing two sources of information in order to compare the former pair types--temporally encoded visual information and directional information  from the motor scanning process. Implication for the source of children's difficulty with mirror-image stimuli of this type are discussed. (Author)",

Specifically, the results showed a generally clear difference in how adequate performance on the OST was related to indices of learning and school achievement. For both white samples adequate divergent performance and verbalization exhibited moderately strong relationships with a number of learning-achievement measures. On the other hand, adequacy of convergent recognition and verbalization was found to  have a generally low relationship with the same criterion measures. In contrast, for the Black sample, adequate convergent recognition and verbalization, but not divergent performance and verbalization, was shown to be related to the criterion variables. (Author)",

Self-control is viewed here as a complex behavior--i.e., as a sequence of specific acts influenced by conditions both internal and external to the person. A person can exercise self-control when he has learned how to manage these internal and external conditions. Three general strategies by which people can learn and use self-control (or self-management) skills are explained and illustrated: self-observation, environmental planning, and manipulation of the consequences of behavior by self-administered techniques. The results of the few studies conducted to date indicate that all three strategies can be effective and that at least one of them is present in all  successful attempts at self-control. (BW)",

This paper is restricted to beginning reading, defined as the acquisition of letter-sound decoding ability, and raises the question: what skills are required by current tests? Available reading readiness and achievement tests consist of batteries of subtests, each of which is designed to measure a component skill necessary in reading. However, high intercorrelations between the subtests indicate either that separable skills are not being measured, or that skills develop at the same rate in most children. However, the makeup of the items in the tests is such that ability to follow instructions and general language competence are common factors which enter significantly into  performance on all subtests. The experience of psychologists in constructing tests to identify separable skills in language and intelligence indicates that this task is possible but difficult. Current tests are suitable for prediction of reading performance, but tests that evaluate separable skills are urgently needed for further research on the development of the reading process, as well as diagnosis. Examples are presented for articulation and phonetic discrimination. (Author)",

Inspired by Festinger's (1950) ideas on resolution of attitudinal discrepancies in groups, Schachter (1951) conducted an experiment that has greatly influenced subsequent research and theory concerning reaction to attitudinal deviancy. Although Schachter's findings on sociometric rejection of the deviate have been frequently replicated, his data on communication to the deviate are partially inconsistent with theory and other research. Additional evidence is presented which suggests that individuals who deviate in nonattitudinal spheres are also subject to negative group sanction. Rejection may be employed against persons who impede group goals, transgress group  norms, or differ in personality from other group members. Finally, data are presented which indicate that deviates are not always rejected; rather, deviation in some settings and by some individuals may be tolerated or even encouraged. (Author)",

The contexting aspects of the model are concerned with the higher level cognitive behavior associated with selection of appropriate behavior, maintenance of goals-directedness, and evaluation of completed behaviors. The operational aspects of the model are those behaviors which are performed during the execution of a concept-attainment strategy. Such behavior as creating a search criterion, comparing objects, and presenting concepts were considered operational. The memory component of the model was designed to facilitate the other aspects of the model as well as form the basis for a model of human memory. The memory was divided into three types of storage, each used for a  particular purpose. The working memory was a buffer-type memory which received information from the external world and acted as a communication device for the transfer of internally created information. The short-term memory contained all of the information relevant to the attainment of a particular concept. The long-term memory will retain learning strategies and descriptive information necessary to implementation of these strategies and descriptive information necessary to implementation of these strategies.

Examination of the logic relating thinking to behavior leads to criticism of the tendency to subordinate \"behavior\" to underlying processes. The difficulties inherent in analyses of this type are that underlying processes are commonly described in behavioral terms and that they are invisible and nonverifiable inventions of the theorizer. The present paper outlines the need for an explanation of behavior to account for its obvious generative and recursive character. Professor Bourne suggests that behavior may be a rule-following enterprise, and presents a brief review of research to illustrate his postulate. Finally, the place of thinking as  a concept in psychology is discussed. Thought is seen as an event which reflects a change in the individual's possibilities for behaving. (Author)",

To improve such methods such rationale are necessary: (1) make explicit the assumptions underlying these programs; (2) describe the planning methods and criteria for deriving youth goals and performances objectives; (3) specify desired youth outcomes in terms of measureable criterion behaviors related to assessed needs; (4) make sure instructional and counseling procedures are feasible; (5) demand that the youth activities involved in the selected procedures are scheduled, and the staff services and material resources required to conduct these activities be collected and implemented; (6) employ summative and formative evaluation designs to study both the expected and  unexpected outcomes of these programs; and (7) require continuous revision of program activities, based on evaluation feedback, until such programs were fully effective for their intended audiences.

The programs were conducted to test whether obtaining a diploma or skill training increased the employment opportunities of former dropouts. A 33 month followup study was made of those who participated as well as of comparable groups of young people. Removal of barriers to employment represented by the absence of a high school diploma did not increase employment opportunities for either the subjects on the comparison group attending regular high school. It appears that it was not the inadequacies of preparation these young  people received that limited their opportunities as much as the general lack of employment opportunities available to youngsters with their background--that is, structural limitations in our society. The recommendation is made that training be conducted only when each trainee can be guaranteed a satisfactory job placement, and that future programs focus on improving job skills without the rhetoric of rehabilitation.

It was hypothesized that if a significant portion of the reliable individual variation in a complex learning situation could be identified and described, it would be reasonable to expect that subsequent predictions could be made about the conditions necessary to maximize efficiency in learning for various categories of subjects. Scores were obtained for thirty-nine subjects (nineteen male, twenty female) on twelve references tests representing measures of fourteen intrinsic individual difference variables. The implication being that those people who are susceptible to response competition will do poorly on conceptual learning tasks that are high in concept complexity. The basic  hypothesis here is that those people who manifest resistance to response competition are less suceptible to interference with the consolidation of visual information, and are therefore able to form the necessary association needed to develop a short-term visual memory structure.

The previous year's project involved the development of an objective, self-administering inventory designed to measure the values of young children. The Values Inventory for Children (VIC) originally contained 60 pictorial items; and was administered in the Fall of 1970, to 996 children in grades one through three from five ethnic groups: Mexican-American, Oriental, Anglo, Negro, and Indian. The general conclusion from this study is that values do play a part in the adjustment of the child to  school and in his achievement although it was impossible in this study to determine exactly how much they contribute over and above the child's ability since no precise measure of ability was available. It was also concluded that the more like the teacher a child is to start with at the beginning of the school year and the more he becomes like her over eight months, the better he will do in school.

The opening paper presents a brief overview of research on learning hierarchies. Issues considered include the use of behavior analysis as a basis for generating hierarchies, the extent to which hierarchy theory can take into account individual differences in learning patterns, and the implications of cumulative learning of increasingly more complex tasks for theories of cognitive development. Different methods of validating hypothesized hierarchies are discussed. In the succeeding papers, four instances of research on hierarchies are presented, each representing a different approach to the problem of hypothesizing and  testing hierarchical relations among cognitive tasks. Several discussants, representing the developmental, learning, and psychometric points of view, then consider implications of the research reported. (Author)",

Though the spread of technology was initially slow, it now offers many instructional aids (e.g., tapes, records, television, computers, and other teaching machines) in reading usage. The systems approach brought about large scale computer experiments and computers are now widely used in schools' reading programs. Educational television programs (e.g., Sesame Street and the Electric Company) have been very successful in the teaching of reading. Audiovisual aids and other multimedia devices are commonly found in reading instruction. These recent innovations,  nevertheless, have many impediments to their gradual acceptance and usage: cost, resistance to change, and dehumanization factors. However, reducing cost through the use of minicomputers, increasing funds for educational technology, cable television, and disseminating multimedia products can help minimize these problems. The reading teacher, too, must become technologically oriented to assist and counsel students in the use of these instruments. With the efforts of the teachers and the use of these new instructional devices, strides can be made in reading instruction. (HS)",

Sex-related factors listed which may attribute to the high incidence of boys experiencing reading difficulty were: (1) predominance of female teachers in the primary grades, (2) boys' lack of interest in basal readers, (3) adults considering reading a female activity, (4) effect of different socialization processes of females and males upon school success, (5) teacher attitude toward males during reading instruction. Sex discrimination does appear to predominate in English and American literature and literary criticism. College text in English literature are male oriented and few women writers exist in English literature before the nineteenth century. Thus, it appears that materials  prepared for the instruction of children are heavily slanted in favor of males and male pursuits and that \"literature is traditionally and obviously male centered.\" On the basis of current information it appears that no single factor, including sex discrimination, is responsible for boys' reading difficulties.

Many deprived children in our inner cities are deficient in areas necessary for successful learning. Characteristics of deprived, inner city children which cause learning problems are listening, speaking, experiences, mobility, immediate physical needs, abstractions, best learning, and mismatched systems. Basal readers exhibit characteristics which cause problems for inner city children: (1) over reliance on configuration of context clues, (2) disparity between child's spoken language and book language, (3) lack of sufficient practice and exercise in skills learned in different settings, (4) gaps in instruction and the thinking process, (5) attempting too much, and (6)  stressing an analytic method. A study comparing an analytic and synthetic method of teaching reading was conducted on 420 inner city kindergarten children. Eighty-one matched pairs were assigned to three control and three experimental classes. By the end of the second grade the experimental structured reading program proved to be more effective for the total group in spelling of phonetically regular words, freedom from spelling reversals, and number of words and sentences written.

Analysis of data prompted these conclusions, among others: (a) approximately one-sixth of the school reading programs performed in an effective and acceptable manner, although approximately two-thirds performed in an effective manner (actual exceeding predicted gains),  and approximately one-fifth performed acceptably (exceeding national reading norms); (b) approximately one-third of the school programs were judged neither effective nor acceptable; and (c) compensatory funds were spent in a negative relationship to the pupils' level of performance.

Some researchers have attributed these differences to biological-maturational factors; others have suggested cultural-societal causes. The present study sought to examine this dichotomy by testing the reading ability of boys and girls in four English-speaking nations. More than a thousand elementary children from Grades 2, 4, and 6 in Canada, England, Nigeria, and the United States participated. Each subject was tested for reading comprehension, vocabulary and various word analysis skills. Analysis of variance, in which sex was nested within grade and grade within country, was applied to the data for each of eight analyses. Dependent variables were raw  test scores, grade equivalent scores, or composite scores. In two countries, England and Nigeria, boys generally scored higher than girls and the sex differences favoring boys increased by sixth grade. Conversely, in Canada and the United States girls generally scored higher than boys and the sex differences favoring girls diminished or disappeared by sixth grade. Results of the study indicate that sex differences in reading ability are culturally related. (Author)",

Children can be motivated to write too, enhancing the technical and emotional aspects of published poetry as well as occasionally serving an individual therapeutic need. The creative teacher can devise jingles and poem games to reinforce learning in subject areas, particularly language arts. Syllabication becomes a game instead of a drill when students write Haiku and Tanka. Vocabulary development is immediately meaningful as students write cinquains or descriptive couplets.

Fifteen New York City public schools provided 180 first, third, and fifth grade white and black males from lower and middle socioeconomic status (SES). A variety of auditory tests were administered as well as a visual discrimination measure, an attention measure, reading tests and an intelligence measure. The results largely support the hypothesis that poor auditory discrimination is a major intervening variable between social conditions and reading retardation. The relationship is stronger for blacks than for whites and decreases with age indicating that teaching and remedial  training should be oriented differently for various SES, racial and age groups.

One hundred thirty-eight students in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades were given the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Based on the score of this test, good and poor reading groups were defined as the upper and lower 27 percent of the group tested. These students rated themselves from one to ten on 21 traits on a rating scale. Their teachers rated them on the same scale. Analysis of the data yielded no significant results. Comparisons of the answers to the individual questions obtained by  comparing the groups to each other indicated that the good readers were more congruent with their teachers than the poor readers on most questions, and that the good readers' and poor readers' self-perceptions didn't differ as widely as their teachers' perceptions of them.

        "description":"Behavioral objectives in the teaching of English are criticized. The primary objection is the a priori expectations and reasoning which is a necessary part of these objectives. Behavioral objectives are said to restrict the flexibility and mobility of the English teacher in his classroom interaction. The entire concept of writing behavioral objectives is seen as being misconstrued in that learning, concepts, and information are made the center of instruction rather than the student. If the goal is to create better learning situations, it is felt that the solution should be to create imaginative creative, flexible, humane, and humanistic teachers. (CL)",

        "description":"This paper considers 12 paintings which are a cross-section of the art work done by a kindergarten class of 5-year-olds in an attempt to support the following assertions: that there is a qualitative correspondence between the level of maturity evidenced in the paintings and in their speaking about them; that the degree of development in both speech and painting is affected by the child's home environment; and that increasing sophistication in most children's paintings is paralleled by increasing sophistication in their use of language. Only partial evidence was found to support these assertions. Correspondence between levels of maturity in painting and in oral language was recognizable in 6 of the 12 paintings. Significant indications that the child's home environment affected  development in painting and speech were apparent in four examples. Increasing sophistication in painting corresponded to increasing sophistication in language usage in five instances out of a possible nine. Photographs of the paintings considered are included in the paper. (CL)",

The novels are grouped according to the three stages in the initiation experience of the adolescent: separation; transition; and incorporation. In separation, the adolescent usually goes through some kind of experience in which his family situation is changed or the ties of belonging are cut in some other way. Transition is defined by the adolescent-initiate's awareness of his emerging sexuality. Incorporation is characterized by the acceptance or rejection of society by the initiate. The books discussed are: \"Boy at the Window\"; \"Hog Butcher\"; \"Beetlecreek\"; \"The Learning Tree\"; \"Sissie\"; \"Brown Girl,  Brownstones\"; \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\"; \"And Then We Heard the Thunder\"; \"Native Son\"; and \"Invisible Man.\" (CL)",

In reading &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; the student analyzes its humorous and farcical aspects which function as an opaque shield to a covert and more profound statement of the human condition. Through the reading of &quot;Richard II&quot; the student analyzes a history which treats the tragic disintegration of royal illusions. &quot;Hamlet&quot; is  analyzed in the terms of conflict, artistically crafted both in character and setting, which predicts inevitable disaster.

Eight programs are presented which are a collection of literary texts grouped round a central theme. The programs are the work of different teachers who set out to discover in the classroom how successfully the thematic approach might be used in the later stages of the secondary schools. Presented are teacher's records of the experiment as well as frank discussions of the pitfalls and problems encountered and identified. The programs listed are: (1) The gap between aspirations and the reality of human behavior (Class V); (2) The Class System (Class V); (3) War--and its Aftermath (Class V); (4) Loyalty (Class IV); (5)  Childhood (Class IV); (6) Work (Class IV); (7) Family Relationships (Class III); and (8) School Life (Class III). An appendix consists of samples taken from thematic programs produced by graduate students. Teachers using the thematic approach have found (a) discussion in the classroom becomes a very worthwhile activity and that (b) the quality of the writing both in the essays on the literature studied and in the more personal writings on the theme itself improves appreciably in content and style.

A questionnaire was administered to undergraduate students at Bowling Green State University requesting them to write a &quot;lecturette&quot; on the subject &quot;The Important Things to Consider for a Good 'Speech to Inform'&quot;. This was done at the first meeting of the quarter and at the end of the quarter. The WORDS System, developed by the University of Rochester Medical School, was used to  analyze the data collected by stripping words of their endings and editing out prepositions, conjunctions, relative and personal pronouns, and the &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to have&quot; verb forms. The concept of the WORDS System is that sufficient meaning exists in the association of &quot;a word with itself and other words to conduct meaningful analysis&quot;. Results indicate that (1) students come to a basic course with much more awareness of speech-communication than might be expected, and (2) the student's principal concern is toward effective delivery; however, experienced students seemed to recognize a greater importance in the organization of ideas, while both groups seemed equally concerned with the importance of &quot;interesting material and topics.

The goals of this study were threefold: (1) to study the development of language patterns in first grade children from these socioeconomic groups; (2) to determine the effectiveness of the Gloria and David &quot;Oral English Test&quot; as a predictor of reading achievement; and (3) by introducing one experimental oral language development program to some of the disadvantaged Negro pupils, to measure the effects of such a program on language development during the second year of school. Data were obtained from 200 beginning first grade pupils in the fall of 1969 with additional data gathered in April 1971. Analysis of the data revealed the following: (1)  There is a significant difference in the language patterns of entering first graders in the four schools as measured by the phonology and morphology scores of the Gloria and David &quot;Oral English Test&quot;; (2) Differences in fluency rates of entering first graders at the four schools are not so great as those shown on the other two measures; (3) A study of the rate of change in the three language measures during the first year of school, experienced by Negro pupils in integrated schools and in segregated schools, was not significant; (4) Differences in reading scores were not significant between the experimental group and the control group during the second year of school; and (5) Correlations between the fluency scores and the educational level of the parents were not significant.

        "description":"In this second of two studies conducted with portions of the National Speech and Hearing Survey data, the investigators analyzed the phonetic variants from standard American English in the speech of two groups of nonstandard English speaking children. The study used samples of free speech and performance on the Gold-Fristoe Test of Articulation from a group of 192 Black children (grades 1-6 from Niagara Falls, New York, and a group of 192 Mexican-American children (grades 1-6) from San Antonio, Texas. The study reports the frequencies of omission, substitution, and distortion. The present data is compared with the previously reported results obtained from standard American English speakers from Marshall, Iowa. The major conclusion is that all phonetic variations from standard  American English can be attributed to one of the following sources of variation: (1) reduction in the complexity of segments, which usually decreases with age; (2) differing phonological rules between standard English and a dialect of English; and (3) phonetic interference between a foreign primary language and English.

It was to attain this ideal of developing the many possibilities for children in this age range that the concept of the middle school campus was designed in Winnetka, Illinois. Locating two schools on one campus provided the solution to the problem of providing a continuous 4-year program that would recognize the differences in development during this period. One school is designed to serve the 5th and 6th grades while the second school houses the 7th and 8th grade students. To insure the continuity of the total program, the position of campus principal was created; and the administration,  teaching forces, resources, PTA, and student government were all coordinated. Such a viable, functioning institution provides for continuous development, efficient use of physical and human resources, and the opportunity for change as the need arises. (Author)",

Such programs place less emphasis on prescribed texts and more emphasis on learning from a variety of resources suited to the interests and learning abilities of the individual. Thus, these programs require an abundance of readily available learning materials. The school media center, library, or resource center is developing and expanding to meet the ever-increasing demands by the school population for a wide variety of resources. Materials for learning now encompass all types of media such as filmstrips, 8mm and 16mm films, audiotapes, videotapes, transparencies, pictures, maps, charts, globes, multimedia kits, educational games, and realia. Ideally, the school media center serves as the central agency for the  acquisition, production, organization, and distribution of learning resources required by students and teachers. It also serves as a center where resources may be used and from which learning materials may be selected for use in other areas of the school or borrowed for use beyond the school building. The center functions additionally as a link with other community information services and resource personnel. This publication is intended to give guidance to those involved in planning new or expanded facilities for the school media center. (Author)",

An \"evaluation\" method is hypothesized as a way to gather the data needed to make environmental measure probability inductions. Evaluations gather counts and measures of objects and environments needed for human activities. Human satisfaction levels are then defined through questionnaires and indepth probes of cultural meanings, and correlated to the counts and measures. Environmental measure probability inductions are made from these correlations. Preliminary to making evaluation field studies, assumptions are made about environmental parameters,  quantifying user activities, the validity of user opinions, the dimensions of cultural meanings, and the manipulation of data. Five \"realities\" are isolated for evaluation comparisons: objects, environments, standards, records, and opinions. (Some pages in Appendix C may reproduce poorly.) (Author)",

The model, which uses a systematic approach to the problems of change and accountability, is designed to assist educators in the continual definition, selection, and implementation of viable educational alternatives. The report discusses the theoretical background of the self-renewal model, suggests the segments of the educational system to which the model could be applied, and examines its associated time line. The author provides a step-by-step explanation of the model including (1) the selection of an educational philosophy, (2) the development of written goals from that philosophy, (3) the acquisition of a staff consensus  on the philosophy and goals, (4) the development of educational objectives from the goals and priorities, (5) the establishment of a selection criteria for alternative instructional designs, and (6) the dissemination of the program plan. The model calls for continuous discrepancy evaluation to determine inconsistencies between the programs selected and the philosophy and goals desired. (Author/JF)",

All teachers involved with teaching new Canadians were asked to give their salary levels and to list all their students by name, birthdate, mother tongue, estimate of English language skill, and the number of hours of instruction received per week according to group. The data is presented under (1) demographic analysis -- hours of instruction received by pupils, (2) cost analysis procedures -- teachers' salaries and costs of special English instruction, and (3) observations and conclusions -- citywide average hours and costs of instruction. The study found that a total of 77 public schools and 18  secondary schools had made special provisions of some kind for their new Canadian population. The author observes that even in schools where extensive provisions were being made there was some informal expression of a wish that more English could be taught to more children; and he suggests that these feelings may reflect the frustrating urgency of teaching a new culture and language to an increasing influx of new Canadians.

Although they urged racial and ethnic integration, the commission members were not unanimous in their recommendations to implement integration, and a discussion of the separate opinion of four commissioners is included. A majority of the commissioners concluded that public funds should not be used to support attendance of students at nonpublic schools, and four of the 18 commission members proposed &quot;partial support&quot; of nonpublic education.

The document reports that, at both Mesa and Stockton, teachers were given about half the maximum amount they could earn in bonuses to purchase incentive rewards for the children, to buy supplementary instructional aids, or to use in any other way they wished.

The study focused on authority structures and processes of evaluation. Data were collected on 24 alternative schools and five public schools by means of observation in the schools and by a questionnaire administered to 200 elementary and secondary teachers. Four teaching tasks were identified: Teaching Subject Matter, Character Development, Maintaining Control, and Record Keeping. Data revealed that there was more emphasis on Character Development in alternative schools and more emphasis on Teaching Subject Matter and Maintaining  Control in public schools. Although public school teachers had and desired high levels of autonomy, alternative-school teachers had and wanted higher levels. It was also shown that, although the alternative-school teachers were evaluated more often and received more negative evaluations than public school teachers, for both samples evaluation was infrequent. Both groups believed that training was of little importance for successful teaching, that experience in the classroom was more helpful, and that the personality of the teacher was the most important factor in successful teaching.

The material is presented in two major sections, one devoted to the concept of merit pay and the other to a discussion of alternative methods of rewarding outstanding teachers. Within the concept of merit pay are discussed (1) three major additional compensation provisions, (2) merit provisions in historical perspective, (3) principles of merit pay plans, (4) procedures for merit rating and/or evaluation, (5) pro and con arguments regarding merit pay programs, and (6) some successes and failures of merit pay plans. The differentiated teaching staff approach, the teacher incentive plan,  and the approved staff plan are examined in depth in a section on alternative reward methods. Study findings reveal that (1) careful teacher preparation and training (implying improvements in the college programs for training new teachers) is necessary before a school can handle the technical and human relationship problems inherent in a thoroughgoing merit program; (2) a merit salary program is feasible only in school systems that have developed approariate objective evaluation procedures; (3) teacher morale, a complex of many factors, is not primarily determined by the salary system, be it merit or nonmerit. Two model salary schedules, one proposed salary schedule, and a 19-item bibliography conclude the presentation. (Author/JF)",

Both theoretical and empirical studies were performed to evaluate the procedure. The instrument used in this study was a mailed questionnaire administered to a national sample of elementary school principals. The results of using data gathering from a national sample of principals are presented. According to the author, study findings regarding the utility functions could be used to rationalize the selection of particular curriculum goal areas (e.g.,  word comprehension) for relative emphasis and the process of using this information could also improve the principal's insight and eventual decision.

        "description":"In 1969, the governor made a series of recommendations to the Legislature and to the people of Michigan regarding changes in the method of funding elementary and secondary schools. The current system, which relies heavily on the local property tax, has produced sizable inequities of educational opportunity among the children of the State. Since several courts, both State and Federal, have questioned the constitutionality of similar systems of financing schools, a greater sense of urgency has surrounded the consideration of these recommendations. The proposals fall into the two major areas of (1) a constitutional amendment that would shift the reliance of school operational funding from the local property tax to a system of State taxation, and (2) a different system of allocating  funds to local school districts that would better equalize educational opportunities for students. This report is a compilation of statements regarding these proposals. The document also includes the proposed constitutional amendment, draft legislation, a computer simulation of the distribution proposal impact, and an analysis by a nongovernmental agency. (Author)",

The author focuses, albeit briefly, on performance as a function of the interaction between supervisory style and organizational climate. He argues that performance objectives are in integral of the systems approach to instruction, which is a highly sophisticated process with carefully defined logic and procedures. The introduction of performance objectives and the concomitant systematizing of instruction produces more structure and rules than is normally the case in teaching, which therefore requires more detailed supervision. Within this  context, the paper (1) discusses the need for close supervision in employing the systems approach to instruction, and (2) outlines some of the essential elements in the supervision of instruction using performance objectives.

According to the report, nonverbal behaviors provide the primary vehicle for expressing emotion and leakage channels that are difficult to control or to censor; and nonverbal cues function as qualifiers in the form of metacommunicative messages to indicate how verbal statements ought to be understood. It is the supervisor's responsibility to share with the teacher his observations of this nonverbal behavior. The report notes that teachers tend to be defensive about observations with which they disagree, and that observations and evaluations of nonverbal phenomena seem  to dramatize these value differences. According to the author, the utility of the observation system, the validity of which both supervisor and teacher agree upon, is that it removes the difficulty of value differences. (JF)",

Under this system, the observer would and should have no idea as to what the instrument is supposed to measure, his only task being to record what he sees. Taking a pupil's point of view and adopting his kind of discriminations, the observer draws only those inferences a pupil might draw about the meaning of what is said. Such inferences might include whether the teacher is telling the pupil something he should learn and remember; whether he is asking  a question the pupil is supposed to answer; or whether the teacher is looking for a certain answer he has in his head.

A pretest-posttest research design was used to measure pupil achievement, and an instrument was designed for teacher evaluation of music curriculum guides. Results of the performance test showed that pupils using the behavioral objective-structural sequencing guide made almost twice the achievement gains during one academic year than did pupils using the traditional guide. In addition, teacher responses indicated that their  perceptions of the degrees of pupil participation in \"listening\" and \"physical movement\" in the experimental model were significantly greater than those of control teachers. No differences in pupil participation in \"singing\" and \"creative activities\" were noted. Experimental teachers indicated significantly higher evaluations of and preferences for the new guide.

The Model for Educational Improvement is a theoretical construct that combines some well-known elements of the change process in a new configuration. The model deals with both the external factors and the internal structure of a school system and demonstrates the route through which an innovation moves toward adoption. This part of the investigation deals with school systems using change agent teams as a vehicle for educational improvement and compares them to other school systems without such teams.  Findings revealed little evidence that the presence of change agent teams made any difference in perception, emphasis, responsibility, or influence in relation to the improvement process in a school system. Of special concern was the ancillary finding that school staffs have limited knowledge of the process of adoption in their own school system. This finding was identified as the \"level of ignorance\" and showed that from 32-73 percent of the staff knew little of the process by which a major innovation was adopted in their own school system.

The preschoolers examined were the 1966 cohort of 1008 infants who were 50% biological risk and 50% nonrisk. Criteria for selection of experimental subjects were disorders of pregnancy and gestation, delivery, neonatal effects, and any combination of these. It was hypothesized that the four categories of early developmental risk and social class were significant influences on child growth as measured in physical, motor, and cognitive domains at four ages of  36, 42, 48, and 54 months. The statistical model employed was multiple linear regression. Regressive models of development were compared. Predictors and criteria for each of the four ages were reported. The models were found to vary considerably in their capacity to account for criterion variance. Results showed that at 36 months, consideration of the three domains of development indicated that cognitive attainment was most predictable, and that at the later ages, social class was usually more influential than biological risks on cognitive attainment.

        "description":"Described is the development of the Paraprofessional Educator Manager (PEM) Model and the role of the PEM in early childhood education. Various studies are first cited to show that individuals other than trained teachers can stimulate the intellectual development of preschool children. The PEM model is thought to provide for the greatest integration of positively oriented activities at home and at school at the lowest cost possible. The model is also said to provide a training ground for the upgrading of adults as well as children. The PEM is explained to supervise paraprofessional teacher aides and paraprofessional home visitors who attempt to coordinate the classroom and home learning environments. The role of the PEM is shown to require him to retrain, plan, organize,  supervise, and integrate the activities of eight paraprofessionals working with 48 children and their families. Implementation of the model and training of the PEM are then briefly noted. (CB)",

The first part of the report presented the overall study, while the second part consisted of a manual for student aides and administrators of similar programs. The sample consisted of 29 male handicapped, 32 male aides, 33 female handicapped, and 72 female aides. Results showed that participants, when compared to general  college students at the college, made better academic records and had a lower attrition rate. Most participants were reported to have found meaningful vocational placement which was related to their measured vocational interest profiles. It was concluded that student aides appeared to make a positive contribution to the total educational process for physically handicapped students, and that the aide role had no negative effects on the aides' own progress.

A total of 7,119 children participated in the examination and were thought to be closely representative of the child population from which they were drawn with respect to age, sex, race, region, and other available demographic and socioeconomic variables. Major findings were reported to include: from the otoscopic examination, approximately 20% of the children were found to have some abnormality in at least one of their eardrums; enlarged tonsils touching at the midline were  found among more than 1% of the children; one child in five was found to have some obstruction or defect of the nose; and children with abnormalities of their eardrums were found to have reduced hearing sensitivity, on the average, at all the test frequencies. Comparison of the results with a 1958-60 study among Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, school children 5 to 14 years of age was made.

Major findings were that boys showed a greater incidence of handicaps than girls, that incidence of more than one handicapped child in a family was high, that parents thought their children needed more help in school,  that annual costs to parents ranged from $50 to $4,000, and that almost 10% of the handicapped children took medication. A survey of 25 service agencies was also conducted to assess the programs available to handicapped children in the county and the additional services needed. A general finding was that few agencies considered the entire needs of the children, such as his physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being.

The data regarding the language development of the children showed that receptive and expressive language acquisition could be measured with the test instrument developed and that these data clearly indicated the child's language growth.

An equal number of academically handicapped students are projected to participate and be supported by District funds. All of the students are diagnosed as handicapped, with deficiencies in functional reading skills, academic achievement and/or readiness for the world of work. Activities are described to include skill training of students in various occupational areas, including health, industrial, business, community homemaking jobs,  maintenance, custodial, food services, laundry helper, gardening and nursery work, horseshoeing, animal care, day care and nursery schools, auto repair and service. Training stations are explained to be located at community classrooms, on campus and at off campus sites, depending on the specific nature of job training being followed by students. Learning activity packages are said to be developed to provide specified skill training for students. Some of the students participating are said to be from the inner city. (Author)",

A continuation paper on functional analysis of behavior explains a method of determining behavior contingencies by recording antecedent events occurring prior to behavior, behavior itself, and consequences following behavior. Developing self help skills is covered in terms of techniques to increase self feeding skills, techniques to weaken undesirable feeding behaviors and to teach appropriate toilet skills. The short discussion of behavior modification with an autistic child concludes that  careful structuring of the child's environment can influence the child's behavior. A method of teaching imitation to severely handicapped and retarded children is then presented. The paper on technology of education examines use of consequences in the classroom. Three concluding short papers discuss behavior problems in the classroom, administering behavioral programs, and modification of self destructive behavior, respectively. (CB)",

The stage was explained to involve processing visual stimuli prior to sensation and through to recognition. In three of the four experiments, the paradigm of visual masking was used to determine the speed or efficiency of information processing; the Crawford-pattern mask technique was used throughout. The four experiments were titled age effects on backward visual masking, adult age effects on backward visual masking, forward and backward masking with normal and retarded subjects, and iconic storage and information availability by normal and retarded subjects, respectively. Subjects in the four experiments  ranged in age from 5 to 55 years of age. Major findings of the experiments were reported to be development and documentation of a methodology surmounting previous problems in studying development and mental retardation aspects of iconic memory, establishment of relationship between age variable and efficiency with which visual information is processed, and poorer performance by retarded subjects on iconic memory tasks than by normal subjects matched in terms of mental age.

Theoretical examination of the etiology of stuttering notes that traditional theories of stuttering have differed primarily in the inferences concerning the nature of the causal factor. The theories are categorized and briefly discussed in groups of physical or neurological, psychological, and physiogenic and psychogenic etiologies. Discussion of therapy notes that various and sundry methods have been  used in treatment of stuttering, ranging from methods that focus upon treatment of the symptom to methods dealing with the stutterer alone. Examination of conditioning approaches to treatment points out that conditioning or learning approaches emphasize that stuttering is a speech disturbance that could happen to anyone.

Correlation between extent of use of cued speech and reported beneficial effects on receptive and expressive language, speech and  speechreading was significant at the 0.01 confidence level. Impact of the dissemination and parent training program seemed adequate, resulting in initiation of use of cued speech by enough schools and programs to give it a chance to prove its value. Impact of the followup program was insufficient to bring the participating programs to the level of models of use of the method.

Instructional units are provided for the following disability areas: emotionally  disturbed, learning disabilities, brain injured, educable mentally retarded, trainable mentally retarded, communication disorders, blind, visually impaired, deaf and severely hard of hearing, and multiply handicapped. The instructional units are said to result from a conference on the role of music in the special education of handicapped children. (CB)",

Introductory comments in the general session are followed by three sessions on occupational program design for the emotionally disturbed, employment potential for the emotionally disturbed youth in the world-of-work, and guided tour of basic modified secondary occupational programs, ages 15 years and up at the career development center, respectively. The proceedings are conducted in a most informal manner with many references to specific students and their problems and/or accomplishments. Occupational awareness  laboratories are explained to provide experiences for students 5 to 10 years of age; the experiences are thought to represent the real work world in terms of activity, understanding, and appreciation. Preoccupational exploration experiences are then described to be shops designed to provide general occupational experience in broad based areas for the intermediate or middle school population. Secondary vocational educational is discussed, with the further options of specialized education, split programing, or work experience. (CB)",

In this overview paper, the author considers a large body of research, especially that commissioned by the Television and Social Behavior program of the National Institute of Mental Health, and concludes that children are exposed to a great variety of aggressive models and do acquire and are able to reproduce aggressive behavior. Evidence on children's acceptance of aggressive behaviors is described as complex, subtle, and dependent on such factors as rewards to the model, whether the model is seen as fantasy or reality, the  observer's home life, and the situations in which he finds himself. However, the author feels that the accumulated weight of the evidence from so many studies justifies the conclusion that at least under some circumstances, exposure to televised aggression can lead children to accept what they have seen as a partial guide for their own actions.

They tend to be distrustful of new ideas and methods and to rely on their extended families to meet their needs for human contact. One way in which the working class person may have a chance to widen the character of his interactions with society may be through cable television. In order to achieve this breakthrough the communication system must be manned and sustained by persons of ostensible working status backgrounds and interests, thereby giving the cable system credence among its proposed audience and a voice to speak to the outside world. With this system established it may be possible to give working class people a view of the larger world, an understanding of the  society in which they live, and a guide to the power they possess to shape society to their needs. The proposed system may also offer simple pleasure-giving entertainment that is better geared to the unique popular culture tastes of working people. (JY)",

Over-the-air broadcasting has regarded informational programming as an &quot;inessential item&quot;, to be disposed of whenever profits fail to increase. Television news has been superficial and has failed to take into account the needs and tastes of minority groups. Controversial informational programs have suffered from government criticism and the lack of sponsors. The costs of network programs are enormous. If cable television left payment and access up to the viewer, thereby eliminating the need for censorship, and used low-cost  videorecorders and less slick presentation methods, many of the problems of over-the-air news programming could be solved. In order to achieve this goal cable should be granted a modified common carrier status, with a number of free public channels. The remaining channels should be reserved for whatever services the viewer chooses, with no advertising and little regulation beyond maintaining technological standards and keeping competition open. These regulatory preferences should be indicated before the disposition of power is firmly established and resistant to change. (JY)",

The basic assumption implicit in the concept of the multiple-image presentation is that it increases learning. A study tested the effect on learning of single- and multiple-image presentations as they related to two levels of stimulus complexity of a series of similar problems and to practice of these problems. Three experimental variables (stimulus complexity, communicator strategy, practice), six stimulus conditions, and 24 treatment combinations were used. Subjects were asked to learn a visual concept and identify it on later slides. Results showed that reducing the number of irrelevant cues, while holding  relevant ones constant, reduced the difficulty of learning. Also, practice over a series of similar concept attainment problems had a positive but differential effect over a series of four problems. (JK)",

The study also used individual eye movement quantifications as a predictor of preference for color and non-color pictures. Specifically, eye movement fixation patterns were used as indices of preference for color and non-color visual displays. An exploratory examination of the results of individual eye fixation preference in the experiment suggested that the total subject population could be subdivided into two groups: group A, subjects who looked at color stimulus, non-color response and did not change fixation preference from pre-learning to post-learning test; and group B, all other subjects. In both groups in a synchronous audiovisual presentation,  learning was facilitated more by color pictures than by non-color pictures. The preference expressed by eye fixation variables for the two visual presentation modes was not shown to differentially relate to efficiency of learning for the whole population, but the results did support the hypothesis of interaction for the subjects in group B. Prediction of learning success was facilitated by the addition of eye movement variables to more conventional ability predictors and by the addition of color card preference choices to other ability predictors.

Computer simulation of reading is useful because the similarities in the human reception and perception of orthography and computer input allows such study. Computer simulation enables a more detailed study of the acquisition of reading skills than is possible in laboratory or classroom studies. In previous research a computer program was written to convert the word orthographies appearing in beginning readers to the segmental phonemes which define their oral representation.

The components include two bidirectional cables, a computer for processing subscribers' requests, and subscriber terminals to be located in homes or offices. The home terminal includes a three-digit keyboard or a full numeric keyboard with a strip printer. The first phase of testing has showed the full SRS system transmits data with high reliability in the presence of typical or even excessive thermal noise. Tests of the computer and software showed the system can deal with heavy service traffic with an average interrogation response time from 2.4 to 13.3 seconds for 50,000 subscribers. Initial consumer use of the system will be for  meter-reading, shopping from the home, reservation services and emergency services. Other services to be tried may include pay TV, interactive education in the home, audience participation programs and off-track betting. (MG)",

A systematic review of past and current experiments with educational applications of computers and television is coupled with a study of the social milieu in which public schools can be expected to operate in the near future. The paper is divided into four sections: a general overview of the social conditions which characterize schools today, an overview of the many studies which have been done in the use of television and computers in education, and economic analysis of some of the best studies of media use in order to provide some data about the combinations of media and teacher which could produce a given \"educational outcome;\" and a summary of  findings and implications. The report notes that while it is well established that students can learn from both television and computers, studies have not been done with an eye toward an economic product approach which would allow the determination of the best media-teacher mix to produce a given educational outcome. It is also found that certain aspects of the social milieu of present day education work against the effective use of educational technology. (JY)",

The five basic functions performed by all libraries--acquisition, cataloging, storage, retrieval, and circulation control--are identified, and an overview of library cooperation of a general nature not restricted to communication is presented. Applications of telecommunications are then described with respect to interlibrary information interchange and with respect to new uses. School and academic library budgets are discussed, together with the important role played by federal legislation and  financial assistance. Current interlibrary communication utilization is described, noting that data communication is potentially an area of considerable value to libraries, but is currently used by only a few. The future of interlibrary communication utilization is projected; medical school libraries are seen as most likely to increase their utilization of data communication in the near future. (JY)",

In order to find some of the causes of this lack and to point out policy questions in this area, the author surveys several issues in the field of new information media. He discusses the impact of the new technologies on the universities, and he likens the development of cable television to the founding of the postal service. He examines some of the issues in publishing, noting the lessons to be learned from the development of the publishing industry and tracing the effects of new technologies on the industry. In dealing with the library crisis, he notes that the access to adequate storage and  distribution techniques of both print and non-print media will have to be improved if libraries are to thrive. Personal contributions to the \"social memory\", he notes, are more limited by the new technologies than they were by the advent of pencil and paper. The copyright problems arising from facsimile transmission, dry copying techniques, and cable television are examined in some detail. (JY)",

Two efforts to meet the first problem are use of media and audiovisual aids and also proposals to reorganize the school system. An additional help would be the establishment of a communications university which would offer training in all fields needing communications expertise.

Each yoked subject was paired randomly with a member of the branched group and received the item sequence, including branching items, determined by the performance of his branched partner. The yoked group provided a control for the adapting process. The only difference between the branched and yoked groups was that the item sequences were adaptive to and appropriate for the branched subjects and not for the yoked  subjects.

The latest CATV systems provide down stream, to-the-subscriber transmission between 50-300 MHz, and up stream from-the-subscriber transmissions between 5-30 MHz. This system design is adequate for TV.

Five years later the first transoceanic cable was laid. In 1875 A.G. Bell transmitted the first complete sentence heard over wire, and the first Bell telephone company was started in 1878. The first telephones were sold in pairs; the subscriber had to install their own lines. When the early telephone exchanges were built they were manned by young boys. The dial telephone was invented by a Kansas City undertaker in 1889. Radio and telephony developed with the telephone system, and the first radiotelephone linking the U.S. and Europe was established in 1927. The first amplitude modulation (AM) radio station  began operating in Springfield, Mass., shortly after World War I, and the first frequency modulation (FM) station was authorized to operate by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1940. The first television station was authorized by the FCC in 1941 and the first CATV station system began several years later. (MG)",

By 1965 the FCC had claimed jurisdiction over all CATV systems in the U. S. This jurisdiction was challenged in 1968 and was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. The same year the FCC proposed new rules regarding which signals could be carried on CATV in certain categories of broadcast markets. In October 1969 the FCC ruled that CATV systems with 3,500 or more subscribers must start originating a significant amount of programing within 18 months. In 1970 the FCC prohibited CATV ownership by telephone companies in their own service areas and by  national TV networks. The same year the Commission established new rules about importing distant signals and began an inquiry into how regulatory authority over CATV should be divided among federal, state, and local government.

There are many problems still to be worked out, such as a system of copyright compensation for re-broadcast programs; federal, state, or local jurisdictions; over-promising to get franchises; and understanding a maze of rules which may not even work. However, it is clear that the time has come for cable television to begin to act and experiment, using the spirit of the rules--better service for the public-- and not  playing games with the letter of the rules.

The goal of the experiment was to determine the extent to which computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and knowledge of group dynamics can overcome the serious instructional problems of large introductory lecture courses. Students were divided into three sections. Students in one section received the CAI as individual students; students in another section studied in small groups and received the CAI as a group; the third section served as a control group. Academic achievement, attitudinal development, and the sociometry of the students in the test sections were studied. It was found that the students preferred small group instruction. The students studying in small groups  sometimes achieved academic results which were superior to the control group; but occasionally the small group produced significantly inferior results. When this happened, the group also demonstrated a significant deterioration in social structure. The small group instruction had a much lower cost per pupil than did the individual use of CAI. It was therefore concluded that a combination of CAI and careful attention to group dynamics may be an effective and economical way to solve the problem of large group instruction in introductory college courses.

By the end of the contact year every training manual was revised, based on data from in-house tests, consultant reviews, and results from various test sites. Tests showed that the manuals were effective in either self-instruction or group  presentation modes. It was found that the greatest need for assistance with the training program always arose during the set-up phase and, after that, any problems that arose could be handled by telephone.

EIN attempted to promote the sharing of computing resources at colleges, universities, and educational service institutions across the nation by publishing descriptions of programs available at each member institution along with the name of an EIN representative at the institution in the EIN Software Catalog. The hoped-for result was that casual users would have their programs run at whatever computing facility had the appropriate program available rather than write their own. It was found that the volume of use never reached the desired level. Some of the reasons put  forward for this failure were: the use of mail to transfer information and programs among members resulted in slow turn-around time; many members wanted to acquire programs for comparative or teaching purposes rather than to submit a job; it was difficult for the distant user to interact effectively with the computing facility. Chief among the suggestions offered to remediate these and other problems with the Network was the use of a cheap, high-speed electronic access system. (JY)",

Among other things there is interest in attempting to find out how motor programs are stored latently, selected, activated into muscular contractions, controlled, and tailored for optimum communication. Chapter 1 discusses research thought and methodology in phonetics and expresses the need for constant empirical feedback in all stages of the development of models of these processes. Chapter 2 attempts to shed light on the mechanisms speakers use to control the fundamental frequency of phonation in speech. Chapter 3 considers arguments, evidence, and experimental techniques relevant to discovering certain possible  brain mechanisms underlying observed speech behavior. Two issues are covered: the possible role of feedback in speech and how the timing of gestures in speech is controlled. (Author/VM)",

They include the notions of: (1) \"integrity of the discipline,\" (2) \"democratization\" of instruction, and (3) academic accountability. Discussion of the growing mythology surrounding individualized instruction reveals critical weaknesses and basic, contradictory educational objectives in such teaching methods. While the value of educational \"democratization\" cannot be denied, the realities of educational financing and the nature of language instruction itself preclude the success of individualized programs of instruction at this time.

This initially can create problems of communication breakdown. To complicate the situation, nonverbal messages that do not support verbal communication messages assure communication breakdown. This paper proposes cultural differences as the number one consideration for the school when it deals with children from different cultures and provides recommendations for teachers, curriculum, and community on affecting the change required to meet the educational needs of the  culturally different child.

Linguistic work during the period was directed at expanding the dictionaries for both German and English. The number of lexical items coded was increased, as were the features associated with each item. The coding involved complex problems of linguistic description, such as treatment of adverbs and extended forms of verbs. Since adverbs had not been adequately classified in any existing grammars of German or English, a new classificatory schema is being developed. The  extended forms of German verbs have been treated in a recent monograph, which has served as the basis for the lexical analysis of these constructions within the German-English MT System. These extended forms are particularly difficult in having a small group of verbs used primarily to depict the verbal component and nouns combined with them to carry the semantic portion of the expression.

Included is a detailed accounting for the 1969-70 academic year of the resources and expenditures of unmarried full-time students, most of whom were college sophomores. Major emphasis was placed in the instutitional practice of packaging grants, loans, and jobs, and the relationship of student indebtedness to persistence in college and plans for continuing education on the undergraduate and graduate levels. Analysis of the data revealed that parents provided most (44%) of the student's income. Students themselves provided 35% of this income: 15% from employment during the school year and 20% from other sources such as personal assets, savings from summer  employment, and income tax refunds. Eleven percent of the students income came from scholarships and grants and 10% from loans. Comparisons are made in the study by sex, race, and type of institution attended. (Author/HS)",

College professors and high school teachers belong to separate professional organizations, and rarely do conferences involve both types of educators together. Thus, a communication gap exists that has at its base a problem that students are complaining about everywhere -- that of a lack of relevance in the classroom. High schools are ideally supposed to prepare students for the college experience, but this cannot take place unless high school teachers realize what is to be expected of students after they go to college. To study this and related problems, a conference was held at which participants were students, faculty, and administrators from both secondary and higher  education institutions.

Observations of departments indicate that they are knowledge- or discipline-oriented rather than teacher-oriented.

In such sexually mixed institutions, girls are not only in competition for men, but they are in competition with men as well. Thus, the female faces an identity crisis that would be avoided. At single sex institutions, women can compete among themselves in the sciences as well as in traditional female areas. Women in women's colleges are able to develop leadership qualities in student government and college committees without sacrificing their feminity.

These are: (1) Do students indeed provide the instructor with information about instructional practices that he doesn't already know? and (2) If this is the case, to what extent is it true at a variety of colleges and for a significant proportion of instructors? The study was conducted by comparing student ratings or descriptions of instruction with the teachers' own self-reported descriptions. The correlation between the 2 sets of descriptions or ratings were not particularly high, indicating only modest agreement in the way faculty and students perceived instruction. In particular, instructors and students did not agree on the extent to which students are free to ask  questions or give opinions in class, on the extent to which instructors are concerned with student learning, on the amount of agreement between objectives and what is being taught, on instructor openness to other viewpoints, on the extent to which instructors inform students of how they would be evaluated, on whether the instructor encourages students to think for themselves, and on the clarity of course objectives. These discripancies between the 2 sets of ratings not only underscore the need for student feedback, but also suggest specific areas of instruction where feedback is most essential. (HS)",

        "description":"The present study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between 2 expressions of alienation, described as psychological alienation and activist political alienation, and to learn something of the characteristics of students who manifest these different expressions. Four general types of students are found in evidence. The first type are the conventionalists or students with low psychological alienation and low activist political alienation. These are generally good students who are satisfied with the societal status quo. The second type of student is the disturbed conventionalist or a student with high psychological alienation and low activist political alienation. These students are generally not able to form their own identities, but do not attribute their personal  dissatisfactions to defects in the established political structure. The third type are the integrated activists or students with low psychological alienation and high activist political alienation. These students usually have liberal parents and are from socioeconomically and educationally privileged backgrounds. They remain faithful to parents values, and are frequently more idealistic, individualistic, and impulsive than other students. The final type; the disturbed activists, appear to have both high psychological alienation and high activist political alienation. These students are usually from privileged backgrounds, but are estranged from parents, resentful and rebellious. (HS)",

It is felt that the Tufts administration should provide positive leadership to dispel present concerns and to encourage the employment of qualified academics who are married. Although antinepotism policies were originally passed to protect colleges and universities from the political pressures of having to hire incompetent people with influential connections and to prevent the formation of father-son alliances, they are now used almost exclusively as rationalizations not to hire or promote women who are married to faculty members. After considerable study of nepotism practices and their effects, it is evident that the elimination of antinepotism practices would have the following effects:  (1) undergraduates would be able to see husband and wife teams working together professionally and dealing with the problems of dual-career marriages; (2) undergraduate women would be exposed to more good academic career models; (3) qualified women and men married to faculty members would be better able to utilize their valuable talent and resources; (4) Tufts would be assuming a position of leadership in providing equal opportunity for women; and (5) the university would have a larger pool of qualified female academics from which to choose.

Medical schools and their affiliated teaching hospitals are trying in various ways to adapt their teaching, research, and service functions to these concerns. With the intent of exploring how a number of medical centers are approaching these problems, the Harvard Center for Community Health and Medical Care in the spring of 1970 sponsored an Invitational Conference on the Evaluation of University Medical Care Programs. The conference brought together representatives of 6 medical schools with comprehensive medical care plans, as well as people with special backgrounds in  medical care, economics, prepaid health care plans, and program evaluation. The specific thrust of the conference centered around how each of the participating medical schools are proposing to evaluate their particular medical care plan. This document presents the papers and discussions that took place at the conference. (Author/HS)",

Noting a 45% dropout rate in psychology doctoral students who began between 1955 and 1964 and were studied in 1968, one author deplored the loss in time and effort to students and faculty when students leave graduate school. Also of interest were possible sex differences in the variables used to select candidates, and in the reasons behind male and female graduate students dropping out. Thus, 123 graduate students entering the University of Washington Department of Psychology between 1963 and 1967 were studied. Although progress toward the Ph.D. was not highly related to admissions data such as GRE scores and undergraduate grades, performance in the first  year was found to be predictive of later success. Evidence of sex discrimination was minimal and subtle. It is suggested that greater attention be directed toward measuring commitment to the doctorate to reduce the rather large attrition from the program. (Author/HS)",

Unhappiness with nonacademic aspects of Hofstra was  cited by a slightly smaller percentage (36%), and dissatisfaction with academic aspects was cited by the smallest percentage (30%). Academically better students tended to give dissatisfaction with the dorms and other nonacademic aspects of Hofstra as reasons for leaving, whereas the poorer students cited personal and financial reasons.

An examination of the data indicates the following trends: (1) USC freshmen are less likely to express a left and are more likely to express a middle-of-the-road political preference than their national counterparts. (2) 1971 entering freshmen at USC are considerably more apt to express a left than a right political preference. (3) In-state freshmen were more likely to express a left and less likely to express a right preference than  were out-of-state freshmen at USC. (4) The overall increase in left political preference expressed by USC entering freshmen does not appear to be related to sex or state residency.

The system's structural properties and their interrelationships determine the degree of structural conduciveness to norm-oriented movements or hostile outbursts. It was found that variables relevant to structural conduciveness are all highly interrelated aspects of structural differentiation. The environment of the university is unstable with what is described as \"disturbed-reactive\" and \"turbulent fields\" qualities. Strategies of cooperation and coalescence used to cope with the environment are subtle and complex. The organizational structure of the university is highly decentralized, with tendencies in the administrative sector toward hierarchalization that are  countered by departmental and academic autonomy and a new student subculture. Important factors that generate strain in American colleges and universities are: looseness of fit between norms influencing the education process and democratic equalitarian humanitarian values; separation and remoteness of policymaking bodies from their constituent groups; the encounter of social cleavages on campuses and the existence of strongly felt but ambiguous authority structure.

All states must begin to resolve for themselves the problems that are occurring and will occur within the next decade. This document presents the results of a study made in the state of Ohio to determine the present needs of medical manpower in the state, the projected need for physicians, and the methods by which a shortage of physicians may be alleviated. Planning for such problems requires that several central questions be answered: (1) What is the relationship of medical education to the means for delivery of medical care to the people of Ohio, and how can this relationship be improved? (2) How many Doctor of Medicine degree recipients should be graduated annually in Ohio by 1980,  and how do current expansion plans of the 4 existing colleges of medicine compare with these needs? and (3) If more Doctors of Medicine are needed by 1980 than will be supplied through current expansion plans, where should one or more new colleges of medicine be located? Further, should plans for new medical schools call for the same kind of large-scale medical center that has embodied the best in medical education in past decades, or should expansion take the form of a bold new departure in medical education? These and other questions are considered. (HS)",

The movement to permit women to study and practice medicine was spearheaded by Sophia Jex-Blake when she sought admission to the medical classes in the University of Edinburgh in 1869. She fought and won the privilege of attending the medical classes in the university under limited conditions, and she was later joined by 4 other women seeking the same right. Final and total victory was won when, in 1878, Parliament redefined the Medical Act of 1858 to confirm women's eligibility for medical education in separate classes, for their admission to the prescribed examinations, and for their right to be duly  registered as physicians. This document presents an account of the movement to secure these rights to study and practice medicine in Great Britain. (HS)",

Not only have these scholars provided an atmosphere at their campuses in which intellectual pursuit has thrived, but their very presence has attracted other eminent scholars to New York State, producing a concentration of expertise that has resulted in many international conferences in the State. The chairs have served as educational and financial resources for the State by promoting research endeavors and enhancing faculty output in their institutions, and  scholarly research has been stimulated resulting in the publication of hundreds of articles and papers, and in the writing and editing of many books. The image of New York State as a locus for intellectual excellence has been and should continue to be enhanced by such a program. (Author/HS)",

The solution to this uniformity, especially in the United States, has been that of the formation of consortia or other cooperative agreements between and among different colleges and universities. The province of Ontario, Canada, has many problems that may be solved by the creation of cooperative programs. In Ontario there is a system of extramural and continuing education which is competitive, essentially anarchic, and ill-adapted to the job of educating its yough. In its present organization there is little likelihood that the provincial system can fulfill its responsibilities of today, much less the vastly increased responsibilities it should assume tomorrow.

However, tenure at the same time may also tend to perpetuate mediocrity and incompetence within a college community if faculty members are not carefully scrutinized prior to granting them tenure. Students, because of their close association with faculty, should definitely be included in the evaluation of teacher competence. Thus, it is recommended that the University of Utah create a Student Advisory Committee comprised of upperclassmen and graduate students in each department to make recommendations regarding curriculum or other departmental changes, and evaluations of all teachers being considered for retention or  tenure. It is also recommended that 3 qualified students be granted membership on the University Tenure Advisory Committee.

A conference was held on the subject of equal opportunities for women and at a 1969 conference a NOW chapter was formed on the Cornell campus. Since that time, this organization has succeeded in ending the admissions quotas for women in various departments, has ended parietal rules and residence rules for women, and has instituted a branch of Planned Parenthood on  campus so that every undergraduate female will have success to contraceptive counseling and devices. Another achievement of the 1969 conference was the development of Female Studies at Cornell. The first course taught was \"The Evolution of the Female Personality.\" This course touches on history, sociology, literature, intellectual history, and anthropology, and was found to be of interest to undergraduate men as well as women.

However, a cooperative arrangement among colleges, such as the one described in this paper, can sexually integrate single-sex colleges at very little extra cost. The Five Colleges Cooperation consists of 1 male college, Amherst; 2 female institutions, Smith and Mount Holyoke; a new coeducational undergraduate college, Hampshire College; and a large state university, the University of Massachusetts. In this cooperative agreement, any student at any one of the colleges may elect to enroll in any course at any other of the colleges, so long as that course is not offered at his or her own institution. The possibility of establishing student centers for students at all of the colleges has  also been discussed, as well as joint extra-curricular organizations and social clubs. This arrangement, which would cost the colleges approximately $10 million if undertaken separately, can be achieved for about $200,000 a year in a cooperative arrangement. (HS)",

However, more and more women are becoming discontent with their traditional roles as wife, mother, and housekeeper, and are demanding their full and equal rights as persons. The university has an important role in developing women and men and for preparing them to meet the challenge that a changing society offers. It is therefore suggested that universities create an Institute for the Study, Redefinition and Resocialization of Women as an independent institute or interdisciplinary department in the university. The Institute would contain 2 divisions: the Division of Woman Studies and Research of Women, and the Division of Continuing  Education. Such an institute would provide women with the opportunity to learn the necessary skills to participate in a more representative way in decisionmaking whether in government or in community or business.

A regression analysis was used to study the relationship between college quality and individuals' incomes, controlling for individual ability, years in school, experience, and other socio-economic traits. Both peer group effects and faculty quality were found to be significant influences on later incomes of students. The influence of quality grew as labor force experience grew. Educational quality seemed to have greater effects for more able students. Also additional years in school are substitutes for college quality in the process of preparing to earn  income in post-school life. (Author/HS)",

The project was conducted by and for a consortium of institutions that included Eastern Oregon College, Southern Oregon College, Oregon College of Education, Oregon Technical Institute, Portland State University, and the Teaching Research Division of the Oregon System of Higher Education. Principal activities in the first year were seminars, workshops, and demonstrations for faculty, administrators, and  business officers. Subsequent activities primarily involved preparation and review of proposals, and conducting research and development projects. Projects were completed in areas of biology, poetry, economics, music, pass/fail grading, and student evaluation of instruction. Some projects not culminating in final reports had substantial accomplishments. A sizable program patterned after CORD has been established by the State. (Author/HS)",

Seven self-instructional units, currently in various stages of completion, form the basis of a basic curriculum in opthamology. Performance objectives for the units were derived from the results of a questionnaire responded to by 1,600 practitioners and students of differing backgrounds and areas of specialization. The instructional materials concentrate on the development of clinical information-gathering and management skills rather than the recall of factual knowledge. The 7 units are expected to consist of approximately 20 hours of instruction. A 5-hour unit on ophthalmoscopy has undergone tryout and revision based on student performance. Performance on newly developed  mannequins, which allow simulation of the opthalmoscopic examination, was the criterion measure. Sophomore medical students, after completing the opthalmoscopy unit, were compared to senior medical students who had had experience in using the opthalmoscope with patients. The sophomore students performed an average of 13 percentage points higher over-all than the seniors, and 63% of the sophomores scored higher than any senior. (Author/HS)",

In addition to the survey, a personal interview was conducted with 10 eligible students to provide validation for the questionnaire and supplementary information. The study revealed that counselors are significantly more concerned about students, more accepting of students, more genuine with  students, more approachable to students, and more effective in meeting the advisement needs of students, than are faculty advisors. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that colleges utilize more trained counselors in their advisement programs.

Extending the concept of these evaluations to include the student instructional expectations dimension, the study proposed that the classroom experience be related to the process and systems approaches, more dependent upon monitoring and feedback. As a working model for classroom role structure, it employed Stogdill's group achievement framework to distinguish between those expectations associated with institutional dynamics--called situational--and those related to the classroom--called contextual. Instruments were administered at the opening--and close--of a semester to 209 students in 8 social science classes in 3 colleges. Developed from previous Critical  Incident and factor analysis techniques, the 20 instrument items employed modified Semantic Differential scales. Additionally, the study examined relationships between expectations and the AVL (Allport-Vernon-Lindzey) Value Scale. The substantive hypotheses--for each class and demographic variable--found statistically significant differences between expectations and evaluations, even for high evaluations. If these evaluations demonstrated the direction of expectations, but failing to indicate their intensity, the study concluded that extrapolations made solely from evaluations were of questionable value in measuring the range of classroom dynamics. AVL intercorrelations did not produce any significant patterns, however. (Author)",

Results of the study indicate that it is difficult to determine what faculty members will change their jobs for what reasons. It is felt that the economic aspects of a new job offering are not the only reasons for a faculty member's decision to change positions. Faculty are generally classified into 2 categories: the movers and the non-movers. Those who are movers, it is found, seem to feel that they will find more satisfactory working conditions at institutions other than the one where they are employed. What they actually find is a situation closely resembling the one that they left, and once again they move on. Faculty mobility appears to be decreasing heavily as the job market absorbs  the overpopulation of Ph.D.'s, and the subject, within a very short period of time, is expected to become close to impossible to study. However, research is needed in the field of intrainstitutional mobility. Career paths within colleges and universities, mobility through the ranks and into and out of administration, are becoming increasingly important areas where study is needed. (HS)",

The extension educator presented to the sociologist several important behaviors of the county agent as discovered through research using the critical incident technique and asked him to indicate sociological concepts that might be helpful to the agent in performing his tasks. The encounter between the 2 professionals was intended to suggest an approach that an extension educator might make to a sociologist for isolating sociological concepts relevant to the county agent's job. It ended with a commitment by the sociologist to take the lists of behaviors of county agents that the extension educator  had developed through the use of the critical incident technique and relate sociological concepts to these behaviors. The sociologist in turn left 3 books with the extension educator that he felt would be useful to him in his quest for sociological concepts that would, if understood by the county agent, be helpful in his job performance.

More specifically, it concerns itself with questions such as: What is the present role of the small college? What roles can small colleges most effectively play in the continuum of research needs? What resources are necessary for playing these research roles? How do the existing college policies and resources relate to those needed for research productivity? What changes in college resources and procedures are required for research and how can they be efficiently made? More than at any time before, society is looking to educational institutions to solve its problems. However, a serious shortage of researchers presents little chance that solutions to society's problems will be found. The  existing challenge to education cannot be met completely by training more researchers. In addition to increasing the research personnel, the practitioners and the community leaders must be encouraged to join hands with researchers in pursuit of the desired solutions. Without the cooperation of all educators and community leaders, there is little hope that education can meet the challenge. (Author/HS)",

Student charges that many college courses are irrelevant to social realities and needs, and that the traditional structure of the academic curriculum results in a fragmented and superficial educational experience are familiar to all concerned with higher education. Not only has the substance of particular courses and academic programs come under attack, but also the methods of packaging them, such as the A-to-F grading system, the use of lectures rather than independent study, and inflexible course and degree requirements. Studies have indicated that in the past only a few colleges and universities provided effective means for  students to design or shape accredited academic programs. Now, however, institutions of all types, sizes, and geographic locations are not merely bowing to student pressures for participation in educational reform, but are actively encouraging student suggestions for change. This paper summarizes results from a survey of student initiated changes in college curriculum in over 230 diverse higher education institutions in the U.S. (Author/HS)",

The first problem that needs to be confronted is the need for a new attitude toward freshmen and their experience. To further this new attitude, several suggestions are made: (1) appoint a director for freshman studies to be a personification of the institution's concerns for the freshman experience; (2) designate a special team for freshman advisement; (3) appoint a college senate committee on freshman studies; (4) establish a separate set of educational  objectives for the freshman year; and (5) create programs to enhance freshman identity and morale such as publications, dinners, trips, concerts, or lecture series. Whatever the method, relevance must be put back into the freshman year to keep the talented youth interested in the higher education experience as a whole. (HS)",

It is during the freshman year that students form their attitudes toward college and their studies. In addition, many students make decisions as to their college major, their potential occupational field, or whether or not to remain in college at all. In spite of the importance of the freshman year, the year fails at least as often as it may be said to succeed. This lack of success is due in part to the lack of response of the typical freshman curriculum to student needs. The entering freshman in a college often gets the largest classes, the least experienced and poorest paid faculty, the fewest academic options, the least advisement, the dullest subject matter, the least personal living  arrangements, and the most personal rules. The freshman curriculum needs to be revised to enable students to match courses with their interests and needs, rather than taking courses because they contain knowledge that everybody should have. If the freshman curricula were to be corrected now, it is possible that much of the talent that is currently dropping out of college may be utilized by our society in 4 years. (HS)",

Our society has traditionally discriminated against women, not only in jobs and education, but also by defining the female role as a submissive one, where the woman's highest goal is to further the occupational success of her spouse. The purpose of women's studies is to redefine the female role in terms of the possibility of women attaining success and fulfillment through professional occupations rather than through homemaking and child-rearing. Courses in women's studies attempt to raise the awareness of the achievements of women through the normal educational process. During the 1971-72 academic year there were approximately 750 women's courses on 500  campuses, covering topics from the history and literature of women to sex, sexism, and sex roles. It is hoped by the leaders of the movement that women's studies will become even more widespread and will penetrate the consciousness of all persons in every phase of our society. (HS)",

Responses by these subgroups are presented in tables. In general the art class received much more criticism than the law class, especially in the pace and manner of presentation and in the expenses and availability of course materials. The total group and each subgroup stated that they would enroll in the class if it were offered again. (RG)",

Eight major concerns of faculty regarding their evaluation were discussed with emphasis on the positive aspects of evaluation. The use of simulations provided workshop participants with the opportunity to assume roles of deans of instruction, colleagues, department chairmen, and candidates for faculty positions. Golden West College's (California) Assessment of Student Learning (ASL) system was presented as one model for faculty evaluation. The ASL system, which stresses faculty use of specific or behavioral objectives in course planning, was discussed in terms of its advantages to faculty members and the college. Conclusions of the workshop include: (1) an  evaluation scheme should be based on definite performance criteria; (2) deans themselves should become aware of the use of objectives and faculty self-evaluation; (3) the problem of evaluating faculty who do not use objectives was not resolved by the participating deans; (4) the use of simulation appeared a successful way of bringing out problems and underlying concerns; and (5) the participants felt that the workshop was beneficial and should be followed-up with additional meetings.

Findings after one semester of instruction showed that there was: (1) a high correlation  between Nelson-Denny Reading Test scores and knowledge of the English syntax; (2) a significant relationship between directed instruction in English syntax and students' reading achievement; and (3) no significant differences in grade point averages between the control and experimental groups.

A determination was made of the elapsed times for component elements in the sequence from a library requesting material, through processing within PNBC to the library receiving the material. Processing time within PNBC was found to be 13.01% of the total &quot;turn-around&quot; mean time of 19.75 days, and about 6% of the total mode time of 10.5 days. (Author)",

Potential users of this group tend to be  younger, male, white collar workers or students, with a higher level of education, who read more books and have a positive attitude toward the library. The following characteristics of users were determined: (1) if female, a housewife, aged 22-34 with a high school education or better; (2) if male, a student, aged 22-34 with a college education; (3) uses the library for personal reading; and (4) is satisfied with library services and facilities.

The problem of recognizing straight lines in general position on the quadratic lattice has been completely solved by applying parallel acting algorithms to a special code for lines on the lattice. The relation of the code to Farey series and continued fractions and the effects on the code of a line when the line is subjected to affine transformations were studied in detail. Algorithms for reducing straight line codes to a standard form were developed and made the basis of a line recognition process. Cellular automata were designed to carry out line recognition. Other cellular automata were designed to recognize topological connectedness,  detect boundaries and approximate curves by straight line segments. (Author)",

Identification of the Oklahoma MARC Services as the unique resource for sharing among the six states has been followed by development of a strategy for catalyzing the interstate use of this resource. Clarification of services has been accomplished and translated into a SLICE/MARC-O Brochure. Acquainting potential users with the services was identified as a critical first step and thus an educational or training program has been developed and offered to the six states. Communicating the concept of interstate cooperation throughout the six state area has taken the form  of newsletter, professional press news release, and talks with professional library groups as well as the six state library agencies. Guidelines for new SLICE projects have been developed in order to stimulate other cooperative ventures. Each of the six state libraries pledged to support the Continuing Education of Librarians in the Southwest (CELS) project. A proposal for implementation of this project has been prepared.

In addition to the usual printed material the libraries were to have audiovisual equipment and material for individual student use in the library. The library was to be open longer than the regular school day. This program was successfully inaugurated in three of the seven project schools. Pupil response indicates a positive attitude toward the program although the lack of audiovisual equipment and material prevented the full implementation of the program. The short period of operation of the project seriously limited the  ability to obtain reliable data on changes in pupil and staff behavior. The lack of a control group is a limitation of the research design which limits interpretation of the data. However, information was obtained which will serve as a base line for the continuing evaluation of the project during subsequent semesters. (Author/NH)",

Thus, since several libraries had shown some success in upgrading of libraries through the employment of medical library consultants, it was decided that each participating library would identify one member of its staff to perform the role of Intramural Coordinator. This paper attempts to identify the role of a new kind of librarian, the medical library consultant, and to define a reporting mechanism so that Kentucky Ohio Michigan Regional Medical Library (KOMRML) extramural coordinators can begin to share experiences constructively for program planning and implementation. The  change in function of the medical resource libraries to &quot;public&quot; libraries, the role of state library consultants in extending library services, and the possible activities in which a medical library consultant might engage are examined.

The immediate purpose of the project was to develop methodologies for evaluating or analyzing networks; the ultimate purpose was to provide planning assistance to network funders, designers or operators. The project was conducted in four simultaneous phases. The Conceptual Model (Phase I) considered components of network design and performance and identified thirteen significant operational parameters. The Behavioral Model (Phase II) simulated network operations through &quot;game playing&quot; and further confirmed the validity of the Conceptual Model. In Phase III an effort was made to quantitatively analyze interlibrary networks in a Metropolitan Area. Significant operational variables were  identified and measured. A Node-Network Dynamics Grid was developed to assist in evaluation and analysis of the Pilot Model Data. An Analytical Operations Research Model was developed in Phase IV to provide network planners with a tool for netowk performance prediction as a function of design options. A generalized network model called Lib-NAT (Library Network Analysis Theory) was developed and is presented. The methodologies developed in this project have been used by several states for network planning or evaluation and seem to be valid when properly applied. (Author/NH)",

The doctoral dissertation must embody the results of extended research, be an original contribution to knowledge and include material worthy of publication. It is surprising, therefore, that &quot;Dissertation Abstracts,&quot; the primary source of abstracts of dissertations is usually overlooked in reports of English-language abstracting and indexing services. This study provides empirical data about the dissertation as an information source. It assesses diffusion and assimilation patterns of dissertation contents. The assessment was based upon an analysis of patterns of (1) diffusion of dissertation contents in the  open literature of botany, chemical engineering, chemistry and psychology and (2) assimilation of dissertation contents from the original format as reflected by citations to the dissertation itself. It includes a literature review, a description of research design and methodology, an analysis of collected data noting similarities and dissimilarities, and a presentation of conclusions and implications drawn from the investigation. The chapters are supplemented by data presented in the Appendix. (Author/NH)",

What types of households use the library? Why do some households not use the library? What is the cost of the various services provided by the library? What specific steps can the library take to improve its services? What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems? For how long should the library allow books to be checked out? How frequently should overdue notices be sent out? Is an investment in a security system worthwhile? These questions were studied in the context of the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library. A methodology for determining answers to these  questions, as well as to other questions that arose during the investigation was developed. Although answers will vary from library to library, the methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries.

The approaches to the problem are varied, but the common objective of literature control is evident. The U. S. seems to be firmly committed to the Uniform System, and, as a national system, it is ably suited to the needs of architects, contractors, and manufacturers. Its chief disadvantage is the lack of knowledge of the workings or even the existence of the system among the three groups it professes to serve. The main problem facing the European community is one of direction--systems used are as varied as the countries themselves. In the U. S., use of computers is invaluable for their speed in sifting, sorting, and updating processes. While in Europe, computers are being employed  to find a common terminology for member nations of the International Council for Building Research, Studies, and Documentation (CIB). The work of the CIB is so far-reaching that the U. S. must become aware of its activities. U. S. participation, either as a CIB member or as an observer is desirable, and all CIB publications should be readily available to all.

The pilot program was to involve a number of centers which would demonstrate a variety of service patterns so that strengths and weaknesses of both the school and public library service to children, singly and cooperatively, could be assessed. These pilots were to be in operation for three years. At the end of this period, a report was to be submitted and recommendations made on demonstrated ways to meet all the library needs of all children, preschool through grade six. A request for funding was prepared. However, a \"zero increase\" budget necessitated the elimination of the funds for these pilots. But,  because of the broad interest in the subject and the real concern of the field, the Task Force recommended that the \"Guidelines\" be issued so that communities could be fully informed of the proposed nature of the pilot program and further planning stimulated. It is hoped that the dissemination of these \"Guidelines\" may stimulate cooperative planning for improvement of library service to children. (Author/NH)",

Since the disadvantaged tend to be non-users of library services, the library should develop aggressive, creative, and possibly unconventional programs to meet the unique needs of this group. The library should provide necessary information, vocational, and recreational materials which meet these needs and, thereby, help create a climate of optimum growth for the disadvantaged so that he is better able to close the gap of inequities separating him from the rest of  America. The program is evaluated in terms of the effect it has on the lives of those people served. Evaluations from staff reports provide useful guidelines for future planning.

A pre-post test evaluation design was used. The tests used were Draw-a-Man, The Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the TOBE tests of knowledge of concepts in the areas of language, mathematics, social studies, and science. Test data were analyzed by computation of means and standard deviations and t tests of the significance of differences and correlations. The study results showed that children made significant gains during the 5-month attendance at kindergarten and that  test performances at the end of school were significantly higher than those of the control group. There was a strong relationship between test scores and socioeconomic data. Differences between boys and girls were seldom significant.

The concept mainly focused upon was that of inequalities. Five experiments were run. These are: (1) acquisition of mathematical concepts under experimental situation and in traditional pedagogical situation, (2) cued vs. non-cued instructions in the learning of inequalities by three-year-olds, (3) \"more than\", \"less than\" and reversal learning, (4) correction vs. non-correction, and (5) effect of pre-training and cued reversal training. The stimuli for the experimental situation were made up of pairs of pictures of varying numbers of objects with from 1 to 3 or 2 to 6 objects in each picture. The experiments provide evidence that nursery school aged children  can learn simple mathematical concepts and learn them very rapidly. Children generally found the concept of \"more than\" more easily understood than the concept of \"less than\". Problems for further study concern the time to initiate pencil and paper activity, the time to initiate verbal activity, and the question of whether the concept of \"more than\" is learned as a number concept.

Methods used to study these problems are to define objectives in the affective domain and to develop instruments to measure the attainment of these objectives. It is pointed out that the interrelationship between what the child is able to do and how he feels about himself is being more clearly recognized, and the lines of separation between the developmental and cognitive learning approaches are beginning to blur. It also pointed out that the cultivation of a positive self concept and the acquisition of cognitive skills must proceed in tandem and that both are important prerequisites for success in school and for the development of a competent, independent and  contributing adult. There are two approaches to the assessment of behavior. The first method is observational, i.e., some scheme by which desired behaviors are categorized and rated by an external observer who is usually the classroom teacher or some other specially trained adult. The second technique relies on the subject's performance on specifically constructed tasks or test items. Finally, it is pointed out that there is a recognition of the need to find procedures for assessing change along both the emotional and cognitive dimensions so that the effectiveness of any preschool intervention can be more fully evaluated.

        "description":"A study of the speech process was conducted. The process is described as one closely linked to the one involved in the problem of the serial order in behavior. It is pointed out that in the speech of young children the grammatical relations that are properties of elementary underlying sentences appear in the grammatical meanings. Six examples of child speech patterns are given. By the end of the second year, children come to express grammatical relations through word combinations. A methodological assumption is made that the duration of speech can be taken to be a function of the duration of underlying schemata. The hypothesis is suggested that the basic encoding process in speech is one that produces underlying elementary sentences. It was found that there is clearly a  difference in the amount of time allotted to actual word combinations and to successive holophrastic utterances. A counter hypothesis is also suggested, i.e., that successive holophrastic utterances show variation in order and cover a longer span of time because they are not included within a single intonation contour. A different form of evidence that underlying sentence structure plays a central role in regulating the duration of speech is taken from the temporal organization of imitation. It is speculated that the brain processes for constructing underlying sentences have evolved in such a manner as to produce new foci of attention at this natural rate. In this sense speech can be said to be the bridge between conscious awareness and largely unconscious cognitive operations, such as  identification, classification, and storage. (CK)",

Chapter Two examines the functions of families and the social forces operating on families to change their structure. Chapter Three considers the need for child care: the concept of the need and the current practices of child care in Massachusetts. Chapter Four reviews the thought influencing programs for young  children and describes different kinds of care for infants, toddlers and preschoolers. Chapter Five examines the development of early childhood education in schools, reviewing the introduction of kindergartens as a requirement for all school districts. Chapter Six reviews the importance of the providers of care, discusses problems of selecting, training and certifying child care and early education workers, and recommends plans for training and registering child care staff. Chapter Seven considers problems involved in evaluating children, particularly those with special needs. Chapter Eight contains an analysis of the costs of child care, and Chapter Nine presents an analysis of the current role of Massachusetts state government concerning children's services.

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the impact which certain cognitive styles or structures have in mediating the influence of aggressive television on young boys. The subjects were 143 boys, ranging in age from 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 years, attending elementary school in the Santa Monica area. During the first of two sessions, each child was administered various tests. During the second session, the experimental subjects were exposed to one of two experimental conditions: an aggressive film or a nonagressive film. The control subjects saw no film. Following exposure to the film for the experimental subjects, an aggression measure was obtained in the guise of a guessing game played with a second experimenter (male) who acted as a confederate. Four major experimental hypotheses were  advanced: (1) For the 7-1/2 and 8-1/2 year olds, it was hypothesized that the more differentiated the level of cognitive functioning, the less would be the impact of the films; (2) For the 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 year olds, it was hypothesized that the more differentiated, organized, and articulated the level of cognitive functioning, the greater would be the impact of variations in the experimental film condition; (3) It was hypothesized that the level of cognitive functioning would be more differentiated, more elaborated, and articulated as a function of maturity; and (4) It was hypothesized that the level of aggression would be a function of the age of the child with the younger children being more aggressive than the older. Hypotheses 1, 3, and 4 were generally supported by the results of the  study. Hypothesis 2 was not supported. The findings of this study indicate that the effects of media depend not only on the nature of the content, but also upon the child's individual cognitive styles. (Author/CK)",

The instructional unit was based on the concept that all matter living and non-living, is composed of molecules which can undergo change. The unit was presented in two parts. In Part I, six 50-60 minute lessons were presented to an intact class over a two-week period. Comparisons between this experimental group and an uninstructed control class revealed that over the relatively short instructional period the experimental group did significantly better (p.01) on the subject  matter test than the control group. On the Banta Curiosity Box Test, both the pretested and non-pretested experimental children and the pretested control children scored significantly higher than the non-pretested control children. The results to the other individual measures developed to assess curiosity behavior were ambiguous, primarily due to problems with the measures themselves. Modification and extension of the instructional program and the evaluation instruments were undertaken in Part II. One month after the completion of Part I, the same experimental class was presented five 30-minute lessons in a seven-week period. Experimental children continued to perform better (p.005) than their control counterparts under the revised instructional program. Results of Parts I and II point up  the importance of the further development of instructional units designed to improve young children's scientific inquiry processes. (Author/CK)",

The longest looking time to a single stimulus recorded in this study was 1073 seconds, or over 17 minutes. Looking durations of over 2 minutes were very common. On several occasions,  durations of over 8 minutes were recorded. An analysis of the data was performed. The most important result of this study is the length of time an infant will spend looking at a stimulus in an experimental session. This suggests that it is possible to assess infant attentional patterns in chunks of long behavioral episodes. (CK)",

        "description":"A survey of assessment procedures of the newborn and of the infant during the first month of life was conducted; the survey indicated that there were instruments for evaluating the newborn and for evaluating the four-week-old infant, but there was no single procedure which included an evaluation of both the newborn and the four-week-old infant. This study is concerned with trying to understand individual differences in infant behavior which can be used to specify the dimensions and parameters of an effective environment for particular infants. Reported is work involving a sample of 60 infants, 30 males and 30 females, who were each tested at three or four days of age in the hospital and then retested four weeks later in the home. Interest is primarily in the stability of  performance over the four weeks and secondarily in the distribution of scores at both ages and in sex differences. Subjects include mainly white, upper lower, middle, and upper middle class infants, all of normal birth-weight with Agpar scores at five minutes well within the normal range. For the retest at approximately four weeks of age, the mean age for females was 27.87 days with a range of 24 to 33 days; for males, the mean was 27.79 days with a range of 24 to 34 days. After wheeling the infant into the examining room, his initial state was observed to two minutes. Then the pen light flashlight was flicked across the closed eyes and any response observed. Female scores were generally more stable than males over the four-week period. Males showed significant shifts, for items measuring  peak of excitement, alertness, following with head and eyes, reaction to sound, and pull to sit. Data tables and charts are provided. (CK)",

        "description":"Several sets of evidence are offered to support the hypothesis that cognitive and social development are intimately interrelated, and that mother-infant interaction influences both. A mother's prompt responsiveness to her baby's signals tends to foster the development of varied and clear modes of communication and thus the development of one facet of social competence. Sensitive maternal responsiveness to infant signals, especially when combined with giving a baby freedom to explore his physical environment facilitates overall development of competence as measured by a general intelligence quotient. The quality of mother-infant interaction affects both the quality of a baby's attachment relationship with his mother and at least one important specific aspect of cognitive  development, the development of the concept of the object. The concept of the balance between exploratory and attachment behavior is considered, and it is suggested that the significance of this is not so much quantitative as qualitative. That is, the significant individual differences lie not so much in the relative quantities of attachment and exploratory behavior as in the quality of each and the smoothness of transition from one to the other. Evidence is presented that the quality of mother-infant interaction influences the quality of the infant's attachment relationship to his mother, and that it also influences the level and quality of exploratory behavior and play.

        "description":"An instructional game is presented. The instructional goal of the game was to help the learner, one of the players, understand and use seven different prepositions with which, on the basis of a pretest, he was unfamiliar. The game was arranged so that instruction would occur simply as a result of communication to the learner from his partner who, acting as a tutor, already had the language skills to be taught. The tutor acted as the first player. The program was sequenced in terms of cards and in terms of the picture content. A criterion test was used and consisted of three parts. The first part asked the child to point to one of three pictures which showed particular spatial relationships. The second part of the test posed \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions. In the third part, the child  was asked to describe pictures. The central problem of this pilot study was to test the effectiveness of this procedure with four-year-old children. The experiment was carried out in two different Head Start Centers. At one school, all testing and game-playing was carried out in an adjacent classroom; at the other, a van was used. The average improvement for the experimental learners was 3.5. Those playing with partners as naive as themselves showed an average gain of only .75. The use of a game format as a vehicle for instruction was found to be valuable, but the necessary arrangements and programming required a good deal of effort and supervision. It is recommended that a more informal context for peer tutoring be sought. (CK)",

The general procedure employed was the descriptive and experimental analysis of the behavior of subjects in social interaction situations, as recorded on videotape. Types of dyads videotaped include mother-infant dyads in a caretaking-play setting, mature (adult) dyads in semistructured focused interaction, and preschool peer dyads in preacademic task settings. Results of the mother-infant study include: (1) Cry-fuss pauses of less than one second were considered socially nonfunctional; (2) A basic mother infant behavior code was established; and (3) Sampling statistics routines will be included to detect significant differences in the  average temporal locations of sequential dependencies between events. Nonverbal regulators in mature dyads were found to include manual illustrative and emphatic movements, facial affect displays, orientational and attentional movements of the head and body, and adjustments to tension. Videotapes of social behavior of preschool children performing preacademic tasks revealed that the performance of low income preschool children is affected by a combination of the familiarity and competence of peers present in the performance situation. With familiarity and performance controlled, family economic level appears not to have any notable implications for preschool performance. These studies indicate that as early as the preschool level, existing human resources in the peer group can be arranged  to provide more optimal conditions for testing ability and promoting learning in social or academic tasks.

The procedure used was a 3x2x2 (Treatment by Sex by School Location) fixed-effects factorial design to test the hypothesis that if second-grade children instructed with two methods of question presentation are compared with children receiving regular classroom instruction, then a significant difference in social studies achievement will result in favor of the experimental groups. The experimental groups were instructed for a six-week period. The instructional sequences were three weeks in length: one on the concept rules and  the other on concept location. Results of data analysis showed the following differences: (1) Children instructed with predominantly higher-level questions performed at significantly higher levels regardless of method of question presentation than did children receiving regular classroom instruction; (2) Children using non-reading materials for question presentation achieved significantly higher levels than did children using reading materials; (3) Children from the suburban school demonstrated higher achievement than children from the urban school. Conclusions include: (1) Oral presentation of instructional questions in social studies materials for second-grade children resulted in higher achievement levels on the part of the learners than did written presentation; (2) Social studies  achievement was not affected by the sex of the pupils; (3) No interactions occurred between the variables of sex and among the variables of treatment, sex, and school location.

Displays of deviant behavior--such as aggression, tantrums, and self-destruction--were followed by periods of isolation in a timeout room. A reversal design was employed such that return-to-baseline periods were instituted subsequent to each timeout period. The overall effect of timeout was to significantly reduce the rate of deviant behavior. On the average, 15 and 30 minutes produced 35% decrease in deviant behavior with little difference between the effectiveness of 15 and 30 minutes. The range of  effects in all timeout conditions varied widely. The sequence in which the 1 minute duration was presented effected the direction of its effect. When it preceded the use of longer durations, 1 minute was most effective. As it came later in the sequence, its suppressive characteristics became less reliable. (Author)",

In the final reinforcement period, these subjects were given control over dispensing reinforcers to themselves, based on their self-collected behavioral data while subjects in the other experimental group continued with the externally managed reinforcement. In  extinction, reinforcement was discontinued for all subjects, but one of the self-regulation subjects in each classroom continued to overtly self-observe. Results indicated that both reinforcement programs produced a considerable reduction in disruptive behavior. The self-regulation procedures were slightly more effective in reducing disruptiveness than was the external regulation procedure and this advantage persisted into extinction. These results suggest that self-regulation procedures provide a practical, inexpensive, and powerful alternative in dealing with disruptive behavior in children. (Author)",

Twenty three first and second grade school children were taught through external reinforcement procedures to raise their level of attention on a simple discrimination task. Subjects in one group were then taught to manage their own reinforcement contingencies and their performance was compared with that of a group continued on external reinforcement and a group for which reinforcement was discontinued. Results showed that groups receiving reinforcement performed at higher levels than the no reinforcement group. Self-reinforcement maintained discrimination behavior at as high a level as external reinforcement with no decrement  in discrimination accuracy. Some greater initial resistance to extinction was evidenced in the self-reinforcement group as compared to the other groups. No differences in generalization of attentive behavior were found.

The study questioned whether (a) preschool children acquire learning incidentally; (b) there was a difference in the quantity of such learning between black and white children; (c) differences in learning was influenced by socioeconomic status; and (d) differences were as evident for familiar as compared with unfamiliar stimulus materials. The experiment used a measure of incidental learning obtained by exposing subjects to a room containing selected items but giving them no instructions to attend to the objects. A comparison group was also placed in the same room but instructed to attend to the objects. The second dimension of familiarity was added by including items in the  room which were known to the children as well as objects likely to be unfamiliar. Following a fixed exposure of three minutes, each child was given a free recall and recognition test. The findings verify the presence of incidental learning in preschool children. Black youngsters did substantially better than their white counterparts on the recall of familiar objects. White preschool children did substantially better than their black counterparts on the recognition of unfamiliar objects in the incidental learning condition. (Author)",

Statistical procedures utilized were factor analysis, Hotelling's T2 statistic, Cochran's test for homogeneity of variance, Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance, Student's t test, Kendall rank correlation coefficient, analysis of variance, and Pearson  product-moment correlation. Although it was not possible to reject the null hypotheses of either equal means or variances, it was noted that the factor structure on the CUES was lower than those for the national sample, that Anglo Americans perceived the university environment as more scholarly than did the Mexican American students, that men scored higher on the awareness scale than did women, and that Mexican American students who report conflict between Mexican and American ways and who report no conflict between Mexican and American ways did not differ on the 4 dimensions of the CUES. Data results are shown in 21 tables, and 2 figures; the 3 appendixes include the data-gathering instruments, the factor structure for the 100-item CUES, and a questionnaire. (Author/MJB)",

Kindergarten and 1st-grade students were to be instructed in both English and Spanish, and the program was to be expanded one grade level each year. The program was set up to be a voluntary experiment for Mexican Americans, Anglo Americans, and Negroes. The method used in teaching the bilingual program to the kindergarten class were as follows: (1) naming and classifying objects in either English or Spanish, (2) identifying family members in either language, and (3) identifying and naming colors in either language. First-grade students were expected to respond to instructions given by teachers in both languages and to learn to write simple words in English and  Spanish. The kindergarten and 1st-grade bilingual program was evaluated using the following tests: (1) the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, (2) the Inter-American Series, Test of General Ability, and (3) the Stanford Early School Achievement Test. Videotape interviews and spot evaluations of students were also made. Because findings proved promising, the following recommendations were made: (1) the program should be continued and allowed to move into the 3rd year of the 5 year program, (2) the in-service Spanish course for school personnel should be continued, (3) more bilingual materials should be acquired, and (4) community involvement should be expanded.

An attempt to obtain an objective evaluation was made through the use of a battery of tests given to selected  students at the start and close of the speech therapy program. Subjective evaluations were collected by means of questionnaires. The returned questionnaires indicated that the respondents considered the project to be valuable.

The methodology employed isolates and gives equal treatment to 5 causal explanations. The 5 are genetic, culture of poverty, opportunity, maldistribution, and scarce resource explanations. Comprehensive materials are then organized around these explanations as they contribute to nonmetropolitan Southern poverty. It is concluded that nonmetropolitan poverty in the South is not monolithic in nature nor subject to explanation by a single causal thesis. State by state, locality by locality, the data reveal substantial differences in social and age structure, racial composition, employability potential, availability of resources, political climate, and the similarities among and between  groups of regional residents living in poverty. This study implies that if planning, program, and research efforts are to be aimed at resolving nonmetropolitan poverty in the South, the urban ghetto mentality of poverty theorists and planners must be brought to an end, that the view that poverty is the result of simultaneously interacting multiple factors must be challenged, and that the implementation of uniform program packages must be supplanted by programming, research, and evaluation uniquely tailored to the assessed characteristics of target localities.

ABRAZO's goals were (1) to study the self-concept of Mexican American children in grades K through 6 and (2) to implement and to evaluate several strategies hypothesized to contribute to the development of a positive self-image in Mexican American children, grades K through 6. Operational components were established in 4 elementary schools of the San Jose Unified School District in San Jose, California. These schools service approximately 1,500 students in neighborhoods with a  50% or more Mexican American population. The study sample was 90% Mexican American and Anglo (12 Blacks, 16 Orientals, 11 other were included). This 3-section final evaluation report includes (1) a summary and discussion of the extensive data base established by collecting data from teachers, parents, and students in areas of organizational climate attitudes, self-concept, and student achievement; (2) an evaluation of each of the 11 ABRAZO components; and (3) a discussion of findings and recommendations of the evaluation with a view toward providing a constructive critique of the project. Four appendixes containing data on teacher in-service, the \"Friend\" component, and a separate classroom observation study related to student self-concept are included. (Author/NQ)",

Student progress was evaluated through use of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the interpretation of tape-recorded interviews, a diagnostic test for sound problems, and the Goodenough \"Draw-a-man\" Test. The report concludes that bilingual education does show a substantial and  significant advantage over ordinary education for bilingual pupils. Careful testing of the bilingual pupils in the future should show the rate at which transfer of knowledge to the second language occurs. Another suggestion is that since normal monolingual children would be, in comparison to the bilingual students, at a disadvantage, it might be appropriate to initiate programs to make the entire educational system at least bilingual.

The program's objectives were (1) to determine the present level of services available to off-reservation Indians in Maine, (2) to determine present housing standards, educational levels, health programs, and geographic areas of population concentration, and (3) to create maximum public awareness of and involvement in the recommended solutions. In gathering information, a structural questionnaire with both closed and open questions, which allowed for both statistical and opinionated data, was used to evaluate the plight of the off-reservation Indian. Sources of error in the work program stemmed from poor communication--many of the Indians spoke French  or an Indian language and only partially understood English, many misunderstood the questions asked them, and the interviewers had some difficulty in conveying the reason for their visit. Two plans were recommended: Plan I calls for the creation of the position of &quot;Co-ordinator&quot; to off-reservation Indians within the State of Maine Department of Indian Affairs, thus creating a central headquarters to work in behalf of the off-reservation Indians; Plan II calls for the creation of 2 positions of &quot;Co-ordinator,&quot; and their respective jobs and qualifications are listed.

The 4 major components of the program, which included 5 kindergarten and 5 1st-grade sections located at 5 elementary schools, were instruction, staff development, materials development, and community involvement. In evaluating the program, a random sample selected from students from the total program was used. English language activities, the language used by the children in unsupervised situations, and the Test of Basic Experiences administered in both English and Spanish were used to measure  language growth.

Examined in various stages of mechanization were 3 specific areas where potatoes, snap beans, and apples are grown (Onieda, Steuben, and Clinton counties). Then, a state-wide study of agents and agencies providing alternatives to unemployment and welfare for displaced migrant workers was made. One bean broker, 14 growers, 10 crew leaders, 45 crew members, 5 officials--each representing an agency specializing in job placement and/or retraining opportunities for migrants, 6 dairymen, and 6 presently working  former migrants were interviewed. Questionnaires were returned by 64 members of 3 state agencies, 46 Cooperative Extension Agents, 42 growers and businesses, and 2 presently working former migrants. The interviews and questionnaires provided the data for this study. Descriptive statistics led to the following conclusions: (1) migrant workers have been and will continue to be displaced by machines; (2) mechanization may have very positive effects on the migrant worker, forcing him into more steady, often more skilled, positions which offer better wages and the chance for a more stable family and social life; (3) displaced migrant workers prefer to continue in agriculture; (4) there are openings in full-time agricultural positions; (5) former migrant workers have found satisfying full-time  jobs; and (6) former migrants have received needed on-the-job training. Included are 4 recommendations, 4 interview guides, and 4 questionnaires. (MJB)",

The program included the use of in-service activities, parental involvement activities, educational materials, evaluation design, and teacher-child behavior measures. All components of the program were evaluated, with students' cognitive development tested in the areas of English reading, math, and language and in Spanish reading and language. Students' affective development was tested in the areas of  attitude towards the Mexican and Anglo cultures, towards school, and for self concept. Test results showed that bilingual classes significantly excelled comparison classes in the area of oral language comprehension in both English and Spanish. Recommendations included a change toward more criterion-referenced testing. (Author/PS)",

The median family income in 1970 for all families of Spanish origin was lower than the median income for all white families but higher than that for black families. Unemployment rates were higher for persons of Spanish origin  than the national average and about the same as the rate for men of Negro and other races. Among persons 25 to 29 years old, 48% of persons of Spanish origin had graduated from high school compared to 58% of Negroes and 80% of all whites.

The data, collected through personal interviews with 69 migrant workers and their 29 employers, indicated that migrant interviewees did not consider themselves to be in poverty and were reasonably well satisfied with the earnings, housing, fringe benefits, working  conditions, and government services available to them in Ohio. Also, while migrant children have received considerably more education than their parents, more than 50% of those in school were more than 1 year behind their grade level. In interviews, growers admitted that if wage rates increase significantly above current levels, there will likely be increased mechanical harvesting and a considerable decrease in migrant employment.

The objective is to establish a broad base of sound principles and philosophy of education for young Indian children with some ideas, experiences, materials, and resources for implementation, from which each school can select appropriate directions, relevant to the particular child, his family and community. The purpose of the guide is to serve as a reference to schools developing their own curriculum. The guide suggests that the teaching method to be employed should stress learning through play and through identification with the teacher rather than through instruction. The 5 areas  discussed include (1) early childhood education, such as the articulation of early childhood experiences; (2) creating an environment for learning, such as the planning of use of kindergarten space, the arrangement of equipment and supplies, both indoors and outdoors; (3) curriculum experiences, such as language and concept development, the development of social science, mathematical, and natural and physical science concepts; and experience with music and art materials; (4) supporting services, such as parent involvement in the kindergarten program and bilingual, social service, and health programs; and (5) bibliographical materials, such as books, pamphlets, and films.

The hypotheses tested were (1) that nonmetropolitan Black boys have more positive orientations towards military service than metropolitan Blacks and (2) that lower-class metropolitan boys with high occupational aspirations have more positive orientations than other metropolitan youth. The hypotheses were evaluated using data from Black high school sophomores. The specific orientations examined are desire to enter the military, anticipation of military service, certainty of this expectation, and general  attitude towards participating in the military. The findings indicated that all of the nonmetropolitan and metropolitan boys were favorably inclined towards military service, and lower-class Black yough with high aspirations were not more favorably inclined toward participation in the military than other Black youth.

Attendees endeavored to assess the existing knowledge with respect to these problems, to point out major gaps in this body of knowledge, and to suggest types of research needed to cope with the problems of rural poverty. It was determined that many values and beliefs held by poverty-stricken people impede the introduction of changes which can eliminate poverty in rural areas. Additional research is needed on the returns and costs of improving the quality of education, the relationships of size and location of areas to developmental potentialities, and the arrangement of alternatives in an ordering of priorities that will be useful to public decision-makers. It was further  concluded that additional research is needed on the social costs and returns of transferring people from low-income areas. (HBC)",

This report discusses migrant seasonal labor with regard to (1) the wages and earnings of the workers, (2) the recruitment of workers, (3) the agricultural-labor housing, (4) the employment statistics and operations, (5) the major crops which employed a large number of workers, and (6) the mechanical and technological developments in agricultural labor, Wages and earnings for 14,461 seasonal workers (22.6% of the total seasonal workers employed in cultivation and harvest activities during the 1971 season) are compared with those since 1965. Mechanical and technological developments have affected employment of  seasonal workers. Some of the developments discussed in this report are a new harvester used in apple harvesting, a new heating system used in grape cultivation, a new approach to peach pruning, a method of total tree harvest, zero tillage, research done with asparagras, sugar beets, and beans, and year-round bean export. This report includes a discussion on the administration of the Rural Manpower Service and the services it provides, such as job training, recruiting seasonal workers, and providing public and human relations. Some highlights of the 1971 season, such as further research being accomplished with tomato caging, finding suitable land for planting mustard seeds, the growth of the sugar beet industry, a new plant for growing and processing mushrooms, and the decline of the  strawberry acreage, are also discussed.

The study's objectives were to determine to what extent the metropolitan Black women differed from the two types of nonmetropolitan Black women in reference to the perception of racial prejudice directed towards Blacks by local Whites, the desire for racial integration, and the perception of the possibility for racial integration in the local area. A second objective was to determine whether or  not the interrelations of these variables differed by place of residence type. It was concluded that place of residence does influence racial orientations of Blacks in the South, that a great deal of intragroup variation existed in degree of prejudice perceived regardless of residence type, and that town residents perceived a higher degree of racial prejudice directed toward them by local Whites than did the other two resident groups. The recommendations for further research included the factors underlying the dramatic variability in degree of prejudice preceived, the desirability of integration, and the perceived possibility of its occurrence.

        "description":"The paper first proposes a general model for the study of acculturation in the Chicano community and then presents developing trends which are viewed as important to understanding la raza. In generating a theory of acculturation a (+) or (-) value was assigned to each link (for example, lower, middle, or upper class family background) of the model. From the model, 5 possible types of acculturating individuals can be conceptualized-- the acculturated individual with no disadvantaged background, from the middle or upper class; the principal structural acculturator, who overcame a disadvantaged background mostly through education or through high motivation and hard work; the intervening acculturator, who is a member of the subordinate community and who has been acculturated through  intervening media sources and is aware of a better tomorrow; the deviant acculturator, who is acculturated but shows no signs of positive influences; and the unacculturated individual, who is unacquainted with the superordinate culture--a person who is either a recent immigrant or who has led an isolated rural experience. Trends in understanding la raza include a cultural explanation of what many Anglos believe of Chicanos, a criticism of the focus upon acculturation which attacks the &quot;melting pot&quot; theory because many groups cannot assimilate, and Chicano nationalism--a developing trend in which there is a conscious attempt to restore the self image of Chicanos in the Southwest. While degrees of acculturation have occurred, assimilation has been a rare thing. If there is truly to be a  defense of integration, there must first be a change in the inequities of the system.

The handbook encourages continuous progress and a nongraded organization and emphasizes individual instruction. Chapter 1 provides a comprehensive history of migrant education in Kansas and nationally, including the geographical location of migrant programs in Kansas in 1970. Discussed in the second chapter is the administration and organization of migrant education, including public relations (parental involvement), primary education, intermediate grades, program directors, contact personnel,  teachers, teacher aides, teacher specialists, librarians, school nurses, school food personnel, school custodians, school bus drivers, and school secretaries. Facets of the curriculum discussed in chapter 3 are art, field trips and realia, health and safety, language arts, mathematics, music, physical education, science, and social studies. In chapter 4, the conclusion, a letter to the State Consultant on Migrant Education describes the children's reactions to the library program at Sharon Springs, Kansas. Books for teachers' use, books for children's use, periodicals, posters and kits, and films and filmstrips are included in the bibliography. (HBC)",

        "description":"Ten individual reports from the 1971 summer migrant educational programs in Kansas are summarized and evaluated. The goals of these programs were to (1) help children develop oral language and expression; (2) provide arts and crafts for personal expression; (3) provide swimming and other types of recreation for physical development and coordination, along with helping the children play and share with others; and (4) provide health classes as a means of teaching personal hygiene and cleanliness. Shown are the geographical location of migrant programs and tables indicating the number of participants by grade level and school term, the number of participating children according to age, and the approximate length of time students participated. The program data for the regular school  term and summer school programs, the program length, the number of children served, the children's origins, and the home base of the migratory children attending the various centers in Kansas are included. Some subjective estimates of the value of the program indicated that the children were attentive and listened with increased interest; improved their language skills, vocabulary, comprehension and speech; and developed a respect for their heritage. It is suggested that if Kansas summer migrant schools are continued, a migrant school course of study should be provided, preservice training should be increased, and a team of Mexican American supervisor-consultants should be obtained to provide direct in-service training.

Data was collected by means of a network of 35 permanent teacher correspondents, as well as 2 field stations which were operated for 3 years in 2 investigated villages. The areas for which information was provided included attendance of rural youth in various types of schools; dropouts in the rural areas; the level of pupil's knowledge and ability; and schooling retardation and its effects on unequal educational opportunity. Selected conclusions only were presented in this report since reports of the research as a whole are to be published in book form. Trends indicated by the research include the  need to (1) strengthen rural schools by eliminating their present dispersion and by opening new, more centralized networks based on bussing, (2) strengthen the rural teaching personnel by raising qualifications and specialization, (3) introduce gradually universal secondary education in city and country, (4) improve the system of student selection, and (5) modernize teaching methods.

The general goal of the study was to gather information that would enhance understanding of the educational problems and needs of migrant families and to give direction to efforts to meet these needs and help solve the problems. The results indicated that (1) 30% of the males were unemployed; (2) 93% wanted to work outside of agriculture; (3) 93% wanted vocatinal aptitude testing; (4) 61% wanted to take vocational courses; (5) great  interest was shown in the skilled trades, clerical, and health occupations; (6) 46% had completed 7 or fewer years of schooling; (7) 55% were deficient in the use of English; (8) the greatest obstacle to taking courses was lack of knowledge about what was available and not knowing where to find out; and (9) most could take courses October through April. The study revealed a need for expansion and improvement in vocational education and especially guidance, adult basic education at both elementary and secondary levels, including English as a second language, and emphatic need for better communication between the schools and these people, especially about educational offerings and better articulation and cooperation among the schools and other agencies.

The study was conducted in 3 adjacent coastal communities in southern California. It used 3 groups of children (30 in each group) who differed in certain identifiable aspeces of language-cultural background but who were alike in nonlanguage intelligence, chronological age, grade (7th & 8th), sex, and socioeconomic status. The 3 groups consisted of (1) Mexican American children speaking both English and Spanish upon entering kindergarten (E-S), (2) Anglo American children speaking only English upon entering kindergarten (A-E), and (3) Mexican American children who had never spoken any language but English but whose parents communicate in English and Spanish  (M-E). All were compared in all areas except articulation by an analysis of covariance with nonlanguage IQ as the covariate. Differences in number of articulatory errors, among groups, were tested by means of the chi-square, the Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Signed Ranks Test, and the Duncan test, which was also used to determine which group differed from others. There were significant differences among the groups in silent reading comprehension, mechanics of English, general language development, oral reading accuracy and comprehension, articulation, and inflection. Analysis indicated that in each of these areas there were no significant differences between the A-E and M-E groups, but that both of these groups excelled the E-S group. There were no significant differences among groups in silent  reading vocabulary, total silent reading, spelling, or phonemic discrimination. Included are 81 tables of data. (NQ)",

        "description":"The regional approach as an alternative for meeting the needs of rural youth is discussed in comparison to the small school district which cannot possibly serve the broad spectrum of student needs in rural areas. The rural educational setting and its shortcomings are described as the lack of facilities, a lack of an obvious connection between education and the ability to earn a livelihood, the inability on the part of pupils or parents to see a relationship between the school curriculum and their community life, and the students' inadequate knowledge of job requirements for particular professions, which hinders them in preparing for a certain vocation. Both the regional approach and the\"shared-service concept\" are discussed. The advantages of these approaches are that (1) an  intermediate unit allows cooperation between small districts, (2) the combination of rural schools' operations results in a more efficient and economical operation, (3) the incompetents can be weeded out of the profession through closer supervision and better evaluations, (4) the composite knowledge and cooperative utilization of resource personnel can be increased area wide, (5) through textbook exchange programs, the one book/one student concept can be abandoned, (6) by consolidation of duplicatory functions and data-processing equipment, the number of personnel required in a supportive role can actually be reduced. Several project reports (i.e., the Appalachian Regional Commission Annual Report of 1968, the 8-state Rocky mountain area project, the National Outlook Conference on Rural  Youth, and the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory report of 1969) are cited.

The four categories used for pupil response are the abilities to recall standard procedures, to apply them, to choose the correct process, and to devise original methods. This system is illustrated by a test consisting of 20 items covering these four categories in each of five topic areas taken from Form 3 mathematics (approximately grade nine). Lastly, the report describes the standardization of this test,  including the preliminary trial, the choice of a representative student sample, the administration of the test, and the item analysis of the results.

        "description":"This study was designed to investigate the effects of discovery and expository methods of presentation on the immediate acquisition and retention of geometry concepts by seventh graders. Four geometry concepts, \"quadrilateral,\"\"rhombus,\"\"trapezoid,\" and \"parallelogram,\" were presented in written lessons which used either an expository or a discovery approach. Ss studied the lessons on four consecutive days. They were given a test on the concepts either immediately after completion of the lessons or one day or 21 days after completion of the lessons. Ss who received the test one day after completion were retested 21 days after completion. The findings of the study were as follows: (1) Ss who studied the expository lessons had significantly higher scores than Ss who studied the  discovery lessons; (2) An independent groups analysis revealed no significant difference between treatment groups. However, a repeated measures analysis revealed that Ss in the discovery group tended to forget less than Ss in the expository group over the 21-day retention interval; and (3) The expository group spent only one-third as much time on the lessons, yet had immediate acquisition superior to the discovery group and 21-day retention equal to the discovery group.

This report deals with the ways in which PIA affects teachers: in basic mathematical knowledge, knowledge of PIA-specific content, and attitudes toward teaching arithmetic. Findings indicate that PIA can be used effectively as in-service education, particularly for those teachers with relatively lower initial knowledge of the basic mathematics which underlies a contemporary elementary school mathematics program. PIA does not seem to change teachers' attitudes, however; nor is it beneficial in increasing knowledge of concepts  not specifically related to PIA. These results seem to hold equally for both rural and urban schools. (Author/JM)",

The goals of the research program are to provide: (1) new knowledge about the interrelation of process, learning variables, and individual differences which will have implications for cognitive theory, and (2) new information concerning conditions of cognitive learning which can be applied to the development of sound instructional materials and procedures. A research model or framework which specifies the variables and processes of interest was developed. The present paper has not resulted in the establishment of a new research activity within Program 1 of the Center.

The design process gives systematic direction to the designers of the workshop, helping them shape general goals into specific objectives and to select activities based upon sound principles of learning and group interaction. Content encompasses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes the workshop  seeks to develop, as well as the issues that come up during the workshop and the procedures involved in implementing the design with real-life people. Outcomes vary according to the design variables, process, and content. Crucial to the outcome are continuing dialogue and follow-up to ensure ongoing commitment to environmental education.

A multiple regression analysis was used to establish an equation to determine the lower limit of the prediction interval, to determine whether I.Q. or mathematics placement score has more influence on the student's grade, and to determine how much of the variance in grade can be explained by the I.Q. and mathematics placement score. It was concluded that the diagnostic exam was more significant for predicting purposes than the I.Q. score. Linear models were statistically significant as were the individual variables of diagnostic exam and I.Q. score. The explained variance suggested that there was  considerable room for improvement in the prediction model. (Author/JM)",

Information on three areas--the level of knowledge of the American about the metric system, problems which would be encountered with a national policy of metrication, and methods of public education on the metric system--was obtained from a study by the Survey Research Center (SRC) and papers from experts on consumer concern. About 1,400 family units, representing a cross section of the country, were interviewed by the SRC. Attitudes and knowledge levels were given index values based on answers to several questions. Findings indicate widespread satisfaction with the present system and  opposition to conversion. It is also suggested that resistance is due primarily to ignorance about the metric system, since the vast majority of those well-informed strongly favored its adoption. Television was the most popular means of public education. Experts agreed that the advantages outweighed the costs and problems of the conversion and felt the major disadvantage was the psychological one of adjustment.

Conventional factor analyses were performed, separately for boys and girls, for concept scores and for task scores. Three-mode factor analyses were performed. The main conclusions drawn from the results of the conventional factor analyses are that all 30 of the concepts are measures of a single functional relationship existing among the concepts, and that all 12 tasks are measures of a single underlying ability or latent trait. The three-mode results indicate that there are no important concept-task interactions for the idealized persons, thus it is reasonable to regard  the concepts and the tasks as being two independent modes.

Ten percent of those responding reported that they were presently teaching; an additional 41 percent expressed definite interest in teaching; and yet another 8 percent admitted a possible future interest. More significant is the statement by a large group that they might have been interested in teaching had the opportunity been offered before retirement. One distinct handicap to taking advantage of this interest in teaching was that only 8.3 percent of those interested had ever had a high school teaching certificate. Another handicap was the relative  immobility of the group--their desire to teach near their present location. This study has been limited mainly to measuring the potential available.

All other instructional procedures were constant for both groups. No significant differences resulted from the employment of either method in the laboratory activities in the Introductory Physical Science (IPS) course, when judged in terms of student progress as reflected in test scores related to: (1) critical thinking skills, (2) understanding of science, (3) academic achievement of knowledge and concepts presented in IPS, and (4) development and expression  of interest in science. The manipulative method was significantly superior to the nonmanipulative method for the development of selected laboratory skills. Academic achievement and performance of the students in the nonmanipulative group did not support the view expressed by the teachers that the manipulatory method of laboratory instruction is necessary for motivation and satisfactory learning of science as defined by the IPS course. The IPS course did not appear to stimulate student interest in science after one semester of instruction. (Author/CP)",

The experimental group included 97 subjects enrolled in three classes studying second-year biology and one class studying tenth-grade social studies; the control group included 108 students enrolled in five classes studying second-year biology. Three subscores (biological concepts, nature of the scientific enterprise and the work of scientists, and social implications of the concepts) and a total score were obtained from the 90-item multiple-choice test administered to experimental and control classes as both a pretest and a posttest. Significant achievement gain on the  three subscores and the total score was found for all classes in the experimental group. The control group showed no significant gains. In responding to a student questionnaire, a majority of the students (73 percent) expressed a positive opinion about the interest potential of the reading material, and a majority (57 percent) also indicated that the reading material was less difficult than that ordinarily experienced in biology classes. It was concluded that the performance of the experimental classes met the criteria under which the socio-historical approach was to be judged acceptable. (Author/CP)",

The \"new look\" assumes three tasks: 1) to determine whether current texts show improvements; 2) to go beyond minimum type evaluative criteria in the AEA report and develop a standardized economics textbook evaluation procedure; and, 3) to identify innovative developments in acceptable texts. An introductory section of the report discusses the AEA report. A second section views the 12 texts selected for the present analysis on the basis of criteria and evidence comparable to the AEA Report. Individual texts are not identified. The third section considers the rationale for some extended criteria and a standardized evaluation procedure. An exploratory classification and sample set of  extended criteria are presented in Section IV. These criteria are then utilized to classify the innovative developments identified in five selected second-generation texts. Some of the concluding observations: 1) high school economics texts as a group have been substantially upgraded; 2) the quality of acceptable texts now runs strongly ahead of the typical teacher's preparation in economics; and, 3) all the acceptable texts shared the common virtue (and implied defect) of being appropriate for the above average, academic strata of students.

First, in its broadest sense international understanding might be taken to mean an understanding of the world system. Second, it is useful to view the schools as being able to make three primary contributions to students' understanding of this world system--an understanding of: the earth as a planet; mankind as a species of life; and the global social system as one level of human social organization. Third, a summary is offered of what there is about the planet, species, and international social system that educators and social scientists feel should be emphasized. The concept of international understanding also points toward certain qualities, characteristics, or  capacities to be developed in individuals (referred to as \"dimensions\" of international understanding). In the second portion of the essay, the author attempts to deal with the question of what distinguishes the internationally competent citizen. After suggesting that individuals occupy six major kinds of roles in relation to the world system, an attempt is made to specify for each role the major characteristics that distinguish the internationally competent citizen. Finally, a summary of the essay is presented in the form of a typology, which sets forth major contributions that the K-12 curriculum should seek to make to students' international understanding.

Examining the past in this way reveals an analogy between the function and structure on the biological level and on the social level, illustrating basic factors and processes of development such as unification which are common and interrelated. A sequential process of unification of living cells from one-celled protozoa to the trillion-celled organisms of  man is compared with the unification of men into larger social groups, developing from the original family unit towards an international world unit. Unification makes possible another structure element -- specialization -- occurring in both the biological and human stages of development and causing increases in efficiency, interdependence, cooperation, and transportation, first between cells, then between men, and now between nations.

Purposes for social education are suggested and their implications in terms of curriculum and instruction explored. The importance of this effort lies in a \"need to know where we may be going in order to understand where we are.\" An axiom, normative assumptions, and derived implications are presented and discussed which the author considers to be a baseline conception of social education. The axiom is that \"students are social actors engaged in purposive decision-making who process information in acquiring and acting upon normative and empirical beliefs about social phenomena.\" Normative assumptions are that social education should increase the ability of students to: 1) make socially effective  choices; 2) assess systematically alternative social futures; and 3) to be continuous social learners. This approach to social education has been justified on the basis of explicitly stated values. This theory is open-ended in that others may wish to add, delete, or alter assumptions, and in that it may apply to learning situations not specified or anticipated. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"These guidelines were designed to be used in a training program for thirty secondary teachers who planned to implement \"The Man Made World\" course in their classrooms in the fall of 1970. Emphasis is upon a multi-disciplinary team-teaching approach to help students cope in the real world. Seven chapters are included. Chapter one, the rationale of the course, focuses on the need for today's students to understand the interaction of technological development and social change. Chapter two, objectives and evaluation, suggests teaching techniques, including games, that involve students in relevant learning and in approaches to evaluating the goals and objectives which are established by individual teams. The course encourages student-teacher interaction dynamics which are discussed  in chapter three. Hints to administrators and team members are given in chapter four. Chapter five, teacher preparation, emphasizes teacher training and characteristics which are helpful in teaching the course. Laboratory use and equipment is discussed in chapter six. A resource guide presented in chapter seven contains multi-media references to provide insight into the various areas that are an integral part of the course. An appendix includes multi-disciplinary learning activities. Related documents are: ED 016 634; ED 016 635; and ED 019 243. (SJM)",

        "description":"In this essay, the author presents a rationale (and opportunities) for anthropologists to study the middle and upper end of the social power structure, as well as the lower. Anthropologists have much to contribute to an understanding of the processes whereby power and responsibility are exercised in this country; indeed there is a certain urgency to this kind of anthropology. Among students at Berkeley, there is a tremendously energizing phenomenon in studying major institutions and organizations that affect everyday lives, such as the California Insurance Commission and the Better Business Bureau. (Reports of these studies are discussed and the value of this kind of research for citizenship education is pointed out.) \"Studying up\" as well as down would lead us to ask many\"common sense\" questions in reverse; and the consequences of not studying up as well as down are serious in terms of developing adequate theory and description. If one's pivot point is around those who have power/responsibility, then the questions change. It is particularly appropriate that anthropologists should lead the way in this work by virture of several characteristics of our discipline. There are those who would oppose such a reorientation of anthropology, and their reasons are discussed here. (Author/JLB)",

        "author":["Scott, John Anthony"],
        "description":"History instruction at the secondary level is not sufficiently relevant to the needs of students today. The traditional concept and function of most textbook oriented teaching is one of indoctrination, Americanization, and an attempt at preserving the economic, social, and political status quo. There is a need to educate students to intelligently confront and solve social problems. Although social scientists have developed new innovative courses, schools, and projects, they have not developed a strategy for bringing about needed changes in history. The history profession has contributions to make in the formation of an alternative strategy. Suggested points of strategy which need to be debated are: 1) The role of the school is to prepare students for activism toward attacking  social problems and to help them view social change as a catalyst of world survival. 2) In this context, historians can attack and demolish racist myths and teach the origin and nature of war as a human institution over which social control is possible. 3) Historians can also develop the significance of regional and local themes with special reference to the educational needs of different ethnic groups.

        "description":"This paper discusses and explains how one college revitalized its history program, first, by reorienting its history curriculum toward a global perspective, and secondly, by implementing an inquiry approach. Three questions answered by the faculty provide a framework for a brief explanation of the changes necessitated by the introduction of global history. 1) The type of historical knowledge required for the students of the 1970's is information about human development in all parts of the world. In order to teach from a global perspective, the faculty abolished traditional survey courses and replaced them with a comparative civilization course, and required history majors to include course work in at least two geographic areas other than the United States and Europe. 2) A \"vital\"  history curriculum that permits change whenever necessary can be maintained through a catalog system listing courses by region and topic to encourage imaginative and experimental course offerings. 3) A small faculty can offer a global-oriented curriculum using team teaching and retraining of faculty. The inquiry approach to global issues encourages students to select broad questions at the beginning of their study, gather, classify, and evaluate historical data, and solve problems. (SJM)",

These generalizations provide the framework for the development of major cultural understandings. 2) Specific instructional objectives, defined in behavioral terms, are suggested and identified as  expected student learnings. These objectives are keyed to skills which are extended in foreign studies. 3) Ninety lesson plans are given, each including a statement of teacher objectives, several teaching techniques, a content outline, comments, and a citation of instructional materials. 4) A bibliography of student and teacher materials is provided.

Pre-teaching tasks involve: 1) planning activities that increase the scope and body of social science content and methods and increase pupil performance in cognitive and affective skills; and, 2) planning activity sequence, transitions, evaluations, and multimedia resources. Elements of the teaching-learning process are: questioning, discussion, use of resources, teacher-pupil  planning, cueing, and reinforcing. These are presented in two sections, one focusing on the teaching process, the other on the learning process.

If social studies is not simply an offshoot of social sciences, but, rather a required general education program concerned with the preparation of citizens for reflective participation in a democratic society and with educational relevance, the curriculum can properly focus on public issues. Such a curriculum needs to be based on a realistic view of societal values and their relation to public controversy. The school can become a socializing force in American society depending upon how the society's basic values are handled in the classroom. Cohesiveness in society is dependent upon the sharing of a common frame of values. First, children need to be  involved emotionally in commitment to basic American values, then helped to develop a rational basis for their values by giving additional meaning to the already existing values through considering consequences of value commitment, contradiction among values, and conflict and the pluralistic nature of society. This curriculum can be taught effectively within a school only if discrepancies between avowed values and the actual state of society are recognized and exposed, and only if pluralistic and political commitment, interchange, and involvement with society are modeled.

Through actions and selection of topics and materials, however, a teacher suggests that he believes in certain ideas and events and, therefore, teaches values. The key issue here is not whether values should be taught, but rather, the justification of certain values over others to be taught and the decision on how to teach them. Values, defined as concepts in the minds of men which are reflected in specific value claims made by individuals, represent the quality of worth or merit which men place on various aspects of their experience and by which they judge that experience. Students need to understand the difference between personal, market, and real value  claims, and how to know that the latter assert that a given thing is better than other conceivable and available alternatives according to a particular set of criteria. Moral value claims represent a particular kind of real value claim. Students can be taught the meaning of justice and its potential usefulness as a universally applicable principle, and need to empathize with the feelings of others. Value education includes both cognitive and affective components. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"Important global attitudes in the United States and other countries are measured and social attitudes interpreted according to a number of variables in this cross-cultural study. The term Worldmindedness (the quality which is measured in the study) refers to a world-view of problems of humanity rather than a national view of them. Two testing instruments measured the attitudes, the primary instrument a 32 item Worldmindedness Scale consisting of half pro-worldminded and half anti-worldminded items (in addition, eight dimensions of worldmindedness were identified constituting sub-scales within a scale), and the secondary instrument a checklist type of questionnaire on socio-economic background. Analysis performed on thre samples of secondary students with differing socio-economic  backgrounds, ages 16 through 18, in Italian, German, and American schools, indicates that the Worldmindedness Scale has notably high reliability and validity for its kind of instrument and is applicable to cross-cultural studies. It was concluded that a basic similarity in attitudes exists among the three national groups and that adolescents in these countries appear to share a common, value-oriented worldminded view. (SJM)",

Eleven thousand pupils from 373 classrooms in 110 schools throughout Oklahoma participated in the study. Variables examined were: practicality, community, awareness, propriety, and scholarship. The instrument utilized to measure pupils' perceptions was the Elementary School Environment Survey (ESES). The most significant findings were: 1) Schools in middle/high socioeconomic class settings (non Title I) have a significantly more scholarly environment; 2) Rural school students perceive the environment as more polite and  considerate than do students attending urban schools; 3) Self-contained classrooms differ significantly in the educational environment dimension of practicality; and, 4) Educational environments do not differ significantly according to sex of principal, age variance of faculty, or enrollment size. Since there were only three significant differences found out of a possible 35, it may be that the wrong variables were used to identify the real differences between schools that professional educators intuitively know exist.

Asian Studies Inquiry Program uses a multidisciplinary approach to examine Asian thought and the historical and changing patterns of Asian life. Having both excellent materials and sources, the author feels that this is the best \"total program\" available. A Look Across Cultures: China, and A Look Across Cultures: Japan, are thematic, discipline oriented, and traditional, providing inadequate treatment of concepts and  analytical questions. With adequate conceptual preparation and rearrangement of and supplement to the readings, the projects have merit. Kansas Extra-Mural Project focuses on the treatment of major philosophical strands of thought. The project is excellent for those concerned with the thinking process. (Author/SJM)",

It is important that children understand at an early age the concepts that people are in many ways different, the same, and individually unique; that ethnic groups offer both cultural diversity and conformity; and that each group has an evolving identity. The concept of empathy towards others is conveyed on an individual and group basis. Intergroup relations is another important concept, inasmuch as the building of positive relations among individuals and groups is a constant challenge. The concept of racism is introduced in the  hope that children will understand the legacy and manifestations of racism helping them to deal with racial problems. Knowing yourself, the last concept, is a principle that is applicable to an individual and to groups and is a life time goal. (SJM)",

        "description":"Where is an appropriate point of departure for instructional planning in the social studies? I advocate an approach based on the transaction between a student and his significant world. The Transactional Unit is that segment of the interactive phase of teaching which focusses on the transaction between the student and the display. In this context, the student can be seen as being engaged in the process of becoming, viewed here as a transactional affair. Becoming is entailed in the structuring of perceptual, preferential, and manipulative acts which elaborate/transform the ongoing relationship between student and action world. Steady-state change, morphogenic change, and their sub-concepts are some of the salient concepts embedded in our notion of transaction, and provide us with  a shape of the potentiality of the concept of change as a focal point in the social studies. In a social studies program based on transaction, it is crucial that the student make as part of the program the nurturing of his control in the structuring of his perceptual, appraisive, and manipulative acts guided by designative, appraisive, and prescriptive questions to effect the desired change. The transactional approach to social education calls for students' participatory commitment to the processes of change. Thus a social studies curriculum focussing on controlled change calls for the totality of our students' transactional experience. (Author/JLB)",

Both the experimental class, taught by the simulation-game method, and the control group, taught by the lecture discussion method, were instructed by the same teacher for a period of ten days. Pre- and post-experiment content examinations and attitude surveys were given to the two groups to determine comparative effects. Providing no statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that simulation-games enhance the ability of the student to acquire more factual and conceptual knowledge, this study does indicate that games can influence students' attitudes and values in a given  direction. These findings also indicate a need for further investigation of such elements as measurement of retention, relevance, and transfer factors, and effects of the two teaching methods of different achievement levels.

This number describes efforts at Bell Junior High School in Golden, Colorado to create a democratic environment. In the initial process of establishing goals, Project Director George Carnie talked with students and teachers about opportunities and changes needed. Teachers designed specific activities to allow students to achieve these common objectives. In the process, the principal's power was redistributed to actively involve staff, students, and community in daily operating procedures, staff policies, etc. The redistribution began by listing all school tasks and making them available to  the willing and qualified. A process of growth and renewal is the basis for Bell's plan. Four processes form this growth plan: problem solving, school decision-making, open communication, and personal accountability. These four same processes are topics for an inservice program arranged with a nearby university. Individual differences in the need for structure are taken into account, meaning that neither traditional nor innovative teachers are forced into a particular teaching style. A process of continual evaluation, both objective and subjective, provides important feedback on the entire effort. (JLB)",

The Twelfth Street School Project illustrates how a development of structure can bring together university faculty and school system personnel to work jointly and cooperatively in a &quot;Center for Innovation and Research.&quot; The structure and organization present an embodiment of five premises. 1) The collaboration of educator and social scientist can best occur on the neutral  ground of a center. 2) The disciplines in a joint effort must depend upon analysis of the problem and upon the orientations of collaborators. 3) A close relationship between university researchers and school practitioners is necessary. 4) Research contacts should be sustained and cohesive. 5) The same research findings can contribute to a disciplinary body of knowledge and to the solution of &quot;real&quot; problems of teacher and administrators. The Center has produced an understanding about the possibilities of a productive relationship of social science and education. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"Fourteen romantic school critics share as a group common views of: the goodness of man in his natural state; the organizational or technological society as inhibiting and limiting individual development; teaching as a nurturing act; and conflict in American society as something which unites. They all write in an a-political non-programatic tone but do not, however, provide adequate explanations for their view. Four general questions point toward a Marxist critique of the romantic school critics. 1) Is education in North American society a failure or a success? 2) What is happening educationally to the \"poor\", the deprived, minority group? 3) What is the most important function of North American Education? 4) What are the possibilities of educational reform under capitalism?  Romantics have helped Marxist scholars by focusing attention on public education; providing clear illustrative material for a more fundamental analysis, and providing consciousness raising experiences for those who have taken their message seriously. It is the author's hope that reformers will realize that only through a revolutionary change in American society can educational reform occur in school. (Author/SJM)",

The focus is on the real political world and why people behave as they do. Facts and ideas are drawn from the work of social scientists, and the questions raised are those that have guided social scientists in their analyses of voter behavior. In Chapters 1-5 fundamental questions about elections and voter behavior are raised, pertinent facts and ideas are discussed, and sample lessons are presented. In all, there are nine sample lessons. They cover a variety of topics; and some teach specific skills. One lesson, for example, focuses on reading and interpreting political polls. Others are case studies of  political situations. The Appendix is a guide to books, periodicals, films, and simulations about voter behavior. These materials can be used as background material for the teacher or to enrich instruction. (JLB)",

        "description":"Whether or not an innovation in education is accepted is often dependent upon its direct affect on the stability of the adopter. A framework of organizational theory provides structure and meaning for a study on differing positive/negative responses of distinct groupings of educators toward the adoption of innovative practices. Educational change occurs within the framework of a school system made up of six subsystems of students, teachers, principals, central office administrators, parents, and community; each subsystem tending toward a status quo and operating independently (although interdependently when required). In this study, involving the principal and the teacher subsystems, four educational innovations were selected and offered, each to impact in the \"zone of  indifference,\" likely to produce positive response, and in the behavioral \"zone of reaction,\" likely to generate negative response and anxiety if confronted with change. Findings suggest that the educational subsystem required to make the greatest modifications in normal operating procedures will raise the highest level of resistance. This indicates that resistance can be predicted and furthermore, through identification of systems required to make the greatest changes, that it is possible to plan strategies that will help subsystems adapt to a program change.

        "description":"Two addresses dealing with educational change, given at the NAIS conference in March, 1972, are presented in this brief pamphlet. In the first, Bruce McClellan speaks about the need for independent schools to respond to challenges of social change in an optimistic rather than a pessimistic manner as they face the task of educating a new generation for a new world. With increasing technology the need for individual freedom and self-awareness becomes greater as a counterpoise. Because we live in a world of struggle between anonymity of machinery and technology and the inner tensions of humanity -- a world also of creative and destructive forces -- a paradoxical situation exists. The challenge is to first recognize the problem, and then respond to it. In the second speech, Esther E.  Osgood briefly describes a panorama of educational interests and reform during the last forty years in independent schools. Each decade focused upon different aspects of education, evidence that education is a constant flux of change and will always be different in the future. (SJM)",

        "description":"This paper was written in response to an article entitled \"Defining the Social Studies: An Explanation of the Three Traditions\" by James L. Barth and S. Samuel Shermis. The three positions portray social studies as citizenship transmission; as social science; and as reflective inquiry. These authors favor the latter position, defined as a process of decision making as to significant social problems perceived by students to be of considerable concern to them. An alternative position is proposed in this paper, namely, that the structure of economics should be an important organizing vehicle in the social studies and presents a case for a fourth tradition. The structure of a discipline should be defined as the interrelationships of its important concepts and the concepts of science  as a tool for repetitive assistance to a reflective inquirer. Problems for inquiry must be selected and organized so as to lead to an understanding of such a structure. The paper concludes with a further detailing of the case for economics education, pointing out the essential nature of the need for more citizens to understand and apply economic concepts in individual, business, political, and societal matters.

Since Communist acquisition of power late in 1947, three major educational reforms have reflected a progressive nationalistic educational trend. The first, in 1947, aligned Romania's Western-oriented educational system with that of the Soviet Union; the second, in 1955, called for reorganization of the schools along polytechnical lines. Revealing a bolder posture toward national independence and also reflecting political aspirations and educational objectives of the regime, the third reform in the 1960's was designed to further Romania's long-range plans for  industrialization and technical development and fostered change in general education, higher education, teacher education, and the vocational system. Among the achievements of this latter reform were: 1) the revitalization and modernization of higher education, and alignment of Romania's higher education with the modernization process occurring in the west; 2) extension from 8 to 10 years of free and compulsory education; 3) a rise of enrollment at all levels; and, 4) reorganization of vocational education.

Two more issues, Metropolitan Government, and influx of business and industry, are considered desirable but there is relative pessimism regarding the chances that something will be accomplished in five years. Three impediments to development of any of these issues are: 1) the community leaders; disenchangment with Republican and Democrat politics, politicians and political organization; 2) pessimism on the part of community leaders; 3) the feeling that an  inspirational and catalytic leadership linking patterns of governance with the larger body politic of the community does not exist. Knowledge of these perspectives may contribute to dialogue conducive to crystallization of concensus, avoidance of conflict, and utilization of conflict dimensions which may be at the core of creative responses to the problems.

Each episode reflects the anticipated social and intellectual maturity of the pupil at the grade level selected. Materials for primary levels stress human interaction within society; materials and activities chosen for grades 5, 8, and 9 begin to develop the distinction between ideal and real life; secondary school samples capitalize upon the emphasis of the elementary program and focus upon increasing precision of critical thinking as well as accuracy of knowledge. The secondary episodes are for U.S. history since 1929 in grade 11 and a sociology course in grade 12. In all episodes teacher and students try to determine if their attitudes have changed as a result  of the study. Activities are adapted to local and state history and conditions. Student materials, quizzes, teaching strategies, and bibliographies are included in some episodes. (Author/VW)",

The procedure views the levels of occupational education as a pyramid, with students making decisions about careers based on broad exploratory experiences and counseling. As choices are narrowed the experiences become more intensified. A remedial program is operated for students who are identified as potential dropouts in order to equip them with the competence and skills necessary for pursuing further vocational training. It was concluded that  the exemplary project made important progress in developing skills which will serve as a basis for continuous growth and advancement in chosen careers, and it was recommended that funding should be continued for the second year of operation.

Career education offers an opportunity to develop and implement more appropriate curriculums that will meet the needs and desires of students and serve the purposes of society. The fundamental concept of career education is that all educational experiences, curriculum, instruction, and counseling should be geared to preparation for economic independence and an appreciation for the dignity of work. Beginning with the early elementary school years (K-6), the student is provided an opportunity to explore a wide spectrum of occupational clusters so that by the middle grades (Grades 7-9) he can examine more closely those clusters in which he is most  interested. By the end of the 10th grade he develops elementary job skills that he can pursue if he does not complete the 12th grade. If he does complete the 12th grade, the student is prepared to enter the labor market or to continue his education at a post-secondary institution. To put a career education program into action requires a profound rethinking of missions and restructuring of operations by all who are concerned with American education, but the benefits gained will be worth the investment.

After a pilot study was completed and the instrument validated, 32 contract school districts and 52 non-contract districts (an 81 percent return) were surveyed. Following a data comparison based on percentages, it was concluded that administrators of both types of districts hold the same view about the cost and value of vocational education. Also, there was no significant difference in their attitudes concerning the value of vocational education, for students in different scholastic ranges.  There was a significant difference in two of eleven statements regarding general attitudes toward vocational education with the major difference being the approach to vocational education within the total high school program, and the priority accorded vocational education by the administrators.

In the area of curriculum development, the most effective approach appears to be instructional content derived from explicit analysis of desired behavior after graduation, rather than from a selection of excerpts from a total body of knowledge. Each curriculum should be defined by what technology and industry need for job success. A proposed solution to problems encountered with the current method of curriculum development (teachers writing for personal  classroom use) is based on the probability that a cooperative approach by several large school systems with effective research support and management assistance can gather the financial resources (Federal, state, local, and industrial) to accomplish the tasks. From this base, each school system would sponsor independent development in one or more specific job family areas which would be implemented, field tested, and nationally disseminated. In addition to effective management, the plan also includes inservice staff development and evaluation techniques. (SB)",

Pretest and posttest measures of subject content, attitude, and critical thinking abilities were obtained using such instruments as a Semantic Differential, the Life Career Inventory, and the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal. Also a retention test was administered 23 days after the posttest. Based on the analysis of data, a major conclusion of the study  included: (1) The Life Career game is no more effective than traditional methods in assisting students to learn subject matter, (2) Simulation is more effective than traditional methods in changing attitudes and for retention of subject matter, and (3) Neither method was effective in improving critical thinking ability.

The analysis offers substantiation that the antecedents of career education reside in both vocational education and guidance, and that the term \"career education,\" so far as it is presently articulated, does have significant support from these knowledge domains. During the past century, much of the support for the antecedents to career education has come from the needs of a labor market changing from an agricultural to a technical character. A review of existing projects reveals that only a few meet the levels of  integration, synthesis, or longitude now expected of career education. There has been more emphasis on career programs at the elementary and junior high levels than at the senior high school level or beyond. The evolution of career development theories has stimulated programs of a prevocational character placed earlier in the life of children. Many research requirements are stimulated by career education, and these needs are listed. (SB)",

        "description":"Oregon's Dissemination Program was established in July 1970. Its purpose was to close the communication gap between validated information and the decision making processes related to school administration and instruction. The program was administered by a staff of six, two of whom were assigned to pilot Intermediate Education District offices. The program provided a computer based information center using ERIC and CIJE files as the primary source of documents. Library resources and BOCS services were used extensively during the initial year of operation. By December, the Center was in full operation. The use of services increased from 13 requests in October to 159 requests in November. The program expanded to include districts throughout the state. In 1972, a systematic state  wide information network will be established. Feedback indicates that increasing numbers of administrators and teachers are relying on more validated information to make decisions. It can be concluded that the dissemination of validated information is valuable for systematic improvements in education. It is also evident that effective information retrieval-dissemination is a complex process which requires special skills and careful development. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The identification of teaching resources for low achievers depends upon analysis of student characteristics, teaching strategies, and mathematics curriculum content. Social and emotional problems of low achievers are often reflected in low motivation, short interest spans, antisocial behavior, high absence rates, and goals based only on the immediate future. These characteristics suggest that appropriate resource materials should be constructed in small units with provisions for individualized work, and should emphasize success and self-worth--possibly by including an incentive or reward system. An activity learning approach provides an excellent vehicle for promoting the following teaching procedures that are particularly effective with low achievers: (1) Employ repetition  through spiraling; (2) Introduce small segments of material at a time; and (3) Use language which the class is likely to understand. Resource materials should have clear objectives which have some relationship to the immediate needs of the learner. Content material should develop desirable habits, attitudes, and appreciations as well. To do this, materials must combine low difficulty levels with high mathematical standards. (Author/CK)",

The discussion is centered around (1) a tenative typology of forces for re-socialization, (2) a view of adults as having three basic attitudinal strategies toward life, and (3) a flow-chart that may serve as a paradigm for re-socialization theory. The three major forces for re-socialization are cited as being: (1) Cultural transition; rural to urban area, migration to new country, career shift, and social status shift; (2) Critical social interaction: social conflict, social institutionalization, and brainwashing; and (3) Personal crux: physical accident, familial loss, responsibility shift, religious experience,  and age crisis. The three major additudinal strategies that can be attributed to the individual are: problem-solving types, conforming types, and ambiguous types. These three types are described as to traits and behavioral responses to the environment. The re-socialization paradigm, in the shape of a tree, shows the basic influences on a human organism (genetic developmental, and environmental), two basic socializations (general and occupational), a disturbance to the norm, re-socialization, and three possible re-directions that occur.

The discussion describes a model IPI system (The Draper Model); recommends certain considerations if it is to be used successfully; and shows that programmed instructional (PI) materials work best in a learning system where individually prescribed and managed instruction is the goal. The basic steps employed in the use of IPI materials are described. The use of contingency management in creating a total learning environment is discussed and illustrated with an experiment in which contingency management was used in an attempt of increase the productivity of 16 prison inmates who were studying PI materials. It is concluded that IPI works, as is being  shown at the Draper Correctional Center, in adult education programs, and in programs for the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Recommendations for those who are planning or operating an IPI system are provided; these are: (1) Learn the underlying theoretical principles of IPI; (2) Recognize benefits of IPI; (3) Recognize that IPI has limitations; (4) Involve the trainee in planning and operating the program; (5) Relate basic education skills as closely as possible to occupational goals and work; (6) Use small instructional units or modules; and (7) Employ paraprofessionals to assist in the training system.

        "description":"Individualized Learning for Adults (ILA), a program designed to meet the needs of adults enrolled in Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes, is presented. The curriculum of the ILA program consists of two carefully constructed continuums sequenced along two dimensions: area and level. There are 257 performance objectives, or skills, in the Mathematics continuum and 188 performance objectives, or skills, in Communications Skills. Each continuum is divided into the following areas: (1) Mathematics: Numeration and place value, addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, geometry and measurement, applications; and (2) Communication Skills: Phonic Analysis/Handwriting, Structural Analysis, Vocabulary Development, Literal Comprehension, Interpretive Comprehension, Evaluative  Comprehension, Library Skills, Reference Skills. On entering ILA, each student takes an Entrance Test (or tests). Within each test are items designed to make a gross evaluation of the students' achievement in each unit of the continuum. Instructional decisions pertinent to a student's learning program are always made with the student. (CK)",

        "description":"The strategies whereby relevant findings and implications of empirical research could become known to and employed by adult basic education practitioners in solving their problems are demonstrated. Efforts were made to: (1) Identify significant problems in the practice of adult basic education; (2) Conduct a thorough search of the research literature in the social sciences relevant to such problems; and (3) Develop and disseminate a series of monographs which would translate the findings of research and suggest solutions to problems in a manner which is meaningful to practitioners. To accomplish these tasks, job descriptions were developed, a nine-member staff employed, a project task analysis performed, criteria for selecting writers devised, and a conceptual system to  facilitate a uniform approach to the definition and analysis of problems developed. The staff read 3,000 reports and made a survey of all members of the Commission of Professors of Adult Education and the Special Project Directors to detect research recently conducted. Findings include: (1) Ten monographs which relate research to practice can be produced in a twelve-month period with the resources made available in this project; (2) Problems reported by practitioners and researchers are often imprecisely defined and analyzed; (3) Practitioners tend to attribute problems to lack of financial and physical resources or to some uncontrollable conditions rather than to a lack of capability or knowledge on their part.

Using methodology derived from information theory, information processing ability was measured with the individuals performing as a communication system. Fifty-five school teachers, ranging in age from 20 to 66, served as subjects. In four groups, the subjects judged the sizes of dark squares on a light background in five tests. Images were projected onto a screen, under controlled timing conditions. Performance declined as age increased in four of the tests. In two tests this decline was statistically significant (p<.05). It was anticipated that the methodology employed would provide asymptotic values of channel capacity, indicating that maximum information processing capacity had been reached. However, the  methodology used did not provide such a measurement. A secondary phase of the study explored individual differences. Eleven subjects exhibited considerable variability, particularly a difference in their ability to judge size of squares and the placement of a dot in a grid pattern. The study confirmed earlier studies indicating some decline in performance with aging but pointed up the abilities of older adults to make precise judgments even under severe testing conditions.

Measures of the number and results of MDT trainees' interactions with ES offices before and after release from prison were made to determine the degree of effectiveness being achieved by ES personnel in securing training-related jobs for MDT trainees. Data were gathered from four sources: (1) the ES extension office records (at Draper) of 56 MDT trainees and an interview with the ES counselor stationed at Draper, (2) records of 41 MDT trainees (73% of the  study group) released to the service areas of 13 ES field offices located throughout Alabama and interviews with office managers or responsible personnel in these offices, (3) postrelease interviews of 16 MDT trainees which had already been accomplished in connection with EMLC Objective 3, and (4) additional telephone interviews with 10 of those 16 MDT trainees. Results showed that the ES Draper Extension Office had placed 18 (32%) of the 56 MDT trainees in training-related jobs; 14 (25%) of them reported to work and 7 (13%) were still employed on those initial jobs at the time of the study. The 13 ES field offices placed 5 (12%) of the 41 MDT trainees released to their areas in training-related jobs. (Author)",

The point is made that the principles of behavior modification derive primarily from basic research performed within the framework of the experimental analysis of behavior. The Rehabilitation Research Foundation has been involved in the design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of innovative correctional programs for a number of years. It is proposed that the next logical step in the utilization of these techniques in corrections be taken: the development and evaluation of a token economy within the institution itself. The proposed demonstration project will: (1)  Establish a token economy in one cell block of a large correctional institution for adult, male offenders (felons); (2) Examine the effectiveness of a system based upon positive reinforcement; (3) Develop a remedial educational program tailored to the correctional setting; (4) Determine the impact of various token reinforcement procedures; and (5) Evaluate the effect of token economy upon post-release adjustment and recidivism. The project has three phases. Phase I will consist of an initial observation period. Phase II will involve the institution and maintenance of the token economy. Phase III will consist of postrelease follow-up. Follow-up data will be used for validation and intervention purposes. (CK)",

The study employed a three-phase design: (1) a pre-survey of the prison community, (2) limited intervention, based on findings of the pre-survey, and (3) a post-survey to determine effects of intervention and to validate findings of the pre-survey for which no intervention had been designed. Samples were drawn from trainees in the 1968-69 Manpower Development and Training (MDT) project at Draper Correctional Center, Elmore, Alabama, from nontrainee inmates at the same institution, from Draper Correctional Center staff, and from Rehabilitation Research foundation staff. Positive correlations were obtained in each of the staff samples between scores on an accuracy of information scale and those on a positivity of attitude  scale on both the pre- and post-intervention surveys. Pre-to-post gains in both attitude and information scores were also registered by most subjects. The data gathered in this exploratory study and the experience gained can be of considerable value in planning more rigorous design in efforts to explore environmental factors that affect a manpower training program for prisoners. Also, persons or agencies setting up a manpower training program or any other similar effort in an institutional setting may find in this report patterns for planning which can help them maximize efforts to generate positive attitudes on the part of those in the prison environment whose behavior toward the program affects the degree of success it may achieve.

Objectives of this paper are to cite evidence that PI is being used successfully in correctional institutions, to suggest reasons for this success, and to show that PI works best in the context of a broader learning system where individually prescribed and managed instruction is the goal. A brief questionnaire survey in the use of PI was conducted in 150 major state adult correctional institutions throughout the nation and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Ninety-seven per cent reported their institutions experiencing success in the use of PI. Reasons given by respondees for the success of PI include: (1) permits individualized instruction, (2) self-paced, (3) students like it, (4)  no competition (with others). In addition, 37% of users of PI systems reported that they had developed effective approaches, such as contingency management and performance contracts. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, a major consumer of PI, states that it is committed to the continued use of PI and to development of more sophisticated contexts, such as training systems and contingency management. Draper Correctional Center has experimented with developing a model basic education program in which PI is the primary instructional method. This method has four steps: Diagnosis, Prescription, Managing the Instruction, and Evaluation. (CK)",

In setting up an ABE program, the initial order of business is to construct a viable model, one that insures that rapid and significant learning will occur for those participating in the program. Operant psychology has provided many practical applications to the problems of education. Programmed instruction (IPI) is an example of such an application. Several essential criteria by which the educator can design and evaluate learning material are: (1) Explicit behavioral objectives should be set forth in a manner which lends them to measurement; (2) Validation data should be provided by  the publisher of the materials; (3) Trainee-oriented instructional increments are a desirable characteristic of instructional materials; (4) Active student participation is another desirable characteristic of an instructional product; and (5) Instructional materials should provide the student with immediate feedback of his learning progress. An advanced model of IPI for ABE is in operation at Draper Correctional Center, Elmore, Alabama. It is concluded that for efficiency of learning, ABE materials should be programmed in sequence, modularized, and presented in a manner that permits frequent feedback of the learner's progress.

        "description":"A survey determining how widespread the policy of prisoner furloughs has become and how well the programs which have been implemented are operated was conducted. A questionnaire regarding home furlough policies was distributed to the directors of the departments of corrections of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The questionnaire requested a copy of the law and/or regulations under which home furlough programs were authorized (if applicable) and posed nine questions. These questions include: (1) Do you have a policy of sending adult male inmates home for emergencies? (2) Do you have adult male inmate home furloughs for other than emergency purposes? (3) Do you have a law for adult male inmate home furloughs? and (4) What are the criteria  under which adult male inmates are selected for home furlough? Findings include: (1) The granting of emergency leave is a widespread practice in American corrections; (2) The home furlough program is a relatively new addition to American correctional practices; and (3) The criteria under which the various agencies grant furloughs typically stipulate that persons considered for the program be of minimum custody status, have either served a fixed amount of their sentence or be within some fixed time of release and be approved by a review committee which considers the applicant's institutional record, home situation, and past history. Further research on home furlough programs is suggested. (CK)",

        "description":"The training of all people on a correctional institution staff is discussed. The point is made that there are special problems about penal institutions in trying to effect behavior change in that people are living there against their will. This circumstance produces a basis for a subculture. It has been found that the criminal subculture is the most important dynamic in the correctional institution, as far as the operation of the institution and the training programs within it are concerned. This subculture contains: (1) the \"adapters,\" or those people who come into an institution with very little prior experience of living in jails, (2) college kids who are caught for using \"pot,\" another type of \"adapters,\" (3) the \"solid,\" the man who teaches the new people the ways of the  subculture. It is stated that the most crucial consideration in the operation of an institution is that the warden's office or the administrator's office must be the center of operation. For purposes of this discussion, an \"authority figure\" is defined as anyone who works in an institution, excluding the inmates. Of special concern is the correctional officer, whose potential as a behavior change agent is an almost untapped resource. In order to change an inmate's behavior, a correctional officer must: (1) Have some contact with him; (2) Build up his trust; and (3) Help him out in a tough situation. (CK)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of employing educationally advanced inmates as one-to-one basic education tutors for inmate students was evaluated. In conjunction with this evaluation, an experimental study of the most efficient material presentation and testing techniques using this manpower resource was conducted. Three different modes of presenting programmed material and two modes of testing both immediate and long-term retention were used, and the effectiveness of these modes was assessed in terms of accuracy and response rate. One mode of presentation involved the use of the programmed text in the usual manner, with no specification of response to topography. For the second mode, the course was cut into frames for use with a specially developed \"teaching machine,\" requiring a written  response to each frame. In the third mode, frames were pasted to index cards with the answers on the reverse side. Tutors presented questions, acknowledged responses, indicated correct and incorrect answers, and discussed errors following each learning session. In this mode, \"Precision Teaching,\" a verbal response and interpersonal contact were required. Testing consisted of either the traditional fill-in-the blank procedure or a personalized technique in which the tutors presented the test items directly to the students. Precision teaching was shown to generate higher rates of emission of correct responses on criterion tests than the teaching machine, which in turn exceeded the rate generated by the textbook alone.

At the end of the course, 10 of the 13 were reading graded material with reasonable accuracy, fluency and comprehension. Two were making fair progress, but probably will not retain literacy without joining continuation classes. One did not learn, but her vision was defective. After 3-1/2 months, students were again tested. Only one had joined a local literacy class in the interim. Eight of the 10 who could be tested achieved 80%-95% accuracy in the comprehension test (Evaluation Unit - National Literacy Pilot Project) for reading. The two who had been slowest in first testing had lost considerably and achieved only  23%-33%. All had lost in writing skills during the interim. A certain amount of homecraft practices taught in the classroom were transferred over to the home, but it was difficult to assess how much. (Author/CK)",

The proposal contains several innovative and experimental features, the most significant of which are the project's relationships with the Experimental Manpower Laboratory for Corrections (EMLC) and a newly created Center for Studies in Community Corrections (CSCC) which is also operated by the RRF. Derived from these linkages will be two mutually beneficial outcomes: (1) The EMLC will have manpower trainees to use as subjects in its experimental studies and CSCC will have manpower graduates referred to it for its  treatment, training, and coordinated services programs in the community; and (2) The MTPP will have the Lab's input for improving upon its training and rehabilitative effort and an outreach community center(CSCC) where postrelease graduates can receive follow-up services, such as continuing basic education, &quot;crisis&quot; intervention, behavior modification, and job development and placement. Other experimental features of the proposal include: (1) Selection, training, and provision of related services for approximately 175 male inmates of the Alabama prison system; (2) Application of &quot;contingency management&quot; procedures to shape optimum training performance and behavior change; and (3) To use incentive payments in simulating real life experience.

The system featured programmed instructional materials and contingency management procedures to obtain stable cumulative records of learning performance. Contingency contracts and backup reinforcers were used to achieve optimum motivation, as indexed by test scores and ratios of empirically derived estimates to actual times for task completion. Intercorrelations between learning rate, various measures of educational achievement, and I.Q. were not significant. It was suggested that a behavioral analysis of other functions should be explored.

        "description":"The individually prescribed instruction (IPI) system in use at Draper Correctional Center was studied. The IPI system for basic education involves five operations: (1) establishing the learning objectives--basic literacy, educational skills prerequisite for occupational training, preparation for the GED high school equivalency examination, etc., (2) Diagnosing the learner's relevant entry skills, (3) Prescribing the modules of material in the sequence necessary to attain the objective or to remedy the learning deficiency, (4) Managing the contingencies of reinforcement, and (5) Evaluating learner's progress. To complement the IPI system, a system of managing the contingencies of reinforcement was necessary in order to maintain consistent learning performance. The study was  designed in three phases. Phase I was a three-week baseline period during which quantity and quality baseline measures of academic &quot;productivity&quot; were established. During Phase II, the contingencies of reinforcement were managed by the experimenter. The third phase was a two-week self-management phase during which each subject was allowed to specify the amount of work he would do each day. Evaluation of the effectiveness of contingency management techniques in the Manpower Development and Training Program will be part of an intensive, long-term follow-up study. (CK)",

        "description":"The case for behavior modification and some examples of its application in a variety of correctional settings are presented. The principles, techniques, and strategies utilized in programs designed to induce behavior change are largely determined by the model of causality to which one subscribes. A new approach to human behavior, which is the result of a rapproachement between psychology as a basic and an applied science, represents the first attempt to develop a viable science of human behavior which allows the practitioner to implement experimentally derived and validated principles in an applied setting. The hallmarks of this approach are empiricism and objectivity. Deviant behavior is depicted as acquired in the same manner as normal behavior, and consequently, as amenable to  modification through the appropriate use of the laws of learning. Diagnosis is the tool used by more and more professionals to discover the reason for behavioral deviancy. The four functions of diagnosis are: (1) It specifies in what manner an individual differs from those around him; (2) It identifies the causes or origins of the individual's deviance; (3) It supplies information as to what will transpire if no remedial action is undertaken; and (4) It specifies what intervention strategy will be most effective dealing with the deviancy. The guidelines given for use of diagnosis include: (1) a clarification of the problem situation, (2) a motivational analysis, and (3) an analysis of self-control. (CK)",

        "description":"A methodology for the assessment and prediction of recidivism in terms of degree or extent of environmental deprivation or support is presented. The Environmental Deprivation Scale (EDS) was employed as an objective means of assessing environmental circumstances in a group of recidivists as contrasted with non-recidivists. The EDS consists of a check list of 16 behavioral items dealing with everyday functioning in the areas of occupation, institutional activities and interpersonal relations. In the present study a total of 74 releasees from Draper Correctional Center were followed up in their postrelease life. The present report contains the detailed comparison of recidivists and non-recidivists on the EDS along with additional information on the discriminatory power of the EDS  in other forms of behavioral deviancy. The data show that there is appreciable separation in EDS performance of recidivists and nonrecidivists. Recidivists show a high degree of environmental deprivation while the nonrecidivists show a much greater degree of environmental support. Thus, the EDS serves as a detection device as well as a criterion of degree of deprivation and an indicator of the extent of behavioral deviancy. (CK)",

        "description":"A survey designed to elicit factual information about the provisions for adult education currently being made in Jamaica is presented. A questionnaire was designed for this purpose. It is intended that the survey be presented to a Conference of representatives of the Adult Education Agencies for their consideration. The questionnaire was divided into the following sections: Introduction, Affiliation, Finance, Staff, Subject Areas and Activities, Facilities, and The Future. The Agencies to whom the questionnaire was sent included governmental organizations, statutory bodies, independent and voluntary organizations, and university agencies. The agencies on the list numbered 66, and of these, 41 completed and returned questionnaires in time to be included in this report. In the  appendix a list of the agencies which completed and returned the questionnaire is given. The best returns were from the statutory agencies, most of whom returned the questionnaires. Conclusions include: (1) A large number of agencies are engaged in one aspect or other of adult education; (2) Not all of these agencies are involved exclusively in adult education; (3) The adult education effort in Jamaica is fragmented; (4) An appropriately oriented co-ordinating machinery can serve to give more dynamism to the adult education movement; and (5) A properly constituted co-ordinating machinery would serve to identify areas where there are dificiencies in the provision of adult education.

        "author":["Sparks, James Allen"],
        "description":"The parish administrative board--the Session--is an interactional group according to the operational definition as advanced by Gibb, Proshansky and Seidenberg. As a group it shares relatively common religious and moral values, as well as institutional goals. The perimeters of the Session's group life are clearly, if not legalistically, defined by the constitution of the United Presbyterian Church. Prescriptions for study are not so clearly spelled out, although the Session's willingness to study is assumed by the national church boards and agencies. Does the minister's style of leadership and the Session's task-orientation effect the board's functioning as a learning group? In this paper, an effort is made to find answers to some of these questions from the literature of small  group research. Two hypotheses were advanced: (1) Administrative groups are differentiated from learning groups primarily by styles of leadership and group tasks and goals; and (2) Administrative groups in the church can become more effective at learning tasks by an educationally oriented and flexible leadership style of minister behavior and a commitment to study as well as to problem-solving and administration. The major conclusion of this paper is that an administrative group who perceives its work to be decision-making may not engage readily in other tasks, unless it, as a group, accepts such tasks and makes a commitment to them.

One purpose of this program was to determine age differences in cognitive abilities, with special reference to items selected as suitable for adults of different ages, to survey the educational backgrounds and skills that older and younger adults bring to learning situations, and to study age differences in personality characteristics of a type likely to influence the individual's learning. A second main purpose of the research was to investigate experimentally the interaction of the variables mentioned above with the age of the learner in determining learning and performance. The general plans and results for these two aspects of the program of research are described in Parts I and II of the report. Part I,  Adult Age Differences in Cognitive Abilities, Educational Background, and Learning Orientation, discusses adult age differences in cognitive functioning, in educational background, and in learning orientation. Part II, Experimental Studies, discusses effects of performance; and age, stress, and cognitive performance.

Its purposes included: (1) To learn something about the state of the art and anticipate future developments; (2) To relate what has been learned to education for the profession of management accounting at the undergraduate and graduate levels; and (3) To provide a framework of reference which may be used for determining what role the Society of Industrial Accountants should play in the development of instructional systems for educational programs, making judgements in the allocation of resources to the development of instructional programs, and deciding on the approach which should be taken in developing instructional systems most appropriate to Society of Industrial Accountants (SIA) programs. Instructional Technology is  defined as the media born of the communications revolution and as a systematic way of designing, carrying out and evaluating the total process of learning and teaching in terms of specific objectives. Its potential benefits include: (1) It provides greater flexibility in matching learner needs and instructional resources; (2) It permits continuing monitoring of an instructional program and achieving the optimum in cost-effectiveness; (3) It broadens the scope for more effective experimentation and innovation; and (4) It provides for the introduction of response and feedback mechanisms.

An introduction to the work of Literacy Volunteers, Inc. (LitVol), is presented; this introduction is the first in a series on major partners in the national Right to Read effort. LitVol organizes and trains volunteers to teach reading on a one-to-one tutoring basic to functionally illiterate adults (those with less than fifth grade skills). Among the methods developed by LitVol are: heavy use of voluntary staff; organized recruitment plans for trainers and learners, aided by TV spots and other publicity materials; tutor  training, using handbooks on organizing and instructional techniques, including audio-visual components; and methods for &quot;matching&quot; tutors and learners by personality and components. Advantages of one-to-one tutoring include: (1) Illiterate adults have often been frustrated in classrooms and generalize this experience to any group situation; (2) It is difficult to find a group, or even two adults at the same level, who, studying together, can learn at the same pace; (3) Personal tutoring can fit the instruction to the varying motives of the adult learner; and (4) Personal attention can often buck up the morale of the troubled learner.

Results indicated that the frequencies of initiations and negative responses were lower in 4-person racially mixed groups than in 4-person homogeneous groups. Also, the ratio of responses in general to initiations was lower in mixed groups than in homogeneous groups. Thus, racial awareness was found to inhibit social behavior. (Author)",

Self alienation is conceived as an individual's sense of detachment from his own feelings, thoughts, and identity. Personality characteristics, especially those associated with psychopathology, were defined by elevations on the clinical scales of the MMPI. The hypothesis that social alienation would be related to indices of \"psychoticism\" was partially born out  in the significant association between the social alienation scale and the related scales on the MMPI. Results also suggested a relationship between self alienation and \"neuroticism;\" however, there was a great deal of overlapping of the alienation measures. (RK)",

Aggression can serve to insure privacy. Privacy, then, allows one the freedom to explore the environment.

Essentially, privacy, territoriality, crowding, aggression, intimacy and creativity are seen as biological predispositions whose manifestations are greatly modified by social circumstances. The remarks presented here consider definitions, examples and functions of these several terms and concepts, and attempt to relate these concepts, sociologically, to the self, to others, and to one's environment.

After depression, alcoholism is the 2nd most common psychiatric diagnosis among suicide victims. Suicide attempters also are frequently alcoholic. The association between alcoholism and suicide, however, may only apply to white males during the middle years of life. The relatively low rates of suicide among older black alcoholics may be a consequence of the earlier onset of excessive drinking in this group, although this needs direct confirmation before proven true. The role of alcohol, in contrast with alcoholism, is less clear in suicide, although perhaps a quarter of suicide victims had been drinking at time of death. Homicide, on the other hand, is  associated with alcohol more than with alcoholism. In most studies, about 50 percent of both homicide offenders and victims had been drinking at the time of the crime. Two autopsy studies indicate that victims, at least, were often severely intoxicated. However, alcoholism is rarely diagnosed in homicide offenders, suggesting that, while alcohol consumption may contribute to homicide, alcoholism does not. (MA)",

In the context of this study, the term \"human ecology\" is used and refers to the study of man as a function of his positional occupancy in various social structures. It is one possible model for the study of man and is primarily concerned with discovering that balance of social environmental elements that would optimize man's adjustment and survival. In relationship to this model, the literature in the following 2 areas is reviewed: (1) Social Causation and Enlarged Conceptions of Maladjustment; and (2) Social Structures and  Adjustment. From this review it is concluded that future research and model building pertinent to overcrowding and other such environmental matters would do well to avoid normative and one sided approaches to the program, i.e., emphasizing either environmental or personalism to its extremes.

Such a contention was not supported by this study of 53 families in which the mother is a practicing physician, attorney, or college professor. While 8 of the couples were childless, 4 of them were involuntarily so and the remaining 4 were newly-married. Of the 45 couples with children, the mean family size was 2.4. Ten of the couples with children had plans to have more. Seven couples had 4 or more children. Two women indicated limiting family size because of their career commitments: both reportedly regretted having done so. All 53 professional women rated their roles as mothers as being more important to them than  their career roles. None of them expressed resentment over limiting their career activities due to family responsibilities. Suggestions are made for changes in the social structure which could lead to high levels of child-related emotional satisfactions for parents without encouraging them to have large families of their own.

With reinforced practice and covert sensitization the main therapeutic procedure had far more effect than therapeutic instructions. For desensitization, it is concluded that the critical procedure only facilitates imaginal approach to feared or phobic situations. Most of the therapeutic effect is due to expectancy. The degree of the effect of expectancy varies with different experiments, and it is suggested that the more disabling the disorder the less the effect of therapeutic instructions. It is further questioned  how the giving of therapeutic instructions and a believable rationale, influences behavior change in neurotic conditions. With phobia it appears that desensitization facilitates imaginal approach to the feared situation. This may lead the patient to try to approach the situation in reality, which in turn may be responsible for the demonstrated superiority of desensitization to other forms of the therapy. However, including exposure to the feared situation greatly adds to the efficacy of desensitization, and is beneficial in its own right. (MA)",

In addition to supporting and extending earlier findings regarding the influence of nurturance and power characteristics on identification, the present data  suggest that emotional intimacy and dominance are characteristics whose reinforcement value for adults depends in part on the culturally defined sex role of the model.

Strategies are based on 6 tasks for meeting the standards for a rational value judgment discussed by Jerrold Coombs (1971). The 6 tasks involve reducing differences in each of the following: the interpretation of the value issue, the purported facts assembled, the assessed truth of purported facts, the relevance of facts, tentative value judgments, and testing the acceptability of value principles. Procedures are formulated on the basis of 3 sets of principles: logical, such as analyzing value conflict into its logical components; procedural, such as organizing sources of conflict according to the kind of logical component and how they contribute  to the complexity of the conflict; and psychological, such as breaking larger conflicts into smaller conflicts and resolving smaller conflicts first. In tests of both the approach to strategies and the procedure, results were as follows: (1) behavior on the 6 tasks followed a complex pattern, rather than occuring in a simple logical order; (2) participants discussed a variety of alternative plans, rather than just the initial plans on which there was conflict; and (3) the emphasis on moral and economic concerns was changed somewhat.

        "description":"Interviews with 321 university students were used to determine relationships between admitted marijuana use and theft and perceptions of the severity and certainty of punishment. Use of marijuana and theft activity were expected to be least frequent among those who: (1) perceive the harshest penalties for marijuana possession and petty larceny; (2) perceive the greatest likelihood of receiving the maximum penalty upon conviction for those offenses; (3) expect that law violaters are, generally, caught by the police; (4) have the greatest familiarity with others who have been arrested for theft or marijuana possession; and (5) perceive the greatest chance of being arrested themselves, should they steal or use marijuana. The data suggest that (1) perceptions of severe punishment are  largely unrelated to admitted theft or marijuana use; (2) \"general\" deterrence appears not to be working for either offense -- that is, punishment of \"other\" when perceived by \"ego\" appears unrelated to \"ego's\" admitted criminality; (3) the expectation that arrest or maximum penalties upon conviction would be likely (certain) for oneself appears somewhat related to lower levels of marijuana use and larceny. However, these latter relationships are stronger for marijuana use than they are for theft. (Author)",

An attempt is reported here to eliminate such misbehavior by strengthening a competing and educationally relevant class of behavior, namely academic performance. A classroom was sleected in an urban school which included children with the most severe behavior problems. Fourteen children, ages 6 to 9 years, were included in this study. A simple but reliable method for recording the behavior of the teacher in the classroom was first developed; the emphasis in the recording was placed on objective definition and quantification of behavior relevant to academic performance in the classroom. Through training in behavioral procedures, the teacher was able to eliminate the behavior problems while  increasing her effectiveness in the classroom as measured by (1) the proportion of time per day spent discussing academic subject matter with the class; (2) the daily number of assignments given to each pupil; and (3) the proportion of correct work performed by the pupils. The increase in academic achievement by the students and the increase in teaching time by the teacher occurred in a matter of 4 academic days. An additional findings was that 6 out of the 14 children were promoted to the regular classroom following the behavioral intervention. (Author)",

Play therapy is considered to be part of the non-directive client-centered approach to counseling developed by Carl Rogers. The importance of giving the child the opportunity to play out his feelings and explore his thoughts and experiences is stressed. The counselors role in this situation is defined as being an indirect participant, providing recognition and reflection of the child's feelings. Two types of playrooms and their suggested contents are presented. A way of integrating this method into an elementary public school through a program of workshop training classroom teachers in techniques of play therapy is proposed. The method is adaptable to the classroom  through creative activities, and the recognition of the feelings of the child by the therapist-teacher in a manner by which the child can gain insight into his behavior is discussed.

In an effort to provide a broader background, students were placed in community agencies during the summer months. Bi-weekly seminars kept each candidate abreast of the activities of the others. Recommendations were that revisions in academic course content were necessary, as well as closer supervision during placement. The second paper presents results of studies in which the Inventory of Counseling Practices was used in conjunction with the IPAT Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire. The basic difference in the studies was the factor of experience. Implications of these results for the training of counselors were considered.  Particular emphasis was given to the role personality plays in defining later choices of counseling behavior. The overall conclusion drawn from the data was that counselor educators should more carefully screen their students in order to select people willing to become involved with their clients. From that point, counselor educators must help their students develop the skills they will need to work effectively with their clients. (Author)",

Criteria for the Project consisted of ratings of the randomly-placed clients by employer representatives, comparable ratings by the Director of Placement, and client satisfaction. The placement registrants who participated in the Project received employment interview evaluations significantly below those of randomly selected control interviews. Despite reporting more difficulty with securing positions  than a randomly selected group of placement registrants, the placement clients who participated in the Project counseling gave equally favorable evaluations to the placement services they received. Project participants' placement success was rated by the Placement Director as equal to that of the randomly selected control group. This ultimate placement success was seen as a result of the non-traditional services they received. No differences in outcome were apparent between those counseled individually and those counseled in groups. (Author/CJ)",

Coping ability can be seen in children's ways of handling unfamiliar and stressful situations and is a skill that is seen as likely very influential in an individual's total development, both social-emotional and cognitive development. The report describes the situations and procedures that were developed to elicit coping behaviors. Further, methods of observing, recording, and categorizing coping were also presented. The objectives of this pilots study were to determine whether a useful set of contrived or staged techniques could be developed that would elicit many of the coping behaviors a child might reveal in his natural environment. The  preliminary results showed that the younger children aged 3 and 4 years showed different coping styles than the 5, 6, and 7 year olds and that a hierarchy of more to less mature forms of coping could possibly be developed in future studies. Some recommendations for further work in this area were suggested. (Author)",

Each of these strains creates problems in educational governance and policymaking, sometimes necessitating administrative reorganization or disruption of the usual relations among educational governing agencies. To solve the crises in educational governance, an intergovernmental approach is necessary with emphasis on (1) the interdependence, rather than the local, State, and national governing powers; (2) the importance of the pivotal position of the State in making the federal system  work; (3) the need to give education a more strategic place in Federal Government priorities and to augment federal assistance to education; and (4) the continuation of local school districts but with some restructuring and greater collaboration with other governmental jurisdictions.

The first section describes findings of recent studies in Oregon, British Columbia, and Manitoba, regarding the relationship between administrative component size and that of the school system, and the relationship between school system size and unit costs. Similar findings for all three jurisdictions reveal that there exists a cost curve wherein costs decrease with increase in system enrollments to a certain optimal point. Beyond that point, costs increase with increases in enrollment. In the second section, some criteria are established for analyzing school systems, and the suggestion is made that insofar as system \"bigness\" is concerned, three criteria are important: citizen  participation in policymaking, program diversity to meet community needs, and flexibility in meeting pressures for innovation. Three case studies of New York, Vancouver, and Toronto are described briefly. (Author/EA)",

The inadequacy of the property tax revenue as a chief source of public school support is a fact of educational finance to which increasing attention is being given by school officials in many parts of the nation. A number of States, South Dakota included, continue to place the major responsibility for public school support on local property taxation and to rely on local initiative for developing an efficient system of school district organization. This document reports the results of an investigation into the quality of the education and the taxation system in South Dakota, and offers recommendations for citizen consideration. Committee members visited a representative sample of 25 school districts and  utilized prepared data forms that elicited data on instructional practices, instructional facilities, pupil personnel services, innovations, special programs, pupil population, and staff characteristics. Two major recommendations asked that a concerted effort be made among citizens to reexamine the educational objectives of the State and that the State Department of Public Instruction and allied professional organizations strengthen their commitment to research and development as a means to assist in the improvement of public education.

Channels were established for referral of applicable visually handicapped preschool children to the program. Selected preschools for children other than visually handicapped children agreed to admit visually handicapped children and received supportive services to handle the visually handicapped child. Where needed, an itinerant teacher visited the homes of preschool visually handicapped children. For each of the 28 children involved in the study, the birthdate, diagnosis, vision, referral, and services rendered were reported. The Social  Maturity Scale for Blind Preschool Children (Maxfield and Buchholz, 1957) was the standardized evaluation tool used in many cases. Although success was thought to be intuitively apparent in various cases, the complexity of the children's problems precluded definitive measurements of progress in all cases. Appended were four reports by an instructional aide, two mobility students, and a nursery school teacher of their experiences in working with the preschool visually handicapped children. (CB)",

A short review of literature concerned with group work with the retarded precedes a detailed account of the group behavior techniques used with four groups of retarded boys. The establishment of the group as a team of workers in the citrus fields was outlined, and the importance of physical education for the retarded was developed as it applied to the Israeli program. In an attempt for the retardates to  gain admission to the open labor market as farm employees, attitudes of prospective employers in the rural area were surveyed. A followup study focused on the group relationships of the retardates after they had completed the initial research project. The second part of the report concerned a group discussion of the four group instructors and the chief investigator, in which all aspects of the program were analyzed in a conversational manner.

Jules Abrams first examines the relationship of emotional and personality maladjustments to reading difficulty. Then Clifford Kolson advocates the promotion of informal reading and the proper diagnosis of a child's reading level. A discussion of practical approaches for classroom instruction by Winton Buddington is based on the premise that the rate of practical application in the classroom is not tied to intelligence level or academic learning capacity. He advocates placing the child at the correct achievement and expectancy level, encouraging the child to learn at his own rate, and promoting both individual and paired learning. Motivation techniques covered briefly by  William Davis are encouragement of a positive attitude in the child, teacher assessment of emotional problems, use of school crisis room, behavior modification, and development of better comprehension. The last paper by Joan Hyman and Gita Kornfeld focuses upon special strategy for high intensity learning based on the research finding that many reading problems result from improper teaching. (CB)",

It is concluded that, instead of determining whether the primary handicap in dyslexic children is perceptual, linguistic, or both, findings suggest that the nature of the handicap will vary largely as a function of chronological age.

Control subjects were trained with a preferred dimension relevant, the others (flexibility subjects), with a nonpreferred dimension relevant. Combinations were replicated factorially to assess transfer involving the same dimensions as those used in training, or transfer involving novel dimensions. Dimensions used were color, angular-orientation, form, and spatial-configuration. Flexibility acquired in the two-choice simultaneous-discriminations generalized to the matching-to-sample task and was independent of the  stimulus dimensions used in training. At the beginning of training, subjects' discrimination learning performance was affected by dimension preferences; at the end of training, performance of flexibility-trained subjects was unaffected by dimension preferences.

Attrition after 3 years reduced the experimental group to 35 adolescents. After a normal school day, the students participated in programs on the various arts. An expression of creative values by students, their families, nationally recognized artists, federal government, local community, and governmental agencies was said to characterize the program. Although the students concentrated in a specific chosen area, they were  encouraged to explore other art areas. Several testing techniques were used to measure the creativity of the students. In general, participants were found to gain in ideational, fluency, flexibility, originality, elaboration and inventive level compared to pretest scores. The participants experienced significantly more community cultural programs than did the control group. An interesting result was said to be the finding that the male subjects became more sensitive to the aesthetics in life. (CB)",

The language inventory was administered to 160 trainable mentally handicapped children, aged 6 1/2 to 10 years old. Based on the research findings, some tentative conclusions were drawn. The stimulus response subtest seemed to be too easy for most children. Little or no increase of mean  scores was found for the chaining objects and chaining actions subtest. More complex tasks were needed on the motor imitation, vocal imitation, chaining objects, and chaining actions subtests to differentiate between the 8-6 and 9-6 age groups. Administration of the language inventory to 5-year-olds might be helpful. The size of subtest intercorrelations was found to increase with presentation of more complex types of learning. (CB)",

        "description":"The longitudinal study assessed the psychological and educational sequelae of premature birth through the early elementary school years, to determine whether children born prematurely constitute a high risk population in terms of regular school progress. Subjects included 78 children with birth weights of 2500 grams or less, 78 children of normal birth weight whose gestation periods were 37 weeks or less, and 85 controls whose birth weights were greater than 2500 grams and gestation periods greater than 37 weeks. Measures included a 4-month neurological exam, 8-month psychological exam, 12-month neurological exam, 4-year intelligence test, 5-year school readiness test and ITPA, and teacher reports from the ages of 7-11 years. Results indicated that birth weight rather than  gestational age is the major predictor of psychological and educational impairment. Subjects low in both birth weight and gestational age evidence an initial disadvantage which was gradually dissipated, with small-for-date subjects eventually showing greater psychological and educational disability than those who were low on both indices.

Twenty-six deaf children of normal intelligence but deficient in language as determined by reading achievement level, ages 10-13 years, were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Experimental treatment consisted of participation in 30 30-minute sessions of science inquiry, structured toward the development of classification skills and based on physical manipulation of objects to discover relationships. Pre and posttesting with the Goldstein-Sheerer Object Sorting Test measured categorization level. The experimental subjects demonstrated a significant change in the level of categorization  used, indicating that sensory experience, rather than language attainment, was the critical factor in the development of categorization.

In machine controlled training, adaptive logic performs a function analogous to that performed by a skilled operator.&quot; This study looks at the ways in which gain-effective time constant product, system compensation, and forcing function amplitude compare as adaptive variables, in terms of trainee performance, and at the differences in trainee performance between machine controlled and manual adaptation for the above variables. Eight independent groups, including one control group, were tested under different methods of training. Principal results show that manual adaptation is slightly superior to automatic adaptation,  although this could be a function of the difference in performance measurement levels. Gain-effective time constant product is slightly superior to forcing function amplitude as an adaptive variable. System compensation, as implemented for this experiment, is not a satisfactory adaptive variable. Nor are aiding and quickening. (JK)",

The subjects, 80 eighth-graders, were shown two operations--laying out solid objects and zooming in on details--in experimental conditions using either films or slides. Results confirmed that the internalization of schematic filmic codes is possible and leads to improved performance on related transfer tasks and ability tests and that low aptitude subjects, in particular, improved their ability to  use the operations as covert mental skills.

In the remedial model, the instructor attempts to provide some missing, but necessary building-block of knowledge, by identifying a specific deficit. In the compensatory model deficiencies are not corrected, but circumvented so that subsequent learning may take place. The third model involves preferential treatment which seeks to capitalize on other  talents of the students to countervail any learning deficit. (RB)",

These are: a trend toward multi-disciplined approach to achieve specific learning objectives through field testing; a trend toward the development of more complex, multimedia, expensive equipment, materials, and systems; and a trend toward programs designed to facilitate individualized instruction. Most of the present instructional systems, however, are developed by a team consisting of a few subject matter specialists, writers, and editorial people organized and funded by an educational publisher. Development costs for such a system may run $200,000, even without systematic evaluation in the field. Present business strategies and the present pattern of federal funding tend to hinder rather  than help the development of new instructional systems. Business strategies call for selling more of the presently developed material rather than pursuing new ones; the federal funding pattern has tended to be hit-or-miss without effective leadership or control. Progress toward more effective instructional technology might be made if the federal government funded a company willing to undertake the development of a specific instructional system to the point at which a significant number of school systems voluntarily elect to use the system at local expense.

However, people require extensive exposure to auditory patterns before achieving a high level of performance. In an attempt to discover a method of training people to recognize auditory patterns in an expeditious fashion, fifteen methods of teaching identification of complex sonar-like sounds were compared. These included whole and part methods in which subjects were trained on samples of whole sounds, received pre-training on components of the sounds, or were exposed to components in the context of whole sounds. The conditions included variations in the order in which training items were presented and in the  kinds of verbal instruction given. Overall, the various part methods were not superior to training on whole sound items. The best of the part methods drew attention to only one feature of the whole sound. Some systematic orders of presentation showed no advantage over random order presentation. Verbal instruction drawing attention to cues and their value in classification did not prove effective. Among the various combinations of training procedures and state-of-the-art training techniques, the critical ingredient seems to be amount of exposure to instances of the recognition classes to be learned.

The first 18 months of the project (until fall of 1969) was spent in curriculum development activities. A full-year trial of the materials provided feedback for course revision and blocking of exercises into units. During the school year 1970-71 the Consortium worked on a major evaluation effort, dissemination activities, and polishing the curriculum materials in general mathematics and algebra. The predominant theme for the curriculum was teacher-monitored  independent study for each student. Two main types of material composed the individual study curriculum: an \"on-line\" or computer-mediated component involving student/content interaction at the computer terminal and an \"off-line\" component consisting of self-study in a variety of modes, such as workbooks, filmstrips, puzzles, games, and textbooks. Both the general mathematics and the algebra material was designed to appeal to urban youth. The course development, summative evaluation, and a cost analysis of the system are presented along with summaries of the courses and the materials prepared for them. (JY)",

Improved materials are urgently needed because of growing demand for individualized learning and teacher accountability. Schools now are forced to use inadequately verified material because that is all that is available. It is estimated that 99 percent of the materials school children now use have not been put through even the initial phases of the learner-verification and revision cycle. This happens partly because schools select material without demanding information about such verification. It is probable that the material currently produced could be revised to meet the learner-verification criteria with only  minor changes. There is an urgent need for a set of realistic guidelines to help product developers institute a program of verification and revision and for a set of guidelines to assist schools in selecting instructional material.

After instruction all students were retested on the 51 skills. The experimental group's average skill's gain was significantly higher than the control group's.

        "description":"Since cassette recordings are used to teach foreign languages, why not also use them to teach English? This study tested the use of tape cassette messages to criticize student papers. One group of students in beginning freshman English classes heard tape recorded criticisms of their papers; another group served as a control. Overall, it was found that the cassettes did not improve writing skills. One instructor did obtain much greater improvement with cassette groups, but for all classes the groups without cassettes averaged the greatest improvement. However, those students who were in the cassette groups rated cassette criticisms either as extremely more effective or more effective than other techniques. The results of this study suggest that criticizing writing by using  cassettes might result in greater improvement in writing skills for students of some teachers, and that more research should be done in this area.

Chapter One of the report provides an overview of the  project and a description of its rationale. Chapters Two, Three, and Four provide a brief discussion of the content and evaluation of each of the three multimedia sets of materials already developed. The next eight chapters describe plans for future simulations and provide information on the objectives of the simulations projected, their rationales, and their various components. Two chapters describing work achieved thus far in developing support materials basic to the use of simulations conclude the report. (Author/SH)",

A randomized posttest only control group experimental design was employed in a school related concept formation task. A lack of practical differences in performance was found. The resulting similar effects across grade level suggest that a common line drawing-halftone format and presentation strategy can be used over a wide variety of  student population, thus eliminating the expense of preparing separate visual materials for each grade level.

        "description":"The growth of cable television (CATV) will be limited unless present copyright practices are changed. The Federal Communication Commission opposes CATV's importation of distant signals because CATV is exempt from copyright liability. Now, almost all television programs are sold on the basis of long-term territorial exclusivity, which provides that the buyer has sole rights in his area to the program for a specified length of time. In most cases, cable cannot outbid the major broadcasters for programs. Thus there are four basic choices for cable policy: 1) abolish distant signal restrictions with no imposition of copyright liability; 2) abolish or restrict exclusives; 3) subject copyright owners to a compulsory license requirement, making their programs available for cable use at  a regulated fee; and 4) impose full copyright liability and limit cable's market penetration. Of these, the second is most preferable. Exclusivity does not maximize copyright revenues. It is used mainly as a barrier against new stations entering the market for programs. Limiting exclusives benefits the growth of new stations and also benefits the public, who have a chance to see a program at more than one time slot. (JK)",

The overview serves as an introduction to the six studies and summarizes their emphases and findings. In the first study, Gerbner analyzes and compares the programming of 1969 with that of 1967 and 1968, dealing with the quantity and quality of violence. In the second study, Clark and Blankenburg examine violence on TV and match their results against various measures of environmental violence. Greenberg and Gordon obtained data on what is perceived as violence in the third study, and Cantor discusses the factors  influencing the selection of content for children's programs for the fourth study. In the fifth study, Baldwin and Lewis report on how top professionals responsible for producing adult drama perceive their role in regard to violent content. The final study consists of reports of four social scientists on TV violence in the United States, Great Britain, Israel, and Sweden. (Author/SH)",

After an overview, eight research projects are reported. They range from general studies of national samples to studies which focus either on specific subpopulations or on audiences for specific types of programs. Findings of the several studies include that television has become more interwoven into our lives, but its hold on our attention has perhaps been reduced; that  the public has become more critical of the medium, especially of commercials; that heavy versus light viewing of television per se no longer discriminates among children the way it did in the 1959 study of Schramm, Lyle, and Parker; that television is more likely to be used to fill time that would otherwise be used for generally \"nonconstructive\" activities; that there is learning from television; and that viewing of violent programs tends to increase according to the amount of viewing done in the company of parents.

All of these models include actions that fall into the categories of problem definition and organization, systems analysis and development, and system  evaluation. These actions are interrelated by feedback built into the model. Each of the different systems approaches, while addressing the same task in similar ways, perform with different descriptions and language.

To accomplish this task, the teams perform \"experiments\" on a hypothetical school system simulated by the computer. When the team has decided on the best solution, they enter their decision into the computer, which then operates the entire hypothetical system for a year, and generates a \"payoff matrix\" comprised of the year-end mean values for a large set of dependent variables and the total additional cost  imposed on the system by operating under that decision for one year. These values are than used to declare a winner for the game and to illustrate the relative efficacies of the analytic strategies used by the various teams. (Author:JY)",

The dual representation of linguistic information that is implied by paraphrase is important for storing information that has been received and for transmitting information that has been stored. Such duality implies a process of recoding that is somehow constrained by a grammar. Grammar is seen as a set of complex codes that relates transmitted sound and stored meaning. This paper considers the construction characteristics of the speech code which unites the acoustic signal for transmission and the phonetic representation appropriate for storage in short-term memory. The speech code in terms of memory research is  then considered with speculation on the construction of the memory code. (Author/VM)",

(1) A formal assignment may be the result of any type of educational activity, provided that there is sufficient tangible evidence of study which can be assessed by tutors and be available for moderation by an external examiner at the end of the course. (2) Each student with his tutor analyses and discusses the merit and failings of his assignment in regular individual tutorials with the overt aim of personal intellectual development. (3)  Students know beforehand on what specific work they are to be assessed and usually are expected to contribute to the definition of the assignment.

The decrease in federal funding has been directly responsible for the standstill in net employment in government and national laboratories and in nonfaculty research positions. The recession-inflation must be held accountable for the reduction in growth of physics faculties well below the needs to meet increased enrollment. The 2 factors together are probably responsible for the reduction in industrial employment. Some short-range actions may help to alleviate these unemployment problems: (1) new opportunities must be found for physicists; (2) programs to increase the involvement of the physics  community in industry must be stimulated; (3) the physics community should be informed of the present situation as quickly as possible; (4) a placement service should be created to advertise job openings; (5) physics departments should tighten their standards for the Ph.D.; (6) physics departments must reexamine their training programs, especially for careers for which few employment opportunities exist; and (7) those financial inducements should be reduced that channel students into fields of little employment potential.

In this vein, 3 goals were established as being of primary importance: (1) to provide equal opportunity for and equal access to higher education for all citizens, regardless of color or class, insofar as they can benefit from it; (2) to eliminate racial dualism in higher education across the Southeast; and (3) to assume  major responsibility for eliminating white racism, both in educational institutions and in society at large. Other problems were also discussed at the conference ranging from public support of and confidence in higher education, to developing student potential for leadership roles.

The underlying rationale of this financing plan is to give the greatest help to institutions that enroll students from those states that are making the largest efforts in support of education. The federal government would provide general assistance directly to institutions of postsecondary education through a financing program that is tied to the students enrolled. To receive its general assistance dollars, an institution would have to report only the number of students it has enrolled from each state. The federal government would then multiply these enrollment figures by the grant associated with students from each  state. The dollars resulting from this calculation would then be given directly to the reporting institution. A separate 20-page synopsis of the plan is included with the report. (Author/HS)",

        "description":"New York State's public and private colleges and universities have been confronted in recent years with increasing problems of financing the growth of the educational system as required by expanding enrollments. Even without enrollment growth and the need for new facilities and larger operating budgets, increasing costs and slower growth of income have made it difficult for the institutions to operate on a fiscally sound basis with their present commitments. The financial problems differ in nature and scope in the public and private sectors and there are differences also in the plight of the City University of New York versus that of the State University of New York; there are differences as well among the diverse institutions comprising the private sector. Such differences  should not obscure the fact that the health and welfare of all are at stake and that new methods of financing both institutions and students are needed. The papers comprising this document present: (1) a comparison of 4-year public and private institutions; (2) trends and projections of enrollments and facilities of the institutions; (3) the financial situation of the public institutions; and (4) the financial situation of the private institutions.

Ironically, it has also witnessed the emergence of serious difficulties that threaten the survival of some of these institutions and create anxieties for almost all of them. The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education was created to make a systematic appraisal of higher education and to suggest guidelines for its continuing development.

It has been estimated that the total body of human knowledge doubles every 15 years; this fact creates the problem of developing and perfecting new approaches to education that keep pace with that knowledge. In light of these and other factors, this report makes recommendations to the Commission for Higher Education in Connecticut to alleviate the burden of future problems. Included are recommendations for the creation of a management information system in Connecticut, the formation of consortia among institutions in the State, and an increase of financial assistance to students enrolled in the independent colleges and  universities in the State.

In 1968 there were only 8.2 practicing veterinarians for every 100,000 New Englanders--5 fewer than the national average, and less than half as many as will be needed by the end of the present decade. The major problem arises from the fact that there has been no college of veterinary medicine in the New England states since 1947, and New Englanders applying for admission to colleges in other areas of the country are more often than not turned down because of in-state-preference admission procedures. It is therefore the proposal of this report that the 6 New England states should join forces and provide a college of veterinary medicine for the region. (HS)",

As a result, for the first time since the survey was begun in 1956, corporate giving to education declined. Virtually all of the decrease in educational support in 1970 is accounted for by the industries which sustained the greatest slump in pre-tax net income. The overall decrease in educational contributions, however, was small compared to the drop in corporate profits, and there was increased giving by many companies whose earnings experience went counter to the national trend. This is taken to be positive evidence of a continuing commitment on the part of the  corporate community and a recognition of the many benefits that it derives from educational institutions.

Investments in successively higher levels of education, however, have yielded successively lower rates of return, and rates of return on investments in college education have varied greatly by major program of study. In the late 1940's a projection was made that there would soon be more college graduates than jobs for them in their fields. This statement was denied as time took its course.

As a general rule, colleges and universities should not prosecute students for acts subject to prosecution in courts, except where the student's acts are clearly threatening to the institution's existence, or inimical to its educational functions, processes, and objectives. Where necessary, colleges and universities can apply sanctions against students who have been charged or convicted in the courts for the same acts, without violating the state or federal constitutions. However, discipline should not be carried out capriciously in  violation of the due process requirements of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. University discipline that automatically follows civil court decisions is unreasonable and unjust. Automatic discipline violates the double-jeopardy concept held by the \"man on the street,\" a concept which may be eventually embraced by the courts. (Author/HS)",

The use of discriminant analysis to establish differential enrollment probabilities is also explored. Although different models do a better job for different curricular departments, the smallest mean squared across all departments was obtained with the simplest projection technique. Based on the results obtained at this one institution,  therefore, it would appear that simple and straightforward projection models can be useful as complex and sophisticated models. (Author/HS)",

Five predictor variables were established: undergraduate GPA; undergraduate business concentration GPA; total, quantitative, and qualitative scores on the ATGSB; graduation versus withdrawal; and overall graduate GPA. The results of the study show that undergraduate GPA and undergraduate business concentration GPA are the most effective success predictors. The ATGSB, however, proved to  be the least effective predictor, and little support can be given to the continued use of this test as one of the admission criteria. (Author/HS)",

This report takes into account veterinary medical education in the U.S. as a whole, the veterinary population of Florida, the estimated need for veterinarians nationally and in Florida, the licensure characteristics of various health professions, the activities of other states with regard to the veterinarian shortage, an analysis of the alternatives to the creation of a veterinary college, and a proposed program and estimated costs for the creation of a  veterinary college. Unfortunately, none of the alternatives to starting a new school in Florida show promise at this time of making a significant contribution to Florida's shortage. On the other hand, financing a new college presents an even greater problem. Without considerable aid from the Federal government, the construction of a college of veterinary medicine will be virtually impossible. (HS)",

        "description":"Institutions of higher education presently and in the future will be confronted with the problem of offering diversified programs to the students they are supposed to serve. All institutions are becoming more and more alike due to a one-sided emphasis on increased enrollment rather than accommodating that priority to increased program quality. A possible solution to this problem is the creation of cluster and upper division colleges. Each type of college would offer the atmosphere of a small college but would, at the same time, offer the variety of resources available at larger institutions. Another major benefit is a small college atmosphere, which encourages experimentation and offers alternatives to traditionalism as a means of combating the homogenization of higher education.  The cluster college and upper division patterns of organization have yet to be thoroughly evaluated, and they deserve serious consideration by higher education planners. (HS)",

        "description":"Much concern has been shown over possible defects in small college preparation of science majors. This paper presents data from a large-scale longitudinal survey of 1961 graduates that has a direct bearing on the relation of graduate school success to undergraduate origins. Results of the survey show that university-trained science majors are only slightly better than those from small colleges. Except for initial enrollment, chemistry majors from small schools seem to be at some disadvantage if their colleges were not particularly good or if they had mediocre records. Under these circumstances, they were less likely to enroll on a continuous basis, to plan to take the Ph.D., and to expect to take a relatively short time getting that degree if they planned to take it. For biology  and physics majors only the rate of continuous enrollment was lower. In nonscientific fields college type had generally small or inconsistent effects. In nearly all fields and for most outcomes, high undergraduate academic performance was a strong predictor of graduate success. (Author/HS)",

How do dropout rates vary by type of institution? In what ways do dropouts and nondropouts differ? What factors in the college environment affect the student's chances of dropping out? How much difference does the student's ability make? How important are background factors such as sex, race, and parental background? The data were obtained from students attending a representative sample of 217 institutions, including 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges, and universities. The major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) national dropout rates seem to be somewhat lower  than has been suggested in other recent reports; (2) dropout rates at 2-year colleges are somewhat higher than those at 4-year colleges; (3) the major predictors of persistence are the student's grades in high school and his scores on tests of academic ability; and (4) using predictors of the student's persistence in a multiple regression equation, it is possible to compute an expected persistence rate at individual colleges.

Indeed, it is now the subject of intensive study and debate on individual campuses, in legislative and executive bodies, and by national commissions. This paper takes into account the functions of higher education, some possible approaches to reform, and measures that may be taken to lighten the burden on higher education. In summary, it is apparent that the higher educational system in this country performs a wide range of functions that have enormous economic and social value. It is also obvious that public expenditure on higher education is a national bargain and not the extravagance many people believe it to be. Finally, it is clear that  reform, given the nature of present national dependence on higher education, will have to involve the entire society and will entail the invention of ways to relieve higher education of some of its burdens and lighten others. An understanding and acceptance of these propositions seem necessary to any concerted movement toward fundamental reform. (Author/HS)",

Among these results are: (1) there was significantly less disillusion and more end-of-freshman-year satisfaction with faculty, courses, advisers, and graduation requirements; (2) freshmen became more liberal and socially concerned under the new curriculum; (3) new-curriculum sophomores were better adapted to thinking introversion, theoretical orientation, complexity, and autonomy;  (4) new-curriculum sophomores felt that they were better adjusted and less anxious than the old-curriculum sophomores; and (5) new-curriculum freshmen scored higher on English achievement, relative to their high school senior scores, than the old-curriculum group.

To this end, a total of 799 students were tutored by competent upper-division students during the 1970-71 academic year in the fields of English, mathematics, social science, and science. Results show that this method is a relatively effective means for raising achievement levels of a substantial number of freshmen and/or sophomores in certain required courses. Students predicted lowest in achievement appeared to profit least from tutoring, or did not take advantage of it. Those predicted in the average range appeared to profit most from tutoring and participated most. The numbers of freshmen  placed on probation or suspension during 1970-71 were reduced as compared to the corresponding semesters of 1969-70. Individual attention and relative motivation are suspected to be contributing factors in higher achievement levels. (Author/HS)",

This study set out to evaluate the feasibility of such an approach by developing model courses in mathematics and literature. The models were used experimentally in the summer of 1971. Students began with pretests which measured their knowledge in each course; then they were directed to and through the instructional units they needed. The results show that students accepted the plan enthusiastically, that most students not only finished the courses but  finished with generally higher scores than are made in typical beginning courses, that the system is so economically efficient that average course costs were less than $13 a credit hour, and that instructors were able to devote more time to individual needs.

Other major efforts were to initiate discussion regarding communication between different educational levels; the nature and value of awarded certificates; the possibility of using television, radio, and postal services for instructional purposes; and the concept of post-secondary institutions offering a wide variety of  courses. The main part of the report consists of a review of post-secondary educational institutions and their role. Such areas as admissions, distribution of students in morning and evening courses, geographical distribution of institutions, program potential, and the role of teachers are discussed. Tables of descriptive statistics relating to Israeli education in general as well as post-secondary education are appended. (AL)",

The report consists of a definition of a community college, an overview of existing public 2-year institutions in the state and a series of recommendations. In order to bring the separately administered technical education centers and lower-division university branches of the state under unified statewide control and planning, the prime recommendation of the committee is to establish a new state board to govern all 2-year institutions. The board would be responsible for: (1) developing a planned system by dividing  the state into districts according to population data; (2) establishing a policy for the creation of local boards of trustees in each district; (3) determining minimum standards for instructional programs and graduation requirements; (4) overseeing the hiring practices and capital expenditures of the local boards as well as determining the maximum fee and tuition levels that they may charge; (5) authorizing the awarding of certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees; and (6) participating in various federal aid programs for public 2-year institutions. Alternative recommendations that could have more immediate implementation are also presented along with a summary of past recommendations, demographic and enrollment data, descriptions of existing physical facilities, and a summary of the  present financial structure.

A semantic differential research instrument discriminating between faculty holding &quot;more favorable&quot; and &quot;less favorable&quot; attitudes was administered along with a background questionnaire to 700 full-time Illinois public community college faculty in eight randomly selected colleges. Data analysis was based upon the factor scores of evaluation, potency, and receptivity. Interpretation of the results led to the conclusion that the most appropriate faculty to teach these students are (1) females with lower-class precollege backgrounds, and those (2) having less than a Bachelor's degree, (3)  agreeing with the role of the community college, (4) having less than one year of community college teaching experience, (5) considering their main function to teach general education, (6) wanting to participate in the study of disadvantaged students, and (7) willing to take in -service training for teaching disadvantaged students.

In determining the ratio, all respondents were asked to include only that portion of a counselor's time devoted to individual and group counseling. So that all colleges were using the same criteria, each was asked to use the number of day-graded students as reported to the state, and divide this number by the number of full-time equivalent counselors to determine the ratio. A distinction was made between colleges on the quarter or semester systems. Additional observations from the study concerned the trend toward the use of more full-time counselors, a distribution of the number of hours in a normal work week for full-time counselors,  the type of counseling availability--whether by appointment or &quot;walk-in,&quot; the amount of time spent with each client, and the trend toward greater use of paraprofessionals.

This proposal suggests that three major obstacles must first be dealt with: financing, personnel acceptance and time allocation of staff. The central guidance coordinating institution should be the community college with the secondary schools becoming associates. The community college guidance program should serve as the focus and resource center for associated schools. Three functions of the community college guidance staff should be  to: (1) maintain complete occupational information; (2) coordinate student programs to smooth the transition from high school to community college; and (3) act as a resource or referral agency for students with emotional problems. The secondary school counselor should be a consultant to the community college guidance personnel by advising them on the particular needs of entering students. (MN)",

There the student can master the course objectives at his own rate and with the help of a variety of instructional aids. Advantages of this program include: (1) the students using the labs were not segregated from other students; (2) the lab students were given a clear diagnosis of their learning problems and the  measurable objectives which they had to master; and (3) lab students received academic credit toward their graduation rather than having to take non-credit &quot;remedial&quot; courses. In general, students using the labs, either for one term or for the whole first year, had higher GPA's at the end of the year.

Although it is possible to trace the history of Malaysia's libraries back to the first millenium of the Christian era, there are few written records pre-dating World War II. The lack of documentation on the early periods of library history creates an emphasis on developments in the modern period. This is not out of order since it is only recently that libraries in West Malaysia and Singapore have been recognized as one of the important media of mass education. Lack of funds, failure to recognize the importance of libraries, and problems caused by the federal structure of government are  blamed for this delay in development. Hinderances to future development are the lack of trained librarians, problems of having to provide material in several different languages, and the lack of national bibliographies, union catalogs and lists of serials.

These would be interconnected in a regional network, linked in its turn to the world network. The result would be the creation of channels for rapid flows of information, by virtue of which the adoption of political, economic and social decisions, both at the national and at the regional and subregional levels,  could be properly based on a solid groundwork of data. From a practical point of view, it might be a good idea in Latin America's case to organize two networks: one specializing in economic and social information and another specializing in the fields of science and technology.

It was attended by participants from 23 African countries as well as from a number of other Member States and international organizations. The meeting was part of a long-range programme adopted by Unesco to assist developing countries to take advantage of the striking advances in printing, publishing and distribution techniques that have made it possible to produce and distribute good quality low-priced books on a vast scale. The Accra meeting recognized that Africa's book shortage was a severe impediment to economic and social progress. Accordingly, they established regional targets for book development to 1980, correlated to Africa's educational  plans to that date. The economic context of book development was highlighted in a paper presented by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, which is included in this publication, together with the final report of the meeting.

Plans to achieve these goals are given. The second annual report includes the design of five major subsystems: (1) a shared cataloging system, (2) a remote catalog access and circulation control system, (3) a bibliographic information retrieval project, (4) a serials control system and (5) a major technical processing system that will computerize most of library processing. The third annual report discusses the implementation of these five subsystems.  The foremost accomplishment reported in the fourth annual report was the implementation of the shared cataloging system. (Author/NH)",

Students, particularly those in the General College, have had great difficulty obtaining information concerning academics, transportation, sports, cultural events, or merely a telephone number. The present services are inadequate for various reasons. They are scattered, overburdened, incomplete and often overlapping. The problem has been aggravated by the recent growth in the size of the student body. The reorganization and coordination of the present system would render information more accessible and its dissemination more efficient. The following report is intended to study the existing services, discuss the problems encountered with these  services, and offer some proposals for solutions.

The user's judgement of the extent to which the collections met his needs is the only parameter of assessment. Museum curators, the bulk of whose time is spent in research, were asked how well the collections met their needs. Also examined were the resources actually utilized by the curators in their research work, and their participation in and perception of the library material selection process. The study was designed to provide information for policy making, but the implications which are drawn must be considered tentative since only the user's point of view is covered. A more complete  analysis must also consider the perspectives of librarians and administrators of the Smithsonian Institution. (Author/SJ)",

Communication models indicate that a source can usually communicate more effectively in the presence of feedback from relevant receivers on their comprehension of the messages. Another problem of interest to communicators is that of assessing audience preferences and selection behavior and relating these to those of editors, broadcast programmers and other mass communication gatekeepers. The many agencies whose major function is to facilitate fruitful social and economic changes are involved in the problem of developing research to assist directly in planning communication strategies.  Generally, it is argued that more can be learned about communication processes by making the research methods more appropriate to the theories. It is believed that some fascinating aspects of communication can be discovered by making up theoretically relevant communication games. (NH)",

The Institution library carries out these objectives and functions by providing: (1) informal adult education through guidance, counseling, and planned reading courses geared to the needs and abilities of  each individual; (2) materials supplementary to the work of and useful to the psychologist, the educational program, and all other divisions and staff members of the institution to whom library resources in and outside of the institution may be of value and (3) contacts with good library service which will accustom the individual to library usage as an essential in post-institution life.

The primary purpose of the series is to promote the utilization of research findings by those who make policy and those who administer programs in the fields of child health and welfare. In the discussion, the major developmental needs of infants and young children were identified, and some of the problems in attempting to meet those needs through residential group care were described. Some of the major developmental needs of all infants and children discussed in this report are: (1) affection from a person of emotional significance, (2) continuity of care by that person, (3) adequate perceptual and cognitive stimulation  mediated by interested and loving human beings, (4) involvement in the world of adults, and (5) continuing help with the unavoidable problems implicit in emotional development. It was decided that institutions can be staffed and operated in such a way as to meet two of these needs: affectionate care and stimulating experiences. It was also agreed that institutional care should be regarded as a last resort, to be used only if adoption, foster family care, or satisfactory maintenance of the child in his own home cannot be arranged.

The point is made that child care arrangements made by many working mothers among the disadvantaged minority groups are often inadequate. The environment for the proper development of the children of the disadvantaged is often of poor quality and even harmful. In recognition of the need to improve this situation, a Federal  Panel on Early Childhood was established.

The major finding was that the variable of maternal intelligence was the best single predictor of the level and character of intellectual development in the offspring. The survey also showed that the lower the maternal IQ, the greater the probability of offspring scoring low on intelligence tests. A longitudinal, prospective investigation was made of the determinants of the kind of retardation which perpetuates itself from parent to child in the \"slum-dwelling\" family. Using maternal IQ as a basis for selection of a group of newborns, comprehensive intervention in the social environment was undertaken with 40 newborns of mentally retarded mothers (IQ less than 70). The  objective of this intervention was to displace all of the presumed negative factors in the social environment of the infant. The age range of the children was about one year, with the oldest being about four years. Results showed that the experimental children at 42 months surpassed the control group on the order of 33 IQ points, and had a learning capacity surpassing that anticipated. It is hoped that the data may prove that it is possible to prevent mental retardation in children reared by parents who are both poor and limited in ability. Nine figures illustrate the study. (DB)",

        "description":"Three basic issues of day care licensing are dealt with in this paper. These are: (1) Should day care licensing be statutority separate from other child care licensing programs? (2) Where should day care licensing be administratively located? and (3) How much of the safeguarding and upgrading of service can licensing carry in relation to possibly other regulatory programs that might be implemented? The study shows that the differential attitude towards the function of day care and day care licensing was forcibly brought out in a recent research program. It is concluded that as a cultural difference exists as to the function of day care licensing as compared to 24-hour foster care licensing, there would seem to be much operational valor in achieving separability. With respect to  the second issue, currently licensing responsibility is carried out mainly by state or state-local departments of public welfare. It is concluded that the possible assignment of day care licensing to state health departments is preferable if there is any possibility of health departments developing a dynamic division of maternal and child health. With respect to the third question, attention is called to accreditation programs under public or private (voluntary) auspices. The Child Welfare League of America is a good example of how a voluntary accreditation agency can go beyond the public licensing authority. It is concluded that a cooperative program in which the public agency licenceses a center and a private one goes beyond the minimum safeguards would be the best solution.

        "description":"Nonverbal behaviors in young children, including facial expressions, gesture, and body movement, were studied. Decision-making behaviors were viewed on a less intentional-intentional continuum ranging from beginning or pre-decision behavior which suggested little or no intent to middle or exploratory behaviors indicative of more intent to end behaviors which denoted strong intent or a child's absorption in or completion of a task. Subjects were University Nursery-Kindergarten children who were representative of each of the three age groups and were equally representative of both sexes. A Pilot and a Principal Study were conducted. An initial step in the Pilot Study was the development of the Pupil Nonverbal Category System. All observations were made during a free play period.  The following were noted: (1) the nonverbal behaviors exhibited, (2) the nature of any personal interaction, and (3) task completion or the ability to stay with a task for at least five minutes. The occurrence of nonverbal behaviors and the relationship of these behaviors to decision making and to interactions with other persons were analyzed and reported in terms of mean frequencies, percentages, and rankings. It was found that: (1) Frequency of behaviors varied with age and sex; (2) With respect to nonverbal behaviors, the majority of beginning points were observed in the Task Oriented category; the majority of middle points in Focusing Seeking; and the majority of end points in Withdraw. It is recommended that more than one observer should study a child and nonverbal behaviors be  recorded separate from decision-making behaviors. (Author/CK)",

It set out to sensitize them to the two cultures, so that they could cope with both; it also set out to structure what the teachers taught and to generalize how they taught, so that the students could cope with the school situation. The basic heuristic of the curriculum is to find the inherent and make them pervasive like growing veins in the organism. It is what the curriculum considers inherent and what the curriculum has done with the inherent that will characterize  the assumptions reviewed in this paper. These assumptions include: (1) Randomization of pupil participation assures individual attention for all members of the class; (2) Teaching technique affects learning ability; and (3) Teacher-student ratio affect learning progress.

The study tested and analyzed the hypothesis that there will be no significant difference in the posttest semantic differential mean scores among groups on the concept \"Self.\" Two experimental groups and one control group were used. A modified Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design was employed. The actual tutorial sessions were held 30 minutes per day, three days per week over a two-month period. The semantic differential was used to assess the self-concepts of the fifth-grade subjects, and a distinct, one-way analysis of variance was applied to test the null hypothesis. The results indicated that the  fifth-grade student tutors developed significantly different and more positive self-concepts. Factors that contributed to this result were that the student tutors were thoroughly trained in tutoring behaviors and procedures, given a well-defined set of tasks to accomplish, given demonstrations on how to employ the program materials, provided with opportunities to role play the part of the first grader and the fifth grader, informed as to the purposes and expected outcomes of the program, and directly involved in the evaluation process.

In Phase II, six task forces, comprised of experts from many disciplines involved in day  care licensing, met for a week and produced a set of coordinated models for day care licensing. The six models which emerged cover the following areas: legislation, zoning, fire safety and codes, health and sanitation, administration, and staffing and program requirements. These models are intended to be a basic framework for licensing day care facilities and are designed to improve the licensing process through a cohesive approach to reform of state and local care licensing.

The point is made that there are certain fundamental requirements and characteristics of children which every program must take into account. The most important of these basic needs include health and nutrition, security, freedom, structure, compassion, developmental differencies, and challenge. A day care program is responsible for the quality of service it delivers to its consumers. Program administrators have the responsibility of recruiting the best qualified staff who possess the necessary talent for the conduct of the programs. (CK)",

Chapter Two is designed to remind program developers of the practical problems involved in organizing and running a day care center, and offers some suggestions for dealing with these problems. Chapter Three again deals with the issues of day-to-day operation of a center for infants. Chapter Four offers suggestions for activities to carry out with infants of three age  levels: birth to one year, one year to two years, and two years to three years in six areas; language, gross motor development, fine motor development, self awareness, thinking, and social responsiveness and mastery. The Appendixes offer a list of information sources on day care and child development, a list of suggested equipment and supplies for an infant-toddler center, and a list of commercially available toys and books appropriate for children under three years of age.

These hypotheses were supported. A test was also made of Atkinson's recent prediction that performance will relate positively to summated motivation in the peer-competitive context but negatively to this variable in the adult-evaluative context. These predictions were partly supported, and the data were interpreted in terms  of the inverted U curve postulated to hold between discriminative behavior and total arousal. The summated motivation measure is a combination of need for achievement, defensiveness and test anxiety. (Author/DB)",

The comparison between nondistraction and distraction did not interact significantly with age, suggesting little developmental change in distractibility over this age range.

A further intent was that the taxonomy should distinguish what were reasonable objectives for children of differing socioeconomic (SES) levels and ethnic backgrounds, with particular reference to the advantaged (ADV) and disadvantaged (DADV) populations and to white (anglo), Negro, and other groups. To determine the feasibility of constructing such an empirical taxonomy, the studies were submitted to two kinds of analysis, the first at the close of the abstracting phase and the second at the close of the data summary phase. It can be inferred that research and development activities in early childhood have proceeded much too slowly to keep  pace with application demands. The real failure is less in the technology or theory of early childhood development than it is in the coordination of investigative efforts. This state of knowledge made impossible the accomplishment of the original highly differentiated empirical taxonomy. It was possible, nevertheless, by combining studies into grosser demographic subgroupings to prepare a substantial set of behavioral objectives in the psychomotor, cognitive, and affective domains for five year olds.

Women with varied incomes and education, both volunteer and paid, made 30-minute home visits twice weekly to help mothers become cognitive trainers of their own toddlers (starting at age two). Mother-child verbal interaction was stimulated with gifts of attractive, self-motivating materials, chosen because of their suitability to the child's developmental level, and their potential for verbal interaction when used in play between mother and child. Interveners, called Toy Demonstrators, guided mothers to use the Verbal Interaction Stimulus Materials (VISM) in an atmosphere that was spontaneous, relaxed, and most importantly, nondidactic. Most low income mothers seemed to welcome any  kind of cognitive intervention designed to help their children do well in school. Other mothers were resistant, yet appeared cooperative because it was difficult for them to make verbal refusals.

At the end of one year (October 1967 to May 1968) in the program, 33 low-income preschoolers made an average Stanford-Binet IQ gain of 17 points. The varibility within this group ranged from a gain of 33 points to a loss of 7 points. The average IQ gain for 26 similar children new to the program in the following year (October 1968 to May 1969) was approximately 11 points, with a variability ranging from a gain of 24 points to a loss of 4 points. The first group was divided, at the 17 mean point gain in IQ, into High Gainers and Low Gainers (from -7 to 8 points). The seven children who were identified as Low  Gainers evidenced a common pattern of verbally related behavior within the intervention itself, which appears to be characterized by social and cognitive immaturity and by a relatively frequent negative affective tone; six of the seven were also related by an indication of unhappiness in family relationships. It is felt that the factors, beside the program itself, which are associated with high and low cognitive gain, should be identified. Nine case studies of children in the first year of the program are given as illustrations. (DB)",

The toy demonstrator's duties consist of twice-weekly home visits to introduce and stimulate verablly oriented play between mother-child pairs using project toys and books. The toy demonstrator must attend a weekl y group conference to learn the verbal interaction techniques for each new toy or book. During this conference, the toy demonstrators evaluate toys or books used in previous home sessions. The VISIT (Verbal Interaction  Stimulation Techniques) approach used in the program has proven successful in stimulating low-income mothers and their preschool children to interact verbally in ways that benefit the child's later success in school.

Three groups of children, totalling 54, participated in the study from July 1967 through June 1968.

All groups received psychological testing before and after the seven-month experimental intervention period. The experiment and results confirmed the ability of the Mother-Child Home Program to raise significantly the initially low mean verbal and general IQ's of the children exposed to &quot;double intervention.&quot; The Toy Demonstrators used in this program  were trained and experienced social workers; however, nonprofessionals personnel were trained to assume Toy Demonstrator role. Two groups were given training--family agency volunteers, and women who had been mother-participants. The effects of using nonprofessionals have not been evaluated. (DB)",

The project was planned for the cognitive enrichment of preschoolers 2 to 4 years old, from lower income families. The program utilized specially trained home visitors, called Toy Demonstrators, who visited mother-child pairs twice weekly over two 7-month periods. The Toy Demonstrator presented the child with 28 toys and books, and stimulated verbally oriented play by acting as a model for the mother. The mother utilized the information in her interaction with the child to develop the potential for verbal interaction when they played with the toys and books. Results of the intervention method showed that it  was an effective agent for cognitive and verbal growth in the program children. The design, subjects, procedures, materials, data management, findings, and summary of findings are presented. The text is illustrated with 19 tables. Proposed plans for the third year of the project are presented along with projection of future research. Appendixes present the four data cards that are utilized in the program.

Project A was an attempt to identify the effectiveness of an intervention approach that involved the introduction into two classes of curricula in language, mathematics, motivation, and parent involvement. The analysis of the combined curriculum effects on motivation suggested that the procedures used to evaluate the results may need to be supplemented in future intervention attempts by a more precise and more curriculum-related approach. The specific purpose of Project B was to introduce the motivation curriculum into three classes and to provide evidence for its further and more comprehensive refinement. An evaluation of  the direct effects of the curriculum on motivational variables again suggested the advisability of supplementing future evaluations with a more exacting and curriculum-related approach. In Project C, an experimental version of a music curriculum for Head Start children was introduced into two classes by itself and into two classes in combination with a physical activities curriculum. An experimental test of music achievement did not reflect the effects of the curriculum relative to a control group. Project D consisted of the development and presentation of an experimental physical activities curriculum by itself in two classes and with the music curriculum. Results were inconclusive.

Objectives of the study were: (1) To measure the effect of four instructional modes on the performance of tasks which embodied certain musical concepts; (2) To measure the performance differences between age levels; and (3) To measure and evaluate young children's concepts of louder, faster, higher, and shorter as elicited by the measuring instrument. Two forms of a measuring instrument were developed. Each form contained several tests which measured a specific concept. Each test consisted of 20 items or tasks with each task displaying positive and negative instances of the concept. The subject was asked to identify the \"different,\" i.e. negative, instance of each set.  Two independent samples were drawn from public and parochial schools of Lincoln, Nebraska, and the surrounding region. Instructional modes used were designated discovery, verbal cue, verbal response, and motor response. There were significant differences in performance between tests which embodied different concepts. It was concluded that the level of performance is a function of the stimulus features of the task and the accessibility of the concept. Other conclusions are: (1) Performance on tasks is partly a function of age; and (2) There is usually no significant effect of the instructional mode when a concept is not readily available as in the case of higher. Further research is recommended. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The early development of wariness toward unfamiliar persons and novel objects is examined. Data are based upon the reactions of 32 infants who were repeatedly observed, over the age period 3 to 9 months, as they responded to the near approach of a stranger, and to a variety of new objects. Signs of wariness toward unfamiliar persons began to appear during the fourth month of life, and became increasingly frequent in the second half of the first year. In the second six months of life, the conditions of an encounter strongly affected the incidence of wariness provoked by the stranger (e.g., whether the infant was in mother's arms, or was picked up by the stranger), and by these ages various aspects of an infant's interpersonal history had begun to determine the quality of his  response. At all ages the novel objects promoted mainly exploratory interest, and only at 9 months did some minimal signs of wariness appear. Detailed consideration has been given to the parameters affecting reactions to the unfamiliar, including the temperament of the infant, the qualities of the unfamiliar stimulus, the nature of the encounter situation, and the age and experiential history of the infant. It is tentatively concluded that toward the latter part of the first year infants may be entering a period in which the quality of their environment is important in determining their future social orientation.

Three major areas were considered: the extent to which member schools implemented methodological and organizational changes, the established climate for change, and the extent to which project schools have moved toward implementation of the Oregon Board of Education objectives. Survey data were collected from all member schools regarding innovative practices. Additional data, particularly in the area of methodology, were collected by classroom observation and questionnaires in 20 randomly selected elementary and secondary schools (20% of member schools). It was found, for  example, that 22% of teachers' time was spent in teacher-oriented instruction (over 50% is average); students spent 25% of time on assignments with no fellow student or teacher interaction (may not be most productive); there was little use of media or the small group process; 80% of the students perceived that half or less of the instruction they received was related to their real concerns; a substantial amount of confidence between teachers and administrators was noted, but with some communication breakdown due to decisions generally made at the top producing some teacher resistance to organizational goals; the newsletter was comprehensive and widely read by staff; and program workshops were deemed of real value and were effective for information dissemination. It was recommended, for  example, that the director be allowed more school visitation time and that his priorities be reevaluated. Recommendations in each major area are considered. (MJB)",

Output of the processing included (1) a number of statistical measures, (2) complete concordance  giving sentence context, (3) a list of all the words in alphabetical order giving frequency and range, (4) a list of all the words in alphabetical order from the end of the word, (5) a frequency listing, and (6) a number of lists according to various spelling patterns. A concordance giving English loan words in the sample in the context of the sentence in which they occurred was also produced. It should be noted that word lists resulting from the study will be used as a filter in preparing reading material for 6-year-old Navajo children. The body of the report provides a description of the study; the appendix includes translated extracts of the interviews and samples of program output.

A first study on this topic was done in 1969. In the present study, data were obtained for 3,653 of the 4,645 children who were 6 years old in 1970. This study used a teacher questionnaire which was checked for reliability. Teachers having Navajo children in over 100 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools and public schools on or near the Navajo Reservation were asked to describe the language capability of the 6-year-old Navajo pupils. To estimate the validity of teachers' judgments, 194 children at 18 schools were further tested. Results showed that over 2/3 of Navajo children start school not knowing enough English to function in a classroom  using English. In BIA schools, this figure is 86%; in public schools, it is 51%. Comparison of 1970 results with 1969 results showed a very slight increase in amount of English that Navajo children know upon entering school.

        "author":["Spolsky, Bernard"],
        "description":"Two centers of diffusion of the English language are (1) schools on the Navajo Reservation and (2) off-Reservation towns; these diffusion centers were studied to examine factors involved in language shift, especially in terms of internal (on-Reservation) and external (off-Reservation) contacts with English. Teachers in schools with Navajo pupils on and near the Reservation filled out questionnaires rating language proficiency of Navajo 6-year-olds at the time school started in 1969 and 1970. The correlation of ease of access to a school with language maintenance was examined in terms of 2 types of schools: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools and public schools. Findings revealed that 6-year-olds coming to BIA schools tend to be speakers of Navaho who know a small amount of  English, while 6-year-olds coming to public schools are closer to being \"balanced\" bilinguals. A key factor in explaining this is the fact that public school children live much closer to school, the center of diffusion. To investigate how ease of access to an off-Reservation town influences a community's language maintenance, an accessibility index and an average language score for each school were calculated. It was found that the nearer a community is to an off-Reservation town, the more contact it has with English and the more likely parents are able to speak some English at home. The survey also looked at 2 specific communities (Rock Point and Lukachukai, Arizona) in terms of language diffusion.

Ten series of statements were utilized to represent aspects of school environment which would contribute to the following 10 areas of press: intellectual improvement, health and physical fitness, social relationships, moral and spiritual values, home-school relationships, vocational aspirations, civic responsibility, aesthetic appreciation, acceptance  and emotional security, and independence. Scores of the subjects on the 120 questions were subjected to factor analysis which yielded 10 rotated factors that accounted for approximately one-half of the variance. Comparisons were made between pupil responses by grade, ethnic group, sex, participation or nonparticipation in Title I programs, and ability group.

Children were assigned 10 to a cabin, and each child was guided and counseled by a cabin counselor. The camp program included hikes, catching and caging small animals, educational displays of natural history, fishing, cookouts, crafts, talent shows, social games, and dancing. Specific program objectives were to improve self-concepts, develop socialization, enhance cultural growth, improve camping skills, and improve recreational skills and safety practices by providing learning experiences in a natural setting. Self-concept was measured by a 9-item  questionnaire administered to a random sample of 124 campers on a pre- and post-basis. Essentially no change in self-concept was noted. Results of a camper-experience questionnaire revealed that 64% of the campers enjoyed the experience, 73% would like 4 weeks at camp, 91.9% enjoyed the food, and 44% experienced difficulty adjusting to the eating schedule. Over 90% gained in group responsibility, dining-hall etiquette, and personal hygiene. Cabin counselors reported, through a rating form, that program objectives were met. Questionnaire responses were returned by 72 staff members showing their feelings regarding the entire program. Specific objectives were deemed met, and program continuation was recommended.

Those students experiencing the most difficulty in adjusting to the school setting and thus most likely to be dropouts were interviewed, observed in class, and asked to tell stories about pictures depicting students, teachers, and parents interacting in a school setting. Stories told about these pictures revealed Mexican American value conflicts in terms of such factors as loyalty to family and ethnic group, female modesty, machismo, the role of education, and separation of sex roles.

        "description":"Three 1970-71 studies concerning the styles of instruction that lead to higher intellectual performance among village American Indian and Eskimo high school students are presented in this final report of observations of teachers and students in several Native boarding schools and/or integrated urban high schools in Alaska. The first study, an ethnography, describes the problems of these students and their teachers, and suggests a typology differentiating effective and ineffective teachers. This ethnography suggests that the teacher's degree of personal warmth versus professional distance, and degree of active demandingness versus passive understanding, are fundamental dimensions separating successful from unsuccessful teachers. The second study, empirically testing a major  hypothesis derived from the ethnography, found that the socioemotional climate of the integrated classroom is significantly related to the verbal participation of village students, who are typically silent and withdrawn. The third study found that teacher warmth, communicated through nonverbal channels, leads to higher intellectual performance among village Indian and Eskimo students. Suggestions are made for improving the secondary school instruction of Indian and Eskimo students through teacher selection methods and training programs which take into account the importance of personal warmth and active demandingness in cross-cultural teaching success. A bibliography and copies of the teacher and student questionnaires used in the studies are included. (Author/PS)",

Data were collected by means of questionnaires and structured interviews. Analysis of questionnaire and interview data focused on isolating items, such as recruitment procedures, that discriminated between teachers who resigned and those who remained. Additional analyses isolated personal, sociological, and ecological variables related to teacher mobility. Findings included (1) that the BIA schools had a teacher separation rate of 36%; (2) that those  individuals who had the most incongruency in areas related to their work environments were most likely to terminate employment, and (3) that termination of employment was also related to dominant career patterns.

The purpose of this paper is to submit data showing that 68% of Iowa schools face a serious dilemma. Declining rural populations could reduce by half the enrollment in at least half of Iowa's school districts in the next 10 years. Staffing requirements enforced by the Department of Public Instruction are beyond the point of efficient utilization in one-fourth of Iowa schools. Curriculum offerings in small schools are inadequate to prepare mobile Iowa youth for urban life. The per-pupil costs in small districts are extremely high and continue to climb in relation to costs in reasonable-sized schools. The 1967 Iowa School  Support Law makes it impossible for individual school districts to support schools completely by local effort; equalization moves wealth from rural districts with high per-pupil costs to urban areas with lower assessed valuations. Reorganization centered around growing communities and the intermediate unit for special services are suggested to alleviate some problems of small schools. (JH)",

Measures of emotionality/arousal, meaningfulness, word frequency, and word length were obtained in the following ways: individual child's rating of word emotionality, percent Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) deflection, Noble's meaningfulness (number of different free-associates by the child), Thorndike-Lorge estimate of word frequency, and number of letters in each word. No significant differences occurred between own, AW, and BR words on a 2-minute  retention test; but 24-hour retention was greater for own words than for AW or BR words. Own words elicited significantly greater GSR's and were more meaningful than either AW or BR words. Children also rated own words as significantly more emotional than BR words. In the variables of word frequency and word length, own words significantly differed from BR words, but were similar to AW words. Findings and their implications were discussed.

The subjects were selected from 168 freshmen, all of whom were poor readers and spoke predominantly English. All subjects read 150 randomly ordered expressions of three types: sentences, semigrammatical strings (semantically anomalous), and ungrammatical strings. Scoring was based on the number of miscues made on content words and on the number of corrections made in each category. Miscue analysis indicated that higher comprehension subjects used both semantics and syntax in oral reading, while higher vocabulary subjects used syntax but did not seem  to use semantics. Corrections analysis yielded no differences in use of syntax and semantics. Higher comprehension subjects had more miscues than the higher vocabulary group.

Selected pupils were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups within each school.

The results of the study indicated that project children did no better or worse on the criterion reading skills tests than did control students. Attitudes of project and control pupils were  also similar. It was felt that there was a possibility that the difficulty level of the criterion test was inappropriate for these groups.

Student success was the primary reinforcing agent. Students began by reading orally sound symbols printed on cards. Each day the individual students' oral reading was timed. Throughout the program an objective was to maintain a low error rate, yet to progress as rapidly as the students could respond correctly. When all of the regular spellings of the long vowels had been mastered and the individual student's rate was maintained at 80 to 100 sounds-per-minute, he was moved into reading word cards. The words were regular in pronunciation, usually emphasizing a particular vowel sound. Once the student had maintained a rate of  110 to 120 words-per-minute, he was moved into reading sentences from a graded reading series, and then advanced to higher readers when his oral rate improved. Accelerated student performance was evident. Students gained reading competence, self-confidence, and interest in reading, and showed better performance in all subject areas and social behavior in school. (AW)",

Teacher and school factors were rigorously controlled. A continuous comparison of results in the first through sixth grades on standardized measures of reading achievement was supplemented by studies of characteristics of writing and spelling behaviors and creativity measures to determine longitudinal effects of the differentiated beginning. It was found that the i.t.a. pupils continuously showed better abilities in word discrimination, word knowledge, spelling, and creative use of words than did the TO pupils. Additional  data also indicated (1) that twice as many TO pupils received remedial reading as did i.t.a. pupils during this period and (2) that while the TO pupils needed help on word recognition and comprehension, the i.t.a. pupils needed help only on comprehension. It was concluded that compared to the use of TO, the use of i.t.a. had a significantly more beneficial and lasting effect in developing the characteristics which combine to produce a higher success rate among children.

Research and experience have shown that speed reading can be taught and that the need for the skill is tremendous. The first challenge of the 70's is to enlighten school administrators and parents to the important need of teaching speed reading skills. The key factors to success in teaching these skills are (1) a great deal of positive reinforcement at every step of learning, (2) a positive and reassuring attitude on the part of the teacher, and (3) the teacher's intellectual understanding of the skill and ability to perform the skill himself. To overcome the problem of maintaining the skill, visual reading should be taught in the seventh or eighth grade, and content teachers should  know the new reading techniques so that they can encourage students to employ them in daily reading. Students should also be taught to evaluate reading materials so that time allotments can be made for flexible reading. The second challenge of the 70's is the need for more research on visual reading, on new methods of testing and measuring, and on more effective methods of teaching the skills.

The suggested sources of paraprofessional trainees are college students, mothers, company wives, elderly people, and groups of concerned citizens. The training program is broken into three distinct phases: theory, practicum, and supervised employment. In the theory phase, the trainees are tested for knowledge of reading skills and provided with instruction in the methodology of teaching reading skills and the preparation and use of materials. In the practicum phase, the trainees are involved in preparation of materials and  consultation with the reading specialist, tutoring of students, and in self-evaluation. The supervised employment phase involves periodic visits by the reading specialist to provide on-the-job assistance to the paraprofessionals and a weekly seminar. A pilot project has been conducted, and application is being made for funds to conduct a comprehensive program.

Twenty-two poor readers and 22 normal readers were matched on sex, age (7 to 12 years), and IQ (94 to 130). Examination of school records revealed that many poor readers were characterized as having short attention span, being immature in perceptual ability, being hyperactive, being immature in fine-motor ability, and behaving antisocially. In this investigation, two letters were presented simultaneously. Subjects responded by pressing one switch if the letters were the same, and another if different. Reaction time was found to be longer for poor readers. In addition, reaction times increased during testing and  decreased after a rest more for poor than normal readers. Main effects for age and IQ were present. Correlations between initial reaction times and changes were significantly different for poor and normal readers.

Each resource unit can be used independently of the others and materials can be selected from within a unit. The materials range in difficulty from the junior high level of understanding to those that will appeal to the advanced student seeking challenging research activities. The 10 resource units are arranged in a sequence of topics similar to many general chemistry textbooks. Unit topics include: cabin atmospheres in space vehicles, life-support systems, chemical rocket propellants, electrochemical cells for space power, rates of high-temperature reactions associated with space vehicles, space vehicle lubrication, optical coatings for  temperature control of space vehicles, ablative materials for high-temperature thermal protection, chemical evolution, and detection of extraterrestrial life. Each unit consists of three parts: a brief monograph providing background information; several activities for demonstrations, experiments, or projects; and a list of literature sources. For some units, a list of related films is also included. (Author/PR)",

Based on these and other observations of classroom behavior of teachers and pupils the author postulates that two agendas are operative in classrooms. The primary agenda is that of the teacher and consists of the instructional program or formal curriculum. The secondary agenda consists of what the students have in mind. Generally students acquiesce by accepting the concerns of the teacher. However, in some situations students do not acquiesce but instead engage in a kind of guerilla warfare with their teachers. They perceive the primary agenda as irrelevant and attempt to  sabotage it in many ways, such as not bringing books, pencils or paper to class, making jokes, and numerous other techniques. The phenomenon of guerilla warfare is considered to be widespread in all types of communities. A careful study of secondary agenda to determine its cause and prevention is recommended. (PR)",

In order to reduce admissions, an accreditation board is suggested to be established under the supervision of the American Institute of Physicists. Among the criteria suggested for this accreditation would be faculty/student ratio, competence of the faculty, and research productivity. Certain programs are listed which might receive special  consideration with regard to innovations and specific student groups.

In a long paper (28 pages) on &quot;New Techniques for Assessment of Pupils' Work,&quot; A.D.C. Peterson discusses: (1) efforts to improve reliability by the use of objective tests, improved marking procedures, and better standardization; (2) efforts to improve validity by the use of continuous assessment and taxonomies of objectives; (3) scholastic aptitude tests; and (4) oral examinations. The second study consists of three shorter contributions relevant to the question of secondary school leaving examinations: &quot;Examination Research: Results Thus Far and Outlook for the Future,&quot; by M. Reuchlin; &quot;Objective Testing and Educational Assessment,&quot; by W. D. Halls; and &quot;From Point-in-time  Examination to General Assessment,&quot; by J. Capelle. The remainder of this bulletin is made up of reports of meetings of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Council for Cultural Cooperation, and the Committees on Higher Education and Research, General and Technical Education, Out-of-School Education and Cultural Development, and Educational Documentation and Research.

        "description":"In an experiment to investigate learning styles in mathematics, 406 eighth grade students studied two sets of programed materials, one on triangles and one on quadrilaterals. Each program was available in two instructional styles: inductive and deductive. Students were stratified by sex and report card grades, and then assigned randomly to various combinations of one inductive and one deductive program. After elimination of 108 students for various reasons, the remaining 298 students were classified by results on the program posttests. Thirty-two deductive learners (those who had a high score after a deductive program and a low score after an inductive program) and 22 inductive learners (the opposite) were identified. Two further programs were then studied by these 54 students,  one inductive and one deductive, but no significant differences appeared on these posttests. It is suggested that differential learning styles may be subject matter specific. (MM)",

This has resulted in courses containing much confusion and absurdity, at least in biology. An alternative biology project was established by the Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science, utilizing co-operative teams of school and university teachers, but it also has some drawbacks. The new courses, however, have not been adequately assessed in the public examinations which also serve as entrance examinations to the universities. The Education Department has imposed unsuitable assessment techniques which the universities are expected to help implement, even though they were not consulted during the  development of procedures. There is evidence that there is official discrimination, based on racial origin, in selection for university admission. Too many university staff are not using adequate scientific criteria in their experimental design and publication activities; this will have deplorable consequences on education and on the provision of adequate scientific bases for the development of Ceylonese applied science.

Following a general orientation, specific problems and needs are identified and research related to these is noted. Current practices concerning environmental education programs and materials are summarized together with recommendations regarding their development and implementation. Brief descriptions of selected programs and materials and case studies describing program development and implementation are included. Sources of information for supplementary materials are also listed. A copy of the Environmental Education Curriculum Analysis Instrument, along with a summary of learning approaches to environmental education, conclude the work.

        "description":"This draft outline presents and organizes for teachers one of the fundamental concepts in war/peace studies: interdependence. As the definitional statement makes clear, interdependence involves learning to look at the world as a single system, and to identify and analyze its various subsystems. Part of the rationale for considering interdependence as a major concept in war/peace education is that an understanding of the concept and its various subconcepts, is a vital first step in the students' ability to come to terms with his own prejudices, misperceptions, and stereotyping. The guide lists sample affective and cognitive objectives, and provides a developmental idea outline of the concept interdependence and its related subconcepts (universality, origins, dynamics, development,  effects, and methods and techniques for dealing with interdependence.) For each of these, topic and content samples are outlined. Suggested grade levels (9-12) and hypothetical course titles are designated for these topic and content samples. A bibliography lists sources designed as starting points for the development of particular topics and content samples, as well as more general sources on interdependence.

The content is divided into 30 short lessons, with student exercises at the end of each lesson. Simple concepts and terms are used to describe the mandate of state governments, and how the executive, legislative, and judicial branches operate and interrelate. Several lessons are also devoted to an explanation of how county and city governments are organized, and the services they are intended to provide. Taxes are discussed in one lesson on How We Pay for Our Governments. Two chapters take a look at the coordination between the various levels of government, and between the government and  citizens. The principles of our government, such as delegated powers, divided authority, checks and balances, are reviewed in a concluding lesson. New vocabulary is noted in each lesson, and at the end of the workbook.

        "description":"Two hypotheses were tested in this research: 1) Groups of parents, teachers, students, and administrators share similar attitudes concerning the worthwhileness of selected school activities; and, 2) The factors of process objectives, active student roles, informal evaluations, and timeliness contribute significantly to predictions of judgments made by the reference groups of selected school activities. Procedures involved the construction of 24 curriculum activities (included in an appendix), sampling from the various reference groups, and the development and administration of a research instrument (a Likert-type scale). The first hypothesis is partially supported by the data (partially because of the clustering of the groups in five distinct groupings). The second hypothesis is  supported by the data. While these factors do not contribute a great deal individually in the explanation of group judgments, they do yield significant multiple correlations and serve to separate out the policies of the nine reference groups into five distinct clusters. Several recommendations for curricular decisions are made based on these findings. One of these is that since parents agreed with parents, students with students etc., curricular decisions must not be made by one person or group, but ways must be found to have all groups contribute to such decisions.

The main purpose of the report is to help integrate Peru's educational development and process of general development. New paths for analyzing the country's educational problems is another aim of the Development Plan. Long term forecasts (1980) were made of manpower requirements and their consequences on educational development. The stages of the study are as follows: Chapter I summarizes the main results of the study; Chapter II reviews the educational situation in Peru over the past ten years and suggests the main lines of strategy for developing the  educational system; Chapter III translates targets of economic development up to 1980 into manpower requirements according to level the type of education; Chapter IV forecasts development of the educational system needed to satisfy the economy's manpower requirements and to meet other important social and cultural purposes. Methods used and future studies are indicated. The report contains a body of data designed for the encouragement of development planning through further studies and response to circulation of the report. A related document is ED 012 240.

The guide recommends that the themes be taught in conjunction with the regular curricula, when appropriate. Supplementing each theme group (K-3, 4-6, and 7-12) are extensive  resource guides to films, recordings, filmstrips, pamphlets, and books.

The aim of the program is to help children develop the tools of reasoning. Emphasis is on the introduction of cognitive tasks involving concept formation and requiring students to list, group, identify, and label items; interpret, infer and generalize; apply known principles and facts to unfamiliar phenomena; and to predict consequences from known conditions. Each of the cognitive tasks is explained in greater detail in relation to overt activity, covert mental operations, and eliciting of questions. Six units of varying length which involve more than several days are presented. It is recommended that the units gradually move toward greater depth and  longer duration and that by the end of the year the units will involve children for several weeks. Seasonal units are presented to help the children document and generalize the concept that change is constant in the world. A unit on &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; helps children to see themselves realistically. Two family units, one on &quot;The Family&quot; and another on the &quot;Japanese Family&quot;, are presented to illustrate similarities and differences in families. Additional materials for each unit include general reference books, fingerplays, and poetry. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"The goal of civic education in a democracy must be mindful political activism. If civic education is to have a positive effect on the development of this activism: 1) it must provide curricular content which reflects the reality of political/social life; and, 2) teachers and administrators must exemplify, in and out of school, a model of active and mindful civic behavior worthy of emulation, and the school as an institution should furnish a model of such behavior. On both counts, I must be very critical of the reality of American education. The greatness of America is exaggerated; its problems, mistakes and weaknesses are minimized or ignored; and, little heed is given to how political and economic power has been and continues to be exercised. Schools are concerned more with  maintaining authority and exacting obedience than with building self-esteem and individuality. And, while teachers may rule the school with an iron hand, they are notoriously placid and uninspiring citizens. The real trouble lies with a conception of education which, if it was ever valid, no longer fits our circumstances. It is time that American education outgrows its babysitting, propagandistic role, that it abandon its pretense to be the guardian of all wisdom, that it be more willing to share its problems and perplexities with youth, and devote itself to the cultivation of moral sensibility and intellectual honesty.

A major aspect of socialization consists of the roles one learns. Role instruction is designed to transmit role information in a deliberate and systematic manner so that each student can: a) become fully aware of the role learning in his daily experiences; b) grasp the implications of different roles for his social and occupational life; and, c) comprehend the impact of role-learning on the development of his own personality. The kit contains cards and booklets (the latter not yet available) that may be used by both students and teachers. Cards include: 1) basic concept cards,  explaining the meaning of role, personality, and position; 2) role information cards, describing the various kinds of information units related to each social role; 3) orienting discussions, to introduce the student to real-life manifestations of role behavior, the multiplicity of roles learned by each person, etc.; 4) several role-study exercises; 5) selected role scripts (auto mechanic, mother, world citizen, soldier, and others); and, 6) a guide to evaluation of student attitudes toward specific roles. Finally, ways to apply several of these role exercises to war/peace situations are suggested. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"This paper develops a basic conceptual framework of values and the valuing process. Section 1, Values and Value Claims, discusses the four different types of value claims (personal, market, real, and implicit) and their relationships. The second section considers the process of rational evaluation as a method of arriving at and supporting value claims. As this discussion points out, the process of rational evaluation is basically one of comparing alternative means to our ends, and this means/end model must be seen as operating not with initially fixed means and ends, but with the task of developing, clarifying, and combining means and ends. A number of different skills are involved in this process, and it is worthwhile encouraging students to identify these skills during these  discussions. The third and final section, Foundations of Morality and Democracy, discusses the place and function of ultimate values in discussions of values in general, and democratic values in particular. The author concludes with a remark about the difference between education and indoctrination: In moral education, we should be saying nothing that is unchallengeable, and we should be concentrating on providing students with the cognitive and affective skills they need in order to do the challenging of our past assumptions, and to develop new value conclusions for new situations.

        "description":"Student discontent against higher education transformed campuses throughout the country as revolutionary headquarters to challenge the Establishment--the state, the military, and industry--in 1968-69. But militant tactics employed by students deprived them of public support; it was this tactic that contributed to the passing of the University Bill. Nevertheless, it was student power more than anything else that triggered the events through which university administrations and faculty members became aware of the need for university reform. Student power challenged the hierarchic structure of higher education, the academic elite and its social ramifications, moral corruption among administrators and faculty members, as well as the raison d'etre of the Ministry of Education. Though  student power failed to realize its goal in the 1968-69 period, their activities of that period form an important chapter in the recent history of Japanese education: it exposed the vulnerable aspects of higher education to the government, educators, and the public; it undoubtedly will have considerable impact in the formulation of future educational policies and in educational planning. Student power is an element that cannot be ignored in modern higher education in a democratic society. (Author)",

        "author":["Byrne, T. C."],
        "description":"This paper was prepared for a social studies curriculum conference in Alberta in June, 1967. It provides a point of view on curriculum building which could be useful in establishing a national service in this field. The basic assumption is that the social studies should in some measure change the behavior of the students (a sharp departure from the rationale of the information and storage retrieval learning theories of the forties and fifties). Since values held by an individual or group are powerful determinants of behavior, the social studies teachers must be concerned with values and value systems. The curriculum should be designed around their needs and interests to generate relevancy, rather than reflect the dictates of the discipline. Knowledge is essential but if outcomes  are not so much what a student knows but how he behaves in certain situations, content becomes not the end but the means. Students who have been exposed to several years of social studies should exemplify the following behaviors: 1) examine social issues critically; 2) question assumptions; 3) be suspicious of action that limits the rights of others; 4) identify and reject prejudice; and, 5) determine reliability of information sources. When the social studies program accomplishes some of these purposes, it has justified its role. The success of such curriculum design resides with the teacher who is broadly educated within the social sciences. (Author/SJM)",

Basic objectives and assumptions of the experiential training approach are discussed in Chapter One. Objectives include: understanding and acceptance of and effective interaction within a foreign culture. Assumptions of the training program regarding the facilitation of learning include: trainee's responsibility for his own learning, active involvement of trainee's emotions and intelligence, emphasis on learning how to learn, and evaluation based on performance objectives. Chapter Two, Experiential Training/Learning focuses on staff and  trainee roles. Chapter Three, Use of Small Groups, includes discussion of unstructured training and specific sections on a non-directive approach and a modified T-group. Chapter Four, Planning, Designing, and Conducting Experiential Training, presents a general system design for a total program; activities, outcomes, and a time sequence are specified. Special problems, e.g., trainee attitudes, peer pressure, are discussed in Chapter Five. A discussion of the integration of language training is appended.

Objectives of the project were to: 1) enable students to identify environmental concepts; 2) activate pupils toward solving environmental problems; 3) encourage pupils in discovering the causes of environmental problems; 4) develop ways, means, and materials for incorporating environmental education into existing curriculum; and, 5) involve the adult community in treating environmental problems. Activity learning, in which students had primary responsibility for performing daily and weekly tasks, was combined with a  multidisciplinary approach relating the project to the total curriculum. Money earned was to go toward an arboretum at the school. It was concluded that decisions need to be made as to the integration, scope, and sequence of environmental education in the existing curriculum. It is requested that users of the report share their results with the project staff. Follow-up activities include continuation of paper recycling and the possible start of a center for recycling bottles and cans. SO 002 612 is a related report. (Author/SJM)",

The suggestions are examples of ways in which environmentally beneficial learnings can be incorporated into the existing curriculum, and are intended to assist in the development of learning packages. Among the five overall objectives listed are: 1) to develop personal patterns of behavior and attitudes: reflecting and personalizing observation of natural patterns; learning to value objects through perception of their place in patterns; and, 2) to provide specific environmentally significant learnings in math, social studies, art, science, music, and language arts. The concepts of Pattern and Tree Succession are taught within the framework of the above subject areas in a three-step sequence: an introduction  within the classroom (pre-site work); observation site work; and, application to student values (post-site work). One of the post-site activities suggested for the concept of tree succession in social studies is to imagine the development of a forest community around the tree represented by your wood slab, and draw pictures of how this community might have looked during five-year intervals. Then, compare the growth of the forest community with the growth of your community on the time continuum represented by the tree. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"The ideas presented are ways in which teachers can incorporate environmental education into 5th grade general or slow learner curriculum. Objectives of the project were to provide the teacher with an aid in teaching about environment, and to help the student: 1) perceive and develop an awareness of the environment; 2) relate to his environment; 3) manipulate and change the environment; 4) realize that mathematics is a useful tool for studying environment; and, 5) conduct within the classroom experiments on environmental projects. A concept, objective, method, and evaluation is stated for each of the five major student objectives. The project classroom was self contained, and most of the work was field-oriented with very little student research or written work. It was concluded  that changes of student attitudes occurred. Lists of supplemental methods are included which provoke high student interest, create good learning situations, and are possible on a limited budget.

        "author":["Sargo, Herbert J."],
        "description":"This report outlines a method of teaching eighth-grade science with an environmental perspective. Areas of study normally found in junior high science curriculum are integrated with environmental concepts. This particular approach to 8th grade science is intended to be process oriented, field oriented, problem oriented, and relevant to the local community. The class is divided into three or four heterogeneous groups simulating a community situation. Students choose from a list of environmental topics and are given a &quot;group plan&quot; comprised of a list of general questions unique to the subject area to guide their research. The role of the instructor is one of facilitator; students do all they can by themselves. Students are encouraged to expand their learning sources and gain actual  environmental experience within the community through letters to organizations. Block scheduling is suggested. Provided are: readings, information and, community sources; group plans; and a list of environmental educational concepts. Over one half of the book consists of appendices: Student Correspondence; Student-Oriented Information for Distribution; Resource Bibliographical Information; Student Papers on Speakers, Filmstrips and Movies; and Excerpts from Group Plan Research.

        "description":"The purpose of the research described in this paper is to find if the race of a sixth grade male child and the race of his existing social model are important in the child's imitation of a person with social power. Social power is defined as the model's personal control over another person. Social imitation is behavioral change in a child based on seeing the behavior of another person. The races under consideration here are Negro and Caucasian. The first experiment investigated whether legitimate social power is a relevant variable in social imitation. The second experiment varied the race of the child and the social model as potentially significant aspects of imitative behavior. Thirty Negro and Caucasian children viewed films using two Negro and two Caucasian 25-30 year old men  as existing social models. The results of these experiments suggest that in a school setting, where integration of black and whites at both the faculty and student level has been working smoothly, neither race nor legitimate power stand out as determiners of imitation behavior in students.

        "description":"This study investigates the life of rural Filipino teachers and assesses their role in civic or community improvement. The purpose is to locate the activist teachers and further to explain why certain people are more involved in the community. Two approaches are used: first, ethnographic material from informants and personal observations on the cultural and political context of education, i.e., on the educational bureaucracy, village factionalism, and occupational clique groups are presented as conditions for teacher role behavior; second, interviews of over 600 randomly sampled teachers and community members are used to relate selected demographic and attitudinal factors to actual teacher civic participation. This juxtaposition of the descriptive contextual data and the survey  data on individuals (presented in 63 tables) should provide richer ethnography of the Filipino teacher and his educational system and also provide a fuller explanation of general and individual teacher civic role behavior. In sum, teachers, as a community development resource, are reluctant &quot;missionaries&quot; operating in a very difficult professional and cultural milieu. Activist teachers are most likely to be professionally responsible and have high community status. Practical recommendations and areas for further research are discussed in a final chapter. Measurement instruments and reference list are appended. (Author/DJB)",

During this part of a 5-year research program which began in 1966 3 studies were set in the U.S., 6 in Africa, and 1 each in Colombia, Micronesia, Venezuela, New Guinea, Malasia, Singapore, Chile, and West Germany. A description of each study's purpose, setting, methodology, and major findings is provided in the 2-4 page abstracts in Chapter 2. An overview of the project's problem areas, its relationship to the  growing field of political socialization, and specific project objectives are given in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 includes a discussion of selected empirical findings, recommendations for further research, and methodological notes. Significant factors in attitude development were found to be outside of the formal curriculum: in the general societal context and the organizational and cultural configurations within school settings. Two books by the author, substantially based on the project findings, will be published in 1972. (Author/DJB)",

Much emphasis in this paper is placed upon gaining a better picture of educational situations and problems because the rapid changes in our society are creating the need for new educational tasks. Two major functions for a college of education are 1) to bring the relevant scholarship of the university to bear on the practices and problems of education, and 2) to play a major role in the preparation of education personnel.  Four areas which could benefit from systematic studies by groups of university scholars are 1) dissatisfaction about the education of teachers brought about by confusion over the rapid changes in social conditions, curriculum outlines, and the characteristics of teacher recruitees; 2) a need for involving a variety of university scholars; 3) the learning students require for acquiring and using appropriately the knowledge, skills, and emotional responses, and controls representing the important resources of a given subject; and 4) the kinds of constructive roles available for teachers.

Additional questions concerned the factors on which teachers focus when making their self-evaluations and whether teacher experiences have any effect on the self-evaluations. The subjects were 22 experienced teachers and 44 preservice student teachers, with 11 in-service teachers and 22 student teachers having training in the analysis of teacher behavior in 30 2-hour training sessions. The training included operation of videotape equipment, formulation and writing of educational objectives, use of two systems of classroom observation, and  development of teaching strategies. A 30-minute lesson was recorded at the end of the period and subjects responded to their performance on the Alabama Funnel Self-Evaluation Interview Guide (included in the document). Findings indicated that there were no significant statistical differences between the trained and untrained groups, or between in-service teachers in the two groups. Student teachers with training focused on the teaching act and those without training focused on themselves as persons. The study was judged successful in identifying the factors which the subjects used as criteria for self-evaluation and showed that training had little influence on these factors. (MBM)",

The roles of all the people involved in the system are facilitating roles to that end and each should be held accountable to the others. The two groups most concerned in the current emphasis on accountability are school administrators and teachers. Administrators must be held accountable for the provision and maintenance of good learning environments, for the efficient and effective use of resources, and for individual student learning for the resources used. They must make increased use of proven management techniques  and develop an action program for their school system. Classroom teachers have felt most threatened by the concept of accountability. They need to develop performance objectives for each student and to make increased use of validated educational technologies. The teacher should not be held at fault if a student does not learn after all the known techniques and strategies have been tried. Boards of school directors at the national, state, and local levels must also be held accountable for their portions of the system if we are to have greater productivity in public education. MBM)",

Unlike previous studies, this one focuses on the expectations of the future teacher. The factors of conformity, autonomy, discipline and communication comprised 30.4 percent of the instrument variance. Subject to the restricted sampling, results suggest that a recruitee's adjustment to the pressures to conform within the social system of the school, the maintenance of his professional autonomy, coping with classroom management, and communicating with those in complementary roles may be the four most important preoccupations of the new  teacher and as such deserve special attention in teacher training. The Madison groups differed significantly only on discipline, while the Houston groups differed significantly on conformity, autonomy, and discipline. The one significant regional difference for teachers was conformity; significant regional differences for future teachers were on conformity and autonomy. (JLF)",

The subjects were 185 students in an experimental psychology course on socialization. The instruments used include a test anxiety questionnaire, an omnibus personality inventory, and a general information questionnaire. Results indicated several significant differences between the three groups of students. Those who chose the independent study option indicate a significantly greater need for autonomy, flexibility, a higher tolerance for ambiguity, and a greater preference for abstract and  scientific thinking than students who chose the lecture option. Students in the lecture-discussion group were significantly moderate in their preference for reflective thought and academic activities, not different from the lecture group in their interest in abstract thinking, and not different from the independent study group with respect to tolerance of ambiguity and autonomy. The lecture group scored significantly higher on the anti-intellectual authoritarian factor than the other two groups. Further research is under way to test for possible interactions between personality factors, the preference factor, and instructional methods and their effects on cognitive and affective outcomes.

They also rated themselves and the instructor on the same scale near the end of the course, rated the instructor on the Rating Scale for Teachers (RST) consisting of 17 itmes dealing with aspects of a teacher's job and  personality, and took five teacher-made achievement tests during the semester. Students were separated into high and low achievement levels, using the median of the cutoff. Two-way multivariate analysis showed significant differences in teacher ratings on MARS and RST factors between the sexes and between high and low achievement level subjects.

The major thrust of the evaluation was to determine whether teacher aide service had an effect upon pupil achievement as determined by standardized achievement test scores. The achievement of experimental third, fourth, and fifth grade pupils in the reading and arithmetic subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test were compared with comparable pupils who experienced little or no teacher aide service. The findings indicated that fourth grade pupils benefited considerably from exposure to saturated teacher aide service in  the areas of both reading and arithmetic, but this was not the case with third and fifth grade pupils. However, as approximately one-third of the total program pupils profited substantially, it is recommended that the project should continue. It is also recommended that principals should be made more administratively cognizant that the essential role of the teacher aide is the improvement of the level of educational achievement in the project area.

Now we have reached a point where the supply of teachers  exceeds the demand, and there is a need for a new, long look at teacher education and the formulation of new roles. Some targets for future professional action are teacher renewal sites and teacher centers, built on the concept of using schools and communities as proper partners for colleges and universities, the consortium approach to teacher education, greater involvement of colleges in the community, more feedback from teachers to their former colleges, the development of greater sensitivity to different cultures, performance-based teacher education, and improved accreditation procedures.

The three experiments described in this report were designed to discover whether behavior management procedures can effectively control the high levels of disruption manifested by older children, whether reducing the level of disruption will be effective in increasing the academic performance of the children, and, if not, whether a motivation system can be designed which will lead to significant academic output. The subjects were a class of 19 seventh-grade children in a low-income elementary school in Atlanta who had a reputation for extreme behavior problems. The first experiment sought to bring discipline problems under control by means of a token-point reinforcement  system; the second experiment sought to manage discipline problems through social influence and group reinforcement; the third experiment sought to improve academic performance through reinforcement. Results demonstrated that 1) discipline problems can be virtually eliminated through the application of appropriate behavioral procedures and 2) reinforcement for academic performance can significantly increase the academic level of a classroom group. It appears that the more widely behavior management techniques are used, the more effective school programs will be (MBM)",

Two rating scales were devised to measure the attitudinal responses of cooperating teachers to items of bias. A control group of 33 black teachers and 32 white teachers who had not worked in biracial situations were tested. The experimental group of 42 white teachers and 41 black teachers, who had been assigned student teachers of the other race, were tested before and after the student teaching program. The most dramatic differences occurred between the control and experimental groups rather than among the experimental groups. Accounting for the lack of change among the latter are the previous experiences  of experimental group teachers with students of the opposite race and their voluntary acceptance of the student teacher. However, Caucasian and Negro teachers in the experimental group changed their attitudes about the characteristics of children of the other race in a number of areas. In addition, differences in attitudes between Negro and Caucasian teachers were noteworthy in the following areas: acceptance of the minority teacher by the faculty, ease of communication with the other race, professionalism in relationship to all faculty members and administrators regardless of race, and equality between the races in inherent intelligence and children's behavior patterns.

Action is needed now to assure that large numbers of jobs are created which are consistent with national goals and which are also appropriate to the capabilities of the increasing supply of college graduates. Tables illustrate, with figures since 1960, the growth of the labor force, male graduates receiving bachelor's and first professional degrees, the number of unemployed, employment trends, employment offers to college graduates, and the unemployment of white and nonwhite males age 20-24. Increasing the  number of jobs in public education would be the most desirable area for enlarging the number of jobs for college graduates. Provision of resource personnel and supportive professional services would require the addition of more than 100,000 school librarians, at least 20,000 guidance personnel for elementary schools, and an unspecified number of persons in other professional positions which need to be created to give all students and teachers access to the services of qualified practitioners in psychological, health, and social service disciplines.

Consequently, the activities carried out by the project were intended to facilitate the goals of each of the seven programs by providing for greater communication among them, by coordinating resource utilization so as to maximize productivity, by relieving programs of certain evaluation responsibilities so that their resources might be directed toward instructional aspects, and by providing certain resources which otherwise  might not have been available. An examination of program development efforts suggests that the processes involved were both complex and difficult. Lack of time and money appear to be chief among the many problems encountered. Despite those problems, progress seems to be rather substantial when viewed in the light of realistic expectations. Evidence suggests that interns felt much more positively toward competency-based teacher education, the competency-based aspects of their program, and their total program than they did toward more traditional approaches to teacher education.

        "description":"Neither teachers nor students have been instructed in the meaning of non-verbal communication. Several assumptions are presented regarding the nature of non-verbal communication. It has been difficult to do research and reporting in this field due to difficulty in data collection, the complexity of human communication, analization difficulty, inadequate measures of reliability and validity, and absence of useful categories. Recently, researchers and educators are investigating how non-verbal languages are learned, their unique forms in cultural expression, and creating observational instruments that describe classroom interaction. In the author's initial study of classroom non-verbal communication, he developed an observational system describing the consequences of non-verbal  categories, the purpose of which was determining whether a reliable observational procedure could be developed. Categories were added, the advantage being economy of effort and abbreviated note-taking. Non-verbal training and skill development are in the beginning stages. By improving non-verbal skills, teachers learn their own behavior and its meanings and its meaning to students, and they learn to observe and detect non-verbal information from students. The importance of non-verbal behavior would emphasize teacher and student non-verbal cues and result in a better understanding the nature of teaching and learning. (JF)",

        "description":"A discussion and analysis of a novel, &quot;The Pigman,&quot; are given. The story is described as one that appeals to adolescents and also is a good means for exemplifying how an author works. The plot is described as the story of three lonely people--two teenagers and an old widower. It is a novel revealing the duality of life through the use of opposites in juxtaposition. Diction is one of the technics employed by the author, Paul Zindel, to exemplify the themes, e.g. language is used to enforce the theme of honesty versis phoniness. The novel's title introduces the first major animal metaphor. Animal imagery also reinforces Zindel's theme of what is real or honest as opposed to what is phony. With the books conclusion, the reader feels that perhaps the teenagers have at last learned to  distinguish between appearance and reality. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"Children in eight classes of the 5th and 6th grades were randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 received no training in creative dramatics; Group 4 was trained in the use of creative dramatics and were taught by the creative dramatics technique. Group 2 children were trained in the technique, but were not taught the material by the use of the technique; Group 3 children were not trained but were taught by the technique. The study was designed to answer the question as to whether the use of creative dramatics enhances learning and whether the child needed to be trained to benefit from such a technique. The analysis indicates that creative dramatics has an effect both on learning and retention, but the relationship varies, depending on the sex and training of the child. The  findings also disclose that the higher the grade the less important creative dramatics is as a teaching technique. The sex difference was another salient factor; the data were such that using creative dramatics to teach cognitive material actually works against the boys' retention of the material. The girls, on the other hand, appeared to benefit by the technique, both in the initial learning, and the retention of the material learned. Although there appears to be trends in the area of grade and perceived intelligence, no conclusions can be drawn until they can be partialled on sex. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"In an effort to motivate culturally different students to learn standard English while they remain proud of their dialect and retain it as their informal manner of speaking, 120 blacks at three grade levels role played from scripts the parts of employers, college admissions officers, and applicants. The scripts rewarded applicants who could and were proud of speaking two dialects, and penalized applicants who could speak only one dialect, even if that dialect was standard English. A control group of 120 blacks completed Ss for two three-dimensional designs, one featuring sex, grade level and role playing, the second featuring achievement, grade level and role playing. Criterion measures were (1) a semantic differential designed by this study to measure the attitudes of blacks  toward bidialectalism, and (2) a series of Likert-like items testing a variety of attitudes. The semantic differential was partially successful in measuring the attitudes of blacks toward bidialectalism but needs further refinement. Blacks were favorable toward bidialectals, and role playing could motivate them to be even more favorable. Sex, achievement, and grade level were not consistent factors in influencing results, although there were indications that achievers responded more favorably than non-achievers. (Author)",

It is stated that ways are needed to restructure schools so that teachers may reasonably be held responsible for seeing that all clinically normal students are able to read and write with at least minimal competence. It is believed that this restructuring of the present school system should result in small, locally controlled school districts, such that the teacher can know the students and be accessible to their parents. These should be so administered that teachers are given the final responsibility for all professional decisions. Such a teacher-run school would be accountable to the students and their parents, and to its funding authority only for demonstrating it is  meeting the wishes of its clients and handling its funds in a legal manner. Prior to the reform of the present educational system, it is pointed out that everyone in a school is accountable for helping children learn to read and write. (DB)",

The 20 cities selected for the study represent a cross-section of size, geographic location, extent and nature of youth concert activities, and diverse practices and circumstances. It was found that while variations in youth concert operation are inevitable and desirable, certain practices emerge as fundamental in reaching the main objective theme--giving more young people more opportunities to hear and appreciate live performances of youth concerts. Schools are encouraged  to: (1) establish a close working relationship between the orchestra management and the school system's director of music education; (2) Identify specific goals and a timetable for meeting them; (3) Plan fiscal arrangements with both orchestras and schools; (4) Solicit financial support from various possible sources; (5) Provide students with sequential listening experiences; (6) Schedule as many programs as possible during school hours; (7) Provide all students with the opportunity to attend; and (8) Offer appropriate programs of artistic excellence.

Results indicate clearly that such scale values can be approximated satisfactorily through item-examinee sampling. Defining one observation as the response made by one examinee to one item, the similarity between the estimated scale values and normative scale values increased generally with increases in the number of observations acquired by the sampling plan.

Four figural creativity variables (Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration) were correlated with course grades, American College Testing Program scores, sex, and first semester grade-point-averages. Only one out of 100 correlation coefficients computed was statistically significant. In a multiple discriminant function, the creativity scores did differentiate among Architecture, Art, and Music curricular groupings. Nevertheless, it was concluded that this test appears to have no utility in enhancing the prediction of course grades. (Author/MS)",

Major emphasis is given to material, published since 1960, regarding Japanese-Americans and Chinese-Americans since the bulk of the literature on Orientals deals with these two groups. The bibliography's organization is similar to the general pattern of the literature: first, articles about social, economic and educational development , with educational development being most recently emphasized. With respect to geographical location, literature initially focuses on Orientals living in their homelands,  and later turns to Oriental and American comparisons, and lastly to Orientals living in the United States. Because of the general scarcity of recent literature on this subgroup, some dissertations are included in this bibliography. An effort has been made to provide detailed annotation and where possible, complete abstracts and alternative sources. ED numbers following some items indicate that the reference is also available from the ERIC system. (Author/JM)",

A 165 question biographical inventory, prepared especially for this study, covered four specific areas: physical characteristics, family history, educational history, and leisure-time activities. Other questions were included. The subjects were also given the Barron-Welsh Art Scale, the Gough Adjective Check List, and the Franck Drawing Completion Test. The procedure in the second study, using 400  female students from seven New York City high schools, paralleled very closely that of the first study. The principal difference was that the girls' study concentrated on a more intensive exploration of the artistic and writing fields. An intensive program of creativity training for the elementary school level was developed, which proved to be of limited success and only with middle class children. Certain products were developed which were suitable for general use, including both assessment and training materials. (Author/JM)",

The evaluation reported here is limited to two aspects of non-public school involvement: (1) evaluation of non-public school involvement in the planning of District decentralized Title I programs, and (2) evaluation of the functioning of those programs organized by 11 Districts in which services were made available only to non-public schools. Participation in planning took three forms: (1) direct participation in the deliberations of the District planning group on the part of  the principals of the non-public schools in that District; or, (2) indirect participation in the work of the District planning group via a representative who transmitted the thinking of the principals of non-public schools who met as a subgroup; or, (3) direct planning for an individual non-public school through meetings of the school principal and District personnel on a one-to-one basis. In several districts, two of these approaches were utilized. (Author/JM)",

The eight projects that were basic to the Title I program in District 23 included a Pre-Kindergarten Program, the basic aims of which were the development of language, perceptual, and cognitive skills in young children. A second project, a Special Primary Program, sought to raise the academic level of participating pupils, particularly those in grades K-3. A Strengthening Early Childhood Education Program was organized to foster reading readiness, listening and speaking skills, and growth in vocabulary and comprehension. To accomplish the goals of these and other projects in the District, a Paraprofessional Resource Program was instituted to train paraprofessionals  and to promote the effectiveness of their work in the classroom. To increase the effectiveness of beginning teachers, Title I funds were used in a Teacher Training Project. The project also sought to increase the effectiveness of teacher-paraprofessional teams working in the classrooms. Two other projects included a Special Library Demonstration program and a Bilingual Program. (Author/JM)",

Yet as school integration has progressed, the number of black principals has sharply decreased.

It was designed to determine if persons with initially negative racial attitudes would change these attitudes by an experimental experience. The research subjects were white students from border southern colleges selected from the anti-Negro half of a large pool of potential subjects. Equally prejudiced persons were selected as controls. The students were hired for part-time work, a natural situation, and discovered only after they began work that they were to have Negro co-workers. The subject was led by the task requirements of the situation and by the actions of his supervisor and co-workers to experience cooperative  contact with one Negro student (a confederate) and to develop a conversational acquaintance with a second worker. At the end of the final session, the subject rated each one on various aspects of competence character and personality. Several months later, the subject responded to the same racial attitudes scale that he took before the experiment. Thus, the possible emergence of both immediate and/or lasting attitude change is assessed. (Author/LM)",

Individual interviews were conducted of 144 black students and a control group of 159 white students. A questionnaire was designed which used both standard survey research scales and original measures of attitudes and protest activities. Important social characteristics which emerged were social class, sex, age, religion, and status as a veteran. Each was related to attitudes toward separatism-integration and toward the political system. Each was also related to participation in protest activities and to attitudes toward oneself. The integration experience itself emerged as both related to  protest activity and certain political attitudes. It was concluded that the integration experience built support for the political system. A vast array of differences in personality, attitudes and behavior was demonstrated among blacks. Evaluation of the positive effect of integration on attitudes and behavior led to strong recommendations to restructure education based on integrated groups, rather than neighborhood. (Author/LM)",

After three years of schooling the children were found to be deficient in verbal comprehension but have no deficits in short-term memory, arithmetic, or perceptual organization. Bilingualism does not appear to be as important as ethnic status. There is some support for treating Spanish-American children as a single group. If they are to be subdivided, it is probably more important to  consider the whole complex of variables making up the ethnic class rather than just bilingualism. Remedial efforts in the cognitive area with third and fourth grade Spanish-American children should concentrate upon vocabulary, general information, verbal analogies, experience with a wide range of social situations and their corresponding rules, verbal classifying procedures, and grammatical form.

The subjects were Negro and white middle- and lower-class students at a Chicago junior college. Measures of motivation and aspiration were obtained from an instrument administered during a class period. Measures of aptitude and achievement were obtained from class records. As predicted, significant racial differences were shown in both aptitude and achievement, with Negroes lower on both. However, no significant racial or social class differences  were obtained on any of the motivational measures. There was no racial difference in scores on a short social desirability scale, and social desirability was, in general, not significantly related to school interest or educational aspiration. However, different correlates of achievement were obtained in the four race-SES subsamples. Whereas among middle-class whites \"test anxiety\" was highly correlated with achievement, among lower-class Negroes and lower-class whites, \"social science interest\" was important. (Author/JM)",

In Chapter Two, a general socio-cultural picture of various aspects of the Puerto Rican community is given, particularly as it relates to the surrounding black community. A number of selected variables in Puerto Rican English are examined in Chapter Three, building on the descriptive framework of variable rules in generative-transformational grammar. Chapter Four deals with the assimilation of linguistic features from Black English  in three groups within the continuum of second generation Puerto Rican speakers in Harlem. The final chapter consists of a nontechnical description of the differences between Puerto Rican English and Standard English among second generation Puerto Ricans in Harlem, intended as a practical guide for educators who want to know some of the main characteristics of the dialect without the formalization or detail that is involved in the third chapter.

Both groups were similar in terms of services received, equipment and supplies available, type of cultural enrichment activities, amount of individual attention, and involvement in the ungraded approach. They differed only in regard to curriculum and instructional methodology. The control group used the regular Newark City School District  curriculum, while the experimental AFS group was taught according to the curriculum and methodology of the African Free School which was designed to satisfy the normal requirements for standard subject matter while introducing culturally related materials and curriculum. The academic achievement of the control group appears to be substantially better than that of the AFS Class concerning word knowledge and problem solving. The evaluators feel that the outcomes may be distorted to some degree by the distinctly small sample and the presence of a number of &quot;underachievers&quot; in the AFS class. (Author/JM)",

Some features of the program included class size not exceeding 20 students, and simple lessons well planned and presented in small sections. Two of the six periods of the school day were devoted to language arts with emphasis on corrective reading. The third period was used for a modified mathematics course. During the remaining three periods, the students were scheduled for physical education and electives. Participation  in extra curricular programs was strongly encouraged. The guidance program was designed to improve their attitudes towards themselves, their peers, and their world. A work-study program on the senior high school level was initiated during the 1966-67 school year. The students continue their academic studies one-half of the day and receive on-the-job training during the remainder of the day.(Author/JM)",

The primary purpose of the program was to prevent participants from dropping out of high school unprepared for future employment, by providing them with a meaningful secondary education program. The students spent the first two weeks of the summer of 1970 on the Kansas State University campus where, along with their teachers and supervisors, they went through a program of orientation and sensitivity training. Then they split into six teams to work at nonprofit institutions and  for governmental agencies. Each team included two teachers and a college-age youth to assist. In regard to the dormitory phase, some staff were not ready to accept the enrollees, nor were the university dormitory staff or occupants, and the enrollees not ready to accept any of them. Lack of authority, administrative trivia, and unfamiliarity with an unstructured situation hindered the organization of the project. However, many goals were reached. A follow-up phase including individual and group counseling was initiated at the beginning of the following school year.

Procedures were developed which could be used by para-educational personnel as instructors under supervision. In addition, the members of the association were concerned with the development of programs which might reduce treatment time, be incorporated into the ongoing school operation, and, be economically feasible. The point of view of the project director, in making final decision on the program model, was that specific development dyslexia was a neurological dysfunction and that  there was strong evidence that this dysfunction was hereditary. Further, that there were related disorders to the specific reading dysfunction, which were probably not of a hereditary nature but resembled dyslexia and included other characteristics as well. The Alphabetic-Phoenetic-Structural Linguistic Approach to Literacy were the materials and methods used. (Author/JM)",

The dropout volumtarily applies for acceptance in the project and is interviewed by the teacher/coordinator. If the prospective trainee's goal is in the broad areas of employment, further training, or a return to regular school, he is informed what assistance the project can offer him. If the young person asks to be enrolled and is accepted, he and the coordinator decide which components of  the Job Upgrading curriculum will best help him achieve his goals, which then become the project objectives for this particular trainee.

A field study and demonstration program were also conducted in three states using interviews with the disabled and their supervisors. Most disabilities did not prevent successful performance of  laboratory jobs, but there was a widespread lack of communication between counselors who advised the disabled and those who hired and trained workers. Of the 693 disabled included in the hospital survey, 91 percent were performing satisfactorily on the job.

The programs discussed are grouped according to those based upon either industry or technology, those centered around the individual projects with a career development or occupational emphasis, and those characterized by an evolutionary approach. Although the literature reveals a widespread concern and involvement in an effort to improve the industrial arts program, there is still no instance where an innovative program has been  implemented across all grade levels. Nor has there been much coordination with programs in other school subjects. Materials presently available vary from philosophical guidelines for adaptation by the teacher, to highly specific text materials and laboratory manuals, available commercially.

Career development education includes experiences which facilitate self-awareness, career-awareness and career decision-making. Before choosing a model for career development, it is necessary to decide on a model for child development. The model developed here borrows heavily from the work of Harvey, Hunt, and Schroder for four basic stages, and proposes four other stages in terms which form the basis for subsequent extension. The career development experiences were combined with the eight stages of child development to form a matrix of 24 cells. Processes and media appropriate to each cell were derived, thus providing a matrix which serves as a base from which activities can be generated.  (GEB)",

Because this program has been growing rapidly, teacher education activities have not kept up with the expansion. An institute, consisting of 85 participants, six staff members, and 13 consultants, included: general presentations, panel discussions, small group discussions, micro-experiences and informal activities. As a result of the institute, a publication of the guidelines and general presentations was compiled (Volume II of this final report, available as ED 037 581) and a model inservice teacher education course on classroom testing was developed. Based on pre- and posttests, an evaluation of modular  units, and a 1-year followup, the program was judged a success. Recommendations call for continuing efforts to be directed toward the teacher education needs of those in health occupations education. (Author/GEB)",

Among the conclusions of the study were: (1) The cooperative office education programs benefited those students who wanted to begin working immediately after high school, (2) Cooperative office education did not appear to have an effect on the beginning salary, (3) Cooperative office education did appear to have an effect on salary  increases received by beginning workers, (4) A high degree of job satisfaction was indicated by both the cooperative and non-cooperative students, (5) Employers were better satisfied with those beginning office workers who were cooperative office education graduates, and (6) Cooperative office education did not appear to have a significant effect on the quantity or quality of the work performed by the beginning office workers.

No one model clearly boasts more advantages than any other, and the potential user should weigh the costs and benefits of a particular choice of model. However, the author stated a preference for the Occupational Training Information System (OTIS) approach which, for forecasting at the state level, has definite  advantages as a total systems approach. This preference was based on the belief that the OTIS model incorporates components which should make it possible to evaluate the system's total performance and its performance in solving specific problems, particularly those of the disadvantaged worker.

Analyses were performed by organizing and reorganizing the work histories according to the classification. The classification appears to order lower level occupational histories in an efficient way, well beyond chance. Also, all three letters in the Realistic code appear to have predictive validity. The testing of the hypotheses from the theory suggests that the theory can be applied to both adult work histories and vocational choices of high school and college students.  (Author/SB)",

While the study did not purport to cover a representative sample of firms, it did identify approaches used by various businesses within the state of Minnesota. The findings of the study are supplemented by bibliographical materials which will assist in making private manpower planning more adequate. Also, an attempt has been made to: (1) generalize from the survey findings, (2) provide case examples, (3) analyze problems encountered in planning, and (4) develop some basic guidelines for manpower planning by individual firms. Major sections of the monograph are: (1) The Character of Manpower Planning ad Forecasting, (2) Forecasting Techniques: A Review and A Model, (3) The  Minnesota Forecast Survey, (4) Case Examples From the Minnesota Survey, (5) Problems and Guidelines for Micro Manpower Planning, and (6) Research Needs. A selected bibliography of 48 items on manpower planning and forecasting in the firm is included. (Author/JS)",

The elementary program was designed to help students develop an understanding of occupational competence. The prevention of dropouts and individualizing instruction were concerns of the junior high program. For senior high students, dropout prevention, re-enlistment of prior dropouts, and providing occupational experience and information were the major concerns. Two of the centers made arrangements for senior high students to gain work experience, with pay, as teacher's aides during a part of the school day. Two of the junior highs showed positive results during the first year through a close relationship between teacher and  students, and it was decided to curtail expenditures in the elementary area for the 1971-72 year. An expansion of the junior and senior high programs is planned. (GEB)",

Part of this weakness can be traced to the absence of a rationale derived from the body of literature and research and supported by a knowledge of child growth and development. This project was designed to show how knowledge of career development theory and research could be applied to a functional and logically consistent curriculum framework. A suggested outline for career development in Grades 1-8 is presented, which includes: (1) Awareness State: Grades 1-3, (2) Accommodation State: Grades 4-6, and (3) Exploration State: Grades 7-8. Each individual is seen progressing through a number of vocational stages beginning with the formation stage  and extending through the translation-implementation stage. (Author/GEB)",

Conclusions based on data collected and analyzed included: (1) More junior and community colleges should complete a manpower survey, (2) Job analysis surveys should be completed or utilized in occupational program planning, (3) One of the primary methods used in the  development of occupational programs and courses was the reviewing of programs of other institutions, and (4) Most of the decisions pertaining to occupational program identification and development were made by the occupational dean.

Ultimately the contents of this report will be combined with data gathered in two other major areas of investigation to form the basis for the development of a system model and related guidelines for occupational curriculum development and evaluation. Findings, based on a review of the literature and the opinions of consultants, include: (1) The development of a model  should involve the identification of factors relating to the occupational curriculum, whether within the institution or outside the institution, and relating these factors to each other and to the curriculum system as a whole, and (2) The selection of a modeling technique should consider the purpose the model will serve.

Virtually all were black and most were young males. Their employment histories fit the &quot;hard-core unemployed&quot; label, but their attitudes did not match this discouraged and alienated stereotype. Many were unemployed prior to CEP because they were unwilling to accept the menial jobs available to them. While attitudes toward the Columbus CEP were generally favorable, the effectiveness of the program was dependent primarily on the quality of jobs it could make available. The quality of jobs was defined mainly by the wages they paid. Actual and potential participants lost interest when they felt that CEP could not provide jobs that were any better than  those they could get on their own. Retaining jobs following CEP was associated with receiving wage increases, being female, and being referred directly to jobs, rather than attending the orientation-to-work program. (Author)",

Planning and contracting activities discussed are (1) legal research, (2) assessment of needs, (3) requests for proposals, (4) proposals, (5) selection of learning system contractor (LSC) or other program participants, and (6) determination of contracts. Program operation events considered are (1) selection of schools, (2) personnel selection, (3) teacher training, (4) student selection and  transfers, (5) program monitoring, and (6) promoting awareness of the program. Considered under the evaluation phase are (1) program validation, (2) settlement of the LSC contract, (3) program evaluation, and (4) the decision about the future of the program.

Among the recommendations are that the relationship between long- and short-term objectives of a program be examined, that evaluations of programs using behavioral objectives be compared with evaluations of programs not using them to determine the value of behavioral objectives in terms of the instructional-evaluative  process, and that the place of behavioral objectives in open classrooms be studied.

For economically and socially disadvantaged people, education only perpetuates inequality. Financial inequality results in some school districts spending more money per student than other school districts. There is a high positive correlation between a public school student's socioeconomic status and the amount of public money spent on his/her education. What are needed are new forms of school financing where local financing of education is replaced by state, and possibly federal, disbursement of public education funds. However, the essential objective is not to equalize expenditures but to equalize opportunity in the form of compensatory  education programs for the disadvantaged, health care for pregnant women, and post-natal instruction in homemaking and baby care.

Characteristics of stimulus persons were varied in a 2 by 2 factorial design. Pupil characteristics included race (black or white) and class (lower or middle). Different groups of subjects rated each cell of the design. It was hypothesized that high test scores and active and attentive classroom behavior would be associated with higher expectancies in teachers. It was also hypothesized that the results of an earlier study would be replicated, viz. that teachers' ratings of certain behaviors which could be classified as &quot;activity&quot; and as &quot;attentiveness&quot; would predict academic success. The complete design thus amounted to a 3 by 25  factorial, with scores, activity and attention of the stimulus children as repeated measures. Subjects were 120 white elementary school teachers of both sexes attending summer schools. All had taught at least two years. Half of the teachers had been born and always lived in the South; the other half had lived in at least one non-Southern state. Subjects used a five-point scale to assess the probability that children who had just entered school would be reading at grade level by the beginning of grade two. (Author/JM)",

To carry out the study, Lambda Corporation designed and implemented an analysis procedure for systematically assigning students to schools. The analysis system was designed so that it could produce a wide range of different school assignments, ranging from simple neighborhood attendance zones to plans that provide extensive desegregation in a large metropolitan area. The system allows wide latitude in the specification of ground-rules and goals for an assignment. Once these are specified, the system can provide a systematic assignment that is as efficient as possible in  terms of the specified objectives and constraints. Basically three types of publicly available data were required for the study: (1) information on the location and racial composition of the school-age population in each area; (2) information on the location and capacity of the schools in each school district; and, (3) information on the transportation networks in each area, to calculate travel times to assigned schools.

The program ultimately involved three elementary school districts and provided cultural awareness education for more than 90 teachers. In addition there were a number of administrators, special services personnel, as well as school board members who received the training. Potential participants were contacted during the summer. Using the information contained on the application form, the 113 responding teachers were matched according to years of teaching experience, previous contact with disadvantaged children, and school district. They were then randomly allocated to two courses, one which was to begin in September and the other in  January. With few exceptions, the teachers were willing to take the course at the time determined. The program itself consisted of ten three-hour evening sessions held at a local school. Each session had three parts: lecture, question-and-answer period, and the discussion groups. The research design employed was a pretest-posttest control group design with replication. The winter group served as a control for the autumn group. The second training program also provided the opportunity for replication. (Author/JM)",

American Indians present such problems as language difficulties, taciturnity, and suspiciousness. In working with Americans of African descent, the counselor is apt to encounter two kinds of problems, the first related to the counseling process and the second related to the product, goal, or outcome. Because of long geographical isolation and strong resistance to change, residents of Appalachia may be considered an ethnic minority. They, in the counseling relationship, present cultural barriers related to listening, personalism, and language. Spanish heritage groups  introduce a language barrier, demand for respect, machismo, and suspicion as sources of difficulty in counseling. Since American Jews constitute a cultural community, the counselor unfamiliar with the ethos of the group may be ineffectual helping them. To be effective, the non-Japanese counselor needs to understand several aspects of the Japanese American personality: envy and shame, modesty and reserve, and generation differences. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"As the history and statistics of busing indicate, the greatest demand for it has come from rural states, where population is scattered and the consolidated school district is typical. But urban and suburban areas have begun to use busing more heavily than before. Not only has busing become a safety factor in crowded urban areas or suburbs where no sidewalks exist, it has also permitted these areas to develop special schools. Virtually all attempts at unique elementary and high school education now depend on some form of busing. The final result of all this is that the school bus has come to be looked upon as anything but a necessary evil. The following five myths and fictions surrounding the current crisis over school busing offer a final chance to put the issue in perspective:  (1) Busing goes against tradition and represents a break with past approaches to improving education; (2) Busing is the exception and the neighborhood school is always the most desirable; (3) The decision to bus has, until recently, not been guided by social beliefs or principles; (4) Riding on the bus is bad for children; and, (5) Busing is invariably a financial burden on the community. The heart of the busing issue is not the problem of transportation but our national commitment to equality of opportunity for all. (Author/JM)",

Richard Scammon, using one of the important indicators of ethnicity, namely voting patterns, points to both persistence and change in ethnicity in American life. Turning to the social psychological side, Otto von Mering underscores the positive function of ethnicity in identity formation, as well as the distortions and stereotypes which readily emerge in inter-group relations. Finally, Richard Kolm advances some  propositions concerning the meaning of ethnicity, which pose two general types of questions: (1) what is the general nature of ethnicity in the United States, particularly with regard to values?

Schools with the greatest concentrations of white students are losing some of the few black teachers that were added to their faculties between 1968 and 1970. The number of black teachers  south of Eastern and Algonquin parkways dropped from 8.6 percent in 1970 to 7.5 percent in 1971, while the overall percentage of black teachers increased to 31 percent. Out of all white high school students, 96.7 percent attend the four high schools, where at least 85 percent of the teachers also are white. The rapid shift to resegregation in Louisville counters the trend in the nation and the south. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In January 1969, the National Conference of Christians and Jews developed four programs which were designed to help make it possible for a number of Junior and Senior High School age youths, who were handicapped by both racial and economic isolation, to begin to move into the mainstream of community and school life: Student and Administrator, Police-Youth, Socio-drama, and Career Exposure. The programs were based on the assumption that economic and racial isolation among youths adversely affected their motivation, school attendance, civic and community responsibilities, and, especially, their concept of self. Therefore, the programs had two purposes: (1) to more effectively bridge the gap between youths who are behaviorally disordered by reason of racial and/or economic isolation  and youths in the Metropolitan Washington area who do not suffer from these handicaps; and, (2) to further the understanding of the problems faced by disadvantaged youths by other youths, adults, and by those institutions that have a responsibility to serve youth effectively. The overall project is guided by an Advisory Committee, which is composed of Junior and Senior High School age youths, community leaders, educators, manpower specialists, and policemen. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"On May 1, 1972, the Public Education Association held an Educational Forum on Title I, Elementary Secondary Education Act in an attempt to pinpoint and, if possible, clarify some of the major problems and issues, particularly as they relate to New York City. In a decentralized school system, for example, which agency is the Local Educational Agency--that is, the local governing unit officially designated to receive and administer Title I funds? Targeting, or the giving of substantial aid to the highest concentration of eligible children, is another issue: Federal and State officials are challenging past targeting in New York City and are insisting that targeting rules be enforced. The guidelines' mandate on comparability requires that Title I aid supplement, not replace, local  funds. As in targeting, comparability within a district would work very differently from comparability across the city as a whole. Other issues that will bear continuous scrutiny include: (1) &quot;Follow the child,&quot; a regulation permitting Title I funds to follow children who voluntary transfer out of Title I schools into non-Title I schools, but not those who are assigned to non-Title I schools; (2) restrictions in staffing; (3) targeting versus integration; and, (4) planning difficulties caused by annual funding and unworkable timetables.

A 10 percent sample of projects was chosen for study as theoretically representative of the total Statewide Title I program. Each project was visited an average of between two and three times by a trained observer. Additionally, a survey was taken of all school district superintendents in April 1969. The findings of the study point to four characteristics of compensatory education as presently conceived and practiced in Massachusetts, which keep it from efficiently producing significant results of a permanent  nature: (1) Lack of explicit objectives, operationally defined, which deal with the basic problems of the disadvantaged child; (2) Lack of sound designs for evaluating programs; (3) Lack of model compensatory education programs, which demonstrate appropriate curricula and effective teaching methods; and, (4) A critical shortage of well-trained compensatory education manpower.

Motivational patterns on the three scales and on the five factors in Gumpgookies were analyzed between cultures. The motivation-achievement relationship was also obtained by multiple regression analysis. The cross-cultural findings in this study showed that different cultures did provide differential impacts upon the development of  achievement motives as well as upon the association patterns between motivation and performance.

After an understanding of each school's situation was achieved, a select group of fifth year credential students from the University of California at Riverside, School of Education were identified and invited to join the project and complete their academic and practical requirements in the lab schools. From October through December, students met with teachers in the two schools weekly for two-hour meetings with the director for lecture and discussion on multi-ethnic educational topics. In January, many of the  students continued in the program as full-time student teachers, with in-class duties four out of five days, the fifth day being reserved for lectures, workshops, and discussions. Overall program evaluation consisted of administering standard attitude and personality inventories to student teachers, observing them while teaching and in other program activities, and finally relating evaluations by university and school personnel and Title IV staff to the data obtained earlier.

The objective is to establish rapport between the school and the parents in the hope that better communication would help prevent problem students from dropping out of school. Evaluation procedures involved analyses of school records data on absenteeism, lateness for class, and academic achievement in language skills. Questionnaire and interview schedules were used to assess parent, student, and staff attitudes toward the program, toward self, and toward education. Analysis techniques involved simple descriptive  statistics and standard tools for detecting significant group differences. The major findings include the following gains, which were obtained for only one of the two participating high schools: (a) a decrease in absenteeism during the 1969-70 year as compared to the 1968-69 school year; (b) a decrease in being late for classes during the 1969-70 school year as compared to the 1968-69 school year; and, (c) patterns of change in English achievement levels from June 1969 to June 1970 similar to a norm of other students in that high school.

The emphasis was on the sociological processes of selection and differentiation within schools, and the role of education in facilitating or blocking social mobility. A selection of the data from the \"Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey\" were reanalyzed, to compare both schools and students in the ninth and twelfth grades. The findings were, in general, at odds with much of the polemics of school reform, in which educational institutions are criticized for restricting opportunity to lower class or non-white students. When verbal ability is assumed to adequately differentiate pupils, as a criterion  for placement, there is little evidence for discrimination within schools in placement, and no evidence of racial bias. Differences in tested ability accounted for most of the observed segregation within schools by race and class, and, in general, the effects of verbal ability were 3-4 times as important as the combined effects of father's education, occupational prestige, and number of siblings in the family. If more equality of outcomes is desirable, one must question the relevance of tests as a criterion, rather than focusing on schools as agents generating inequality through perpetuating status differentials.

Forty-five male undergraduates at Princeton University were given a task to perform. They then received feedback that they had been either very successful, mediocre, or very unsuccessful in their performance. Following their feedback, subjects were shown, via videotape, the picture rating task used by Rosenthal in a previous experiment. It was found, as predicted, that subjects who underwent a successful experience prior to viewing the photographs, viewed the faces pictured in the photographs as being more successful than subjects who underwent neutral or failure experiences. The next study was designed to test  the hypothesis that subjects who receive consistent and frequent eye contact from experimenters feel more positively about themselves than subjects who receive very little eye contact. Assistant experimenters, blind as to the hypotheses of the experiment, administered the picture rating task to subjects. Half of the assistant experimenters were instructed to make frequent eye contact with subjects while the other half were instructed to avoid eye contact. To test the hypothesis, subjects' self-evaluations were assessed. [This document has been reproduced from the best available copy.] (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Based on introspection and interview techniques of occupational analysis, pedagogical performance requirements were identified for teacher-coordinators of cooperative education programs. Another specific objective of this phase of the project &quot;Model Curricula for Vocational and Technical Teacher Education&quot; was to determine which performance elements were common to a majority of the six programs (off-farm agricultural, distributive, wage-earning home economics, office occupations, special needs, and trade and industrial education), and which were unique to one or a few of the programs. The findings led to the conclusion that performance requirements were very similar for teacher-coordinators of all six secondary-level vocational cooperation programs. Recommendations generated by  the study were: (1) Core offerings should be considered in developing model curricula for the preparation of teacher-coordinators of cooperative education, and (2) Several related and supplemental research and development activities should be completed in the project series.

The project worked to: (1) provide occupational orientation, (2) create favorable attitudes in marginal and disadvantaged students toward education and its contribution to the world of work, (3) relate classroom instruction to an immediate job, (4) provide vocational guidance and job placement, and (5) provide short intensive training for seniors with no previous occupational training. Each school employed a counselor and coordinator of cooperative education. Personnel from participating schools have attended in-service training sessions each quarter. Although comprehensive evaluation would be  premature, preliminary findings show that all eight schools have begun to implement each objective. Reports from each of the local schools are included.

In order to plan, implement, and operate the many complex programs and projects, a number of development training institutes have come into being. A 1962 survey revealed that the focus of the training was on problems of economic planning and that industrial development was considered only incidentally. In order to find ways to overcome this, three agencies established the first inter-regional Working Part on the training of economic administrators of developing countries in industrial development. This document contains the report of the Working Party's meeting in Paris from September 2-10 in 1965. Selected contributions of  the organizers and participants in the meeting are included. (GEB)",

In order to illustrate how the program combines work experience and classroom activities so that students become aware of the possible careers in the health field, this publication follows a typical student through the first year of the project. During the initial stages of the project, the following activities occurred: (1) students from four high schools were recruited, interviewed, and selected for the program, (2) parents were oriented to the program, (3) class programs and educational requirements for each student were determined, (4) teachers were selected and trained, and (5) five hospitals agreed to cooperate as  training stations. Following development of the curriculum during the summer, the training program began in the fall and consisted of classroom activities, clinical experience, and a month-long internship in a cooperating hospital. In evaluating the first year of the program, project staff felt that the program's success was due in large measure to the cooperation of the hospital personnel. This success was achieved by: (1) making sure the program was understood, (2) making the program fit smoothly into each department, (3) listening to department heads, and (4) presenting the program to workers at all levels.

Institute activities consisted of small group discussions and presentations by teaching consultants on such topics as factors contributing to low academic achievement, sociological influences on the disadvantaged, motivating disadvantaged students, and social aspects of the handicapped. Evaluation of the institute was accomplished by a rating scale and by three pre- and post-test instruments which assessed participants' perception of their knowledge,  their attitudes, and their cognitions regarding teaching the disadvantaged. During the 9 months following the institue, each participant was visited twice by institute personnel who provided further aid, observed the extent to which teachers were utilizing methods and techniques learned, and determined the effectiveness of the methods. Two 1-day workshops were held to discuss the results of the teaching methods and provide additional information. (SB)",

A secondary purpose of the study was to present these opinions in a form useful to state and local supervisors of vocational agriculture programs, teacher educators, teachers, advisory councils and local boards of education and school administrators. Among the findings of the study are: (1) More than 90 percent of the administrators indicated preparing youth for agricultural occupations was a major purpose of vocational agriculture, (2) 86 percent of the superintendents in Class A schools indicated girls should be enrolled in vocational agriculture,  and (3) About 78 percent indicated a need for a citizen advisory committee to help plan the local program of vocational agriculture. A major conclusion of the study is that school administrators should be involved in planning new programs and receive considerable instruction in the nature and administration of vocational agriculture programs.

Data were obtained during the workshops and from mail surveys 2 and 6 months after attendance.

Two months later, 22 percent had found permanent jobs, generally in fields other  than aerospace. However, 27 percent of those in a control group found permanent jobs during the same period, indicating that the workshops did not have a positive effect on employment. After 6 months, an additional 25 percent had found employment.

        "description":"In a vocational high school in Ottawa, Canada, with an enrollment of approximately 750 students, 25 different shop courses are available. Students must take six shop courses during the first year, then specialize in two during the second year. During the first 2 years of operation, between two-thirds and three-fourths of those enrolled requested changes in their program. In order to reduce the number of changes, this study sought to provide information, in the form of differential validities, derived from a suitable battery of tests, which would be useful in identifying those occupations most likely to offer rewarding careers to non-academic individuals. Three separate cohorts of students, each containing 350 students, were used in the study of a double cross-validation design  containing four phases. It was concluded that differences in academic performance and performance in shop areas can be predicted with some success for both sexes. (GEB)",

From the total population of 450 metal plants employing over 20 workers each, a stratified sample of 39 plants was chosen and a questionnaire was used to collect the data. Some of the respondents believed that a broad theoretical basis should be given to vocational students, while others thought more time should be devoted to practical work. Several respondents suggested the introduction of a management and production trend.

It was found that the graduates' level of knowledge and extent of training are satisfactory; however, many felt that the requirements need to be raised in several areas.

Specifically, the focus of the dentistry study was on the process of career development with attention to the stability of career choice, while the pharmacy study was concerned with time of career choice. The physician study considered the modifying effect that family-community  environment and high school have upon final career choice. Findings, presented separately for each study, suggest certain considerations for career counselors and for admissions personnel. The first is the individual's self assessment and perceptions of occupations open to him. The second is the selection of applicants by professional schools. (JS)",
