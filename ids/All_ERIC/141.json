        "description":"The focus of a study (a follow-up to work by Rosenthal and others which has indicated that teacher expectancies are fulfilled in student performance) was the kind of teacher behavior which might eventuate following the experimental manipulation of an expectancy which could affect the performance of students. Subjects were female undergraduate teachers (Ts) N=26) and randomly selected sixth and seventh graders (Ss) (N=104) from a midwestern school. Each T was given a lesson plan designed to maximize discussion and IQ scores (randomly assigned and bearing no relation to Ss' actual ability) for each of the four students in her 40-minute microteaching class. Using a specially developed observation instrument, observers categorized behavior in terms of six types of teacher reaction to  student statements. Other data was obtained using the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (Form E) to assess Ts' authoritarianism and the questionnaire to check the credibility of the experimental manipulations and to obtain information about Ts' perceptions of Ss' behavior. Two-way analyses of variance with repeated measures were employed in analyzing data. Support was found for the so-called &quot;interaction quality hypothesis.&quot; Ts did not differ in the amount of attention given to allegedly &quot;gifted&quot; and &quot;nongifted&quot; Ss, but the pattern of attention and praise did differ. An attempt to relate differential teacher behavior to dogmatism was unsuccessful. (JS)",

        "description":"A study of teacher perceptions of student ability as related to first grade reading achievement examined the notions that teacher expectancy does affect the performance of pupils and that teacher expectations are influenced by the sex of the pupil. Female first grade teachers (N=11) in a suburban school provided estimates of the IQ (MIQ) of each pupil after two months of school just prior to administration of the Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test (Form J) to measure IQ (MIQ). At the end of the academic year the Stanford Reading Achievement Test (Form W) was given, its paragraph meaning score serving as the criterion variable. Chi square, analysis of covariance, and regression analysis were used in testing three hypotheses: 1) Estimated cognitive abilities of first grade boys will  be biased downward from the measured while that of girls will be biased upward. 2) When measured cognitive abilities are controlled, reading achievement scores of those pupils whose estimated cognitive abilities are biased upward from the measured cognitive abilities will be greater than the scores of those pupils whose abilities are biased downward. 3) When measured cognitive abilities are controlled, reading achievement scores for first grade girls will be greater than for boys. Data, in the direction hypothesized, offer strong evidence of the relationship between sex-linked teacher perceptions and reading achievement, indicating that teachers' estimates of pupil ability are associated with pupil achievement.

        "description":"This investigation sought to determine the effects of a perceptual modeling concept, presented during the preservice experience, on the verbal behaviors of student teachers in their student teaching experience. Fifty-two preservice teachers were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group received instruction through perceptual modeling of the ten categories of a modified Flanders Interaction Analysis System presented via video tape and discussion. The control group received instruction through discussion and other verbal means only concerning the concepts of the modified Flanders System. Subjects were observed in the classrooms by three observers utilizing a modified Flanders instrument. Verbal behavior was recorded in each of five observations  of 15 minutes each for each subject. A multiple t test program was used to compare the selected verbal behavior variables of the two groups. Student teachers receiving perceptual modeling exhibited significantly different verbal behavior. The experimental group 1) used more acceptance of student feelings, 2) used more praise, 3) used more acceptance and clarification of student ideas, 4) used less lecture, 5) spent less time in direction giving, 6) spent less time in criticizing students, 7) stimulated more student talk, 8) used less extended direct talk, 9) used more indirect talk, and 10) used more extended indirect talk.

Using \"best liked\" and \"least liked\" teachers as originators of the reinforcement, 256 eighth-grade students in Illinois indicated, in relation to each teacher referent, their feelings on a five-point scale about 20 behavioral events typical of those used by teachers in reinforcing students. A 2x2x3 analysis of variance was performed to determine the influence of the student's sex, social class, and attitude toward the teacher on the significance he attached to the positive reinforcement she offers. Student attitude toward the teacher, sex, and social class were found to be significantly related to  how the student regards the teacher's reinforcement. Relationships among certain variables were conceptualized in terms of Newcomb's balance theory. (Author/JS)",

The rationale for cooperation and partnership is examined, and five of the common forms of partnership are described: internship, teacher centers, laboratory centers, regional councils, and partnership at state level. The author then considers some of the issues and problems involved in the current situation, as well as the promising developments, including the increasing participation of state departments of education and teacher unions and associations. Four probable future  developments are identified as 1) greater emphasis on partnership at the state level; 2) an increasing participation by teacher organizations; 3) the development of the teaching center as the clinical dimension of teacher education; and 4) a greatly increased student participation in the decision-making structure.

Some of these questions are: What are the basic qualities and abilities that a teacher must have? Who will decide on these qualities and abilities? How will they be measured? Who needs to be certified? The trend toward accountability and performance criteria for certification is an encouraging step, but it is just a step. Such an approach needs further consideration in order to develop a rationale and workable procedures. Another change being demanded is to give teachers control over entry into the profession. This too is a good idea, but before teachers can be given such control they must present a feasible plan. There are many other problems and  paradoxes which complicate the issue of teacher certification, such as the conflict between human and intellectual values, student attitudes toward education, and efforts to recruit minority group members into teaching while still maintaining high standards.

The last half of the report consists of appendixes containing materials used in the study--questionnaires and interview schedules--and data tables. (RT)",

Edward Ducharme, in &quot;The Evasion of the Text,&quot; submits that superficial aspects of literature rather than skills in textual analysis are being taught to future English teachers, and defends his point with evidence from an exercise in poetic analysis in which more than 160 prospective English teachers failed to detect the underlying irony in Wylie's poem. Charles Hoffman, in &quot;Invasion of the Text,&quot; submits that Wylie's poem is not ironic in tone, that Ducharme is infusing his own life view into his interpretation  rather than using biographical criticism and the corpus of Wylie's work to determine the poem's meaning. Ducharme, in &quot;Again, Evasion of the Text,&quot; defends his view that understanding literature depends, not on secondary sources, but on the confrontation between reader and literary work, and explicates the poem to indicate where the irony lies. Finally, Edward Kelly defends an ironic interpretation of the poem, faults both Ducharme and Hoffman for relying on fixed literary positions, and analyzes the poem by both external and internal literary means.

In this secondary school summer reading program, at the Holderness School for Boys in Plymouth, New Hampshire, teachers decided to assign 16 books--four books to be read by students in each of the 4 years of English. Two criteria were established for book selection: (1) each book must be capable of being handled by students without outside help; and (2) each book must be enjoyable and challenging. Teachers compiled a study guide for each book, containing an introduction, writing topics, and a list of recommended books dealing with the same subject covered in the book being read. One fourth of the student's grade for the Fall Term was based on the four essays which he wrote on his summer reading. The  program resulted in improved class discussion during the early weeks of school and students' increased capacity to understand literature on their own.

        "description":"Instead of emphasizing forms and types, teachers of communication should emphasize the kinds of actions that verbal communications are--both for those who make them and for those who receive them. Because, in verbal communication, language becomes a vehicle by which we exert \"force\" on another, language arts studies ought to begin with the study of the attitudes and impulses which result in communication. Moreover, both teachers and students should be educated to feel that the rewards of communication outweigh its risks. Some movement in this direction has already been accomplished: newer teaching materials emphasize human problems and resources as well as the processes and tasks that children need to understand before mastering the art of influential communication. However, an  overemphasis on formal and ritualistic aspects of communication still exists (e.g., in communication theory and generative grammar). To overcome this, speech and English teachers must put the human actions of all communications at the centers of their curriculums. (DD)",

        "description":"Recent investigations in the field of speech pathology are focusing increasingly on possible relationships among the pathological natures of those speech disorders having an emotional base (e.g., stuttering, stagefright, reticence). The psychological and sociological context of reticence--the avoidance of social and verbal interaction--should be of particular concern to teachers of public speaking, since existing pedagogy either ignores this problem altogether or, by insisting on every student's full participation in the \"recitation-criticism\" aspects of public speaking courses, actually penalizes reticence or intensifies the problem. Teachers of public speaking have in the past often assumed that everyone is trainable to some extent in communication skills and that strength of  will is sufficient to remedy any human difficulty. What is actually needed, however, is a clinical approach to this disorder that can be readily applied in the public speaking classroom, and a revision of the \"recitation-criticism\" teaching methodology.

Eighty fourth-grade and 80 sixth-grade children (8% black) from working-class families, showing a mean IQ of 106 with a standard deviation of 12, were given a picture as a stimulus and asked to write a composition based on it. Types of linguistic structures and deviations were then tabulated. The discourse samples were grouped into three categories--high, medium, and low--and then compared on each of 63 measures. Themes rated high were longer than average while low themes were shorter and showed little use of such  structures as subordinate clauses, modals and adverbs. Grade and sex differences were apparent in the measures, with females producing more discourse than males and sixth graders writing longer T-units than fourth graders. Only 24 categories of syntactic deviations appeared and the lexical deviations also seemed to fall into a few general groups. It was concluded that such groupings present the possibility of a rational approach to teaching the standard syntax and spelling. (Further implications of the study, tables of research findings, and a list of references are given.) (Author/MF)",

Nineteen children in a second grade class for the gifted were asked to write a one-page composition at the beginning of the experiment; were exposed to a series of sentence expansion techniques for eight 20-minute sessions; wrote a second composition, structured to discover how they were employing learned techniques; and after four more sessions, wrote a final unstructured one-page composition which provided information on the subordinate clause index and average clause length. Ten of the 19 children increased their subordinate clause  index, and substantial gains were made in increasing sentence length.

        "description":"This IRCD Bulletin issue contains two papers. One, by Harold L. Cohen, summarizes two of his previously prepared papers in which he discusses his approach to learning behaviors. He describes the use of reinforcements as motivators for academic and social learning at a Federal correctional institution. Cohen states that &quot;The design and use of new schedules of reinforcement in a contingency oriented environment, the use of programed instruction, and a design of a new curriculum produce academically competent youngsters who now recognize that they are becoming successful in an area which for them was previously failure. This is no longer a laboratory theory but a proven fact.&quot; The second paper, by Joan D. Gussow, reviews the theory of operant conditioning and relates it to  education. Discussed are some applications and techniques of contingency management. In rebuttal to those who raise a moral issue about the application of conditioning theory to education, she notes that it can be viewed as &quot;a technology, a tactic, capable of helping us reach our strategic educational goals.&quot; A selected bibliography on the experimental analysis of behavior is included.

Trainees, organized into teams of 10-13, each led by a young adult team leader, engaged in a daily 2-hour classroom session and a daily 4-hour work session. In many cases, they designed their  own afternoon work projects in the community. The project was characterized by intensive community involvement. The findings of a questionnaire evaluation showed that the trainees were interested in a wide range of occupations, including nonprofessional jobs, and that they disliked occupations associated with the opposite sex.

Guidelines are provided in the areas of: (1) characteristics of persons with special needs, (2) characteristics of the Negro sub-culture and the additional problems of this group, (3) guidelines for teacher education programs, and (4) guidelines for programs for persons with special needs. These are general or working guidelines and will be revised, reworked and rewritten as vocational educators increase their knowledge and understandings of persons with special needs. (MM)",

The average nonwhite college graduate can expect to earn less during his lifetime than the white who has never gone beyond elementary school. Traditional patterns of discrimination have caused counselors and parents to discourage minority group youngsters from choosing \"closed\" occupations, and it is important that these young people be informed of opportunities and trained to take advantage of them. This pamphlet discusses significant developments affecting equal employment opportunities since 1960 at the  federal and state level, and special studies and surveys, using current statistical and factual information. The origin and nature of merit employment by private employers, and government and private techniques used to implement it are described. Wherever management has established a firm policy of merit employment, the results have almost invariably been remedial and beneficial. (CH)",

After stratification of an industry by the relative size of the firm's work force, samples were chosen randomly from each class of firms. Each interviewer was assigned to interview only three firms, all within an industry with which he was acquainted. A 1-day training session of interviewers explained the background and purposes of the study. The questionnaires were tabulated by relative size of firm and by industry. Employer schedules which had been left with cooperating employers, were  separated, and those with job vacancies were tabulated with assigned occupational codes. Conclusions of a lack of universal interest in job vacancy records and a number of uncertainties which could effect a job vacancy program, led to the recommendation that other means be explored before collection of these data from employers be undertaken.

Usable questionnaires numbered 2,361 or 81 percent of the employed PN population. Approximately 9 percent of the practical nurses were already studying to become registered nurses and at least 66.5 percent were interested in so doing. The practical nurses considered basic training in nursing theory and clinical practice important, and rated practical nurse experience more important than academic courses in the preparation of the RN. Recommendations resulting from the study included a half-time work, half-time study, full income plan to  upgrade nurse aides to practical nurses and practical nurses to registered nurses, financed, except for tuition, by cost of salaries represented by position vacancies; and reduction of training time through such approaches as proficiency testing and coverage of required clinical experience during working hours.

The effective adoption of these innovations to vocational-technical teacher education programs requires systematic research and experimentation. Study Number One \"Improving Inservice Education,\" proposes that a confrontation of his classroom behavior on video tape recordings will increase the teachers' awareness of the need to modify certain behavioral patterns in the classroom. A systematic analysis of the video tape and the development of competency in specific teaching skills through micro-teaching will facilitate this change. Study Number Two \"Improving Student Teaching,\"  hypothesizes that the augmentation of regular method courses with experiences in a micro-teaching laboratory during the student period by the student teacher, cooperating teachers, and college supervisor would improve the preparation of perspective student teachers.

Aspects of the subject covered by this survey are manpower audit, motivation, temporary help, handling of job changes, and the union's effect on manpower utilization. Sixty-five percent of the participating companies employ 1,000 or more employees. It was found that 86 percent of the companies communicate company goals to employees, and 76 percent report that they take steps to identify individual employee's goals. More than one-fourth report some experience in tailoring a job to fit an employee's talents. More than half of the companies have some plan for coordinating staffing requirements so that surplus manpower in one area can be loaned to other areas with  shortages. Of those companies that have compared the efficiency of regular employees on overtime with the efficiency of temporary employees, 45 percent say that the regular employees are more efficient, while 30 percent found the reverse to be true. Topics covered by the report include Manpower Analysis, Achieving Effective Utilization of Manpower, Manpower Shortages, and Problems in Accomplishing Proper Utilization of Manpower. (CH)",

Major industries are covered in 40 separate reports in the bulletin, some covering groups of related industries, and the emphasis in each report is on the outlook for technological changes. Statistical data pertaining to productivity, production, employment trends, investment, and research development, all of which provide a  quantitative basis for assessing the implications of technological change, are shown in charts and tables and are analyzed in the text. Among the implications were: (1) All industries will be affected, to some degree, by changes in equipment, methods of production, materials, and products, (2) Employment prospects in the industries studied are generally favorable, and (3) Prospective technological changes will continue to reduce the proportion of jobs involving primarily physical and manual ability and to increase the need for jobs requiring ability to work with data and information.

The internal labor market is an administrative unit, within which are performed the market functions of pricing, allocating, and often of training labor. It is governed by a set of institutional rules  covering recruitment procedures, training, compensation, and the like, over which the employer exercised discretionary control. These internal mechanisms constitute the alternative modes of adjustment to changes in both production techniques and labor market conditions. Implications of the internal market are discussed in relation to federal programs of job training, recruitment and screening, coordination of public and private training programs, and governmental manpower planning and labor force adjustment programs.

        "description":"The purpose of this bulletin is to briefly review relationships of employment, income, and family structure to civil rights of the American Negro population in recent years, and to stimulate the design of new and more effective policies and of more penetrating research activities regarding these relationships. Economic, sociological, and psychological dimensions of the problem of assuring civil rights for the Negro minority are sketched. The observations and factual content of the bulletin are based on a broad background of research and action-program experience in the fields of manpower and community development. Frequent use is made of tables to present data which is discussed fully. The information and discussion is used to form specific conclusions having policy, program, and  research implications for governmental agencies. General research needs, such as better surveys of Negro social and economic characteristics, and a permanent clearinghouse for research results, are discussed. In addition, 19 specific areas in which sociological, psychological, and economic research is necessary are presented with suggestions regarding the nature of the needed research. Although the report focuses on Negroes, many of the points and recommendations are equally applicable to other minorities as well as other groups of disadvantaged individuals. (ET)",

The 3-month nurse aide training program included 1 month of formal classroom training at the college and 2 months of supervised training in a hospital. A total of 51 students entered four classes over a 1-year period. Seventeen of the students were employed as nurse aides almost immediately upon graduation. Eight were placed by the counselor in civil service jobs which provided the opportunity for higher salaries; however, it was believed that this group would otherwise have bee n employed as nurse aides. Fourteen students married, were ill, or were unavailable for follow-up. Two were not employed but were waiting for placement as  nurse aides. Thirteen were unable to complete the program for reasons ranging from inability to learn simple procedures to behavior problems which accounted for the greatest number of failures. Recommendations included: (1) requirements of a minimal reading level, (2) allowance of program time for adjustment, and (3) screening in relation to behavior and adjustment. Scores are presented for various psychological tests. (JK)",

The major purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which electronic equipment can assist in the instruction of stenography, and to discover the problem arising from the use of such equipment on the part of the teacher and the student. Objectives were: (1) to provide an opportunity for teachers to become familiar with the use of electronic equipment, (2) to determine teacher reaction, student reaction, and desirable facilities, (3) to determine what variations in teaching method and techniques evolve,  (4) to determine the extent to which electronic equipment may be employed to provide individual instruction, and (5) to suggest possible research in the use of electronic equipment in the stenography classroom. Over 200 shorthand teachers and department chairmen from approximately 175 schools had personal opportunity to consider the use of multi-channel equipment in stenography classroom, plus hands-on experience with the equipment.

        "description":"The original purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine opportunities existing in farming and current methods of getting established in farming. However, the purpose was subsequently broadened to a study of the nature of student decision-making. Factors which were considered to be associated with decision-making include family background, individual ability and school performance. Over a 7-year period, data were collected primarily by questionnaires from two groups of participating students. The initial group of 764 graduating seniors first completed questionnaires in the spring of 1956. In the fall of 1957, a second group of 1,107 male matriculating freshmen in the same 31 high schools located in five geographically distributed Wisconsin counties, participated in the  project. The resulting data presented in a series of tables help the understanding of why students make certain decisions. (CH)",

Increased emphasis on agricultural occupation programs, adult farmer programs, and the unification of small rural high schools resulting in increased concentration of students have resulted in expansion of programs being offered. The five areas of the guidelines are: (1) justification for an additional teacher, (2) administration of the multiple-teacher department, (3) teacher responsibilities with the department, (4) Future Farmers of America (FFA), and (5) facilities for the department.

The development of a self-instructional package for teaching medical terminology appeared to be particularly desirable. Study findings are discussed under the headings: (1) objectives, services, and procedures for a state-wide tumor registry system, (2) centralization of activities, (3) alternative systems, (4) relation between procedural alternatives and physician involvement in record abstracting, (5) training implications, and (6) research projects.

        "description":"To provide a description of male Negro youth in the Mississippi Delta, a study was conducted to assess their educational and occupational aspirations, preferences, and aptitudes, and to recommend relevant educational programs. The sample consisted of 197 rural and 380 urban 12th grade students from 12 high schools in 11 counties having a majority of Negro youth. Some findings were: (1) 70 percent of the students were from families with incomes of less than $3000, (2) Aspirations of urban youth were higher, (3) A youth's mother was most influential in guiding his educational aspiration, (4) 29 percent aspired to a 4-year college degree but two-thirds lacked the necessary finances, (5) Aspiration for a 2-year terminal degree was low, (6) There was a critical lack of realistic  occupational information available to students, (7) Generally, urban youth scored higher in aptitude, (8) The sample scored relatively higher on manual dexterity than on intelligence tests, and (9) 63-74 percent expressed preference for personal service or manual labor occupations. Some recommendations were that additional well-trained counseling and guidance personnel be utilized, and that junior high school level occupational information programs be implemented. (DM)",

The target population was students involved directly in college education, and the verbal system is that associated with the titles of major high-level professions and occupations. The marked agreement between all groups of subjects indicates that all college and university students in the United States share in one main system of beliefs about the higher level occupational world, and that the images are formed in early pre-high school years.

The administration should specify the institutional commitment to correspondence studies, the resources it will allocate, and the recognition and reward it will give to participating faculty. All faculty felt that the  State had a definite commitment to its citizens to provide correspondence courses. Correspondence programs might be made more effective by establishing a central organization for correspondence and continuing education services; by eliminating duplications in the state; or by inviting the participation of the community colleges.

Five two-week University of Rochester summer schools, attended by a total of 472 Britishers of widely varied ages and occupations, were the central part of this experiment. Lectures, discussion, industrial visits, and local tours were the principal activities, although the itineraries and program themes varied from year to year. In particular, British participants tended to withhold criticism and to report increased knowledge and  appreciation of many aspects of life and work in the United States. A visit to Hull by two Negro leaders from Rochester, and the attendance of 24 Americans at an Anglo-American summer school in 1966, were among the other highlights of the exchange program.

A recent study of separations in NASA indicates that the loss rate is highest among younger employees, particularly in the administrative-management occupations. This indicates a need for more follow-up on the careers of young NASA people. Controllable conditions under which MI programs will best serve some of the agency's long range manpower requirements include: (1) clearing and agreeing upon the MI program objectives and plans by high and intermediate levels of agency  management; (2) at least one policy level individual's active participation in the program is needed; (3) MI programs thrive for the long term only when their products earn status in the eyes of management; (4) MI program directors must be responsible for and have commensurate authority to react in the best interests of the program and the NASA mission; (5) MI programs should be tailored to the manpower needs and resources of each center.

The Federation of Charlestown Organizations, area colleges and universities, public and private industry, and social agencies have contributed to its development. The program aims to locate, identify, and motivate the older adult; to direct his selection of a job and preparation for it; to place him in a job; or create a new job for him. Informal recruitment methods have been found most effective; these include direct contact or promotion by church, business, union, or fraternal service groups, and the Massachusetts Division of Security. The average applicant at the Center is 45 or  over, with few job opportunities, poor morale, and lack of confidence; he has been forced into retirement prematurely and has a restrictive pension and insurance plan.

Respondents included four groups: all Kansas county extension directors, professional co-workers, county agricultural extension council executive board members in the selected counties, and selected state extension administrators. Data were gathered through a questionnaire, personally administered. The respondents were asked to indicate how important they perceived the different selected administrative duties to be by scoring them on a five point scale, five being the most important and one the least important. The methods used in analysis were: mean weighted score, rank order coefficient of correlation, and coefficient of  concordance. The study showed that there was more agreement among the respondents as to the rank order of importance of administrative functions of the county extension director than was anticipated. The age variable showed more relationship to the ranking of importance than did any other variable. Sex was the next most important variable studied.

These characteristics were then analyzed to determine which of the trained teachers taught local classes; which teachers delayed before conducting CDAE classes; how many CDAE classes each teacher completed; and from which classes most students dropped out. A greater percentage of the experienced adult education teachers taught local CDAE classes (57%) than did the inexperienced teachers (38%). Of these latter, 22% delayed 90 days before teaching as compared with only 17% of those with an adult education background. Certified adult education  had the fewest student dropouts (8%).

Its aim was to help equalize the knowledge level of city and community representatives concerning issues in urban renewal, and to gain the confidence of local residents and enhance their participation in decision making. Participant education and technical assistance, local and city-wide conferences, a survey of Stuyvesant Heights, a vest-pocket park program, and steps toward a Model Cities program have been among the principal activities to date (1967). The chief result has been that, of all New York City ghetto areas, Bedford-Stuyvesant is the one most ready to receive a Model Cities program. Results have also underlined the importance of consistency of purpose, comprehensive goals,  community organization, political neutrality, flexibility in rate of progress and in funding, concentration on operational rather than basic research, improved communication with the municipal bureaucracy, and the special position of the Center within Pratt Institute and in relation to city departments.

Emphasis is on community service, social reform, community relations, community organization, and other aspects of community development. Institutional objectives are classed as either educational, service, or related to the development of the institution itself. Typical institutional objectives include liberal education, vocational education, community improvement, and a relatively detached stance which stresses research and independent scholarly thought. Also discussed are functions of  universities in community development, and factors in financing and administrative organization. Major criticisms (frequent unsubstantiated claims, insufficient attention to educational objectives) are noted, together with suggestions for a more experimental attitude and wider involvement in such experimentation.

The meeting was initiated with the belief that the academic establishment and the Peace Corps need each other. Three propositions were presented: (1) the Peace Corps should see itself as an educational institution; (2) colleges and universities should become more like the Peace Corps; (3) the relationship between the Peace Corps and American higher education should be permanently committed. As a result of this meeting, Sargeant Shriver established an Education Task Force to raise the level of Peace Corps &quot;training&quot; to &quot;education&quot; in order to see the education of Volunteers as a  two- or three-year process continuing throughout their service. Among ideas from the discussion resulting in the Peace Corps' new education program were (1) a panel of faculty advisors who communicate with Volunteers and visit them overseas for inservice and completion of service conferences, and (2) appropriate recognition by colleges and universities of education for volunteer service.

First, the Peace Corps achieved a new measure of cooperation with the people in its host countries. In the summer of 1968 for the first time, hosts helped to recruit volunteers in the United States and became members of overseas staffs. Second, as volunteers came home, hundreds answered the call of large cities seeking high-quality teachers for low-quality schools. Also during 1968, the Peace Corps shifted a large portion of its training out of the United States and into host countries. Pre-service language training was further intensified. In the future, as more Volunteers apply to the problems of the United States the knowledge and insight acquired in helping people  overseas, the full value of the kind of &quot;education&quot; Peace Corps experience can provide will be realized.

In the first year, the Fund began a program of study and training awards and grants to individuals in the fields of adult education and mass communications. Recipients within these two parts of the Fund's Fellowship program were professionals, semi-professionals, or lay adult leaders from a variety of occupations such as labor, schools, clergy and government. This volume confines itself to the development and growth of these Fellowships. The Directors of the Fund placed high importance upon the  Fellowship program, attested to by the appropriations of $1,968,000 and the way they took part in it through Board committees. These awards have done much to advance the idea and practice of continuing liberal education in the United States, as well as promote the concept of the field's being worthy of the best talents and preparation.

A combination of social and intellectual motivations were attributed to participation. Great satisfaction was expressed, since dissatisfied persons dropped out of the program. The strongest effect of continued participation was an increased knowledge of the liberal arts and humanities, while members also became broader-minded religiously and politically. There was  no effect in esthetic areas nor in serious reading outside the program. Greater interest was expressed in national and world affairs than in the community, but the latter tended to increase with participation in the Great Books program. Participants were active in community organizations and programs to change or improve the community.

The project prepared programs around a variety of subjects in the fields of political, international, economic, and social affairs, and the humanities; tested these materials in experimental form with discussion groups, under a variety of institutional auspices, in different parts of the country, under lay leaders; and distributed the best of them to institutions of higher learning. Programs on over 20 topics were eventually contracted to institutions or individuals, directed by subject matter specialists, and assisted by people who had some knowledge of the group  discussion process. Basic readings were used as a point of departure, supplemented by audiovisual aids such as records and movies. Ultimately, selected universities and colleges established three year &quot;centers&quot; through which discussion groups using the programs were promoted. Conducted from mid-1951 to mid-1958, the discussion project had a total expenditure of two million dollars. The basic evaluation is that &quot;packaged&quot; study-discussion programs, if properly planned and developed, can provide an effective framework for individual study and group discussion of vital issues.

Interest in the subject matter, the  discussion format, desire for intellectual stimulus, and educational level and prestige of the sponsoring agency, attracted participants. The programs attracted more liberals than conservatives, and group members felt others became more tolerant of opposing views, and were stimulated to continue in other educational and cultural activities. Mixed reactions were expressed to having subject matter specialists as leaders. Leaders had even a higher level of education and cultural interest, but tended to play too passive a role in discussion groups. (pt)",

Effectiveness was defined in terms of the degree to which objectives of liberal adult education were achieved: development of mental abilities or skills; changes in values, interests, or attitudes; and increased knowledge. Data were collected from the twelve discussion groups composed of 22 to 28 members, and lectures with 25 to 233 members, by pre and post questionnaires and semi-structured interviewed, and by direct observation. General conclusions were that the same kinds of people were  attracted by both methods: equal satisfaction was expressed with both presentations; and with certain exceptions, both methods had the same effect on participants. Participants were professionals, highly educated, economically established, between 30 and 45 years of age, married, liberal, and over-represented by women and the Jewish religion. Attendance declined throughout the programs, but was accepted as normal for this type of educational program.

The Fund was established to develop, encourage, strengthen, and expand programs, organizations, and research in liberal adult education primarily in the areas of world, political, and economic affairs, and the humanities. The development of educational television took place in three phases (1948-52, 1952-55, and 1956-61), and involved the three synchronized elements of public and professional preparation, physical facilities and financing, and programing. The Fund sought to increase the study discussion method by giving major support to national organizations already providing programs; engaging in experimentation in production, distribution, use and  financing of groups; and supporting research studies in effectiveness of the discussion method. Establishment and support of local institutions and organizations developed in three phases: Test Cities program; Test Centers project; and development of the Demonstration Centers. Work with national organizations involved strengthening of those committed to adult education, persuading others to undertake such efforts, or creating new ones to carry out educational activities. Fellowships were made available to lay and professional leaders, and for planning training programs. (pt)",

Exploration is the free reaching outward, compelled by curiosity, wonder, and excitement. This is not necessarily associated with formal education, but must be achieved through the discipline of order and precision; such growth must continue beyond the beginnings in the home and school. The educational dialogue (conversation) involves a struggle between alternatives; the creative engagement with opposing facts or ideas, either with oneself or others. Unlike other dialogues, the moral and intellectual rules appropriate to mutual enlightment call for insight and understanding, a sense of significance, honesty, mutual respect, and contributions by all members, with  a balance between assent and dissent. Education as creation occurs as an adult turns to the task of making himself grow in understanding of life, of becoming something, by searching for values through literature and discussion. (pt)",

In the case under study, a supplemental budget request had to be submitted to meet expenses incurred by an unforeseen increase in demand for graduate and undergraduate credit courses in the College of General Studies. Accordingly, a written and graphic analysis was made of the budget justification in terms of the total contribution profit concept, break-even analysis, and the multiple functional relations affecting the demand for credit courses. A framework or model was also sought for an intelligent approach in other off-campus departments to planning, prediction, and control of functions. The  resulting tuition increase was accompanied, not by the expected drop in demand, but by an increase. This apparent paradox was attributed to factors other than elasticity of demand (curriculums, total tuition, tuition assistance, promotion) which entered into the final determination of demand. Implications for budgeting and program planning were noted, together with suggestions for further research. (ly)",

The struggle between efforts to to maintain a traditional liberal arts orientation and efforts to expand and emphasize practical, applied arts and sciences was traced, beginning with the short courses and the Farmers' Institutes of the late 1800's. Major changes and points of conflict included the rise of Agricultural Extension, aided by the increasingly popular College of Agriculture, from 1914 until after World War II; the shift of General Extension to fee-charging off-campus and correspondence courses within a relatively  formal academic program; a change of Agricultural Extension emphasis from agricultural education to Four-H and other urban extension services; and increased General Extension involvement during the 1950's and 1960's in broad, problem-oriented, foundation-supported regional development programs.

Cross Cultural Studies (instead of Area Studies) occupied the last nine weeks; feedback materials from Volunteers in the field were used and a much greater responsibility to provide conditions promoting &quot;self-assessment&quot; was assumed.

Task 1 was a forced-choice experiment in which 50 pairs of strings were presented aurally to each subject and he had to select that member of the pair which he felt was the best approximation to a good English sentence. In Task 2, subjects were required to read and rank each string on a scale running from 1 (completely unacceptable) to 5 (completely acceptable). A different order of stimulus presentation was employed on each experimental day; 14 subjects were assigned to one order on the first day and received the other order on the second day. Results show that subjects tend to prefer the same statement over orders and that  rank and preference are highly correlated. There are considerable differences in preference among the 50 pairs of stimulus items. Analysis of the data suggests that this task yields information relevant to the linguistic and in particular the syntactic competence of subjects when applied to grammatically deviant strings. Subjects appear to be trying to cope with the statements by comparing them to acceptable syntactic and/or semantic patterns. (Author/DO)",

This analysis occurs at two stages in the generation process--during insertion of lexical items (more precisely, in testing contextual features), and during the transformation process, when individual transformations are being tested for applicability. In this paper the authors describe a formal system for the definition of tree structure of sentences. The system consists of a formal language for partial or complete definition of the tree structure of a sentence, plus an algorithm for comparison of such a definition with a tree. It represents a significant generalization of Chomsky's notion of \"proper analysis,\" and is  flexible enough to be used within any transformational grammar which the authors have seen.

It involves, rather, knowing a set of items--sound segments, sentence patterns, lexical items--which must be made a matter of automatic habit. Various approaches to testing someone's use of a language have failed to take into account two vital truths about language: it is redundant, and it is creative. Redundancy, which may seem wasteful of effort, is of great use, as it reduces the possibility of error and permits communication where there is some interference in the communication channel (i.e., noise). Implications are that knowing a language involves the ability to understand a distorted message, and that theoretical questions may be raised about the  value of deciding a person knows a language because he knows certain items in the language. Other implications are that one may learn a language just as well by listening as by speaking, and that we can find out about \"knowledge of a language\" equally well when we test passive and active skills, because the same linguistic competence, the same knowledge of rules, underlies both kinds of performance. One approach to test ability in a second language may be to add noise, or mask portions of text. (AMM)",

        "description":"Both sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics are relatively recent areas of study and they tend to overlap. One way in which they overlap is in the selection of topics, among them bilingualism and linguistic relativity. Studies of linguistic relativity demonstrate that, although there are clear surface distinctions between the way languages map physical reality, and although these distinctions may influence the ease of memory and description, there is no evidence that these differences are fundamental or that they prevent the formation of concepts. Concerning the question of how bilingualism affects language development, no final statements can be made. One extreme position, the balance theory, holds that each individual has only a certain amount of language learning ability and  if it is divided between two languages, the knowledge of each language will be weaker. At present language testing instruments are not precise enough to test this hypothesis. While the evidence now collected seems to favor the balance theory, a great deal more study is needed on this complex question. Therefore, although no one suffers cognitively by learning one language rather than another, there will possibly be some loss in linguistic ability when two languages are learned. Unless this is offset by increased motivation, there will be a loss in other subjects. Bilingual education is closely tied to a society that accepts both languages. (JD)",

The subjects were native speakers from the Cearense, Fluminense, Caipira and Sao Paulo dialect areas. Results of the preliminary aural recognition test proved inconclusive. The instrument tests showed a maximal differentiation between /l/ and /u/ in  utterance-final position after a vowel revealed in the speech of the Sao Paulo and virtually all measurable distinction between /l/ and /u/ in this position was lost. It was concluded that utterance final /.CVu/ and /.DVl/ (stressed vowels) are characteristically realized as single syllables and that informants distinguish between members of such pairs as &quot;mel&quot;/&quot;meu&quot; on the basis of the nuclear vowel rather than any contrast in the final consonant. Suggestions are given for teaching these sounds to speakers of Spanish and English. (JD)",

        "description":"In this paper the author examines the &quot;encoding-decoding&quot; model of speaking and understanding English. He reviews in detail an objection to the model: that it was specifically designed with a view to incorporating linguistic theories, such as syntax, into it. As a result, what it more or or less accurately represents is the relation between the linguist and some language other than his own which he may be studying. However, this relation is necessarily quite different from that holding between the competent speaker-hearer and his own language. What seems to be required of an explanation of how we understand English is that it describe how, on hearing an utterance, we attain an appropriate terminal state. This is a description that the encoding-decoding model clearly fails to  provide. What it does describe is a terminal event (the emission of a signal). Even if the model were revised so that it did describe a terminal state, that state could not account for understanding an utterance. The author believes, however, that (with a few refinements in the model) there is no reason to take the objections seriously at all. He next discusses the encoding part of the model which accounts for how we speak English. (DO)",

        "description":"Anthropologist Melville Herskovits, in the section on language of his book &quot;The Myth of the Negro Past&quot; (1941), gives one of the first scientific orientations to the study of black speech in the United States. His basic contribution was to establish the following main points: (1) that the black people in the New World came from regions of Africa where languages of the Niger-Congo family (Greenberg classification) were spoken; (2) that inevitably upon initial contact with New World dialects of European languages, speakers of these African languages created pidgins overwhelmingly Niger-Congo in structure and varyingly European in lexicon; and (3) that the pidgins were succeeded by creoles. Looking at Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus cycle from this point of view, the author  believes that Harris emerges as a skilled recorder of such a creolized variety of Southern speech--the black Middle Georgia dialect. The most conspicuous features of this dialect are: the absence of the interdental consonant in any position, palatalization of the voiced and voiceless velar consonants, suppression of all varieties of &quot;r,&quot; deletion of prefixing elements, contraction, and the uninflected verb and genitive. Reasons for all of these phenomena can be found in the Niger-Congo languages. Also compared are the tense systems of Niger-Congo and black dialect speakers. (DO)",

Required to be constantly alert so that cultural assumptions in the teaching materials are not slighted, he must present all levels of speech and leave nothing about the language and culture to chance. The teacher who never leaves his home country encounters much the same situation and problems of adjustment when working with students from another cultural background. He must function in a new cultural situation without the recognition overseas life forces on one's awareness of the cultural differences. The program in Foreign Language Education at the University of Texas has been arranging workshops in Bilingualism and the  Teaching of English as a Second Language for teachers in the school system of Texas, and has instituted cultural sensitivity training as a regular workshop feature. The workshop format includes: (1) an anthropological presentation and discussion of cultural differences; (2) a second language situation in which the teacher fills out a standard job application form in an unknown language; (3) a technical explanation of the unknown language; (4) small group discussions of teaching approaches; and (5) technical content and cultural sensitivity sessions.

The single most important motivating force in learning a new language is the attitude of learners and their parents toward the new language and its speakers. Of all the responsibilities the schools have toward parents and the community, five have top priority: (1) developing a large number of truly bilingual teachers; (2) preparing bilingual teacher's aides; (3) establishing improved channels of communication between school and community; (4) developing mutually accepting relationships between English speakers and speakers of a second language; and (5) orienting teachers, supervisors, and curriculum writers in realistic  attitudes toward their learners and their problems. Discussed are suggestions for possible school-community activities and techniques already adapted by some schools. The author stresses the importance of fostering positive attitudes on the part of school personnel toward non-English speaking parents. All the factors within the community--the language spoken by the majority of its members, and the socioeconomic and literacy levels--should be considered by the teachers and administrators. (AMM)",

        "description":"This paper represents an effort to explain the language development of the child within the analytic frame of overtly observable data and without recourse either to mathematical models or to postulating hypothetical underlying forms. From longitudinal studies of two-year old children conducted by the author as well as from similar data reported in the literature, it appears that the function of repetition in child language is twofold: (1) as a learning device for the retention of items newly acquired through imitation and (2) as a means of easing the process of conveying the message. Improvement of communication is the principle aim of the child's efforts to shape his language to the sociolinguistic pattern of others significant to him. Repetition's function of easing the strain  of the message in its bare essentials only fulfills the same purpose that redundancy does in adult language. As a matter of fact, repetition ceases when the child's speech progresses to the point of employing functors as a part of a synthetic construction. (Author/DO)",

After having taught the Jacobs and Rosenbaum \"English Transformational Grammar\" in a graduate course in grammatical theory and analysis, the author contends that the terminology and format of deep structure English grammar are \"unnecessarily troublesome\" at present.

        "description":"This study investigates the structural and functional differences between the non-standard Negro English of northern ghetto areas (NNE) and standard English (SE). The major field work was done in Central Harlem with (1) a geographically random sample of 50 pre-adolescent speakers in Vacation Day Camps, (2) six pre-adolescent and adolescent peer groups in Harlem, studied in individual interviews and group sessions, and (3) a random sample of 100 adults, in a middle-class area and two working-class areas. The linguistic analysis in this volume shows NNE related to SE by differences in low-level rules which have marked effects on surface structure. The -ed suffix, for example, is affected by rules of consonant cluster simplification; systematic variation of such clusters regularly  differentiates past tense clusters from stem clusters, and also registers the strong effect of a following vowel in preserving the cluster. NNE is found to have no third singular -s or possessive suffix, but to have an intact plural -s. The absence of the copula is considered the result of regular phonological rules which remove single consonants remaining after contraction. A NNE negative concord rule distributes the underlying negative particle more consistently and to a wider range of environments than in white non-standard English. Repetition tests showed that many NNE speakers understand both NNE and SE forms but produce NNE forms. See AL 001 822 for Volume II. (Author/JD)",

Volume II is directed to a wider range of readers and deals with the differences in the uses of NNE and SE. Included here are a description of the peer groups and vernacular culture studied in Volume I, a description of NNE speech events and group standards of excellence, culture, the subjective evaluation of language differences by adults, and overt attitudes towards language. It is concluded that NNE is a dialect of English with certain extensions and modifications of rules found in other dialects.  The verbal capacities of ghetto children are much greater than those found by other investigators. While structural conflict between NNE and SE is one factor in reading failure, functional conflict (cultural conflict between NNE and SE value systems expressed as different language norms) is the chief problem. It is recommended that children learn to read by reading back their own words, that young, male &quot;auxiliary teachers&quot; be used to mediate between teachers and students, and that the teaching of SE in the early grades be linked to the value system the NNE student brings to school.

Each of the 12 units has a \"preparation stage\" which consists of a self-instructional program together with other activities for the student preparatory to meeting with the instructor or coming to class. Much of this preparatory material is on tape, and it consists of phonology drills (earlier units) and grammar drills and explanations. Following the preparation stage is the \"core stage\" in which material is presented by the instructor in short question-answer exchanges called micro-wave cycles (Stevick, ED 012 897). This stage provides for supervised application and active use of the material introduced in the preparation stage. By means of  the exercises and activities found in the core stage it is hoped that the student can attain a state of overlearning, which he will then maintain by the continued review and use of the material. It is expected that the student knows Spanish since that is the language in which glosses are given in the core stage. Appended are a Cakchiquel chrestomathy, useful sentences and dialogs, games and contests, questions and problems for discussion, verb conjugations, and vocabulary lists.

        "description":"The administrator in a bilingual, bicultural community must act with caution, forebearance, and great understanding, paying intense heed to his community. The term \"bilingualism\" refers to facility in the use of two languages, ranging from a minimal knowledge of either language to a high level of proficiency in both. \"Biculturalism\" is a functioning awareness and participation in two contrasting sociocultures. Biculturalism can be attained without being bilingual; bilingualism can be attained without dual acculturation. In developing a taxonomy for the bilingual program, the psycholinguistics and emotional commitments of the bilingual child should be considered. He may become more committed emotionally to a given concept if taught in one language rather than another. Some program  objectives, which can be measured in terms of behaviors, are (1) the bilingual child will participate in more extra class activities; (2) he will learn more about his cultural values and see the differences between his native culture and the Anglo-American cultural value system; and (3) he will understand the process of acculturation. A discussion of teachers, materials, and testing, and a description of funding sources for bilingual, bicultural programs conclude this study. See related documents Al 001 828 and Al 001 829. (AMM)",

        "description":"The Auditory Discrimination in Depth (A.D.D.) Program suggests that there is a direct relationship between auditory discrimination or auditory perceptual ability and the development of competency in language and literacy skills. (Auditory perceptual ability is defined as the ability to discriminate individual phonemes and to track their changing temporal relationships as oral patterns vary.) Individuals with sub-standard language and literacy skills can often discriminate test pairs correctly as to sameness and difference, but cannot indicate how or where the patterns are different. The A.D.D. Program has proved &quot;effective in developing the ability to conceptualize auditory patterns in detail.&quot; This program, developed in remediation of language and/or literacy problems for both  children and adults, provides for a grasp of the interrelationships between speech, writing, and reading, and establishes a circular auditory-visual-vocal check system which allows each skill to support and reinforce the others. One feature of the program is the use of labeling and syntactical mediation to establish awareness of auditory, visual, and kinesthetic relationships among the phonemes of English.

Program, Auditory Discrimination in Depth,&quot; May 1969, is published by Teaching Resources, 100 Boylston Street, Boston, Mass. 02167.) (AMM)",

Half of the subjects at each level of age were given semantically well integrated (SWI) sentences to learn, while the other half were given semantically poorly integrated (SPI) sentences to learn. The sentences were constructed with the assistance of college associative sentence norms, on the assumption that such norms are a reflection of mature semantic competence. For all measures of recall, the SWI sentences were recalled better than the SPI sentences regardless of age of the subjects. In  addition, there was evidence that the words in SWI sentences were recoded into larger chunks for storage than the words in SPI sentences and that age tended to increase chunking for both SWI and SPI sentences. As anticipated, the only evidence for phrase-chunking was found in the group of seventh graders that was exposed to SPI sentences. (Author/DO)",

It was the purpose of these studies to obtain evidence in support of the &quot;phonetic symbolism&quot; hypothesis. An initial study and two replications were performed with eight adults who spoke only English serving as subjects in each experiment. The subjects agreed about the relationship between vowel sounds and the size of figure regardless of shape. The sound [a] (as in &quot;father&quot;) was more often chosen for large figures while [i] (as in &quot;beat&quot;) was more often chosen for small. A less striking but discernible trend was observed for the labelling of figures with vowel sounds.

This hypothesis was based upon the conclusion derived from previous research that SWI sentences were stored more efficiently than SPI sentences. With the assistance of norms of sequential associative dependencies in active declarative sentences, complex sentences were constructed which contained two underlying sentences: a matrix sentence and an embedded sentence. Under the SWI condition, one of the underlying sentences was an SWI string, while under the SPI condition one was an SPI string. The critical material  (identical for both levels of semantic integration) was contained in the second underlying sentence. The location of the critical material (the matrix or the underlying sentence) was varied. A standard study-test (written recall) procedure was used in a 2 x 2 factorial design with five trials and lists consisting of ten sentences each. The results indicated superior recall for both the SWI and the critical material, and were interpreted in terms of a storage hypothesis. (Author/DO)",

It was predicted and confirmed that this technique would elicit stereotypes based on the dialects. The middle-class white speakers were judged significantly higher than the lower-class white speakers, who in turn were rated significantly higher than the lower-class Negro speakers.

        "description":"The author feels that there is no reason to suppose that adults are less capable than children in learning a second language, given adequate opportunity and motivation. In terms of amount learned in comparable time, the adult is about five times as efficient as the child. This is what would be expected of any other kind of intellectual or rational activity, and that is what second language learning ought to be--an intellectually interesting process. Two types of differences between languages are discussed here--differences in the surface representation of quasi-universal &quot;deep&quot; features, and differences in the &quot;deep&quot; conceptualizations of general human experience (the latter constituting &quot;linguistic relativity&quot;). Linguistic relativity, while a problem for the adult learner, is  also a source of interest, and interest in language itself is one source of motivation for the mature student. The student learning a language in the field must be encouraged to develop initiative, curiosity, empathy, and an awareness of what to look for in the new language. This paper will be published in &quot;The Modern Language Journal,&quot; v53, n5, 1969.

A test of empathy consisting of silent film clips shown at various speeds was shown to subjects who were asked to indicate each observed change in facial expression. A group of 28 subjects took this and additional control tests. Following these tests the subjects learned basic conversations in Japanese in four one-hour sessions. Their pronunciation was then rated by native Japanese speakers on general authenticity and on specific phonetic details for five spontaneous sentences and five sentences repeated after the instructor. The results indicated  differences in speaking skills which were related to two clusters of variables representing independent personality characteristics. An empathy dimension was defined by four variables (tolerance to anxiety, intelligence, involvement in emotional experiences, and perception of emotional expression) and was related to correct pronunciation of specific details in spontaneous sentences (r = +.72). An intuition dimension consisting of three variables was significantly related to general authenticity of pronunciation of repeated sentences (r = +.72). Each cluster was shown to be a significant predictor of skill in second language pronunciation. (Authors/JD)",

The task was to use each of the adjective pairs in a sentence with no restrictions placed on the content or syntactic structure of the sentences produced. It was anticipated that the semantic structure of the HA adjectives would lead subjects to use them to modify the same noun less often than LA adjectives, but to use them to modify the same noun in multiple occurrences of the noun (with contrasting referents) more frequently  than LA adjectives. The data were analyzed for these measures and for one other, the tendency to use the adjectives to modify completely different nouns. The results tended to support the hypotheses. (Author/DO)",

The refusal of its chief proponent to submit to a properly controlled test of his ability, coupled with the inability of observers in independent studies to get comparably low error rates, is sufficient basis for skepticism. There is reason furthermore to doubt whether spectrograms could ever form a valid basis for absolute identification. The present study replicated &quot;The 'Voiceprint' Game&quot; with even more stringent constraints on selection and arrangement of spectrograms representing three undisguised tokens of the same word or phrase by each of three adult male native speakers of North Midland American English. The results show  that (1) most of the similarity between any two spectrograms of the same word is &quot;linguistic,&quot; arising from that particular word's being spoken in the same or similar dialect and context; and (2) differences between the spectrograms of the same word spoken by two different speakers of similar dialects are &quot;small&quot; in comparison to within-speaker variations for that word. The &quot;Voiceprinter&quot; is more properly likened to the &quot;lie detector&quot; in that stable guidelines for interpreting its graphic records appear permanently beyond reach. (Author/AMM)",

Sections on phonetics, phonemics, and suprasegmentals progress from the most simple phonetic data to organization of more complex data into a phonological system. A study of the most troublesome areas of grammar precedes a list of phonologic and morphologic features found to be nearly universally associated with lower-class or non-standard English. Non-verbal aspects of communication are described and  a notational system for haptics given. A detailed analysis and comparison is made of the phonology of Spanish and English, but grammatical systems are not treated in such detail. In the section on language learning and teaching, methods proven by three decades of use in TESOL programs are described, including a sample lesson. Transcriptions of the speech of children from three disadvantaged groups illustrate the pronunciation and some grammatical features of these speakers.

        "description":"In American-Indian and Spanish-American populations, many schools ignore the first language and culture of their students and teach English as a second language in a &quot;hit and miss&quot; manner. Bringing some order out of this chaos has been one of TESOL's most significant contributions. The author feels, however, that there is no substance to teaching English to speakers of other languages in and of itself; it has value only as a means of helping the child communicate in a different medium. In 1967, a case study was made which focused on a Kwakiutl Indian considered particularly well-adapted and bicultural. The summary of the study showed that an individual could make one of five choices in dealing with another culture. He could (1) completely reject the new culture; (2) completely  reject his own culture; (3) reject both cultures and start a new one--e.g., the Peyote religious sect; (4) remain suspended between the two cultural systems, escaping through excessive drinking, with a high degree of anxiety; or (5) participate in two or more cultural systems, moving back and forth between them. The author describes herself as a person having made the fifth choice. She discusses the bilingual, bicultural program for Navajo children at Rough Rock Demonstration School in Chinle, Arizona.

        "description":"The critical shortage of trained personnel for rehabilitation work can be alleviated by careful selection of non-professionals to fill the existing positions. Research suggests that certain personal characteristics of counselors contribute substantially to the effectiveness of changing the behavior of clients. Traits of genuineness, empathy and warmth are characteristic of effective counselors and academic training is less important, as shown by a study involving trained and untrained personnel. Trainers of counselors must also be individuals who have shown competence in counseling, rather than in verbal skills or research techniques. A new source of rehabilitation personnel may be found by establishing voluntary service organizations, similar to Vista or the Peace Corps, which  young Americans may prefer instead of the draft. Besides alleviating the shortage of rehabilitation counselors, the organizations could serve the young by helping them to develop self-images and find their bearings. Voluntary service could also lead to further, professional training. (JS)",

Three major considerations were: (1) How should RESA X relate to local school districts in developing programs for exceptional children; (2) What aid can RESA X provide local school districts to improve their special education offerings?; and (3) How should RESA X organize to carry out its special education role? The report concludes that RESA should strengthen local school districts and enhance their self-sufficiency. Three kinds of help are needed: (1) help in dealing with managerial problems, (2) help to establish and operate programs for exceptional children, and (3) help in providing  pupil services. Finally, it was recommended that RESA should establish a Division of Special Education and Pupil Services. It should appoint a Director for that Division, and also set up a Child Study Center with the Director. (Author/KP)",

The services included intense vocational and personal evaluation, work adjustment training, individual and group counseling, remediation, social services, job placement, follow-up, and special instructions in academic subjects. In addition to the services rendered by JEVS, an effort was made to identify the intellectual, personality, and cultural factors inhibiting adjustment to on-going school instructional programs, so that emphasis might be placed on helping the disadvantaged handicapped youth successfully accommodate to, and succeed in,  school or job. Some 122 (69.1%) of the 276 youth were rehabilitated and helped to make a better adjustment in school, or get and hold jobs in the competitive labor market. (BP)",

The subjects were 288 11th grade students in six rural Wisconsin high schools, who were assigned to five treatment groups or a control situation. After an initial level of ISB was determined by questionnaire, students met with a counselor in either dyadic or group meetings. Statements of ISB were reinforced verbally by the counselor. In one other group situation, they saw a film demonstrating ISB, then met with  the counselor. After treatment, frequency and variety of ISB were reported after three weeks on a questionnaire. Significant differences were found through analysis of variance between experimental and control groups, but no significant differences were found between experimental treatments. Females showed more, and more varied ISB than did males. (BP)",

A follow-up survey two years later, of students who had withdrawn, determined reasons for withdrawal and the nature of the problems these students experienced while still in attendance. Data suggested that salient environmental characteristics of the institution (large, liberal, affluent, secular, academically competitive, and cosmopolitan) were related to attrition, and the relationship differed according to sex. Male student drop-outs tended to be more religious or politically conservative. Female student drop-outs tended to be less esthetically inclined, to come from less wealthy homes, to consider themselves less attractive, and to have lower  verbal aptitude scores. Both sexes, from smaller communities and with lower mathematical aptitudes, tended to drop out. Various university presses, then appear related to student behavior, with the same environmental press having different effects depending on the sex and social-psychological characteristics of the student.

Described are two aspects of a study on essay grading at the high school level in Alberta, Canada: (1) the reliability of scoring procedures, and (2) the effectiveness of the procedures with respect to educational objectives. The grade 12 essay examination was written by 13,000 students. It was scored by 48 readers according to a fixed pattern employing 22 variables grouped according to grammar and content. The following statistical procedures were performed: (1) correlations of scores given by each reader, (2) a factor analysis on the variables to determine what  underlying elements were present, (3) estimations of reliability of scoring by use of correlation means, and (4) an analysis of variance on scores. The effectiveness of the variables was judged. Variables were then grouped according to six factors, and tables to factor loadings and factor descriptions were developed. Style-content variables were found to be very heavily weighted and as this was against the intention of the author, another study, employing a different weighting technique is planned. (JS)",

Results indicated that while college students appear to be interested in constructive social action, most feel too pressed by other obligations to participate. It is theorized that the small minority who participate do so because family and friends place a high value upon social action, or because of that action's relevance to their major field or vocational choice. Colleges should, perhaps, find means to encourage  constructive outlets for social concern. Findings also indicate that constructivists, as distinct from activists, do not appear markedly different from other college students. Volunteers tend to live near campus in residences other than their family home. This appears to indicate that students involved in social action activities have achieved a higher degree of social maturity and have found an independent way to extend family values. (KP)",

There was no correlation between academic experience and overall growth. A measure of the kinds of activities students engage in and estimates of their level of participation in such were tabulated. The level of student satisfaction with the non-academic scene was measured. An average of 38% of the 2,000 students sampled indicated satisfaction with the non-academic scene. Satisfaction with the non-academic scene  correlated significantly with outlets for creative activities, opportunities for social exchange, and increased clarity of position on ethical, philosophical, and religious issues. Students were also asked to choose the one activity, out of nine, which provided the greatest personal satisfaction. \"Self-discovery, self-insight, etc.\" ranked first, with social life last. Findings appear to indicate that personal growth is the most important aspect of \"education\" for the student. (KP)",

More coordination and long range planning regarding early detection of problems should be considered at the elementary school level. In this study, an elementary guidance counselor and a pediatrician were added to the staff of the pupil personnel team of an elementary school. Data was also collected for a control school so that referral patterns, staffing patterns, service functions and outcomes could be compared. Certain trends have become evident: (1) teachers can become sensitized to early identification of student problems; (2) the pediatrician has a valuable contribution to make, aiding the teacher in the  understanding of children; (3) a full time elementary guidance counselor helps coordinate the personnel team, adds to the teacher's sensitivity of pupil problems, and helps move the mental health program towards the individual child; (4) the personnel team can have immediate relevance with suggestions for the teacher of the problem child; (5) parents are willing to become involved if given the opportunity; and (6) use of substitute teachers enhances the classroom teachers involvement.

Four areas of data were gathered: (1) pre- and post-testing, (2) comparison of enrollee behavior prior to and during counseling, (3) a comparative verbal interaction analysis between models, and (4) counselors' evaluation and self report. The counseling brought observable and positive effects.  The team idea of two trained leaders conducting each model worked well, and the models appeared functional for group maintenance and balance of comfort-excitement levels.

        "description":"A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare investigated the relationship between sex role identity and academic achievement. Freshmen and seniors from nine rural Wisconsin high schools completed instruments which measured sex-role identity, self-expectations, self-concepts of ability and educational levels. Results indicated: (1) that while subjects' sex role identities were more in the emergent direction (i.e. a blending of tranditional male and female behaviors) they still viewed appropriate male and female behaviors along traditional lines (i.e. the rugged, unemotional male; the warm, understanding female); (2) that with movement to a more traditional sex-role identity, boys experienced decreased academic success; the opposite was true for girls.  It was concluded that schools are \"feminine institutions,\" supporting traditional feminine roles: girls succeed because they conform to these roles; boys, in rebelling against them and trying to prove their masculinity, do not do as well in their studies. It was suggested that schools foster more emergent sex roles since they are more conducive to academic success. (LS)",

Proceeding through three levels of task complexity (8-, 16-, and 32-stimulus tasks), a stable baseline of performance for each S was attained. Ss then received CER training which utilized a 2100 cycles per second tone as the conditioned stimulus and paired it with a &quot;painful&quot; level of shock. Each S was then administered a seven-question questionnaire and  the Self Analysis Questionnaire. The dependent variables were rate of responding, stimulus presentation time, and response latency.

Reasons why this neomobilistic change does not occur include the poor performance of previously formulated solutions to educational problems, lack of involvement by professionals responsible for the total educational program, and failure to use resources already available. The proposed change model is comprised of five elements, each with specific functions, linked in a general loop configuration: Utilization, information, research, development, and  diffusion. Implementation of the model requires the establishment of a nationwide network of centers for research, development, and dissemination, with adequate attention given to the network's operational aspects of staffing, funding, and political support.

All too often it is the school administrator who is the major deterent to progress. School administrators must take the initiative in pressing for the removal of racial imbalance. Minority groups can tolerate being put off for just so long, and the black separatist movement is a direct result of our inaction. If we continue down the separatist track in education we will have two separate and unequal societies which will end up shooting at each other. This can be prevented if we want to  prevent it. Steps in the solution must include having one curriculum for all children, promoting the concept of \"black identity,\" and unraveling the warped and biased rules of society that really only fit the white, middle class.

        "description":"It has been argued that, compared with the traditional graded form of school organization, the nongraded form is superior in developing pupil classroom behavior, attitudes, and achievement that are related to generally accepted educational objectives. To test the validity of this view, multivariate analyses of covariance were performed on one nongraded experimental group of 224 pupils and two traditional graded control groups totaling 483 pupils, all from the K-6 age range and divided into normal age, underage, and overage groups for purposes of analysis. Results indicate that (1) the nongraded form of organization encourages development of conceptual maturity and participation in group activities; (2) teachers in nongraded schools tend to be more accepting of disorderly pupil  behavior; (3) the graded organization seems to encourage pupil development in achievement, attitude toward school, and contributing activities during teaching episodes; (4) overage pupils in the nongraded school seem to be more contributing members of their classes than overage pupils in graded schools; (5) underage pupils generally scored highest and overage lowest on the measures used; and (6) the research design seems appropriate for use in the evaluation of experimental programs.

There are three major limitations to the use of quantitative techniques in decision making: (1) The techniques used must be applicable to the problem and must reflect the purpose and scope of the problem, (2) the extent to which quantitative techniques are maximally useful to a decision maker is directly proportional to the expertise of the people he must depend upon to develop them, and (3) the consequence of the problem must be defined within limits, thus limiting the applicability of the results. Since man is accountable for the final decision, judgments regarding the value of any decision, plan, or procedure cannot be easily  built in to any quantitative system. Precaution should be taken, therefore, not to limit decisions solely to those dictated by quantification. (HW)",

Several social forces are causing increasing attention to be focused on the division between the two levels. Factors lying behind the growing conflict between the two levels include (1) a breakdown of the traditional forces of educational politics at the elementary-secondary level caused by disunity of teachers and administrators, and (2) the increasing cohesion and political power of higher education. Differing kinds of educational structures in the States are closely related to the operation of political forces between the levels. Financing education,  especially the competition for State funds, is the most critical problem that will affect interlevel relations of the future. Another potential problem area is the control and orientation of education in the 13th and 14th grades along with control over vocational-technical education. In conclusion, the relationship between elementary-secondary and higher education verges on open conflict while policy makers seldom recognize the relationship as one worthy of attention. (HW)",

Teachers, on the other hand, having acquired a great deal of power through the size of their organizations, feel that decentralization poses a threat to this newly acquired power. The result has been tragic and volatile confrontations between community groups and the teacher's union, especially in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville decentralization struggle.

Lessons of the crisis are that the civil rights movement and other developments have triggered an irreversible response in the ghettos; (2) since school systems are the prime means through which social mobility can be achieved, they will continue to receive much attention in the nation's urban struggle; (3) there was a lack of communication between the city board of education and the community's fledgling giverning board; and (4) there were no attempts to hammer out compromises cooperatively.

Most administrators, presently relying on classical statistical techniques restricted to problems having few variables, should be trained to use more sophisticated tools such as systems analysis. The systems analyst, interested in the basic processes of a group or organization, attempts to use available resources to maximize goal attainment. Linear programing provides a valuable tool for the analyst by considering dynamic relationshiips among many variables. Systems management and systems design represent two different levels of activity, the former concerned with day-to-day operation and the latter with organizational patterns. Systems management requires two types of personnel--the system  manager and the system researcher. The manager replaces administrative roles such as the superintendent and principal; the researcher is analogous to the business analyst. The key to the effective performance of these roles--and hence to the benefits of systems analysis--lies in the degree to which suitable training can be provided for role incumbents. (HW)",

After the districts were stratified according to the median salaries offered at the fifth step for the Bachelor's degree and Master's degree, the two highest incentive and the two lowest incentive districts were selected for the study from each SMSA. Hypothesis one was rejected when no significant difference was found in the number of credits attained by individual  teachers in high- and low-incentive districts. The characteristics tested for hypothesis two were sex, marital status, number of children, age, teaching level, and years of experience. Only sex was found to be significantly associated with differential attainment of graduate credits, with men earning on the average 20.24 more credits than women. This difference between male and female teachers may be explained by the males' dissatisfaction with teaching and their desire to move into administration, since promotion is based on achievement of graduate credits.

The institutional variable is the socioeconomic composition of the communities in which the schools are located. Ten schools in a Midwestern urban school system were divided into five high socioeconomic and five low socioeconomic schools and the 10 principals were used as subjects for the study. Problems confronting the principals were identified by direct observation and categorized by means of the Darling taxonomy of administrative problems. Each subject  was observed for 2 full days with 995 problem situations recorded for the &quot;high&quot; group and 1,051 recorded for the &quot;low&quot; group. Analysis using Chi square tests shows that there are significant differences between the distribution of principals' problems in the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; schools with respect to (1) their functions, (2) types of problems they encounter, and (3) origin of their decisions. Different skills are required of principals in the two settings, with principals in the &quot;low&quot; setting encountering more human relations problems and having less time for creative thinking.

        "description":"Collective bargaining in public education differs significantly from collective bargaining in private industry. Whereas bargaining tends to be bilateral between employers and employee organizations in the private sector, it tends to be multilateral (more than two groups involved) in education. Economic analysis gives an explanation for this difference. Two sources of demand occur for public education: User demand for direct personal benefits of education, and nonuser demand for social benefits of education. User demand tends to be more intensive and less sensitive to changes in cost than nonuser demand. These conflicting demands must be reconciled by a political process because shares of the cost of public education are not related to use of, or direct benefit derived from, the  system. When collective bargaining occurs on salaries, the reconciliation of these demand interests is often reflected in multilateral bargaining. That this is so derives from the nature of a public good for which no reasonably priced alternative is available. With private goods, the consumer can switch his demand to other suppliers if the price is too high, but with education all taxpayers are required to pay, regardless of whether they benefit directly from the service.

Devices utilized by the State to influence local decisions included guidelines, contracts, consultants, training programs, conferences, and reports. A survey of over 60 local personnel, the State staff, and State records indicated widespread compliance with State policy. Content analysis of interviewee responses confirmed that State control can be viewed in terms of the French-Raven influence model according to five types  of power: Reward, coercive, legitimate, referent, and expert. Seven conditions were identified as related to the use of State power resources in control relationships: (1) Developmental factors within the overall program, (2) the substantive character of the decision, (3) personality factors, (4) availability of power resources, (5) time and space constraints, (6) the suitability of various types of power to individual schools, and (7) feedback about the effects of previous applications of power.

A widely accepted hypothesis asserts that the composition of State boards of education is a function of the selection process. Evidence collected in a national survey of State board members challenges this longstanding proposition by showing that board members, regardless of how they are selected (appointment or election), comprise a singularly homogenous population. To explain this result, the selection processes were examined in detail. In the appointment process it was found that governors usually have little direct contact with appointees and secure candidates through friends, professional interests, or political necessity. The election process  was universally low keyed and low financed, with little campaign or attention to issues. Furthermore, the State board is rarely a steppingstone to higher office. The reason board members are so much alike is that no one expects the board to be very influential in making or implementing State educational policy. Therefore, only universalistic and undifferentiating standards of public service are applied in selecting board members. (TT)",

The greatest percentage of complaints are against various school regulations, with dress and hair requirements heading the list. Only one-fourth of the schools, usually large- and medium-size senior high schools in suburban or big-city locations, have experienced activism in current political areas such as race relations, the peace movement, or the draft. The instructional  program came up for criticism in 45% of the schools, about evenly distributed among junior and senior high schools in all parts of the nation.

The opening section reviews the highlights of a 1965 survey of part-time teachers in 700 school systems (ED 003 396) and summarizes important findings uncovered in the five communities studied using this background. The core of the report comprises the case histories of the five communities' experiences with part-time teachers. The study suggests that the country abounds with well educated women willing to teach part-time, that part-time teachers are as professional and earn their pay every bit as much as full-time teachers, that obstacles to the use of part-time teachers are institutional rather  than performance related, and that part-time teachers are most successful when used in well planned ways to improve educational quality. Guidelines developed for introducing part-time teachers into a school system include making an inventory of instructional needs, centralizing recruitment of part-time teachers, giving thorough orientation to full- and part-time teachers concerning their use, not worrying unduly about evaluation, sharing information and experience with other schools, and facilitating communication among part-time teachers.

To test the hypotheses, 29 elementary and secondary principals and 15 central office administrative and supervisory personnel of a West Virginia school district were asked to predict the FIRO-B response of one randomly selected teacher from each principal's building. Each teacher was also asked to predict the FIRO-B responses of his or her principal, each  principal having been asked to respond personally to FIRO-B. The accuracy of each principal's prediction for his or her respective teacher was then compared with the accuracy of that teacher's prediction for the principal. Data were collected in interviews.

        "description":"Although the public is best served by governmental agencies which have integrated the major functions of planning, managing, and budgeting, it can be asserted that the planning function is paramount. A review of the evolution of public agency administration in the U.S. reveals that until recent years the planning function has been largely overshadowed by management control concerns. This lack of coordinated planning has resulted in a myriad of incremental agency budgets based on the short term, parochial interests of individual agencies. The introduction of a Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS) to the Defense Department in 1961 provided the impetus for the rapid ascendency of the planning function in Federal program administration. Since PPBS requires public  administrators to plan specific program objectives and to rationally select after systematic consideration of alternative means, those means most compatible with efficient achievement of interagency program goals, comprehensive longrange planning must supplement the traditional management and budgeting functions. Although the potential magnitude of PPBS as an administrative tool is yet unassessed, educational decision makers are expressing increased interest in the possible application of PPBS to school management.

        "description":"Many educational administrators are skeptical of school district attempts to use the planning-programing-budgeting systems (PPBS) tool. This skepticism seems, in large part, to be the result of two factors: (1) A general lack of understanding of the concrete operational steps involved in the implementation of PPBS, and (2) a feeling that the qualitative nature of educational objectives would inhibit the utility of such a tool in educational administration. A review of the Federal Bureau of the Budget Guidelines concerning PPBS implementation in Federal agencies coupled with an analysis of PPBS staffing requirements should help the administrator understand the process of practical implementation. The generally positive evaluation of the contributions of PPBS made by administrators  of such Federal agencies as the United States Information Agency, the Agency for International Development, the State Department, and the Peace Corps serve as evidence of the utility of PPBS in organizational units faced with the difficulties of measuring qualitative objectives. The experience of these agencies may encourage school districts to experiment with PPBS. (JH)",

        "description":"To investigate the leader behavior characteristics of elementary school principals and to examine these characteristics as they relate to organizational climate, 35 randomly selected southern California schools with approximately 715 teachers and principals were studied. The data on organizational climate were collected by means of the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ) by Halpin and Croft, and on the leader behavior characteristics by means of the Fundamental Interpersonal Relationship Orientation-Behavior (FIRO-B) by Schutz, Orientation Inventory (ORI) by Buss, and the Survey on Interpersonal Values (SIV) by Gordon. When little support was found for the original hypothesis, that there exists a significant relationship between leader behavior characteristics  of elementary principals and the organizational climates of their schools, the data were reanalyzed in search of plausible explanations. That the original analyses measured teacher perception of organizational climate as compared to principal perception of leader behavior characteristics constituted one plausible explanation. The findings clearly indicated the presence of a compelling organizational climate stability even when principals were replaced. (HW)",

Scheduling is a complex task even for the traditional equal-time-for-each-subject scheduling. Scheduling should take into account the methodology and learning process of the school. The prime scheduling variables--time, teachers, students, facilities, and curriculum--each have peculiar sets of circumstances and limitations surrounding them and must fit into a complex but complete picture for a proper scheduling rationale to be developed. The allotment of instructional time should vary according to the individual subject. Teachers should be given more preparation time during the school day. Students should be given more responsibility for  their own education, especially in the area of free time. Facilities should be more fully used by keeping classrooms in constant use and by providing teachers with individual offices. Curricula should be more diversified to accommodate all students rather than just college preparatory students. These possibilities are all present when a variable class schedule is employed. It is the principal's role to see that changes are made. (HW)",

The year is divided into four quarters of approximately the same length. Pupils were compelled to attend the first three quarters of the 1968-69 term. Fourth quarter attendance is optional. Pupils choosing to attend the fourth quarter may accelerate, add enrichment courses, or take remedial work. A pupil attending the fourth quarter may choose which three of the next four quarters he wishes to attend, or may attend all four quarters. The financing of the fourth quarter is yet to be solved but it is hoped that State aid will be received.

Results of the third phase are reported of a survey questionnaire sent to all Wisconsin secondary schools to determine the extent to which 18 specified types of superior student activities had been implemented which indicated that both individual and group programs were more often accomplished in larger schools than in smaller ones and that there was more willingness to try procedures involving adding to the regular program than deleting from it.

After a diagnostic evaluation clients were assigned to a job; supervisors, caseworkers, and psychologists provided support or criticism directed toward shaping work attitudes and helping the person see himself realistically. Evaluation techniques considered interpersonal relations, utilization of ability, work satisfaction, adjustment to work pressure, and self concept as a worker. Supervisors and other staff members also rated workers for employability and placeability;  followup studies were done. Of the 159 clients who completed the program, 129 were placed on jobs. Conclusions were that techniques used in the project were practical and effective for the majority of clients and that clients tended to show better adjustment.

Members of the sheltered employed group were assigned to one of five job levels; a job analysis was completed. Data indicated that the VCS maintained its levels of reliability and predictive ability; that it did differentiate between job levels in a  sheltered setting; that the classification of job levels in a sheltered setting could be improved through job analysis. It was also found that the VCS measured four factors: non-intellectual routine work, general ability or intelligence, general health, and maturity of stick-to-it-tiveness; and that the VCS normative data in the institutionalized setting was different from data in a community sheltered workshop setting.

Six adjustment classes in elementary schools and six resource rooms in secondary schools were developed and supported by consultation conferences aimed at psychoeducational diagnoses and including teachers, a psychiatrist, and social workers. Crisis consultations were utilized to handle emergency cases. In the 1966-67 school year, 65 of the 400 crisis consultations concerned suicide; seminars with interested school personnel served 115 teachers, supervisors, and principals; and 727 children, aged 6 to 19, were  referred to the program, 75 of whom were admitted to the adjustment classes and 225 to the resource programs. Aggressive behavior was the most frequent cause of referral. No significant differences in achievement, report card grades, citizenship, absence, or tardiness were found; out of 1,392 ratings by teachers on student behavior, relationship with other children and relationship with authority showed the highest percentage of improvement (69%) while conformity to school rules and participation in class activities were next (64%).

Cooperation was obtained from existing community agencies, participating school districts, and local private practitioners. Center staff included coordinators, psychologists, social workers, a librarian for the visually handicapped, a peripatologist, and consultants in art, music, and physical education. The supplementary classroom program provided placement in the following categories: learning disabilities, hearing handicapped, severely orthopedically handicapped, trainable mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed, and Negro underachievers. Counseling services for  parents, consultative services for supplementary or regular classrooms, resource materials and equipment, and materials and equipment for the visually handicapped and blind were also provided. Both test and non-test sources of data were used to evaluate the project; teacher ratings and consultant reports indicated that most of the pupils were improving in attitudes, skill areas, and group functioning. Of the 131 pupils served in supplementary classrooms, 28 were returned to regular class programs. Teaching methods are reported in case studies. (LE)",

All students were given a series of standardized achievement tests and were asked to complete a school attitude questionnaire. Two experimental (E) classes were significantly superior in all comparisons in mathematics, in two of three comparisons in reading, and in one of three comparisons in science (p=.05). In school systems A and B the E-groups were significantly superior in only two of six comparisons with the C-groups. An analysis of the total performance of all the experimental classes  revealed that they were significantly superior to the controls in only 10 of 21 cases (p=.05). The performances of average E-groups from the same schools were significantly different from C's in only four of 30 comparisons. Responses from questionnaires did not indicate a significant difference in attitudes between the groups. Conclusions were that the acceleration and enrichment program did not hurt either academically talented or average students, that the special program could be improved, and that the program was more appealing to students and teachers than a more traditional approach.

Ten judges graded the relative creativity of the objects by comparing their similarity to an object considered to be standard. The resulting development of a judgmental space for each class was factor analyzed to determine factors of the creativity of the products. Students were administered a battery of personality tests and tests of cognitive characteristics. All of the creativity factors identified contained both personality and cognitive correlates. Factors identified for written products were novelty, flexibility, and openness to  expression; factors for definition of the creativity of artistic objects were inventiveness and novelty; and the creativity of manipulative objects was characterized by the factor of novelty.

Both treated and untreated galvanized stell were tested. Test panels were exposed to three types of atmospheric environments, and results are given. The second paper, \"Corrosion Resistance of Metalized Coatings\", considers corrosion protection of aluminum and zinc coatings applied to low-carbon steel. Panels coated with these metals were exposed to urban, industrial, and marine environments over a nine year period. Thicknesses of  coating, effect of methods of steel preparation and effect of seal coats were studied. (RH)",

Essays written by secondary students in their English classes were rated by multiple independent judges on a number of traits usually considered important: content, organization, style, mechanics, creativity, and overall quality. The essays were key-punched for input to the computer. Computer programs were written to analyze the essays, performing many tests and list lookup procedures, and producing a profile of &quot;proxes&quot; (variables believed to be approximations of important dimensions of the essays). These proxes were then combined through multiple regression to optimize the prediction of  the expert judgments. Across various essays, judges, students, and traits, the computer performed about as accurately (in predicting the expert group) as did the typical human judge. Many other dimensions of the problem were examined, including the use of cliches, passive verbs, and syntactic parsing. A plan of attack was outlined for future investigators. (Author)",

Teachers should assist in developing and implementing new instructional programs to insure continued use of the programed units, as well as flexibility in administering the materials. If the programs are tailored to fit the ability levels of students, learning is effectively improved. The development of a multimedia program should adhere to a systematic plan which can  be trial-tested with selected students, and the program should be modified accordingly. In addition to presenting the details of the development and testing of the multimedia materials, the report consolidates into an example and a checklist of procedures the experience gained during the project in the production of such materials.

Teaching personnel for the project's in-service training program are provided by Southern Illinois University. The goals--academic improvement with better motivation and attendance--are pursued through the use of 16mm educational films, along with other audiovisual materials. Enthusiastic response from staff, students, and parents has resulted in an increase in the number of technicians and specialists on the staff. Each school has a filmstrip library, tape recorders, projectors, and some facilities for the development of materials, as well  as borrowing privileges from the central media center and from other schools. Future plans call for expansion into other media, additions to the existing film library, and more training of personnel. (EM/MT)",

The development of this computer study for the future assignment of 2500 megacycle channels to eligible users in the Greater St. Louis area was an evantual result of this meeting. The body of the report describes a computer program designed to generate the optimal positions for transmitting and receiving units in regions of high density  transmission. The received signal quality and interference levels tolerable are further examined. Descriptions of the relevant variables that must be considered are highly detailed.

Three programs of the BBC 2 production &quot;Medicine Today&quot; were selected as the subject matter for these tests. Clinical tutors and other organizers in ten areas were sent 270 forms on each of the three months to distribute to groups of doctors who met in hospitals and elsewhere to watch the lunchtime transmission of the programs. Replies from the General  Practitioners numbered 104, 95, and 107 respectively for each of the three programs. The semantic differential provided the most valuable assessment of subjective responses so far obtained for these programs and was easily understood by the doctors. Multiple-choice questions following the second program proved to be confusing and were replaced by factual questions for the third program.

In the past these games have been used by the military, by industry, and by social scientists. Simulation emphasizes the inquiry approach to learning. Each student is an independent and individual learner who can interact with others and react to different situations. Advantages claimed for simulation include added motivation, improvement of problem-solving ability, emphasis on communication, and an interdisciplinary approach rarely achieved otherwise. Objections to the use of these games include fear that they breed conformism, emphasize winning over learning, and threaten discipline.

The schools were tested and selected for how scrupulously they had applied the system and, this requirement satisfied, the methods of prescription setting were examined. This examination indicated where and how more variety could be achieved in the individual prescriptions for the children. An evaluation of the area of objectives revealed, not only redundancies, but also the fact that a test used for measuring an objective may itself need re-evaluation. Lastly,  the effectiveness of lesson materials was tested and this showed that some materials were insufficient, and that the methods used for sampling some results were inadequate.

The 200-hour course attended by the second group included, in addition to the dialog repetition, much partially programed morpho-syntactic pattern drill in the language laboratory. Programing considerations were the phonetic features (particularly of the Sandhi phenomena) that are the main sources of error in decoding spoken French. The series of tests administered at the beginning and end of the courses indicated that both  groups had achieved the same degree of improvement. However, the fact that the second group had accomplished the improved level with 40 fewer hours showed that dialog repetition, used in conjunction with pattern drills, was the more effective method.

In response to student activism, educational innovations are underway at the University of California at Berkeley and at San Francisco State College. At Berkeley, the Board of Educational Development (BED), created to give encouragement and approval to new programs designed to improve ways of teaching and learning, has approved 9 student-developed courses. Groups of 3 to 6 students meet with a professor each week for \"tutorials,\" or intensive discussion of readings and lecture materials. Other efforts include work-study arrangements, a summer \"residence college,\" interdisciplinary  courses, one-course pass-fail options, and independent study. The most important change is official sanction by university mechanisms of continuing educational reform. At San Francisco State, the Experimental College was initiated by students, with faculty and administrative assistance and encouragement, to provide a \"counter-environment of freedom\" on the campus. Courses range from fairly technical subjects to explorations in understanding self and society. The attitudes of key faculty, students, and administrators are changing because of their involvement with experimental programs at the College. (WM)",

Section II describes how the functions discussed in Section I are currently \"illogically\" attended to in American colleges and universities.

Separate multiple regression equations for the prediction of instructor ratings and for course evaluations indicated that perceived learning is one of three factors significantly influencing these ratings.

Through the cluster concept, the personal values of the small college have been preserved while it secured facilities of the university. What is not known is whether educational resources have been enriched at a faster rate than the rise in unit cost. The purpose of this study was to examine the assumption that certain offices or services operate more economically on a central basis in cluster colleges than the same offices or functions in individual non-cooperating colleges. Eighteen individual colleges were selected for comparison with 4 of the 5 Claremont Colleges on enrollment, annual expenditures, academic reputation, selectivity, faculty compensation level, assets, endowment, tuition, sex, and  curricular emphasis. Findings reveal that in some areas --library, business office, and health services --there are advantages such as cost benefits and increased resources in a central operation. These profits are gained because the individual small colleges have the size advantage of the group which permits unit costs to decrease at lower enrollment levels. Individual independent colleges, large or small, receive only what they can individually support. For the other areas studied, sufficient data were not available to determine any advantage to cluster or non-cluster colleges. (WM)",

A third address analyzes the causes of student unrest and presents  ways, within a proposed university structure, of resolving issues that cause insurrections among students as well as other campus problems. The fourth paper deals with the meaning of governance, behavioral differences of individuals on various campuses, the value conflict between teaching and research, meaningful communication on institution-wide problems, faculty attitudes toward governance, and administrative leadership.

However, graduate education in predominantly Negro universities has 2 unique functions: (1) to provide programs which meet criteria in terms of adequacy while preparing graduate students for significant roles in the black community, and (2) to stimulate intellectual activity among students and faculty in order that viable graduate programs may become typical rather than the exception. The rapidly changing picture of graduate education in these institutions suggested the need for a study of the status of their graduate programs in 1968. An open-ended questionnaire was sent to administrators at 20 predominantly Negro institutions offering  graduate instruction in the 1963-1964 school year. A total of 1,139 master's degrees and 14 Ph.D degrees were granted by 15 of the 20 institutions in the 1967-1968 academic year. Problems reported include: the recruitment of good students and a capable staff, financial aid for students, allocation of adequate staff time for research, and the need for adequate equipment, supplies, and physical facilities. The paper also discusses the framework within which graduate education in Negro institutions was developed, and considers the future of their graduate work in terms of staffing, students, and programs.

The report is divided into 3 sections, each of which deals with special facets of accelerating curricular change. The first examines social, economic and cultural changes taking place which can be expected to increase and which call for prompt accommodation in the curriculum. The students' attitudes, outlooks and expectations as they react to social and educational changes are discussed. The second section  deals with specific subjects and programs within the curriculum. Obstacles to effecting change are outlined and new orientations for various disciplines are suggested.

In some instances student activists want more participation in decision making, and in others they seek complete control. The organized black students generally use power tactics to gain concessions for themselves rather than to effect drastic alterations in college structure and function. Despite the ends sought by these various groups and although most of them use confrontation tactics, some of the protest reflects legitimate concerns. Instead of adopting an authoritarian posture, it would seem more sensible to acknowledge the presence of student activists, keep  their protest within reasonable bounds, and take a hard look at what forms of \"participatory democracy\" are compatible with the institution's central purpose. For whatever the nature and purposes of the university may be, order on the campus is a necessity, and responsibility for maintaining it must be shared by all members of the campus community. Institutions should be prepared to make functional and structural changes, but it should be emphasized that they exist to serve the larger society rather than to further demands of the moment on their campuses. The kind and degree of participation should depend upon individual capability and performance. (WM)",

The resulting study revealed that communications channels between the federal government and students in the US were inadequate, and that students felt this communications problem to be symptomatic of a more pervasive problem: a general weakening of the sense of \"community\" in the twentieth century. While young people are criticizing today's America, they are also forging the questions and themes for the America of tomorrow. Activist students, in their attempts to bring about change in institutional structures, are adhering either to confrontation  politics--which reflects the belief that US institutions cannot be changed by working within the system but must be confronted from without and forcefully brought to a halt-- or to the politics of participation, which involves working within the system to produce change. The form of change that eventually takes place will depend on 3 factors: the type of leadership that emerges, the capacity of institutions to develop new procedures that provide for student participation, and a personal commitment similar to that of the students. The 9 recommendations in the report represent a synthesis of suggestions from students and faculty at approximately 80 institutions throughout the US. (WM)",

The discussion includes the general organization of the 4-campus University, its responsibilities, the roles to be filled by the individual campuses, and an assessment of the needs of the various disciplines and divisions as the University responds to constantly increasing demands. It aims primarily to provide guidelines within which each of the campuses and the University-wide administration can develop specific programs including detailed costing. This report represents the first step in an ongoing planning process that involves students, faculty and administrators. Each campus developed its own plan by the committee system. In addition, University-wide committees were appointed in  each discipline to consider statewide problems and formulate plans in their particular areas. Reports from all of these participants were then condensed into a single document which was extensively reviewed by all contributors. Some of the major recommendations are: that the capabilities of the 4 campuses be fully integrated and coordinated so that the system can function as a single university; that the principal goals be the educational, social and cultural growth of the individual student at all academic levels; that the education offered be relevant to the times and to the state of Missouri; and that all qualified state residents have the opportunity to attend the University.

Explanations that emerged as to why the governance of academic institutions has become an increasing source of debate were the inadequate adaptation of US college and university structures to social change, the loss of academic institutions' protective coat of isolation as they are drawn into the mainstream of US life, the drastic shift of the institutional balance of power, the loss of college students' bargaining power in influencing policies at their institutions, and the changes in US society and their  influence on students of the late 1960's. It was also agreed that problems exist in university financing curricular planning, institutional efficiency, and the adjudicating of differences of opinion about institutional purposes and roles. Two serious problems must be resolved in order to lessen the conflict over governance: inadequate analysis of the problems of governance, and insufficient understanding or knowledge of the data that exist on these problems. The recommendations in the report focus on these two problems. Summaries of the general sessions of the colloquium are appended. (WM)",

The \"no shows\" constituted 30.4% of all the applicants accepted. Responses were received from 620 persons or 62%. According to the answers: about 86% enrolled elsewhere; only 37% indicated that Stevens Point had been their first choice. The chief reason for enrolling elsewhere was attendance at a school nearer home. Financial  considerations were major determinants of institutional choice, and many of the applicants not enrolled anywhere cited financial difficulties as the chief reason. Final choice of an area of study caused many changed plans. About one-third of the male respondents not enrolled anywhere were in the armed forces.

A report of additional findings compares the characteristics of this group with the &quot;no shows&quot; for whom Stevens Point was NOT a first choice when they applied: It was learned that 60 of the 95 persons not enrolled in any college had chosen Stevens Point, so it can be expected that many of these young people still plan to enroll at the University. Proportionately greater numbers than expected of  students rating Stevens Point first choice enrolled at the University of Wisconsin and branch colleges, in out-of-state colleges and in technical and specialized schools. Fewer than expected enrolled at Wisconsin state universities and other state colleges. Financial problems and change of major appeared to be the most important reasons why students who had preferred Stevens Point chose another school.

The data, compiled from institutional enrollment reports submitted to the Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Commission by colleges and universities in the state, revealed that post-secondary enrollments in Minnesota in the fall of 1967 totaled 148,898 students, of whom 89% attended colleges and universities and 11% attended trade or vocational schools. Public institutions enrolled 74% of the post-secondary students, and men comprised 60% or more of the full-time enrollment at most institutions.  The residence of students tended to reflect the population pattern of the state: the majority, or 82% of all full-time students were residents of Minnesota, 47% of whom came from the 7-county Twin Cities metropolitan area. The in-migration and out-migration of students seemed to offset one another: less than one fifth of all students came from other states, but the number of Minnesota residents who left the state for higher education was even smaller.

Nonconformity was absent and escapism appeared to motivate few students. Service to humanity and achievement of status appeared to be important secondary concerns. A great diversity of reasons were given for first interest in the University, but &quot;visits to the campus&quot; and &quot;friends in school&quot; were the most frequently mentioned.

Training programs are few, mostly because of a denigration of administration by professors. The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) has developed a Department Chairman Program to give deans and chairmen new opportunities for collaborating in ways consistent with academic values. Individual programs are being designed that take into account differences in institutions and in disciplinary interests of chairmen and common interests in role clarification,  development of common reference groups, work on specific administrative topics, and role development. While continuing to run institutes for chairmen and deans on departmental administration, the WICHE program is directed toward 2 efforts: development of ongoing programs of continuing education for chairmen and deans in various regions of the West; and stimulation of complementary activities and organizations within the academic professions. Attention is focused on the new chairman. The program planners hope to encourage deans to use their influence in selecting, evaluating and protecting the interests of chairmen. In helping to define the role and responsibilities of chairmen, the program aims to link administrative training to the resolution of fundamental educational issues.

A new idea, movement or institution may be really the contemporary expression of a permanent human value, not a vehicle for its destruction. (2) The dilemma of its need to be objective versus its desire to be relevant. It is important for the university to examine the kinds of commitments that may have become structured into it. But in making new commitments it must be careful not to replace 1 set of vested interests with  another. (3) The dilemma of its obligation to analyze social action theoretically versus its obligation to be directly involved in that action. The university must contribute in the area of evaluation, theory and innovative ideas to provide perspective for the direct action of others.

Their needs involve such questions as potential alienation, search for identity, and available staff with whom communication is possible. It must now be recognized that it is just as important for advantaged as it is for disadvantaged students that disadvantaged students be on a college campus. Intercultural understanding today is necessary for survival, and integration can only occur in situations  where communication and shared experiences across cultural barriers become reality. Among other things, colleges now need to change instructional practices, examine curricula in terms of their relevance to the components of the student body, and provide counseling that covers a broader spectrum than that normally provided. To fulfill the moral and educational responsibilities attendant upon the diversification of the cultural composition of students on their campuses, the roles of all institutions of higher education must be redefined.

Many students are interested in \"relevant\" courses which, to them, means moving out of the ivory tower and \"into the community.\" Classroom studies could be linked to ghetto problems in action-oriented activities, such as work-study programs, so that students may work in nearby communities for a part of their school year. It is important to incorporate more material on black Americans into the lower-level introductory courses, and to develop specialized courses on black history, black literature, and other fields at upper levels. There is enough material to justify individual courses in many of these fields. A \"qualified\"  instructor is required for these courses, not necessarily a Ph.D holder but an indigenous person who has knowledge of the subject that may not yet be recognized by traditional criteria for the hiring of faculty. The need for these curricular changes is equally great in all-white, suburban-locked colleges. Then the impact of slavery and oppression on both black and white Americans would be reinterpreted and white students would acquire some understanding of the heterogeneous world in which they live. Also, a curricular evaluation committee should be formed at each institution to conduct intensive research on current courses and to suggest any necessary changes in the curriculum. (WM)",

The people most often mentioned as well as a sample of faculty, students, and administrators were interviewed about the way their institution was run. One of the objectives was to define the role of the department chairman. In comparing the data concerning department chairmen with analyses of other faculty groups, significant differences were found in views regarding general resources and  control of the academic program. The data delineate a role that is molded by polar demands &quot;which condition the nature of personal interaction and the social matrix of the problem&quot;, a position that is, &quot;by definition, schizophrenic.&quot; The interviews highlight the nature and dimensions of the concern for resources and facilities. Recruiting and budgeting are obsessions and committee work is deemed important. Individuals are seen as interchangeable parts of a functioning machine and few chairmen engage in establishing goals.

The obstacles most frequently reported were: the innovation needed more time than anticipated; readiness of the students was overestimated; the relative isolation of the experimenter on his campus; and a shortage of necessary facilities. There are ways to overcome these restraints and the recommendation dealing with the problem of facilities relates to an organizational change that would contribute substantially toward incentives for innovation--the establishment of units for research and development of the college or university itself.

        "description":"Professional schools can expect to be faced with at least 2 urgent public demands: the expansion and improvement of professional training programs and the provision of certain types of professional community service by universities. The university could attempt to increase the supply of professionals by: expanding enrollement at professional schools and creating additional schools; taking advantage of theoretical and methodological advances so as to shorten the length of educational programs; fostering programs to enable the existing supply of professionals to be more productive. The university must also address itself to the problems of content and methodology of professional education. A professional must be action-oriented and his education should prepare him for diagnosing  and solving real problems. Ways should be found to nurture the critical judgment of students. Because cricial decisions affecting society will probably continue to be made by nonprofessionals, professional schools have a responsibility to provide information about the relationship of their knowledge to the solution of social problems. Specific steps that could help shorten the gap between professional schools and demands society makes of the professional are: the establishment of computerized \"fact banks\" of information; establishment of a small team of faculty members who would critically review the clinical training offered to students; and initiation of exploratory conferences with members of various fiduciary boards so that the university can learn more about their educational needs.

        "description":"In terms of benefit plan coverage and protection, or \"Benefit Environment\", higher education is the most advanced of professional or employment groups. Between 1959 and 1969, the percentage of 4-year institutions of higher education in the U.S. having faculty retirement plans grew from 85% to 95%. About 50% of these institutions have some form of long-term disability protection in addition to that provided by Social Security. Within the last 10 years, the proportion of colleges and universities reporting group life insurance plans for faculty increased from 50% to 70% and those with basic hospital-surgical-medical plans grew from 80% to 90%. The TIAA-CREF system provides a retirement plan that permits mobility with assured benefits, and is more responsive to economic changes. In  the nationwide TIAA-CREF program, monies are both put away and put to work for an individual each year. When a staff member in higher education who is participating in the TIAA-CREF system retires, he receives the TIAA annuity, which provides a guaranteed, fixed-dollar retirement income and the CREF annuity, which provides an income that varies yearly according to the performance of securities in the CREF portfolio. This contrasts with most pension plans in industry where benefits are determined as a percentage of salary, and investment gains or losses are used to decrease or increase the employer's pension costs.

The paper reviews 6 documents on each of these themes. Among the publications on the college student, the January 1969 special issue of Fortune magazine contained the best overview of the mood of the present generation of college students. Other works deal with college impact on the development of student personality, a developmental approach to the curriculum, college dropouts or failures in contrast to persisters, creative students and underachievers, and difference  between college attenders and non-attenders. Publications on the future of U.S. institutions of higher education discuss the lack of focus and meaning in undergraduate life, strengthening the role of the campus in the community, liberal education versus specialized research, cluster colleges, barriers to educational change, essentialism versus existentialism, the future of the relationship between colleges and universities and the society in which they function, and the rise to power of the academic profession in the U.S. and its effect on the rest of society.

Four papers examine general objectives in higher education and relate them to techniques of evaluation and teaching methods. The papers acknowledge that some recent modifications of curricula and methods arise from considerations of certain objectives in university teaching, but attempt to demonstrate that a more detailed analysis of purposes and aims in teaching would not only be profitable but will soon become essential. Whether objectives are likely to be realized or not depends on a number of factors, including the way in which they are evaluated, the  processes employed in learning, and the consonance of objectives with the needs and abilities of students and with the requirements of the society in which students live. These factors are surveyed in the first paper. The second discusses the evolution of educational objectives in European universities of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The third outlines some approaches to more detailed analyses of specific objectives, and the final paper discusses some problems of evaluating objectives in an effective way. (WM)",

They decide what is taught, how it is taught, and who is taught. They also exert influence on institutional policies concerning size and selectivity, and determine their own permanent membership through recommendations on promotion to tenure. Tenure preserves academic freedom, but it also preserves mediocrity on almost every U.S. campus. Once given, it is nearly impossible to revoke, and has therefore forced many universities to retain teachers whose value to the institution is nil and whose lack of ability impedes the process of education. The power reflected in the present faculty structure and the implications of tenure deserve serious regard by everyone  concerned with the modernization of U.S. higher education. It may be asked what constructive purpose tenure serves in a society that provides constitutionally for freedom of expression. The willingness to reconsider and change time-honored methods and facilities, and the decisions made on innovation will shape the future of U.S. education. We cannot afford to accept any element in the structure of higher education as a \"sacred cow\" at a time when the university is more than ever looked to by society as a primary source of leadership.

One such technique is the Environmental Assessment Technique (EAT), which describes the environment in terms of 8 characteristics of the student body (size, average intelligence, and 6 \"personal orientations) based on the proportion of graduates who majored in each of 6 classes of major fields. To assess graduate school environments, a modified EAT was used which groups graduate faculty and curriculum into 6 classes of major fields and assigns 4 representative disciplines to each type of field. Data were collected from 87 graduate school  catalogs for 1968. Curriculum, faculty, and degrees awarded were converted separately to 6 normalized standard scores which comprised a profile for each institution. The profile scores measured the graduate school environment without using student characteristics, and represented fairly stable characteristics of the institution. They were related in plausible ways to other measures of university environment, and were meaningfully related to the quality of graduate education. The modified EAT technique therefore seems to have potential for studying graduate school environments and the impact of graduate schools on their students. (WM)",

Training the \"primary physician\" (the term preferred here) must be carefully planned. The primary care curriculum should be undertaken by every medical student as a base for further training and will demand a multidisciplinary approach. In instruction, the emphasis must be on the learner, and the goals and  methods of the training program should be supported by the entire medical faculty. The general objectives of the program to teach skills, knowledge and behavior critical to primary care are to give students the opportunity to see, participate in and learn within the structure of a model program in which comprehensive, coordinated health services are available to an identified patient population, and to view a variety of services, properly selected and sequenced, over a period of time. It also aims to provide the undergraduate with knowledge necessary to decide whether to pursue graduate training as a primary physician, maximize further learning opportunities in the field, and relate effectively with primary physicians if another specialty is chosen.

The memorandum sets forth reasons why these constitutional changes should not be adopted and recommends some alternatives to the Task Force proposal. If the proposed changes were to be adopted, it is felt that there would be no organ of university government that would reflect the views of the faculty alone, and adoption plus university adherence to the one-man, one-vote principle would result in student control. It is believed that university government is best when it helps to accomplish the  institutions's missions of teaching, research, and public service. Therefore, university items of business could be divided into 3 categories: (1) those on which students alone should vote, (2) those on which students and faculty should have an equal vote, and (3) those on which faculty alone should vote. Also, students should have an opportunity to be heard on all items, even in cases where they may not vote. The memorandum contains lists of university matters that have been handled by the University Senate for the past 10 years. It is felt that responsibility should be redistributed, and that increased decisions on student affairs by students would be desirable. (WM)",

Nine, or 41%, of the 22 students graduated on time in 1967, compared to a national average of 40% of all college freshmen graduating on time. In the fall of 1967, 70 high-risk students were admitted to MSU from inner-city high schools in what was called the Detroit Project. Of the 66 students in this group who were black, 27 returned in 1968, a year in which MSU admitted 357 black freshmen in a total campus enrollment of 1,007. There was a tendency on campus to identify all black freshmen as high academic risks, but only 25 of the 357  students were actually admitted with records that would not have qualified them for admission. For 1969, MSU has accelerated its drive to attract black students in general and able black students in particular. But some remaining problems include finding black high school graduates, especially those with a B or better academic grade average, the financing of these students, and getting the best prepared black students to attend MSU.

However, the large body of information on student development is little reflected in curricula, college organization or instruction. Revitalized instruction depends upon the teacher's acceptance of certain postulates: that students have drives which operate toward healthy development if given opportunity, encouragement and freedom; that learning is not necessarily logical but psychological and gets direction and energy from the learner, not the discipline; that cognition and emotion are equally valuable and should be cultivated; that the interaction of peers is a much greater force than interaction between younger and older. Present faculty training and interests, the  reward system, admissions process, organization of the curriculum and rules governing it all work to distort and hamper personal development. The curriculum should include: general courses providing a common body of allusion, illustration and principle necessary for people to communicate and share the same culture; liberal studies enabling students to sample different fields; contextual studies; and specialized courses. A much greater use of &quot;affectively charged&quot; courses would be appropriate, especially during the early years.

We are a society of large scale organizations. The implications of a social order dominated by large scale organizations and the ideal nature of a university's problem-solving mission have a considerable impact on the strategy that is adopted. The organization of the university has  prevented a coordinated assault on urban problems; and although campuses resent having new organizational forms imposed on them from the outside, a national interdependent system of higher education is developing which will, perhaps, be more effective in accomplishing social change. The university today is beset with conflicting pressures from both within and without. If it is to attempt to alter social institutions, the faculty must become more conscious and respectful of the diversity of norms underlying behavior within the university; the reward system must be changed; the nature and processes of the university should be communicated to faculty and students; and some university outreach activities should be instituted.

Developmental education is suggested as an effective way of providing the student with a college experience that integrates his cognitive development and the development of his whole personality.

Some findings reveal that 50% of the PhDs spent their careers entirely in academic employment, 25% in nonacademic positions, and the remaining 25% were equally divided between those who shifted from academic to nonacademic jobs or vice versa. Annual rates of salary increase were typically about 8% for those always in or switching to academic work, higher rates were earned by those always in nonacademic work, while those shifting to nonacademic jobs were apt to receive an increase of almost 14% per annum. New PhDs, particularly those in the physical sciences, started on a higher academic level and advanced more rapidly than did their predecessors. (WM)",

        "description":"There has been a suspicion among college English teachers that the writing skills of engineering and science students deteriorate between the time they complete Freshman English and the time they graduate. To test the validity of this hypothesis, 5 groups comprising 361 subjects (72 freshmen, 70 sophomores, 71 juniors, 74 seniors, and 74 technical writing students) at Iowa State University were tested. Each group took 2 free response essay tests and 1 objective test. Scores showed no significant differences in the writing abilities of all 5 groups. A regression analysis was performed to discover the interrelationship of all variables, including earlier test scores, Freshman English grade averages, high school rank, curriculum, and the sequence in which the tests were taken.  Correlation between the composite scores and MSAT and ACT total scores was higher than the correlation between composite scores and Freshman English grade averages or the English Placement score. It was inferred that engineering and science students maintain their writing ability between completion of Freshman English and graduation. Because graduate engineers and scientists need very specific writing skills, a senior course should be instituted that is devoted to teaching technical writing and the translation of quantitative thinking and scientific procedures into coherent prose.

        "description":"Universities are being faced with the problem of how they can best carry out their functions and pursue standards of academic excellence with youth who, because of social, economic and educational disadvantages, deviate markedly from traditional academic norms. Many institutions have initiated special programs or practices designed for these youth. These activities, such as modified admission policies, high school extension programs, tutorial programs, special recruitment, curriculum innovation, all aim to compensate for disadvantages of college aspirants. Because programs have multiplied, there is a pressing need to document and examine the developments. The study envisioned in this brief aims to compile data on existings programs and establish a rapid monitoring system to  disseminate relevant information to institutions engaged in or planning similar programs. A second objective is to assess the effectiveness of existing programs and determine to what extent they have influenced the personal, social and academic adjustments of students and stimulated changes in institutional practice and attitudes. The brief outlines procedures to be used for the general survey intended to collect data from about 3000 institutions and kinds of information the researchers hope to learn from the questionnaires, personal interviews, and case studies of students and institutions. It is hoped the results will encourage further research, especially on the problem of identifying academic potential in minority group youth. The rationale for such an investigation is included.

Proceeding as a taxonomist, the author offers a tentative empirical classification of the positions taken or arguments advanced by professors in the 2 camps, activist and passavist. The class of \"effectively uninvolved professors\" is a large one containing many species whose distinctive behaviors and ideologies are evident even though the class shares a general trait of feeble or no participation in the social process. These types are: the nihilist, dropout, retreatist or delinquent, the eclectic, pluralist or dually committed, the  diphasic, obsessive, partially committed, the laissez-faire conservative, the professor paralyzed by fear, the believer that activism is uncouth, unscholarly or unprofessional. The activist professors include: reactionaries, issues protesters, and revolutionaires, of which these are 2 varieties depending upon their acceptance or rejection of the pacifist ethic. \"...pacifism may be the most telling single criterion of humane citizenship, today and tomorrow.\" The professor who doesn't cop out knows that as an ethical being he must accept the obligations of citizenship.

The project aimed to find answers to 3 questions: \"Is it possible to isolate specific cognitive factors which determine academic success? Is it possible to derive a set of regression equations capable of predicting success in the Honors Program by employing scores on the factors isolated? And, how does the efficiency of acturial prediction compare with that of the predictions made by clinically-trained personnel?\" The subjects consisted of 182 freshmen entering in Fall 1966--54 Honors  Program members and 128 other above-average students. The data analyzed were: high school grades and class standing, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, American College Test scores, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory responses, reference tests for cognitive factors scores, and interview information and behavioral observations. By using a correlational approach and manipulating the variables according to the needs of each specific problem, it was possible to determine the relationships between particular types of behavior and the criterion to be predicted.

        "description":"The Dogmatism Scale (D) and Traditional Family Ideology Scale (TFI) were administered to nursing students at Texas Women's University to determine the effect of dogmatism and authoritarianism upon nursing success. The D scale measures individual differences in openness, closedness, and intolerance, and the TFI assesses an individual's position on a democratic-autocratic continuum. The tests were taken by 133 freshmen 3 times in 18 months, and once by 104 senior and 199 graduates. Results indicate that the entering freshman nursing student is somewhat dogmatic and authoritative, but after the 4-year program, these 2 traits lessen considerably. This would support the principle that college students should and do become more democratic and open-minded as they progress through the  higher education program. The graduate nurse does not become more dogmatic, but usually more authoritative, possibly because she assumes an immediate position of leadership as a nurse. In 4 years, a student either becomes more authoritative and dogmatic, or less authoritative and dogmatic. Those students viewed as potentially successful nurses by their superiors were less dogmatic and less authoritative. It is felt that the TFI and D instruments could help to select potentially successful nursing students. (WM)",

The city is described as an ecosystem, containing large numbers of variables that interact with each other. Most traditional urban studies tend to treat each of these components as a self-contained activity and have proven to be inadequate. In the Washington metropolitan area, response to shifting complexities --such as race relations, urban planning, and the federal role within the District of Columbia-- has been largely self-contained, drawing only sporadically upon the competence of local academicians. One possible  alternative to the single-purpose approach is the \"urban observatory\" and its \"satellites.\" The observatory would have an interdisciplinary core of scholars who would collaborate on research priorities and give continuity and direction to the course of action required to fulfill the desired interuniversity commitment to the city. From the satellites, located throughout the metropolitan region, information would flow to the central observatory, and through them, research and educational programming would be directed into the community.

In summer 1968, questionnaires were sent to 49 colleges; 45 responded. They were asked to give information on 82 items labelled innovative in the literature and to add any others from their own knowledge. This produced a total of 92 technological, ideational, and organizational innovations, on which the colleges reported present use, present consideration, past use, and extent of use. The results are shown in tabular form for nine main categories of innovation: (1) technological aids, (2) faculty use, (3) facilities use, (4) course and program planning, (5) instructional patterns and programs, (6)  instructional organization, (7) scheduling, course or program completion, and calendar arrangement, (8) evaluation of student and program, (9) three additional innovations--(a) a college exploratory program, (b) a prison rehabilitation program, (c) non-computerized information storage and retrieval. Appended are (1) a list of colleges offering information and the name of the individual from whom to request it, (2) a list of participating colleges, (3) a model memorandum on procedures for the staff to use for suggesting innovations or experiments, (4) state-funded research projects in Washington July 1, 1968 to June 30, 1969.

Defining several activist groups and their special interests, he then discusses the new left (primarily the Students for a Democratic Society), the rightists, black students, Mexican-American students, and the elected student officers involved in the National Student Association. As for student government, he notes it has been bypassed by the activists, and efforts to participate in institutional governance are largely unsuccessful. Moving to student rights, he reviews the statements on this topic by the American Association of  University Professors, the American Council on Education, and the organizations preparing the comprehensive &quot;Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of Students.&quot; The last topics are community relations and relationships between students, faculty, and administration, where he discusses campus violence, the use of police, non-student activism, reactions to student excesses, and probable consequences.

The project indicates that the hospital is no longer the focal point of psychiatric care and the community is very much involved in mental health activities. Nurses need to be involved in learning experiences that include the whole mental health continuum. The first phase of the project was the selection of eight diploma and eight associate degree educational programs in nursing to participate in the study. The second phase was the selection of content and learning experiences appropriate to both  programs. The purpose of the workshop was to prepare faculties to use the project method of planning a course in nursing care. This summary of the 5-day workshop includes (1) integration of psychiatric-mental health nursing content in a curriculum, (2) individual behavior and the nurse-patient relationship, (3) the group process, (4) therapeutic environment, (5) the trend toward community mental health centers, (6) 31 selected operational definitions, and (7) workshop materials.

Definitions and expected competence were stated for the general practice of nursing, nurse-patient relationships, communication skill, therapeutic environment, community aspects, and work with patient groups, nursing teams, and interdisciplinary teams. To achieve this competence, the course content had to be identified, levels of progression determined, and related course  content planned. Learning experiences and evaluation methods were devised concurrently. Planning for integration of psychiatric/mental-health nursing content in the curriculum and for the course in nursing care of the mentally ill included three concepts: (1) man in relation to himself (dynamics of individual behavior); (2) man in relation to others (dynamics of communication); and (3) man in relation to the environment (dynamics of environmental influences).

To accomplish these objectives faculty volunteers were recruited to assist the professional counselors in offering 15 instructional hours to each student. An in-service training program for counselors and teacher-advisors was conducted during the summer prior to implementation of the experimental program. Training included theories and practices involving lay helpers, group guidance techniques, consultative methods, basic learning, guidance, etc. One facet of the overall program was the establishment of a course with one hour of credit to be applied at graduation and required of all full-time  entering freshmen. Twenty students were assigned to each teacher-advisor, who was to guide them during their 2-year stay at the college. Whenever a serious emotional problem arose, the student was referred to the professional counselor. At the end of the first year, a survey revealed that over 93% of the students said that they had been &quot;helped.&quot; Individual personalized interactions of students with teachers received highest value ratings.

This study applies the principles developed in that code to library subject headings, using a sample of the Library of Congress list of subject headings as a basis. The study was limited to formatting and styling procedures. A preliminary investigation was performed to determine the kinds of headings which would arrange on the computer in an order different from the present one. A set of rules for styling of headings so that they could be computer arranged in an order somewhat simpler than the present one was developed and tested. This test was  partially successful: the rules can be applied clerically, and professional effort can be limited to editing on the basis of a preliminary sort. The styled headings were sorted once and edited, and the output will be available from the archives of the Office of Education. The order and appearance of the styled headings are somewhat different from the subject heading list. However, the sorting order of only 2.4% of the headings which were not part of large groups all beginning with the same word was changed. It was concluded that, with some reservations, the study demonstrated that subject headings can be so styled as to file unambiguously on the computer. (Author/JB)",

Topics covered in the report include: the development of requests, the operation of the NYSILL network, regional networks and direct academic service, NYSILL and library technology, and interlibrary loan in New  York State. It is concluded that NYSILL has fully demonstrated its value to library patrons, and it is recommended that the program be made one of the permanent reference and research services provided by the state. It is also concluded that the two regional interlibrary loan systems funded by the state at Buffalo and Rochester are complimentary to NYSILL and have proved to be successful, and it is suggested that these networks also be permanently funded.

The Plan, which includes a number of recommendations from the Nelson Associates Report of 1965 (ED 020 746), was drafted by a committee representing the Colorado Council for Library Development, the Colorado Library Association, and the Colorado State Library, and reflects the thinking of academic, school, public, and special librarians. There is a brief discussion of th e current status of Colorado's academic, public, school, and special libraries. The primary objectives of the Plan are to (1) change the Colorado Library Law of 1947 to make implementation of the Plan possible, (2) redefine the role of the Colorado State Library, (3) provide for  the legal establishment of public library systems, (4) establish a complete state-wide reference service, (5) establish standards for library operations, (6) define and implement the roles of the several types of libraries, and (7) establish study groups to develop state-wide programs within the framework of the Plan. The role of the State Library, and plan of operation, and the financing of the state Plan are also discussed. (Author/CC)",

The early months of the project were devoted to solving problems with the system. During May, June, and July, 1968, attention was concentrated on achieving a more efficient pilot operation. As part of this effort, statistics were compiled in June and July. From these statistics an estimate is made of cost per title of performing a similar operation on a full scale random access system. Appendix A contains this cost  projection. The demonstration of cataloging services was suspended on July 31, 1968, and the project was redirected to setting up a MARC II based system. Section 3 describes this effort. The basic difficulty was deciding whether immediate hook-up with interim programs or delayed hook-up with permanent programs was better. The decision was made in favor of delayed hook-up and programs suiting this system are described. (Author/CC)",

Costs have increased and the city tax base has declined. In order to continue to operate as a metropolitan research library and to solve financial problems, the Detroit Public Library, Wayne State University, and the Michigan State Library began a research and demonstration project in August, 1966. Objectives of the project were to (1) provide service to all residents of the six-county metropolitan area, (2) analyze resulting use and users, (3) determine costs, (4) suggest alternative possibilities for financial support, and (5) &quot;sell&quot; the expanded service and necessary financial  support. Major conclusions are: (1) Non-resident use is mostly limited to the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and the SMSA residents should have access and share financial support. (2) No correlation is seen between number of residents in a geographical area and use of Detroit's Main Library. (3) Most of the non-residents' use was in-the-building use. (4) Students were heaviest non-resident and resident users. (5) Extent of non-resident use indicates new financial support patterns would be appropriate. (6) Evidence suggests state support of Main Library Service to non-residents. (7) Visits to the Main Library appear to be a valid index of use. Suggested areas for further study are cited. (CC)",

Since the First Progress Report the indexing program has been modified to facilitate the updating and expansion of the computer-stored dictionary. The MEDICO file which is the output of the automatic indexing program is a direct file stored on magnetic tape and is sequenced by document accession number. The primary access point of the file can involve as many as four hierarchical levels and generic searches are easily implemented. Boolean  searches allow for the retrieval of highly specific information. Prior to searching, the Boolean expressions corresponding to the natural language query are formulated by the human searcher. Normalization of the query to make it compatible with the index language is accomplished automatically by the computer. The tape file is searched sequentially to search for the presence or absence of terms as prescribed in the Boolean expression. Several queries can be processed simultaneously and the output for each query can be printed out as a separate unit. (Author/JW)",

This has been very difficult for the disadvantaged to accomplish because their backgrounds have been one of deprivation and their opportunities have been limited. But the incompetence of the disadvantaged is not significantly attributable to genetic deficiencies; rather it is mostly attributable to their deprived backgrounds. Head Start and similar compensatory education programs have been created to alleviate the intellectual and cognitive deficiencies of disadvantaged children. Such programs have met with varied success. Intervention earlier than age four or five would be good, however, because of the  importance of early development. This intervention should be coupled with some form of parent education or parent participation. Such a total program (called &quot;Centers for Children and Parents)&quot; has been suggested. Not only would young deprived children be given a compensatory education at such a center, but professional personnel there would establish relations with the parents and counsel them as to proper child rearing practices.

This attention is due, in great part, to the formulations about cognitive development by Piaget. Earlier in the century, the experimental approach to child study came to reflect psychology's generally heavy commitment to physics and chemistry. Lately, however, the influence of biology on developmental psychology has become predominant. Examples of this interaction include (1) the study of ethology (particularly of the child's early ties to other human beings, especially to the caretaking person); (2) the investigations in evolutionary biology (the effect that the naturalistic field studies of nonhuman primates have on the naturalistic study of human  primates); (3) the new uses of karyotyping, (looking at the genetic characteristics of the newborn); (4) the link between psychology and physiology; and (5) the use of electroencephalographic data to study brain behavior relationships.

One of the most important impairments of autistic children is perceptual inconstancy (irregularity in the processing of sensory data by the various receptor systems). The likelihood of physiological and biochemical changes under autistic conditions of sensory deprivation require that perceptual patterns be promoted in the child as early as possible. A program of treatment for the autistic child should include parent  participation and parent education, with the goal of reducing distortions in the parent-child relationship. Otherwise, treatment of the preschool autistic child should be concerned with establishing perceptual organization and cortical control over his sensory experiences. Further research is needed on the relationship between parental attitudes or child rearing practices and the existence of an autistic child. (WD)",

        "description":"In order to help parents in rearing children, a theory of parent effectiveness was developed. Based on the idea that parents should be honest with their children about the child's behavior, the theory identified ownership of problems and conflict resolution. Children's behavior was defined as being acceptable and nonacceptable to the parent, depending on the the individual parent and child and on changes within the parent, child, or environment. Conflicts arose when the child or the parent \"owned\" a problem; that is, when their individual needs were not met because of the child's behavior. The conflicts could be resolved by the parent in both cases. When the child owned a problem, the parent could listen to the child express his feelings. When the parent owned a problem, he could  honestly express his own feelings to the child. If conflict arose when neither party's needs were met, the parent and child could seek a mutually acceptable solution. Resolutions where either the parent or child \"won all\" were not considered satisfactory, because resentment built up in the losing party. By resolving conflict situations through compromise, parents could increase their children's acceptable behavior. Furthermore, compromise, as a technique for conflict resolution, was considered applicable to all human relationships. (JS)",

A project was established to create color-vision testing methods and to use those methods to ascertain incidence and to identify color-deficient pupils. The two basic types of tests used were (1) color matching and (2) recognition of colored symbols differentiated from surroundings of other colors. Some 3,400 children were tested during the 1967-68 school year. It was found that the tests used were practical for their age group. The tests produced high interest and should be used either in the latter part of kindergarten or in the first grade. The  incidence of some degree of color deficiency was 0.5 percent for girls and 3.0 to 3.5 percent for boys. The color-symbol tests were significantly more definite than the color-matching test.

The deficit lies in the one-sided development of his problem-solving capacity; that is, an enormous growth has occurred in technological capabilities without a corresponding gain in solutions to social problems. This deficit is particularly significant because intelligence is, to a great degree, a product of the social environment. Important to the development of the brain is proper nutrition, a clean environment to reduce the effects of disease, adequate and varied sensory stimulation, and rich adult-infant social interactions. Yet, given the satisfactory development of the brain, the contrast between our intellectual prowess in understanding and manipulating the physical world and our  insensitivity to (if not debased judgments of) the social purposes of that manipulation points up the perversion of intelligence. Today the problems for mental health and human development are (1) the Viet Nam war, (2) racism, and (3) the gross inequalities in access to resources between and within nations. (WD)",

The purpose of the test was to measure the child's ability to &quot;read a picture.&quot; A subject was presented a novel stimulus and asked to agree or disagree with statements concerning the picture. When a factor analysis was performed on the data, four factors emerged: (1) some measure of general intelligence, (2) a general index of academic achievement, (3) figural measures of creative thinking, and (4) verbal creativity measures. The factors were then correlated with the following results: (1) Verbal creative thinking  was independent of general intelligence, academic achievement, and figural creativity; and (2) figural creativity shared common variance with general intelligence and academic achievement. The independence of the verbal creative thinking factor was incongruous, since many other studies reported at least a low correlation between verbal creative thinking and academic achievement or general intelligence. The results suggest that a replication be conducted with particular attention to perceptual sensitivity tasks. (JS)",

Forty bipolar traits were expressed in sentence form, and children rated themselves on the inventory, indicating their self-concepts. Results showed higher percentages on the positive personality traits for the disadvantaged and revealed greater differences between boys than between girls. The disadvantaged, more than the advantaged,  tended to see themselves as independent, competent, patient, and deliberate; while the advantaged perceived themselves as happy, self-confident, trusting, fearless, and worthy. Despite differences, both groups had higher percentages of responses in the positive end of the continuum, indicating that disadvantaged children do not necessarily reveal negative personality traits in their self-perceptions.

Every experience alters an individual's learning capacity. Therefore, to say a child is naturally of high or low intelligence with unlimited or limited learning power is unjust. Educators must explore interventions that make more effective differences in the creation of new capacities than do the traditional interventions that characterize our educational system. Our emphasis on competitive grades precludes the possibility of multifaceted children with many dimensions of skills. Measuring success or failure on the basis of cognitive skill alone is widespread in our system, which values and rewards that  skill. An alternative is the motivation of individuals. Motivation involves getting the child to perceive goals, giving him a sense of possibly achieving them, providing resources he will need for achievement, and eliciting his willingness to pay for gains that will accrue to him. Our schools must be diverse. We need ranges of experience; variability of methods and content; and tempo, place, and program to accommodate the diversity in children. (DO)",

Since adequate nutrition enables one to cope better with stresses, it is probable that a satisfactory diet can positively influence behavior. Results indicate that high amounts of refined carbohydrates and low amounts of meat are associated with low playground activity, hyperactivity and short attention spans. Children with small amounts of vitamin A had lower playground activity, less hyperactivity, and longer attention  spans.

Pretests and posttests used were the Children's Projective Pictures of Self-Concept, the Preschool Attainment Record, the Self-Concept Rating Scale, and an anxiety scale. In the posttest phase, 20 subjects in a proportional random selection were compared with 20 control children (from the same districts) with no preschool experience. The Head Start sample performed significantly better on tests measuring social skills, language skills, and self-concept. The  meaning of the significance was unclear because of the possibility of an interaction effect between the pretest and the experimental variable; namely, exposure to the Head Start program. It was suggested that Head Starters entering the first grade the following fall be tested and that their performance be compared with the performance of a control group with no preschool experience.

This study examined the structure of the affect that teachers in six majority Negro school districts had on the teacher learning process. Twelve adjective pairs were used to measure each of the following ten concepts: (1) this summer's institute, (2) the economically deprived child, (3) myself, (4) a Negro teacher, (5) a white teacher, (6) Negro principals, (7) white principals, (8) other teachers, (9) a Negro child, and (10) a white child. Teachers' perceptions of four concepts shifted significantly over the tenure of the institute: (1) perceived initially as negative and worthless, the Negro teacher appeared to become more valuable, with a higher measure  of personal worth; (2) attitude toward the summer institute improved; (3) teachers developed more independence in their attitudes and possessed more ego strength in resolving feelings about teaching in disadvantaged areas; and (4) at the conclusion of the institute, the concepts of the white child and the Negro child reflected the concern of Federal programs for deprived children, regardless of race.

There are ontogenetic requirements to develop such potential. The process by which man learns is sequential and involves perceptual-motor-cognitive abilities. There is an optimum respectivity period at each developmental level; and if this period is passed without learning taking place, guidance should be provided to avoid performance difficulties. Physical movement is the basis for perception. A goal of developmental efficiency is the reduction of movement through symbolic manipulation and visualization. Developmental guidance must recapituate ontogeny. The implications of developmental inadequacies in perceptual motor skills in adults, emotionally  disturbed, and mentally handicapped children are discussed, and many citations are included in this master's thesis.

Results revealed that (1)  report card ratings (for work and health habits and behavior) were generally higher for children who attended private kindergartens; (2) school adaptation seemed to be related to kindergarten attendance; (3) IQ's were highest for those who had attended private kindergartens, and nonkindergartners ranked lowest; (4) kindergarten attendance was related to higher achievement scores in reading comprehension, word meaning, spelling, and arithmetic for grade two; and (5) very little acceleration was found, but that in evidence was related to private kindergarten attendance.

Expressive objectives may produce new knowledge as a result of an educational encounter in which the child is free to explore.

These variables are (1) aptitude of student, (2) quality of instruction, (3) ability to understand instruction, (4) perserverance, and (5) time allowed for learning. This study investigated this hypothesis with an individualized learning program (ILP), in which all students were supposed to attain mastery on each lesson before going on in the program. Students in grades two through six were given aptitude tests, and their performance in the ILP was compared with the  test results. Little relationship between rate of learning and aptitude was found when variables number two, three, and four were ignored or were assumed to be operating at an optimum level for all. Thus, either the variables should not have been ignored or the experimental design in this study was faulty. Aptitude may still be found to be the most important factor in rate of learning. (WD)",

The attendance and dropout data from these 8 high schools were tabulated and analyzed. In conclusion, it was reported that  negative educational values in their homes were largely responsible for biasing the educational opportunities of rural youth. (ES)",

In most cases the programs have an adequate supply of teachers, bilingual teacher aides, and community volunteer help. Individual attention is emphasized in teaching reading, language development, physical and health education, and art and music. When necessary, remedial work is given to the children; some programmed instruction is used. Many of the programs include weekly field trips to broaden world experiences, often through outdoor education. The home-school  relationship is stressed as an important phase of the programs. Two curriculum materials centers are being developed to provide for improved supportive services to schools. (JAM)",

The third paper deals with the research methods the economist uses and is entitled \"Acquisitions of Primary and  Secondary Data in Economics.\" The fourth presentation is \"Research Methods Adaptable to Legal-Economic Inquiry\" which concludes that linear programing and simulation are valid tools for this type of research. The fifth paper is called \"Organization for Legal-Economic and Related Research,\" treating the problem of organizing across disciplinary lines and the difficulties encountered.

The variables examined included (1) decision to become a dropout (reasons for leaving school, encouragement to stay in school, encouragement to return to school after leaving), and (2) orientations toward further education (aspirations, expectations, and attitudes toward re-entry into school under various conditions). It was found that poor grades and financial difficulties were major factors in the decision to leave school. While few respondents were encouraged to stay in school,  three-fourths were advised by parents and friends to return to school after leaving. Most respondents desired high school diplomas; however, one-half of the boys and one-fourth of the girls did not expect to attain their goals. Most respondents were uncertain about expectations. It was recommended that dropouts be identified early, and that teachers, principals, and counselors make every attempt to encourage the potential dropout to remain in school. A major conclusion was that much needs to be done in developing educational programs to meet perceived needs of these students. (DA)",

Educational attainment levels reveal significant differences between Mexican Americans and Anglo Americans, between rural and urban Mexican Americans, and between the native-born and foreign-born. State statistics conceal important local variations in schooling. Problems of the Mexican American are poverty, a high dependency ratio, unemployment, poor housing, inadequate public services, segregated schools, nonparticipation in political life, and a high rate of school  delinquency. Policy implications include increasing communication between Mexican Americans and other poverty segments, designing programs of local distinctiveness to overcome local isolation, and training and retraining of non-Mexican American personnel working with this population.

Results of the study showed: that the percentage of Negro children attending desegregated schools in the Southern States in 1966-67 increased substantially over the previous school year; that this progress had been acompanied in many communities by a spirit of acceptance and understanding; that more than 4/5 of the Negro children in the 11 Southern States and more than 9/10 in the 5 Deep South  States still attended all-Negro schools; and that very little desegregation of full-time teachers had taken place.

The discussion does not prescribe a \"best-fit\" model but presents several with an expanded outline of one, incorporating the expertise of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory and the cooperative efforts of contiguous states in a regional area. Recommended is the utilization of existing agencies, such as USOE, state departments of education, colleges and universities, and professional organizations. Also included is a discussion of the available dissemination media and their relative effectiveness and cost. Two basic  assumptions were deemed appropriate: (1) that motivation for dissemination of information lies primarily with the desire to implement dissemination procedures, not with testing given procedures, and (2) that financial consideration preclude nationwide dissemination.

It is also suggested that nonverbal stimuli be used more often as a media of instruction when working with native Canadian pupils. Six psychosocial influences likely to affect development of cognitive abilities in different cultures are identified and discussed: (1)  achievement motivation; (2) immediate versus delayed gratification orientation; (3) initiative and curiosity behavior; (4) conceptual stimuli experience; (5) language; and (6) health and nutrition factors.

One of the major factors of growth has been the in-migration of people from rural parts of the country. One problem created by the influx of people into the cities has been the growth of the ghetto. Conditions of the ghetto, such as overcrowding and poor sanitation facilities, are a contributing factor to riots, although not the primary cause. The Negro population, which accounts for most of the ghettos, has also increased in the urban areas from 12% in 1950 to 20% in 1965. A solution to the plight of the city is the idea of \"new communities.\" These communities would have a pre-determined population figure and would make land available for industry or would be accessible to industry.  Another solution would be the overhaul of land use regulations and a more effective system to control and guide developers. In conclusion, a national policy to deal with urban growth would be desirable in order to provide the cities with a framework in which to work more effectively in solving their growth problems.

Among these were dietery aides, visual stimulation for oral development, and parental participation. Ancillary services were also provided by the program; it was found that a large number of children, mostly Puerto Rican, had a hypertrophied tonsil condition possibly associated with malnutrition. Some of the objective measurements used by the program were wide range achievement tests, reading skills diagnostic tests, arithmetic diagnostic tests, and teacher development tests. Various problems were encountered by the program, the major ones being funding and the shortage of qualified administrators. The Connecticut Department of Education  concluded that: (1) basic skills in the children improved very little, but attitudes about going to school were changed; (2) there was more awareness by parents of their child's interest in school; (3) there was improvement in social, hygienic, and nutritional practices by the children; and (4) structured programs often did not meet the needs of the migrant child.

The second study determined the reading achievement grade placement scores of students who could answer 35 percent of the items on cloze readability tests made from subject matter area materials used at various school levels. The mean grade level at which students could read 35  percent of the items was 7.6 for primary-grade materials, 8.6 for intermediate, 9.4 for junior high school, and 10.4 for high school. The third study tested 240 students' understanding of simple factual information signaled by structures commonly found in written language.

Four question types (rote, transform, semantic substitute, and compound) were used to test comprehension of the structures; therefore, four test forms using these different question types were made for each paragraph. The subjects, fourth graders from an inner city, a suburban, and a rural school, were randomly divided so that 60 students responded to each question. The mean percentage of the students correctly answering the sentence comprehension  questions was 73 percent; the anaphora comprehension questions, 77 percent; and the intersentence questions, 58 percent. The structures identified seemed to represent homogenous classes of behavior since the variation between questions measuring different skills was significantly greater than the variation between items measuring the same skill.

The rationale of both Bloomfield and Fries stressing the alphabetic principle of sound-letter correspondence is evaluated, and research comparing the effectiveness of applying this principle with other approaches to beginning reading is presented. The studies of Chomsky and Halle stressing a deeper phonological explanation for the relationships between the sounds and spelling of English suggest that the traditional spelling of a word can give, in addition to the sound of a word, syntactic and semantic clues. Several studies analyze oral reading errors of beginning readers at various linguistic levels, including morphological structure, syntactic acceptability, and semantic  appropriateness in the sentence and the entire passage. Generally, very high use of context is found. Biemiller notes three phases of errors in which first graders moved in a fairly regular progression from heavy reliance on context, to nonresponse strategy, to greater flexibility in word identification strategies. Labov's studies of Negro speech are summarized, and implications for adjusting reading instruction are pointed out.

(2) Reading is now, and must continue to be, accepted as one of the language arts and be written as such in curriculum building. (3) The structure of reading instruction, its scope and sequence, must be founded on an understanding of the nature of the symbolic process and the linguistic principles of our language. (4) Attention must be given to the adjustment of reading instruction to individual differences. (5) Teachers must accept a special responsibility  for developing critical reading and thinking. (6) Reading material as part of the mass media must be considered an indispensable adjunct to the other mass media. (7) Reading programs based on student needs should place heavy emphasis on literature. (8) The reading program at the secondary level should be a balanced one.

The Bond, Balow, Hoyt New Developmental Reading Test--Intermediate Level was used. On the Reading for Information subtest the nondirected control group scored significantly better than did the experimental group; however, that difference was only 3  months on a grade equivalent basis. This was true for all achievement groups. On the Reading for Appreciation subtest there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups on either of the subtests used, but there were significant differences between the achievement groups of both subtests.

The first-grade teacher used the program again with her 1967 class. An evaluation was conducted of the use of programed reading for these two groups as compared with the use of Scott, Foresman's basal readers for other first- and second-grade classes in the same school. The structure and rationale of programed reading are described, as well as its introduction and execution in this school. To obtain data for evaluation school personnel were interviewed, test data were tabulated, and children were interviewed and informally tested. The data were not analyzed by means of statistical tests. The advantages of programed reading over the basal  reader included greater independence in individual work, a wider range of materials in use, and greater quality and quantity of written work. Suggestions for correcting the limitations observed in programed reading included providing more oral reading activities, substituting small-group skill practice for whole-class skill teaching, and providing closer supervision to assure growth in word recognition and comprehension. Appended are a review of programed reading from the Harvard Office of Programmed Instruction, reviews of related research, tables of pupil data, and references. (CM)",

        "description":"During a 6-month period, 90 fourth-grade pupils were tutored in reading by elementary education majors as part of their regular classroom instruction. Work was done individually or in small groups 4 days weekly for   hour per tutoring session, and all materials used were on each child's instructional reading level. A control group of 90 pupils received the regular classroom instruction only. The study concluded through one-way analysis of variance that tutoring significantly increased the gains in vocabulary, comprehension, and total reading achievement for the combined tutored groups. Individualized tutoring proved more effective than small group tutoring. The program was also considered valuable for teacher education. Weekly progress reports, views of tutoring, samples of  diagnostic and evaluative reports, and materials used for tutoring are presented in appendixes. References are included. (RT)",

        "description":"Through a review of the literature, diverse definitions of the term \"dyslexia\" are presented, and the historical development of the term is looked at. Two independent strands of thought development--medical and educational--are revealed. Medical studies have sought for a common behavior pattern of all dyslexic children and for clear-cut evidence of neurological etiology. Conclusive evidence from both a statistical and pathological standpoint is still lacking. Educators tend to reject the theory of neurological dysfunction as a sole cause for reading failure. In contrast, they emphasize the developmental sequence of reading skills and search for the child's break on the developmental reading pattern. They see the diagnosis of dyslexia as lacking operationality in that it does not  lead to appropriate teaching strategies. The medically oriented clinician is likely to focus on the disabled child and emphasize individual treatment, while the educator is likely to devote a portion of his time to the developmental reading program of the entire school in seeking preventative measures. The study concludes that a need exists for a pooling of thought and research from both the educational and medical professions. A bibliography is included. (RT)",

It lasted 6 weeks and was supplemented by weekly 2-hour inservice training programs throughout the school year. Five middle schools in Hammond, Indiana, were selected to participate in the experimental Title III/ESEA project. Each school was assigned four paraprofessionals who provided corrective reading instruction and content area tutoring to 40 pupils--10 per paraprofessional. One director and three reading  specialists performed diagnostic and supervisory functions. Pupils participating in the experimental and control groups were selected from those pupils referred by the classroom teacher for corrective reading aid. Parental involvement was encouraged through meetings and individual conferences. No conclusions regarding the worth of the project could be made, although most administrators, teachers, and parents were favorable toward it. (RT)",

Fifty-five captioned slides, divided into periods of slavery, emancipation, and twentieth century, were shown. Parents rated these as favorable or unfavorable. Results of Chi-square, t-test, and analysis of variance procedures showed that 78 percent of the illustrations were approved by a majority of the respondents, and none were disapproved by a majority. Most favored pictures were of Martin Luther King, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Joe Louis, and W.E.B. DuBois. Least favorable were depictions of Malcolm X, slave labor,  and children playing in a city slum. Certain factors in the backgrounds of the respondents had significant bearing on attitudes toward the pictures.

Symptoms and causes of neurological impairment are listed, and reading disability theories are discussed. Smith and Carrigan offer a neurochemical explanation of reading disability based on synaptic transmission problems. Orton, Dearborn, and Delacato point to a relationship between reading disability and lateral dominance. However, the paper quickly notes that none of the mentioned theories have been supported by empirical data. Some helpful psychological tests for the identification of neurological defects are listed. It is pointed out that there is no sure way to diagnose neurological causes and that teachers must rely primarily on a pattern of symptoms when making  neurological referrals.

It was hypothesized that a subject hearing a sentence transforms it to its base form, stores it in this form, and recalls it, again transforming it, in its surface form. Thirty undergraduate educational psychology students, divided randomly into two groups, heard 50 taped sentences, each followed by a list of eight unrelated words. Half of the sentences were in base form; half, in surface. After they heard each sentence and its list of words, a buzzer signaled them to repeat the sentence and a second buzzer signaled them to repeat the wordlist. They were given unlimited time for recall. Mean number of words recalled did not differ significantly for groups or for  structure or type. Significantly greater numbers of errors were made by subjects when attempting to recall the surface structure form than when attempting to recall the base form. Duncan multiple range test showed that some sentence types (SVO+VO and SVO+O) were more difficult to recall than other types but that they were not significantly different from one another. Group 2 made relatively more errors on surface forms than did group 1. It was concluded that grammatical structure appears to influence the three processes (decoding, storage, and encoding) of sentence recall. References are included. (MD)",

Section 3 presents a treatment of the stimulus-response theory. In Section 4 the most important result of the paper is proved; namely, any finite automaton can be represented at asymtote by an appropriate model of stimulus-response theory. In Section 5 some extensions of these results to probabilistic automata are sketched, and an example from arithmetic is worked out in detail. The central idea is  to show that by applying accepted principles of conditioning an organism may theoretically be taught by an appropriate reinforcement schedule to respond as a finite automaton.

The algorithm is an extension of the Ho-Kashyap algorithm, utilizing the gradient descent procedure to minimize a criterion function for a solution of the linear inequalities. The criterion function to be minimized is J(Y)=4 Sum(Cosh Yi) (Cosh Yi) where y=A w - b and b is a vector with all positive elements. This criterion function has a larger gradient than previously used and a faster rate of convergence than the Ho-Kashyap algorithm for a certain range of the initial value of b. For problems where a large number of iterations were required for the Ho-Kashyap  algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduced the number of iterations by a factor of 20 to 450. The generalization of the proposed algorithm applicable to multi-class pattern classification problems is presented and a convergence proof is given. (RP)",

The school also features group counseling for students and school-community follow-through on students after they have left the program. The teacher education program, which emphasizes reciprocal  learning for Advancement School staff and Philadelphia teachers, includes temporary placement of staff in Philadelphia schools, acceptance of teachers for year-long residencies, field tests of school programs by teachers with staff guidance, and a summer workshop. The summer workshop for 1968, which focused on developing the teacher's individual possibilities (for personal growth and teaching) and awakening him to his role as change agent in his home school, was structured around four 1-week workshops (Simulations, Achievement Motivation, Communications, and Media) and exercises in group processes.

The decisionmaking model we have been using emphasizes the leadership role of the principal in creating a representative body of teachers who meet, discuss problems, and make decisions on nearly all matters of school operation over which he previously had control. Central among the problems encountered are (1) the hierarchical, bureaucratic organization of schools and  school systems, (2) the fact that changing school structure does not necessarily improve decisionmaking, (3) the nature of the trust relationship between teachers and principals, (4) the teachers' lack of collaborative problemsolving skills, particularly in working with peers, (5) the time required to make a new structure work, (6) the difficulty of insuring that the new decisionmaking body is indeed representative while trying to have it act in the best interests of the total school.

An investigation was conducted to analyze the hypothesis that students perceive their teachers' expectations idiosyncratically. In the first study the Watson Analysis Schedule (WAS) was administered to 22 students from a 10th grade world history class toward the end of the school year. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between students across the 213 items of the WAS. The mean correlation was .204. A second study involving 26 students from another 10th grade world history class replicated the first. The mean correlation coefficient between students was .254. The results  support the hypothesis since in the two groups one could expect about 4 percent and 6 percent overlap between two students' perceptions of specific classroom expectations. It would seem, then, that if goals are to be effectively attained, greater effort is necessary on the part of the teacher to communicate specific role expectations for the group goals or that learning procedures and goals need to be individualized to the extent that they can become consistent with individual role expectations.

Such requirements fall into three categories: attitudes or values, specialized knowledge, and intellectual skills or methodologies. Since an instructional technologist should be able to choose approaches to instructional design and development that are capable of empirical test and public communication, he should have a set of values that maintains empirical evidence in high regard. He will need to know something about a variety of subject matters in which he wishes to work--whether this be language and communication skills, science, technology, or equipment  maintenance and repair--and he will need to know a good deal about the variety of ways in which instruction is done, whether by lecture, group discussion, laboratory, role playing , or whatever.

Such knowledge provides a means of testing new ideas and approaches by the criteria of internal logic before they are subjected to empirical test. Intellectual skills required, other than statistical competence and communication skills, are those enabling him to analyze learning outcomes, measure outcomes, and construct empirical tests of learning outcomes.

        "description":"Discontinuity in changing from one status or role to another lessens with knowledge of the new role (gained through observation or indirect sources such as a counselor) and acquisition of its behavioral characteristics prior to formalization of the change (anticipatory socialization). This theory presumes that the image or role expectation upon which anticipatory socialization is based is accurate. In professional roles such as nursing or teaching, however, conflicting images exist: the professional image, which accurately indicates role duties; and the public, which reflects the dramatic and sterotypic role aspects and may also be outdated. A study of teacher interns revealed that those who made the most successful transition from student to teacher entered the intern program  with the clearest and most accurate image of the teacher, based on teachers whom they knew personally as well as professionally. Research on socialization for change is needed as it relates to educational and sociological problems such as urban and vocational education. (LP)",

With that in mind, American society, education, and teacher education in the year 2000 will be discussed. Over 300 million Americans (75-80 percent in urban areas) will comprise a leisure-oriented society functioning with a shorter work week, sabbaticals for laborers, computer technology, an intellectual leadership group, and persisting social ills. The greatest increase in school enrollment percentages will occur in colleges, which could be supported by  the nation with its GNP of $3 trillion. The teacher, who will be a member of a differentiated staff, may use a curriculum developed by professional federations and teach in a school serving more than academic needs. Attendance at a four-year liberal arts college, with more laboratories and field trips, may precede two years of professional education, which will also be extended to inservice teachers (during thei r working day) and specialists and paraprofessionals (on sabbaticals). A split between two kinds of teacher educators, scientific researchers and humanistic philosophers, may be on the horizon. (LP)",

To contribute substantially to solving the major problems of educational manpower, school organization, and governance of the profession, the National Commission on Teacher Education and Professional Standards (NCTEPS) must reexamine its directions and emphases in light of changing problems. The problems of educational manpower include not only those of supply of personnel, but also of who is attracted to the profession, how entrance is arranged and controlled, why people stay or leave, etc. It is time to reorganize schools and to differentiate staff roles so that personnel can be deployed in ways which will make optimum  use of interests, abilities, and commitments and afford teachers greater control of their own professional interests. And it is time to establish a variety o f categories of teaching personnel providing career patterns which encourage them to proceed with their own professional training and development. Such changes need to be accompanied with appropriate efforts to secure their basis in law. The governance of the profession should be undergirded by legislation and policies for the protection of rights and responsibilities as well as by machinery to deal with malpractice, unethical performance, and other forms of professional and legal violation.

Seven organizational properties important to understanding the effectiveness of a given clinical training progra m are identified through a comparative analysis of sociological studies of occupational training programs in various professions: (1) the program phase: disruptive or not disruptive; (2) the training environment: restrictive or open; (3) authority relationships: traditional or encouraging inquiry; (4) the setting; focused or diffused; (5) activities: their similarity to the \"core  tasks\" of the occupation; (6) degree of visibility of learner activities; (7) degree of learner interaction with \"role models.\" The criteria are then used in a comparative analysis of (1) traditional teacher internship programs and (2) a proposed clinical program based on that used in undergraduate and graduate training of physicians in teaching hospitals. The final section proposes a design for a \"clinical school\" (the organizational analogue in education to the teaching hospital) which goes further than present \"laboratory schools\" in research and development activities and in providing training for personnel from first-year graduate interns to senior doctoral students specializing in some aspect of teacher education.

Twenty-eight teacher-encoders each taped instructions for a verbal task and a geometric task for sixth and twelfth grade levels in a controlled series. Students from these grade levels decoded the messages. Analysis of the resulting student scores showed significant differences in teacher encoding ability, and that the order in which the teacher taught the lesson had made a difference. (Sixth grade students did more poorly on decoding if the instructions they received  had been recorded after the instructions for twelfth grade students had been recorded.) Multiple linear regression analyses were performed for each task (verbal and geometric), and each known teacher characteristic was assessed. It was found that known teacher characteristics did not predict differential success in encoding. Analyses of the instructions for each task (the message) was also conducted, revealing that redundancy and clarity tended to increase encoding effectiveness, although not significantly.

It was anticipated that for Ss receiving the film-mediated model, criterion scores would show stronger relation to perceptual abilities, while for Ss receiving the written model, they would show stronger relation to verbal abilities. Following administration of aptitude tests, 121 Stanford teacher trainees were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: one using a filmed portrayal of analytic questioning; one, a written text from the film sound track; and another, a control treatment which included no model. All Ss received the initial  instruction and microteaching pretest followed by two cycles of models, rehearsal, and microteaching. Classroom performance measures of the use of analytic questioning in three separate microteaching sessions were obtained by four raters who independently assessed typed transcripts of the sessions; two written posttests were also administered. Results of analysis of variance showed that both modeling treatments produced greater behavior change than the control treatment, and that film-mediated modeling was consistently more effective than written modeling. Results of regression analysis indicated that visual or verbal modes of instructional presentation may or may not be related to corresponding scores of perceptual or verbal aptitude tests. (JS)",

A study was conducted to determine whether, in a situation where a comprehensive model of instruction had already been developed, systematic feedback would improve the application of the model through reducing discrepancies between what a teacher believes she teaches and what is observed as being taught. Eight student teachers were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Each was observed eight times  over a five-week period. Subjects gave a Lesson Plan to the observer prior to observation, gave him a Reconstructed Lesson after the observation, and later received the observer's tally of discrepancies between the Reconstructed Lesson and his Observation Record. The experimental group also received immediate feedback during observation. Data was treated via repeated measures and linear trend analysis.

Introductory remarks include a list of seven priorities which form the &quot;framework of context of the NEA program&quot;; a list of 12 goals which the Association continues to champion and promote; appraisal of the &quot;broken-front approach&quot; strategy which has been applied; and a list of previous NEA assumptions which have been challenged or questioned in light of experience and achievements. The bulk of the paper is then devoted to discussion of the questions of school staffing and governance of the profession, which represent new thrusts toward remaking  the education profession to give teachers more control over their professional priorities and destiny. The growth over the past two years of the differentiated staffing concept is traced, and the strategy of setting up 220 demonstration centers and 85 (eventually 200) Staff Development Schools is described. The 1969 TEPS theme, &quot;Negotiating for Professional Standards,&quot; which includes developing a model of essential state legislation for the education profession, is described. The paper closes with a series of questions designed to raise the issues the Association must face in reappraising its position, program, and strategy. (JS)",

        "description":"A typology of teacher encounters was derived from observations of elementary school teachers for the purposes of ordering field data and indicating teaching experiences outside the classroom which affect, through sociocultural forces, classroom teaching behavior. From observations of teacher encounters in the auditorium, faculty room, school grounds, and off-school grounds as well as in the classroom, it is hypothesized that an infrequent encounter of one kind may in its ambiguity strain a teacher's sense of satisfaction more than another. Illustrative of this ambiguity which can be perceived as a dichotomy (such as professional-bureaucratic or authoritarian-democratic), are teacher evaluations and parent-teacher relationships. It is postulated that role expectations have  obscured or oversimplified research and that inquiry into the dichotomies of teaching will lead to more useful research and, because they reflect and reinforce values attached to teaching, provide reassurance that our research endeavors are consistent with our values.

Each of 38 teacher interns, the subjects of this study, taught a 50-minute video-taped lesson for which no instructions on teaching standards had been provided. Immediately after the teaching session and again after viewing the tape of his performance, each student completed an attitude questionnaire consisting of eight concepts (categorized in two domains relating to the teaching situation, and two domains  referring to the teacher's self-image) each rated on nine 7-point scales and had an interview to determine performance perception and satisfaction. On the basis of data collected before self-viewing, the video-taped performance record students were divided into low and high satisfaction groups and compared to determine if significant changes in concept ratings after self-viewing were due to predisposed satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the teaching performance. Results showed that when no model of \"good teaching\" is presented, reactions to self-viewing of teaching performance are determined largely by the viewer's predispositions.

Findings showed that all students were more satisfied with, preferred, and earned high grades from nondirective teachers in both vocational and nonvocational subjects, and that abstract and nonauthoritarian students showed differentiation between directive and nondirective teachers while concrete and authoritarian students did not.

Results of the study favored multidimensionality as it permits a more diversified system of interrelationships to be analyzed. Specifically, results suggested that high levels of student cognition are related to the student-centeredness and warmth (socioemotional climate) of the classroom environment and to student behavior rather than to  the teacher's cognitive level. Regarding the socioemotional climate in particular, it was found that the components of indirect behavior such as teacher warmth and positive reinforcement are not related in the experimental behavior dimension, and that the pattern of teacher behavior is as important as the behaviors themselves.

Twenty-four selected student-generated verbal behaviors (analyzed by the Flanders' system) were subjected to analysis of variance for significant differences of means between the experimental and control groups for all weeks combined. Results showed that for student teachers who received analyses, feedback differed significantly from those who did not in 15 of the 24 analyses, exhibited more indirect verbal behaviors and in addition, used significantly less teacher-initiated talk with more student-initiated talk.

Also, to test for significant differences among four sequential teacher role-playing functions (derived from a grouping of teacher behaviors), separate interaction matrices were formed for each: Teacher-dominated interaction to acquaint the students with the problem (warm-up), balanced student teacher interaction as the problem is explored (discussion), student-dominated interaction in role assumption and problemsolving (role-playing), and  balanced interaction in reviewing major ideas derived from the session (summary). For control purposes, similar student-teacher interaction matrices from a previous study were obtained and contrasted with the overall and the role-playing function matrices. Results of analyses showed significant differences between the four role-playing functions, and in student teacher interaction between the conventional classes and the role-playing classes when analyzed for role-playing function. However, no significant overall differences in interaction were found between the two types of classes. (SM)",

        "description":"An experimental program was initiated into the Glenview (Illinois) Public Schools in 1964 to help elementary students learn to spell correctly and to write fluently. The spelling approach was based on the assumptions that students learn correct spelling best from a word list, that an initial test identifies normally misspelled words, and that students should master first the spelling of words used most frequently in their writing. A list of words to be taught was prepared from the written vocabulary of Glenview children in grades 2-6. Establishment of this spelling program led to the development of a total English program in which spelling was placed in its proper \"frame of reference as one aspect of revision and proofreading.\" This program emphasizes written expression and  encompasses six major areas at each elementary grade: language development, syntax, study skills, composition (various types of writing), mechanics, and spelling.

Re-acting a portion of a second-rate television show can help children become more perceptive critics and prepare them to view better drama that the teacher could bring to the classroom. Free, creative rhythmic movement allows children to use their imaginations, while observation of the emotional and physical states of others gives them an understanding of people--the real basis for acting. Dramatizing a story is another enjoyable class activity that can lead to the students' desire to produce a play based on the story. For such productions, the children can solve the problems of setting, exposition, properties, and costumes. Using spontaneous dialog and the  intimacy of floor-level presentations, students can give successful performances. (JS)",

Speech has a speaker to provide language with inflectional stress and a visible audience to respond immediately to that language. On the other hand, prose (\"an art of written language\")--which is separated in time from an invisible, unknown audience--requires the controlled elaboration of complex thought, an analysis of the processes contributing that thought, and a synthesis of the experience of the writer and his audience. Prose today must also be artfully disguised as \"just talk\" to compete with the pervasiveness and informality of spoken language. Consequently, modern prose style no longer reflects the balanced emphasis of 18th-century literary  constructions, but rather communicates a sense of personal immediacy often at the expense of articulate order, depending on the reader to supply far subtler effects than can be managed by either punctuation or structure. Prose of the future, instead of competing with spoken language to gain an audience, should concentrate on its own best task of preserving the ideals and permanent records of a literate community.

        "description":"The practicing writer encounters four determinants of his use of prose. First, the language itself determines the expression: English, with its wealth of words and styles and with few traditional restrictions, provides problems of choice and temptations to overwrite. Second, the application of verse forms to the novel and a demand for consistently arresting language patterns encourage writers to strive for extravagant effects. A third determinant is the attitude of the writer toward his characters and what he is expressing. This \"tone of mind\" may vary from the simplicity expressed in Hemingway's sentences to the complexity in Patrick White's varied syntax. Fourth, a writer's use of language is determined by the range of styles he has available for adaption: frequently style is  influenced by the writer's concurrent reading, and the second draft of the novel must assimilate a multitude of styles. Ideally, the language should arise from the vitality of the novel. A style can be noticeable but it should remain a medium for expression, not an end in itself. Australian novelists face peculiar problems in their lack of a literary community, their colonial self-consciousness, and the difficulty of symbolically using the Australian landscape. (LH)",

Related in obvious ways with the history of language but often overlooked in dialectology, these principles are (1) that any living language is certain to be changed by its speakers, (2) that speakers who use a language together change it similarly, (3) that different languages become more alike as their speakers communicate with one another, and (4) that speakers who use a language separately change it differently. For instance, because the speakers of Indo-European separated into groups isolated from one another, the natural changes which occurred in the language differed from group to  group until the resultant languages became mutually unintelligible. Similarly, dialect differences now common in the United States have occurred because of the isolation of various groups in the culture and can be explained in terms of linguistic change. Dialects, which are now maintained because a child learns the dialect of his acquaintances, will converge when the various groups in the culture interact with one another. (JS)",

The principal test instruments--student questionnaires and the Iowa Tests of Educational Development--were administered to over 400 students in grades 9-12.

New interest in the \"pre-writing\" activities--e.g., audience analysis, concept formation, and the discovery of judgments which order and give meaning to experience--has manifested itself both in research into the nature of these activities and in the development of heuristic procedures to carry out these activities more efficiently. However, recent research has ignored the motivation for engaging in pre-writing activities. The very earliest stages of the writing process actually begin as the writer discovers that he is psychologically uncomfortable about some violation to his image of the world and wished to resolve the difficulty. He then analyzes and articulates the  opposing components of his image, describes its origins, and specifies, in the form of a question, what he believes will resolve the inconsistency or eliminate the problem which is, at the outset, unknown to him. Because problems are important incentives to action, writing instruction should teach not only the nature and articulation of problems, but also should sharpen the student's awareness of his own cognitive life and encourage him to believe that events in it are appropriate subjects for investigation.

It showed that teachers get very little supervision, that they feel that they need improvement in teaching composition, reading, and the &quot;new grammar,&quot; and that composition should be emphasized more than it is. In their preparation, the majority of the teachers had courses in methods but only about half had any preparation in reading methods and in literature for young people. Less than a third had courses in advanced composition. Half held the secondary certificate, and a little more than a third held the elementary. Seventy-one percent held bachelor's degrees; 21 percent, master's; six percent had no degree. About  half had majored in English. The survey indicated that there was little interest in in-service or continuing education. Most teachers taught in a departmentalized situation, but there was a rather sizable group who taught in self-contained classrooms. In some instances grade 9 was considered to be a part of the junior high school and in others a part of the high school. At least half of the schools represented had block courses. The results of the survey led to seven recommendations on the teaching of English in junior high school. (The questionnaire is appended.) (Author)",

An evaluation of the adequacy of the 101-300 sequence as composition preparation for teaching English in the secondary school was made concurrently in the study. Results of a standardized composition test, theme analyses, and evaluations by composition instructors showed slightly greater, but not statistically significant, gains in writing proficiencies in the 101-300 sequence than in the 101-101 sequence. Greater maturity and  ability in analyzing, organizing, and expressing complex ideas were shown by students completing the 101-300 sequence which provides the added benefit of a review of writing principles and practice at the upper-class level.

Also discussed are test information, attendance and discipline, maturity, family background, reasons for leaving school, future plans and activities of dropouts, and the exit interview.

Analyses of variance were carried out for each of the subtest scores and significance was found for order of presentation and intelligence level. It was found that the WAIS produces significantly higher score in the less-than-average intellectual range and that the WISC  produces significantly higher scores in the average or more-than-average ranges.

Subjects were tenth grade students in a suburban Boston high school. A one-week residential course during winter and spring vacations was taken by one group of six boys and a second group of four. Equated matched control groups were set up. Course content consisted of learning about the achievement syndrome, exercises in self-study, planning future activities, and learning individual responsibility from group living. Findings show that fully trained boys (those who remained in the course for the full five days) had improved academic performance and better attitudes toward school. On the whole, however, the results are said to be inconclusive.  The project gains significance largely because the study is one of the very few which show that intervention can produce a significant improvement in \"hard core\" problem boys. (NH)",

Eleven county areas were selected in Wisconsin which contained a vocational school and a substantial number and variety of government personnel. Budgets, personnel rosters, job specifications, vocational school course offerings, and other documents were collected and reviewed, and interviews with government officials and school personnel were conducted. Over 6,500 employee questionnaire s were completed and processed. Some conclusions were: (1) The size of the sub-professional labor force of government was substantial, (2) Many preconditions of employment had been established by government, (3) A high  proportion of vacant positions were filled by persons already employed by government, (4) The number of menial jobs for which vocationally trained youth would be over-qualified, comprised a substantially large portion of the positions, (5) Government did not compete with private industry in recruiting practices or monetary rewards, and (6) Very little was known about government jobs, either by the schools, the students, or the government employers themselves.

Some major findings were: (1) Mechanization of the cotton harvest has erased the high peak of seasonal farm labor, (2) Management of labor recruitment can lead to the development of a dependable local labor force, (3) Much of the problem is due to migrant crews moving over the state and taking jobs away from local workers, (5) The seasonal work force is greatly under-utilized, (6) Underemployment is largely due to prejudices of workers against certain kinds of farm work, (7) A work program, including learning marketable skills would assist in meeting  farm labor family needs. Some recommended activities useful in stabilizing local labor supply were: (1) increased activity by grower groups in recruiting and handling labor, (2) experimentation with crews trained to do all types of farm jobs, (3) development of new crops and varieties to smooth out the work year, and (4) in-migration of new workers willing to do all farm jobs.

Major steps in the study were: (1) identification of costs and benefits, (2) collection of representative data, (3) determination of appropriate criteria for investment decisions, (4) statistical analysis, (5) calculation of the return to the investment, and (6) consideration of limitations and related issues. Data were collected in three cities. The dependent variables were the average monthly earnings before and after taxes 1 and 6-years after graduation, and the percent of time employed 1 and 6-years after graduation. The independent variables were (1) city of  graduation, (2) type of curriculum, (3) sex, (4) IQ, (5) race, (6) marital status, and (7) father's education. Other non-monetary and non-economic benefits and performance characteristics such as voting behavior and economic aspirations were also examined. A detailed discussion of conceptual, statistical, and methodological considerations is included, in addition to an extensive discussion of specific findings. (EM)",

Self-help programs such as Alcoholic s Anonymous and Synanon have attracted wide attraction. The concept of using a product of the problem to help others with the same problem is not new, but it has been applied only to a limited degree in the rehabilitation of the public offender. To allow a full expression of views on this topic, the papers given at this meeting examine the promise and problems of such a program for the offender himself, for the correctional system and for society. Presentations include: \"Offender Participation in the Correctional Process: General Theoretical Issues\" by LaMar T. Empey; \"Sources of  Resistance to the Use of Offenders and Ex-Offenders in the Correctional Process\" by Donald R.

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to develop an effective, efficient, standard method of training aides using programed instruction. A 2-month curriculum which had been established in the Los Angeles County Hospitals in 1962 was refined and objectives were specified in behavioral terms. Programed instruction materials were written for the knowledge aspects of the course, and tests were developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum and the materials. The November 1967 class of trainees who participated in the demonstration project were compared with trainees of 1963 who had had formal group training but no programed instruction and with a group trained in 1961 or before with on-the-job training only. The test results indicated that those who had had formal training  attained more knowledge than those with on-the-job training only. There was no significant difference between formal group training without programed instruction and formal group training with programmed instruction. However, the latter required 35 percent less instructor time. It is recommended that programed instruction be integrated into formal training programs because it conserves instructor time, provides for flexible scheduling for large or small groups, and aids in standardizing content. Appendixes include a sample test, a curriculum outline, a day-by-day program schedule, and a rating scale. (JK)",

Supplemented by federal funds over $52 million appropriated by the Ohio General Assembly has been spent for these 2-year campuses. The Ohio Board of Regents and the State Board of Education consider technical education beyond high school an integral part of higher education, and the former has established appropriate standards for curriculum, faculty and facilities. As funds become  available, the Ohio Board of Regents plans to extend the network of technical education centers, to improve the financial support of technical education, and to encourage increased student and employer understanding and acceptance of technical education.

Once trained these youth sometimes refused to accept employment, were poorly prepared for earning money, got into trouble, sometimes quit the low-entry jobs, were sometimes fired after placement, and had to be brought back into the program for further training and remediation. Other factors included discrimination, a shortage of the requisite kinds and numbers of jobs, the obsolescence and inadequacy of existing vocational schools, the refusal of labor unions to support apprenticeship programs,  and the lack of program coordination between those who train and those who hire. The school dropout is for the most part trainable and employable, but only with a considerable investment in time and dollars. The strategy of the economics of intervention and return on investment indicate that prevention is cheaper than therapy. Some alternatives to existing youth employment training programs are the armed forces model, the school model, the redefinition model and the industrial model. (DM)",

Some findings were: (1) Out-migration was greater in the high agricultural income area, (2) Career advancement was highly associated with migration, (3) In the high agricultural income area, out-migration was associated with residence, father's occupation, present occupational aspiration, year of high school graduation, and age at the time of interview, (4) In the low agricultural income area, migration was associated with present occupational aspiration, year of graduation, age at  time of interview, and place of early adulthood residence, (5) Graduates who migrated from the low income agricultural area tended to remain within commuting distance of their high school community or leave the state entirely, (6) High agricultura l income area graduates more frequently move beyond the commuting distance of their home high schools but remained within the state, (7) 64 percent of the low agricultural income area and 47 percent of the high agricultural income area graduates who migrated moved to cities of 100,000 or more.

The analysis, integration, and classification of objectives leading to an integrated curriculum will require various intensive activities: (1) in-residence writing programs, (2) laboratory-classroom opportunities to test germinal ideas, and (3) resources for a national testing program. The rationale for an integrated curriculum is contingent upon the fact that many learning experiences in different subject matter areas are quite similar, therefore an attempt is needed to group learning experiences based on process rather than  subject matter. Constructing an integrated curriculum involves: development of behavioral objectives by subject matter, and utilization of a scheme for integrating objectives. Such an approach is expected to be utilized for the Study of Curriculums for Occupational Preparation in Education Project (SCOPE). A major advantage to an integrated curriculum is the resulting improved occupational relevance of subject matter material. (DM)",

Despite this, the division of labor and the demands are not uniformly identified for social workers of differing educational preparation. The size of the social work manpower problem has been caused by the rapid population increase, increased urbanization and industrialization social problems, expansion of the demand and utilization of social services, and greater expectations of individuals for  personal and social fulfillment. The need for social workers for Department of Health, Education, and Welfare programs is projected to be 100,000 persons by 1970. Many schools of social work are already full and new facilities are necessary to increase the supply of graduates. Administrative policy on licensure, manpower data collection, financial and career opportunities, job titles and qualifications, and educational programs need to be developed and implemented. (EM)",

Attention is given to the methods (inputs) for arousing motives and ways of evaluating whether a motive has been aroused (yields). There are two general types of inputs: course inputs and environmental inputs. Course inputs may be placed in four groups: (1) teaching the achievement syndrome, (2) fostering goal setting, (3) providing cognitive supports, and (4) providing group supports. Environmental inputs are the opportunities and specific external cues for motives.  Motivation is studied relative to potential high school dropouts, increases through structure and climate, and yields through individualized instruction. A related document is VT 008 366. (CH) -",

Educational change must be a logical outcome of systematic, controlled, empirical, and critical investigation. Improvement of research is dependent upon increased interaction of research specialists and vocational educators. Some major recommendations concerned project review, the need for greater dissemination of research data, and the guarantee of full amounts of research funds offered by public laws. The vocational education amendments of 1968 designated use of research funds for: (1) research in vocational education, (2) training programs for research dissemination, (3) experimental, developmental, and pilot programs for projects, (4) demonstration and dissemination projects,  (5) development of new vocational education curriculums, and (6) development of programs for new careers and occupations. Areas of proposed research were: (1) philosophical foundations of vocational education, (2) the process of vocational education, (3) preparation of professional personnel, (4) reorganization of the high school curriculum, (5) post-secondary development, (6) vocational guidance and curriculum development, (7) evaluation of vocational education, and (8) vocational education needs for girls and women.

        "description":"This study was designed to test the belief that severely handicapped children are comparatively unready to utilize vocational services at the time they leave school, because, in comparison with normal children, they have not been exposed to a variety of prevocational work experience in their formative years. The study sample comprised approximately 280 handicapped children ranging in age from 14 to 17. The children were subdivided into three disability groupings: the physically disabled, the educable mentally retarded, and the emotionally disturbed. It was found that the physically disabled children evidenced more benefit from the services than did the other two groupings. The mentally retarded showed gains in socialization but not in employability, and the emotionally disturbed  children did not show any significant benefits. It is believed that prevocational services will be more effective if they are provided within the school system itself. A related document is ED 015 314. (CH)",

In an attempt to classify and project the needs and demands of different types of employment, graphs were used to illustrate: (1) employment in major occupational groups, (2) employment in major industry groups, (3) employment by occupational families, (4) occupational opportunity trends, and (5) differential unemployment rates. The primary outcome of work is some specified product, but learning is also a concomitant of every job. A goal of occupational education is the gaining of specific  skills or knowledge contributing to the efficient performance of some job which results in a product and learning. Each job requires specific combinations of skill, knowledge and experience for the sake of efficiency, but even more basic to employability are certain attitudes. A taxonomy of work was forwarded to illustrate the three basic problems to be confronted in occupational education: unemployment, underemployment, and overemployment.

Three versions of the Section Control Indicator Console of the Nike-Hercules guided missile system were utilized. One version was a physical duplicate, fully powered and operational; a second had no power; and a third was a full sized color illustration of the powered version. Sixty U.S. Army trainees were randomly assigned to one of five training conditions, 12 to a group. Each subject was tested immediately after training, 4 weeks later, and 6 weeks later, and  each was retrained to a criterion level.

Data were collected through a review of the literature and have been limited mainly to research reports on remedial adult education programs. Findings showed that the disadvantaged, who are hampered by psychological disabilities, have the lowest income, the largest families, the poorest education, the highest incidence of ill health, the least change of employment, and little promise of a better future. Largely because of discrimination, the poverty subculture is compelled to evolve its own way of life, and programs of change seem doomed if they adhere to established patterns of contact. These programs should cope with the fundamental problem  of overcoming the resistance of the disadvantaged to education. Specific details of educational planning to solve the problems inherent in programs designed for such adults are unavailable because of the scarcity of research.

The studies had both a basic and an applied objective. The basic objective was to obtain evidence upon which to base a theory of the processes involved in language comprehension. The correlations between a large number of linguistic features and a measure of the difficulty students exhibited in comprehending the written language samples in which those features occurred were determined. The number of linguistic features which can be conceptualized numbers in the hundreds, most of which must be regarded as potentially representing a stimulus involved in the comprehension processes, because present theory  of comprehension is too primitive to permit the authors to identify or to rule out more than a few of those features. The applied objective was to develop regression formulas for estimating if instructional materials are suitable for students of varying levels of language comprehension ability. These readability formulas provide a partial solution to the problem of fitting materials to students. That is, students may be provided with materials suited to their levels of comprehension ability not only by manipulating the materials to make them suitably understandable but also by selecting and using just those materials which are suited to the students' comprehension ability.

D&U is viewed as a transfer of messages by various media between resource systems and users. Major sections analyze characteristics of individuals and organizations which inhibit or facilitate this transfer. The process is interpreted at four levels; the individual, the interpersonal, the organization, and the social system. Additional chapters analyze messages, media, phase models, and knowledge-linking roles. Models of D&U can be grouped into three perspectives: (1) \"Research, Development and Diffusion\", (2) \"Social Interaction\", and (3) \"Problem  Solving.\" A \"linkage\" model is proposed as a synthesis. Successful linkage is achieved when user and resource system interact collaboratively, simulating each others' problem solving behavior. Seven factors highly related to successful D&U are: (1) linkage to internal and external resources; (2) degree of structure in resource system, user, message and medium; (3) openness of user and resource systems; (4) capacity to marshall diverse resources; (5) reward; (6) proximity to resources and other users; and (7) synergy, i.e., the variety, persistence, and synchronization of messages and media. Implications are drawn for research, development, practice, and policy. (Author)",

Even when the Neighborhood Council rejected participation in the second government Model Cities Planning, members were determined to solve their community problems of jobs, housing, and education through active community involvement and existing governmental and private service agencies. The project consisted of a series of related neighborhood workshops for persons in the target poverty communities. The  purposes and results of the workshop were: examining the elements necessary to a successful neighborhood organization; examining techniques of integrating neighborhood organizations into the urban regional governmental complex; and preparing and publishing a manual of neighborhood organization designed especially for the Louisville Metropolitan Region.

The schools focused on economics, vocation, retraining, patriotism, social preparedness, self-knowledge, self-improvement, and responsible citizenship. Although many of the programs of the early folk high schools were general, some concentrated on civic education--others on practical subjects. All periods showed a high percentage of Finnish-speaking participants, a smaller percentage of Swedish-speaking ones, and a representative number of teenagers; while the third period showed a decrease in the percentage of students from the  agrarian population. It was only after 1925 that folk high school principals were required to have an M.A. degree, teacher training, and experience in teaching in the folk high school. State aid which was made statutory in 1926 absorbed 70% of the total cost by 1959. The folk academies were and have remained more theoretical and academic than the folk high schools.

        "description":"A report is made to the Secretariat of the Council of Europe of a case study on the introduction of the concept of permanent education in Denmark. The supplies of education, which have been limited to clients in childhhod, adolescence, and yound adulthood, should now be distributed over a lifetime. Economic growth was formerly explained by input of land, labor, and capital; now it is accepted that research and education also are input factors. Political integration in Western Europe will lead to economic growth but may also cause disruption and unemployment in certain industries. Dependent on foreign trade, Denmark is particularly vulnerable; the best basis for industrial development will be a stronger educational system combined with research. A plan for the introduction of  permanent education might comprise: provision of educational supplies to all major professions and occupations; reorganization of the existing system; research, development, and control functions; and reorganization of educational administration through legislative amdendments.

A test was composed which comprised 40 questions spanning mathematics from 10th year to first year college level; together with a questionnaire, it was sent to participants in adult education classes in physical and biological subjects and in nonscience classes, in city, suburban, and county areas. A small control group was drawn from the staff of Senate House, administrative headquarters of London University. The parameters derived from total scores were Residual Mathematical Age (RMA) and Retention. Women adult students were found inferior in Retention, although the younger women in the control group did not show inferiority. Retention was inversely  related to education; time since mathematical education ended was of surprisingly little significance; and people retain more mathematics than they think they do. Distributions of RMA and Retention were strongly dependent on the type of course attended; people competent in mathematics appeared in physical science courses and absent from nonscience courses; women did not join classes demanding mathematical ability unless they were far above average.

In the experiment, extension agents worked intensively with farm families in five township areas for five years; one of the major objectives was to develop and test techniques for increasing agricultural output. It was found that farmers in experimental areas adopted improved farm practices faster and stepped up their use of inputs more than farmers in matched control groups. Average value of total farm output increased $5,600 on experimental farms as compared to $3,400 on control  farms. Net farm earnings for the experimental sample increased an average of $1,646 as compared with $938 for the control sample. Benefit-cost analysis showed that the program cost $117 per farm per year. The differential increase in net earnings during the five-year experimental period exceeded the total costs of the program by two and one-half times.

Permanent residential facilities were opened in 1962 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and added to in 1965. Objectives are to develop and conduct programs for persons interested in cooperatives, carry on research and scholarship programs, provide consultative services, develop a cultural center, maintain a library, make and enter into contracts, and provide other services. Although it lacks a research program and adequate funds for  staff and library, the residential facilities, involvement of clients in program planning, emphasis on self help and back-home applications are great strengths. Challenges for additional services in the future will necessitate financial support and association with other educational agencies. (eb)",

Participants and nonparticipants appeared to have markedly different attitudes toward change, although many of the differences observed were accounted for by age and education. When these and other variables were controlled, however, participants were more willing than nonparticipants to give up their spare time to further their education, and they noted a  greater need for more education to insure satisfactory employment in the future. To secure wider participation of the rural population in continuing education programs, it would first seem necessary to encourage the development of favorable attitudes toward change.

Findings of the inventory of Federally-supported programs in extension and continuing education (contracted to Greenleigh Associates, Inc.) indicate that program development is markedly uneven across the country, and a number of Federal agencies and offices could not complete the inventory questionnaire with a high degree of reliability or detail because the program information required was not available. Concern was expressed about the lack of trained personnel to develop and implement programs. The Council is developing program evaluation criteria and (with regard to Title I of the Higher Education  Act of 1965) recommends: (1) continuation of the grant program; (2) continuation of the 75% Federal - 25% non Federal matching requirements for the next two years; and, (3) allocations of at least 10% of Title I appropriations for special demonstration and experimental projects.

The new emphasis on serving the whole community calls for a totally different approach--that of integrating continuing education fully into the colleges' regular program. This requires interaction between administrators of equal rank at a senior staff level rather than the obsolete chain of command pattern. The integrative approach is illustrated by Selkirk College (Trail, British Columbia). No differentiation is drawn between youth and adult students in formal classes. Each faculty member is considered also as an adult educator and organizes, with community residents, programs relevant to community needs. The  college did much to facilitate informed work and discussion on the problem of consolidating local government units. While there has been some difficulty in winning acceptance for this approach among faculty and school boards, the concept is seen as one of potential importance for community development. (dm)",

The categories were delineated as follows: (1) a formal organization for coordination of extension work exists and is functioning; (2) some formal coordination exists among institutions in the state which offer extension course work; (3) one institution in the state offers the great majority of extension course work and no coordination among institutions is necessary; (4) several institutions within the state are engaged in extension course work, but these institutions feel no need  for interinstitutional cooperation; (5) several institutions within the state offer extension courses and believe there is a need for coordination, but there is no formal or informal organization in existence; (6) reports were received from more than one institution in the state and the information is conflicting or contradictory. Data which were collected through mailed questionnaires revealed the following: 13 states fall in category 1, 7 in 2, 2 in 5, and 2 in 6. (The questionnaire is included). (nl)",

The majority of viewers obtained notification of the series from newspapers and the extension newsletter. Other findings showed that almost three quarters of the women had sewn before, the mean number of programs viewed was 3.7, and few viewers attended supplementary extension classes. Respondents were generally favorably impressed with the series, found the  information packets helpful, and increased their knowledge of sewing. Those viewing more programs had higher scores, but no relationship was found between age groups (those under 20 to 45 years and 46 years+).

Employment opportunities for 1967 participants were better than they were for those of 1966. There tends to be considerable variation among states in the non-employment of participants in both summer institutes. Montana,  Utah, and Wyoming fared best in 1966-67 with only a small percentage of respondents indicating no teaching assignment.

Analysis and refining produced 30 distinctive units or concepts. Real-life situations and examples were used to explain such major concepts as affective behavior, channel, commitment, language, message, persuasion, sender, and receiver. Finally, seven kinds of desired knowledge were discussed as guidelines for intensive study:  communication as a dynamic process; the importance of communication concepts in educational change; the concepts themselves as related to agricultural education; the importance of the communicator in presenting valid information; sources of difficulties; the sender receiver relationship; and qualities desirable for improving information dissemination.

In preparation for careers, women returning to college face such problems as: adjusting to the learning environment; lacking self-confidence; overestimating previous experience and training; facing lack of understanding of the mature personality by administration; limitations of time imposed by her multiple role; and coping with changing family  relationships.

Both states required citizenship, age of 21, and ability to read and write any article of the United States Constitution, with Alabama requiring the English language be used. The Dale-Chall Readability Formula was applied to the Louisiana test and revealed a ninth grade reading level. The Flesch Formula was applied to the Alabama test, in addition; and the Dale-Chall reading level revealed a grade of thirteen to fifteen; while a third formula by Gunning revealed an eighth grade score. It was concluded that the tests were not based  upon a sixth grade reading level, and either this grade should be changed to an eighth grade level or above, or a different test not requiring reading of the Constitution should be used. An alternative would be to teach registrants with special reading materials with technical political vocabulary. It was recommended that one consider the ability to take tests, to fill in blanks, and to complete multiple choice questions and sentences. (pt)",

The National Institute for Public Affairs sponsored three studies of such educational need in Detroit, Berkeley, and Syracuse, which resulted in the philosophy that mid-career programs should provide a general and interdisciplinary approach for understanding of the metropolitan community. The Syracuse University program conducted in 1967, and repeated in 1968, was attended by 45 public administrators from five upstate metropolitan areas. The program was conducted over a four-month period, involving two one-week in-residence training periods at both ends of the session. The first phase consisted of lectures,  discussions, and workshops in preparation for analysis of the metropolitan area, which occupied the following two months. The resulting papers were discussed in the last residential week.

Reasons for the necessity of such studies are discussed and include: the degree of participation in, and support of, local programs is proportionate to their relevance to real life; adult education should be a primary medium for a citizens' intellectual growth and participation in organized community life; and systematic study of the community enables a greater understanding of social problems and ability in dealing with them.

The questionnaire used was about the same as the one used the year before (1967). It was found that age, sex, marriage, and family responsibilities did not prevent attendance. Many graduates received promotions, job changes, and increased income; a significant number planned to continue their education. Most of them praised the teachers highly and felt that the amount of work required was about right and that the required or elective subjects were helpful. It is recommended that the program be continued and that federal, state, and local  agencies try to secure financial help. (eb)",

Immediate program evaluation and followup evaluation were done; the University of Maryland followup surveyed not only workshop participants, but also trainers and teachers taught by them. The workshops led to the publication (1966) of a guide for teacher trainers and to the creation (1967) of a national clearinghouse on public school adult education. Areas of need were highlighted in information and coordination, teacher training, curriculum development, funding, publicity, student evaluation, and counseling. Recommendations called for a national service bureau in adult basic education, regional  demonstration centers, a national teacher training institute, demonstration projects in industry, and a demonstration project to train dropouts and unemployed youth as teacher aides.

There is no simple, automatic correlation between education and freedom, adult education and parliamentary democracy. Adult education for living democratically involves the family, school, work and leisure time institutions, and society generally, and includes the participation of the citizen as a voter, member of a party, and officeholder. A study of the influence of adult education on Swedish elected officials revealed that 66% of the parliamentarians, 79% of the social democrats, 87% of the agrarians,  41% of the liberals, and 33% of the conservatives had recourse to adult education. Adult education preparation for city council members in Stockholm and three other selected communities ranged from 51% to 80%. Political participation must be learned; therefore, education bears a major responsibility for overcoming political apathy.

The formal, irrelevant education, confined to the earlier years of an individual's life may only prepare him for a minimum of seven to 15 years of work during his adult life. Because India presently exists somewhere between the pre-industrial and industrial stages, the country must accommodate monumental and often unpredictable change. Development of a philosophy of lifelong learning will be necessary to meet the challenges of a changing world, which in turn will demand a change of educational objectives, organization, content, and methods. There can no longer be the conflict between science and arts, humanities, and technology,  general and vocational learning, utilitarian and non-utilitarian education, primary versus secondary, and school versus adult literacy. The development of a practical program of lifelong learning will require interdisciplinary research and cooperation which will be challenged by the inertia of the Indian society.

The number of households in the United States will rise to 84.4 million by July 1985, representing an increase of 26.3 million over the estimated 58.1 million in March, 1966. The Western states are expected to lead the country in population gains. In 1985, throughout the country, high school graduates will rise from the 1965 49% to 68%; college graduates aged 25 and over, from less than 10 million to 21 million; women with four years of college, from 7% to 13%. In 1967, educational attainment in the central cities of metropolitan areas was lower than outside the central  cities. Educational attainment among Negroes was highest in metropolitan areas. The proportion of men over 65 in the rural work force is double that of the urban population. Women 55 to 64 will increase from the 9 million of 1966 to 11.3 million in 1980; those 35 to 39 will also increase; but those 40 to 44 will decrease by 9%. Changes are also taking place in the family, which is assuming less responsibility for child development and transmission of basic cultural values.

From these, 88 were selected for the experimental study; and of these 88, 41 completed the experiment. In Albany county, 12 of the 41 persons met in two sessions with a film, lecture, and small group discussions; while 29 from Laramie county received the information only through the mail in written form. Both methods of disseminating information about the tested concepts on the attitude scale were significantly effective in changing  total scores in the low and high groups.

The sample included 268 randomly selected faculty members and administrators from seven universities in the western states, and 175 industrial personnel of eight firms in the area. Two opinionaires were devised, one for universities and one for industry. A Fisher's t for uncorrelated means was used to determine the significance at the .05 level. Roughly one-fourth of the university faculty members had no time for courses; the rest thought they could take an average of 3.5 semester hours without adversely affecting full time responsibilities. About 80% felt that all tuition should be free to the faculty. The industrial  personnel felt they could devote 8.7 hours per week to continuing education and felt the company should pay three-fourths of the cost. A higher percentage of university faculty members than of industrial employees were working toward advanced degrees, but both devoted about the same amount of time to the job and community. More industrial personnel attended noncredit classes. (A bibliography and copies of the questionnaires used are included.) (author/nl)",

In Bristol, a class in archaeology included a week-end course on &quot;Archaeological Air Photography,&quot; in which members flew, photographed, and interpreted findings. Leeds, Keele, and Sheffield reported courses for students working for London external degrees; at Sheffield these included 17 students from industrial day release courses. Other exploratory courses  included Liverpool's &quot;family summer school&quot; and Leicester's &quot;Making a Teaching Film.&quot; The overall expansion of adult programs is continuing at a rate of over 6% yearly; tutorials increased from 694 to 710. Greater effectiveness was found in using full time, rather than part time tutors, who often model evening classes after daytime ones.

Educators were asked about role concepts, years of service, training and prior experience, proportion of time devoted to continuing education, numbers of persons devoting major time to ministerial continuing education, chief problems, and their own continuing education. Fiscal policies, criteria for selecting participants and developing programs, provisions for educational counseling, denominational strategies, and extradenominational participation were investigated. Data on participation by clergy and laity in nonresidential, residential, and  correspondence study were tabulated for action training centers, clinical pastoral education centers, councils of churches, seminaries, universities and colleges, denominational agencies, specialized continuing education agencies, and miscellaneous agencies. Respondents also indicated specific objectives, evaluation techniques, personal preferences among programs, programs with the most educational value, popular types of programs, and lessons gained from experience.

Assuming a positive relation between knowledge level and leadership performance, selection and/or retention of leaders could be based on the following characteristics: (1) four years or more of experience; (2) married people with children in 4-H; (3) former 4-H members; (4) relatively young (averaging about 41); and (5) previous teacher and/or leadership training experience. It seems that attention should be paid the following items: (1) key content areas such as &quot;how to teach boys and girls&quot; and &quot;how to  organize 4-H clubs&quot; should receive attention since leaders felt least competent in these areas; (2) the specific tasks and responsibilities of leaders should be made very clear to them when they are first recruited and trained, so as to leave no doubts concerning their proper role.

Peace Corps trainees can provide reliable personality descriptions of each other; when these are gathered in a systematic, controlled manner, they can lead to an integration of assessment, training, and research. In this experiment, trainees evaluated themselves and each other on traits and skills deemed especially relevant by the assessment staff and staff members who had just had  overseas experience (host country nationals, returned Peace Corps volunteers, and the project director). Assessment and human relations training was then integrated by means of the assessment staff's constructing and evaluating their particular assessment instruments, discussing the results of their assessment with each trainee, and initiating feedback.

The child has lived in the United States and English is her primary language but her parents speak only French in the home and she has spent several months in France during three visits there. The data used in this study were collected in the child's home by her bilingual parents during the period when she was six years and three months to seven years and two months of age. Grammatical and lexical interference was shown to occur in both languages: English influencing French in word order and stress, and French influencing English in the category of gender. The child does not, however, show any evidence of phonological interference in either language. Examples are given of the use of loanshifts,  loanwords, syntactic substitutions, word order, agreement of gender and number, stress, and extension of grammatical morphemes. The author concludes that, in spite of considerable lexical and grammatical interference, there is no evidence of a merger of lexicons or grammatical structures. The child has not evolved a lexicon or grammatical structure compounded of French and English elements. The author also feels that these observations illustrate the validity and completeness of the theoretical framework developed by Uriel Weinrich in &quot;Languages in Contact&quot; (New York, 1953).

        "description":"The object of this study is to treat pronominalization in Spanish within the framework of generative grammar. (The non-hypenated word \"pronoun\" refers to the traditional class of words including alguien, algo, el, or ella. The hypenated form, \"pro-noun,\" refers to the underlying lexical entries or feature complexes which share the features [+pro, +noun].) The description here is limited to pronominalizations which can be traced to underlying strings of determiners and pro-nouns. The determiners are the definite and indefinite articles, the demonstratives, and the indefinite determiner, algun- 'some'. This study differs from that of Stockwell, Bowen and Martin principally in that the underlying forms upon which the processes of pronominalization act will be considered feature  complexes occurring in the base strings of noun phrases (Chomsky, 1965). It is suggested, for example, that the pronoun, ella 'she', has an underlying pro-noun which combines the features of feminine gender, singular number, and humanness. The processes of pronominalization involve the deletion or retention of these underlying nominal feature complexes. The form, ella 'she', represents the retention of the feature complex indicated above, while the string, el bueno 'the good one', is the result of the deletion of a feature complex combining the specifications masculine gender and singular number.

It is a weekly half-hour television program transmitted from stations in San Juan and Mayaguez and received throughout Puerto Rico  and the islands of Vieques and St. Thomas. In remote places, it is probably the only opportunity the children have to hear native English speakers.

The linguistic variable, itself an abstraction, is realized in actual speech behavior by variants. The formulation of the linguistic variable may be viewed as a function of its correlation with extra-linguistic variables (socio-economic class, sex, age, contextual style, and racial isolation) or independent linguistic variables (linear environment and syntactic construction). The author tries to show that in order to account for systematic variation between the variants of a variable a consideration of extra-linguistic and independent constraints is imperative. Only a  consideration of these two facets will reveal the fully systematic nature of variation and the various constraints on the relative stigmatization of certain variants. (DO)",

Furthermore, some current views of Black English have challenged basic linguistic and sociolinguistic premises about the nature of language. It is therefore the purpose of this paper to examine some very basic premises about the nature of language which have a direct bearing on current viewpoints toward Black English: (1) Languages are notoriously \"nonlogical;\" it is therefore a deceptive practice to teach the so-called \"logic\" of languages and to vindicate statements about the rules of a language by philosophical dictums about the logical nature of languages. Yet one of the common grounds for rejecting Black  English by educators is that it is illogical. (2) A second premise of the linguist is that all language systems are adequate for communication. Yet, one need not read very far in the literature on the speech of the disadvantaged to find them characterized as non-verbal, verbally destitute, or at best drastically deficient in their speech. (3) A basic linguistic axiom is that language is systematic and ordered, but some treat Black English as an unsystematic and irregular deviation from standard English. (4) Language is learned in the context of the community, but Black children are judged by a norm to which they have not been exposed--SE. (Author/DO)",

Precedence should be given to (1) the most socially diagnostic variables, (2) the most general rules, (3) grammatical variables over phonological variables, (4) speech patterns of general social significance over those of only regional significance, and (5) the most frequently occurring items. When determining the order of lessons,  each BE feature must be considered in terms of the total configuration of sociolinguistic principles. The author views the determination of order in terms of a sociolinguistic matrix, which he presents. (DO)",

The four principal topics of their discussions were: (1) the ethnography of asking questions, (2) the meaning of words--particularly as influenced by social and linguistic contexts, (3) the use of linguistic and social data from research on the preceding two topics in developing theories and methods in the several disciplines, and (4) the need to correct some shortcomings of current research. It was felt that \"we simply do not know how to phrase questions that will be meaningful to random samples of diversified populations.\" The  participants agreed that almost all contemporary social science research would be improved by much more careful attention to ethnographies of interrogation, and that analyses and interpretations based on current research are often highly problematic.

        "description":"During the summer of 1968 a special summer program in sociolinguistics (\"Language, Society, and the Child\") was held at the University of California, Berkeley. This program grew out of the research on \"children's language acquisition in a variety of cultures\" which has been underway at that institution for four years. Originally it was planned to restrict the program to 32 pre- and post-doctoral students with backgrounds in linguistics and the social sciences. Among these were seven who had recently returned from making field studies, guided by the \"Field Manual for Cross-Cultural Study of the Acquisition of Communicative Competence\" (ED 015 434). The participants attended four workshops, each restricted to eight participants: one on child grammar, two on sociolinguistics, and  one on child phonology. They also took courses in the regular University summer program. It was found, upon opening the workshops to auditors, that the extra participants were one of the factors working against successful analysis of the field data. Some of the important topics which were discussed were the structure of early grammatical constructions, the rules for social uses of language in children's cultures, and the effects of the milieu of the child on the rate and type of language development. The effectiveness of these workshops as training devices is also evaluated in this article. (JD)",

The first article, &quot;Breaking Down Your Writing Goals,&quot; by Gerald Dykstra, discusses attainable &quot;sub-goals.&quot; The first step, or sub-goal, on the way to developing written skill in English is the corollary of simple repetition in oral work--the copying of one entire title  and paragraph without error. Following steps include substitutions, transformations, reductions, expansions, completions, additions, revisions, commentary, and creations. &quot;The Teacher's Bookshelf,&quot; by Carol J. Kreidler, describes especially selected materials for the teacher's reference and for the classroom, as well as several new and forthcoming texts. Ruth E.

        "description":"Basic to composition skill is control of sentence structure and accuracy in mechanics. Although it is often said that a student should not write what he has not first heard and practiced orally, it might equally well be said that he should not be expected to write grammatical patterns that he has not read, inasmuch as there is a difference in the structures used in speech and writing. One approach to developing control over patterns in writing is through transformational grammar, because it provides (1) a systematic method of constructing sentences; (2) a device for identifying faulty constructions; and (3) an understanding of how structures which seem similar on the surface may be quite different structures with quite different meanings (\"Grading papers/crying babies can be a  nuisance\"). Studies conducted in the combining of simple statements into more complex sentences show that the more mature and skillful the writer, the more he uses transforms, particularly nominal-producing transforms. The author suggests having students first express their ideas in short simple sentences to develop a feeling for the essential elements of a sentence. They may then move on to combining by coordination or subordination with an adverb clause, passive forms, relative and noun clauses, and verbals. An exercise in combining sentence patterns concludes the paper. (AMM)",

We must, the author urges, internalize the fact that a divergent dialect represents a system of its own and is not simply an accumulation of mistakes. We should capitalize on the overlap of standard and divergent dialects and not be stampeded by the differences. (These are not so profound that they should encourage teachers to form a foreign language frame of reference--the student feels alien enough as it is.) In applying English as a second language techniques to SESD (Speakers of English as a Second Dialect), over-structuring is a constant danger. We should keep in mind that \"standard  English,\" like \"general American,\" is an abstraction of limited value. (A group of Michigan teachers might have an attitude toward the \"pin/pen\" problem that is different from the attitude of teachers in Florida.) Attempts to deal with target forms should not be isolated from the learner's communication needs in other parts of the curriculum. The teacher should take an honest look at (1) his students and their linguistic \"status\"; (2) his own objectives; (3) the distribution of his and the student's time; (4) the basic types of course activities; and (5) his planning.

The fault is not with the testing, but with the instructional program. Reforms in testing must be accomplished as part of a revolution in the total instructional program encompassing: (1) a shift from a fact-laden to an idea-centered curriculum in all subject areas for all students, (2) an emphasis on the \"process goals of education\", (3) mastery of the subject matter by all students, and (4) individualized instruction tailored to the needs and capabilities of each student. Needed changes in testing include developing instruments able to measure learning outcomes of new curriculum stressing theory and method of inquiry. Different types  of subtests measuring the specific learning outcomes of units can be used to individualize instruction. Developments in diagnostic testing are needed to provide the teacher with test approaches and tools for measuring student characteristics as learners in relation to different learning tasks. Finally, a computer based information system is needed to make information accessible on each student. Tests concentrating on specific, objective material and limited to paper and pencil assessment are to be avoided. (CG)",

Results show that freshmen appear  quite knowledgeable regarding certain elements, but highly deficient on others. Students are clearly confused where popular misconceptions are found.

The Scholastic Aptitude Test measured the academic ability of the American students, and high school grade point average with that of the Swedes. The findings show evidence of a positive relationship between inner desire to achieve and serum uric acid level, and between external environmental pressures and cholesterol level. Among students in a highly competitive American college, a significant correlation was found to exist  between students' serum uric acid levels and their grade point averages. This finding was not observed in Sweden where admission is more selective and academic pressures are less.

Perceivers consisted of 160 undergraduates. Expressors were 20 actors. Each perceiver matched photographs of expressors with one of the seven emotions. Results indicated significant main effects: (1) for the race of expressor, (whites were more accurately perceived than blacks); (2) for sex of  expressor, (females were superior to males); (3) for race of perceiver, (blacks were superior to whites); and (4) nonsignificance for sex of the perceiver. Race differences in POE suggests that there may be differing cultural sensitivities to emotional nuances: i.e., black man's subservience may make him more \"sensitive to the communicative symbols of action.\" (Dickey and Knower, 1941).

Release of any of this information to prospective employers often means maximum discretion on the part of social work educators and minimum protection for the student. Three recommendations are made: (1)  procedures be established to limit obtaining and releasing information about students, (2) students should be involved in determining these procedures, and (3) a principle of selection should be used in obtaining and releasing information about beginning and graduated social work students.

Living in crowded quarters, poorly nourished, and given little preparation for the outside world, these children seem destined to fail. Their semiliterate mothers and fathers, if they have one, struggle to support a large family on welfare payments or on wages from irregular employment. When the stationary poor child begins school, he is ill-equipped intellectually, socially and emotionally to meet the demands of the middle class culture. His vocabulary is limited, he finds the classroom restrictive and feels inferior because of his social class. Neither his parents nor the school can provide him with the social and  intellectual skills which he lacks. His feeling of distrust for authority generalizes to teachers, and truancy and delinquency often result. At the age of 16, he drops out of school, finds it difficult to get employment, and perpetuates the circle of poverty. (Author/LS)",

Data was obtained from three experimental and three control groups. Conclusions indicate that: (1) providing good information does not assure its effective use by counselors and staff, (2) the approach, utilized by this system, to information dissemination is well liked by students, and (3) parents play a major role in students' educational and career planning.

Findings show that the decision to drop out is based on a complex network of reasons with the problem of poor attendance most often cited as the major cause. While the dropouts were counseled by school personnel and other professionals, only a small number benefited from an individual curriculum adjustment which the author feels is the most valuable preventive measure available for combating early school termination. A comparison of the two groups may be interpreted as follows: (1) higher attendance may have some effect on eventual graduation, (2) failing contributes  decisively to the decision to drop out, (3) \"satisfactory\" academic performance more consistently characterizes the lowest quintile graduates, and (4) character trait ratings for the graduates most often increase over the period of school years while those for the dropout do not. The author suggests that prevention of dropouts rests heavily on: (1) coping with character trait problems, (2) curriculum adjustment to individual needs, (3) educational objectives which are both challenging and attainable, and (4) evaluation techniques in terms of individual ability and effort.

The focus would be on social behavior and institutional analysis. The latter, designed to prepare the student to perform in the field, would include both survey and specialized courses on community organization, social planning, field work and seminars.  The Council found the traditional two or three days in the field unrealistic. The flow of work in community organization is irregular, so it was recommended that the field assignment be programmed in relation to the tasks to be undertaken.

However, since the twenties, these standards have been changing in the direction of sanctioning premarital relations when mutual love and affection exist. These more liberal standards have become dominant in the attitudes of college students. Unfortunately, they have been misinterpreted as evidence of a continuing increase in the frequency of premarital relations. The data presented indicate that the incidence rate leveled off after 1930. What has occurred is that standards are \"catching up\" with  behavior. Counselors, educators and administrators must be cognizant of this changing culture.

Such environments would include the following features: (1) provisions for diverse stimuli for students, (2) discouragement of traditional responses, (3) encouragement of new kinds of responses, (4) encouragement of active and analytical participation of students in  the environment, (5) increases in the anxiety threshold when low levels threaten to paralyze adaptive behaviors, (6) acceptance of normal student \"identity crises\", (7) opportunities for students to test their new selves and knowledge, (8) appropriate feedback to students as they change, and (9) sympathetic resources for students when necessary.

Developmental guidance, concerned with personalizing the educational experience, should be available to each child to gain self-understanding. Major responsibilities of the elementary guidance department are pupil appraisal, consultation, and developmental counseling. The administrator- his interests, his values, and his support- is crucial to the success of the program. Opening new vistas to children through career exploration is the subject of the second speech. Nine reasons are given which deal with the child's perception of himself, the world of work, and the future. Nine points are then made pertaining to how this exploration should be conducted. It should be active, relevant, exploratory, and  non-graded. Career exploration should use available role models, starting with parents and moving outward to the larger society, with a minimum of amassing and digesting occupational information. (KP)",

A study, conducted at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, investigated this relationship, using as subjects 1,424 ninth grade students. The subjects self perceptions were inferred from ratings on each of the eight factors of the Perceived-Self Scale. Results indicated a significant relationship between patterns of achievement and perceived self. The finding that a positive feeling of acceptance by teachers and peers was more commonly associated with overachievement than with underachievement, demonstrates the importance of teachers'  attitudes toward students in shaping their role in self concepts. Therefore, teachers should consider self concept as an important aspect of learning and development which the school, through its educational process, should seek to promote and foster in every child.

This hypothesis may be operationalized in two ways: (1) when workers are employed at one job, the ability requirements of the job become a constant across all subjects; consequently, ability level can be used as a predictor of satisfactoriness; and (2) when workers are employed at different jobs, measures of correspondence between each worker's abilities and the ability requirements of his job are used. Two studies, conducted to test both forms of the hypothesis, and using blue-collar and white-collar workers as  subjects, measured the variables of satisfaction, satisfactoriness and ability. Results indicated support of both forms of the hypothesis. This has implications for further selection and placement research, as well as for increased understanding and improved managing of the behavior of individuals at work. (LS)",

The 171 selected students were enrolled in a supervised study course one hour of the school day which provided special group and individual counseling. A matched control group remained in the regular curriculum with the usual counseling services available to them. Attendance, grade point average, attitude, school offenses, and court referrals were the variables used to evaluate the project. Statistical analysis showed only a small difference in the number of  school offenses for the experimental and control groups. This lack of objective findings in support of the project may have been due to an unequal matching of groups and the use of variables not sensitive enough to measure change occuring. The staff of the project agreed on the effectiveness of agency coordination. (NS)",

Results showed that hypotheses one and three were fully supported, while hypothesis two received partial support. However, the ego variables appeared to influence academic achievement largely, but not completely, through their association  with intelligence. The racial differences on the ego variables were interpreted as contributing to a vicious cycle, with the Negro child's intellectual and psychological handicaps interacting with each other to increase the amount of deficit.

Findings of the study, based on data for 1950 and 1960 from the 19 Latin American and 49 non-Western nations autonomous before 1960, generally supported two basic hypotheses: (1) The sequence of acquisition of structural elements in Latin American educational systems has tended to follow the item ranking of a Guttman scale of structural differentiation for that area, and (2) better than 50% accurate prediction of  the structural elements an educational system will next acquire is possible when the system's differentiation level is known. Both alone and in conjunction with enrollment ratios, communicability, and urbanization, structural differentiation was found to be a key variable in educational system adaptiveness. Development of the scalogram is explained, supporting correlational data are tabulated, and bibliographies of source material are appended. (JK)",

The educational leader is responsible for balancing the two forces of politics and change, which pull at the school's resources in opposite directions. He must develop political insight and judgment because of the rising costs of education and growing confrontations with parent dissatisfaction, teacher organizations, and student unrest. Other major social forces and developments modifying the traditional school-community relationship include: (1) The Federal Government's increasingly active role in public education, (2) continuing poverty in the midst of an affluent society, and (3) cybernation, with its  resultant decreased dependency on human labor. Recent attempts by educational leaders to resolve problems of decentralization and racial integration illustrate the educational administrator's intrinsically political response to the influence of special interest groups and the changing relationship between the school and the community.

One of the pilot schools was graded conventionally; the other was nongraded. Problems included training procedures, motivation of staff, communication, administrative cooperation, and teacher participation. Five criteria were established for selecting schools for participation in IPI: (1) Administrative commitment, (2) teacher commitment, (3) participation in research, (4) retraining of administrators and teachers, and (5) uniqueness of situation.

Collective negotiations will probably improve the quality of education to the extent that quality (higher salaries, smaller classes, better working conditions, etc.) coincides with the self-interest of teachers. The power accorded to teachers by collective negotiations can be crucial in professionalizing public school teaching, but if used selfishly it can encourage mediocrity, be detrimental to educational quality, and defeat the purpose for which the status of professionalism is awarded. Local school boards are anachronistic in many respects. Collective negotiations may focus attention upon their deficiencies and thereby bring about a more  rational organization of local government along broader functional lines rather than wholly political lines. The logic of broadening the unit base for collective negotiations does not seem to square with developments in New York City's decentralization controversy. However, the problem in New York is one of identifying who the employer is. A possible solution is overlapping bargaining, with city-wide issues negotiated at the city level and local issues negotiated at the local board level in a manner similar to private industry. (TT)",

Recent court decisions and civil rights legislation leave no doubt that the present minimal desegregation efforts of Louisiana's schools are inadequate and must be greatly improved in the immediate future. This legal impetus for rapid desegregation is buttressed by research findings which indicate a comparatively low degree of educational attainment among both white and Negro citizens of Louisiana. School officials need to carefully evaluate the probable effectiveness of all methods available for achievement of desegregation (bussing, educational parks,  school pairing, etc.). If the overall quality of Louisiana's schools is to improve, additional improvements must be sought in such areas as teacher preparation, recruitment, and evaluation; instructional programs; organization for instruction; and school facilities.

Of these, 285 were assigned to experimental classes taking the curriculum under development and 203 were assigned to comparison classes providing the regular mathematics curriculum. The students were average in intelligence, but were at least 1 year behind in mathematics achievement. The main testing instrument was the Diagnostic Test with which the students were both pre- and posttested. Relevancy ratings were collected to check on the fairness or appropriateness of the test items. The results showed that (1) teachers selected instructional objectives that reflected  skills already available to their students, and (2) experimental teachers tended to gear instruction to skills already achieved by students at entry into the program. Two implications are drawn: (1) With regard to instructional practice, teachers need to be informed about the entry skills of their students as related to the objectives of a course of instruction; and (2) data on entry skills could have been most useful to teachers developing the program had they been made available early in the research.

The Netherlands was chosen as a research site because the consequences of educational selection were anticipated as being particularly pronounced where streaming is a well established practice. To demonstrate the importance of analyzing schools as mechanisms of social selection, questionnaires were administered to all the fourth-year boy students (1,239) attending a selected sample of 44 secondary schools and representing all socioeconomic levels. Results of the study indicated that streaming tends to maintain  the present system of social stratification in two ways. First, it functions as a &quot;cooling-out&quot; mechanism by bringing aspirations in line with expectations, and, second, it reduces objective distribution of talent by creating a social distance between certain classes and certain types of schools. Streaming was also found to contribute to the maintenance of patterns of deference to the opinions of an educated elite.

In 1967-68, an evaluation of this ungraded program was made to determine if the reading and arithmetic performance levels of the students at Powel were higher than those of a matched graded school. An evaluation of pertinent school summaries and testing program results was conducted to identify a graded elementary school which would closely match the student population at Powel. Powel and the control school were matched on teacher-pupil ratio; EIP status; academic performance in school years 2, 4, and 6; and socioeconomic status. The results showed that the ungraded organization produced greater total school achievement. Within-year  comparisons revealed that at year 6, students in the ungraded program achieved more than their counterparts in the graded school, while at year 4 the above average students in the ungraded program achieved less than the average students in the graded school. An ungraded program, therefore, might not be advantageous at all elementary school levels, but does appear to be suitable for students in the upper elementary years with above average abilities.

Two scales to measure the dependent variable, rate of adoption of educational innovations, were developed--one to measure district adoption and the other to measure individual teacher adoption. Other independent variables included cosmopoliteness (the use of outside sources for new educational ideas); opinion leadership on innovation; communication patterns; role responsibilities; and certain organizational variables such as expenditure, size, assessed valuation per ADA, and pupil-teacher ratio. The investigation sought to determine (1) which variables  were related to innovation, (2) the number of levels at which a variable was significant, (3) the constellation of variables significant at each level, and (4) how strongly related to innovation were these groups of variables. The major result was that three variables--board conception of community attitude toward innovation, conflict over responsibility for determining educational policy, and expenditure--explain 77 percent of the variation in the rate of district adoption of innovation.

The sociometric device provided for subjective and perceptive selections on the dimensions of \"liking,\"\"school competence,\" and \"social power.\" The study found that greater diffusion of sociometric choices and perception of choices made by others were associated with membership in nongraded and conventionally graded classrooms than in pupil team-learning graded and pupil team-learning nongraded classrooms. This result was attributed mainly to instruction  occurring at the team level with the teacher providing instruction to individual pairs. Based on an analysis of data from the classes in social studies, English, and mathematics, it was concluded that subject studied as well as class size had no appreciable effect on the sociometric choices of students.

The program is called &quot;Educational Systems for the Seventies&quot; (ES '70). The 18 participating schools represent a cross-section of the nation's schools. The planning effort for the project has identified four broad classes of activities to be carried out: (1) Staff development, (2) instructional management and career guidance, (3) school management, and (4) evaluation. The activity having the highest priority is the setting of educational goals and operationally defining the performance objectives. Each graduate will have received a  comprehensive education including the requisite background for college entry and salable job skills. This will be accomplished by individualized instruction. The project also provides for the development of models for curriculum development. The use of computers will be necessary in the management of the learning function and for data processing purposes.

The primary method of analysis chosen was an actuarial approach which involves construction of a survival curve showing numbers of teachers surviving after each period of time and the rapidity with which the initial group of teachers leave their districts. Results show that nearly seven out of 10 teachers hired by Oregon school districts will no longer be serving as classroom teachers in the same districts 5 years later. The shortest survival expectancies were found among females between the ages of 20 and 24, next shortest amount females between 25 and 29, and males between 20 and 24 were the third poorest  risks. Over 40 percent of all newly appointed teachers were in these groups. On the other hand, ladies in the 40 to 54 age group had the best survival records, but barely 10 percent of newly employed teachers fell into this category. Administrators seem to employ just those teachers that have the poorest experience of surviving. Differences in survival rates for male teachers were observed among districts, with more populated districts having the best records and the remote, less populated ones the poorest. (TT)",

Fault tree analysis is an operations research tool which is designed to increase the probability of success in any system by analyzing the most likely modes of failure that could occur. A graphic portrayal, which has the form of a tree, is constructed by a series of logical steps, showing at each stage precisely how a given failure can occur. Mathematical formulas based on the probability of occurrence of individual events are applied to determine the critical path leading to the top undesired event. Among the many advantages of this technique is its usefulness as a device for evaluation of processes as opposed to the more common evaluation of products. The document includes a  history of fault tree analysis, principles of fault tree construction, a prototype fault tree with analysis, and evaluation of fault tree analysis as an educational research and planning technique. Although many technical problems are yet to be solved, fault tree analysis holds much promise for application to education.

In expressing the resource interchange, economists rely on the language of productivity. Of concern is the global contribution of educational systems to national economic efficiency. This type of analysis is relevant to such decisions as whether more or less money should be spent for education and how money should be allocated within educational systems. Model building is essential to systems analysis, and the models used for this type of study are cost-benefit models. Economic systems analysis is now being directed to an examination of the internal  efficiency of education, which involves analysis of the way in which education is produced. This focus requires schools to be thought of as productive systems with interrelationships among people, units of space, and equipment determining the efficiency of the process. An administrator's production function is developed and input-output studies, based on large-scale cross-sectional statistical analysis, are used to provide empirical guidelines for the improvement of allocation within educational units.

Descriptive simulations provide models of human systems that explain their behavior and can be used to test theories by comparing real past behavior with simulated behavior. Intellective simulations capture organizational qualities deemed important by the analyst and are suited to discovering the effects of proposed changes. Normative  simulations are designed for analyzing such organizational problems as communications difficulties, social interaction patterns, hierarchical structures, and the implications of various strains and stresses.

In most States, State legislatures and local boards of education have not contributed their fair share toward support of the program.

School officials seeking to operate their school system in a lawful, peaceful, and productive manner should be aware that as agents of the State they are subject to constitutional restraints on their authority. Such an awareness should limit the potential for turmoil stemming from decisions affecting the civil liberties of students. (JH)",

The present financial system, based on State equalization of local property tax valuation, is inequitable since it results in many school districts, particularly those in large cities, having inadequate resources to meet extraordinary needs. The Detroit experience dramatizes this nationwide dilemma: In less than a 10-year period the State equalized valuation has decreased by a billion dollars while the pupil population, containing a large proportion of the State's disadvantaged children, has increased. In response to the seemingly impossible task of providing equal education to an increasing enrollment with decreasing resources, the Detroit Board of Education has  filed suit against the State of Michigan, charging that the State has failed to provide equal educational opportunities in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A court's finding in favor of the school district's claim, or a favorable decision for the plaintiff in similar cases currently being contested elsewhere, could lead to the transfer of public school finance from local to State authority for more equitable allocations.

The knowledge explosion in the past 70 years dictates this focus. There are four basic ways of rescheduling the school year: (1) The staggered quarter plan and its many variations, in which the schools operate year-round with vacations spread throughout the year; (2) the extended school year (204-212 days), with economies arising from student acceleration; (3) the summer school programs for remedial, makeup, or enrichment work; and (4) the Multiple Trails Design. The Multiple Trails Design is the most flexible of the plans since it does not rely on term rotation or acceleration  to achieve desired goals and it allows educators to be innovative. It allows for individualized programs, acceleration, and enrichment, and gives teachers time for individual development. Computers programed with many rescheduled school years will soon be ready to provide individual school districts with programs which will best fit their needs and conditions. Vacations are becoming year-round phenomena and should not hinder year-round schools as they did in the past. (HW)",

The prime impetus for this experiment in community involvement in decentralized school administration stemmed from a coalition of parents residing in the community and teachers belonging to the United Federation of Teachers. Representatives of this coalition were members of the district's initial planning council, and later comprised the majority of the members of the district's Governing Board. This experiment immediately faced large obstacles and consequent frustrations stemming from at least three sources: (1) Intercoalition dissension, heightened by the  city-wide teachers strike of 1967, (2) the city Board of Education's refusal to allocate authority to the local Governing Board, and (3) widespread dissension and insecurity throughout the total staff of the school district. These factors, coupled with other disruptions, accented the position of those members of the Governing Board who felt the need to &quot;force a confrontation.&quot; (JH)",

This conflict developed over the Local Governing Board's desire to clearly establish its authority to hire and fire employees of the district, and the United Federation of Teachers' contention that their contract with the New York City Board of Education prohibited arbitrary action of this nature by the Local Governing Board. On May 7, 1968, the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Local Governing Board terminated the services of 19 staff members without causal evidence or formal hearings. This action brought about a teachers strike within the district which was still in effect as the  school year ended. Attempts at mediation of the dispute were made throughout the summer, but were unsuccessful. The polarization of positions became particularly evident when a court decision denying the Local Governing Board the power to dismiss any of the teachers was not accepted by that board, and when the UFT disregarded the Taylor Law and elected to begin a city-wide strike of the school system on September 9, 1968.

The findings indicate that various factors were related to the emergence of eminent men, including population growth and concentration, change in the nature of the economy, and a general increase in prosperity. Although educational reform and innovation at the elementary level and extension of university education were also found to be significantly associated with eminence,  degrees of eminence and level of educational achievement were not related. In general, those areas which diverted a portion of their resources to educational reform produced a significant proportion of the eminent Scots in the 18th century. (Author/JH)",

(2) representative rule administration would develop little tension but considerable positive sentiment, and (3) punishment centered rule administration would result in high tension and hostility. Observational data, gathered from two groups of NYC schools exhibiting two distinct leadership styles, was supportive of these hypotheses. Results of a questionnaire distributed to a random sample of  teachers and principals in the Urban District, indicate that principals perceive the union contract as restricting their exercise of leadership t a much greater degree than do the teachers. This research, and recommendations stemming from it, should allow a principal to determine the type of rule administration that will result in the most efficient and desirable relationship between himself and the teacher.

Major findings were as follow: approximately 85% of both groups were gainfully employed, the group without off campus work experience was achieving as well as the group who had received off campus work placement and supervision, and the unemployed in both groups tended to be those who were multiply handicapped or tested near the bottom of the IQ range of the group.

Subjects having little experience with the retarded rated them less favorably on all 21 semantic scales (p.01) while subjects with retarded siblings or relatives tended to be more favorable and knowledgeable. Students had a general image of the retarded based on characteristics of the severely and moderately handicapped; the retarded ranked sixth in preference among 10 client groups. Client preference changes occurred more often in high  exposure schools but rank ordering of client groups remained basically unchanged. Students in field instruction placements serving the retarded were superior in knowledge (p=.05) and showed greater attitude changes and greater extremes in client preference (predominantly in a positive direction). Conclusions were that the introduction of content on mental retardation in social work curriculum does not materially affect knowledge and attitudes. (RJ)",

Findings were that the visually impaired represented an older segment of the population and that the marked increase in estimated trends resulted not from severe but rather from other impairments. Of an estimated 5,029,000 persons with impairments (prevalence rate=31.3 per 1,000 population), 969,000 could not read ordinary newsprint and 310,000 could not see features and/or moving objects. Analysis of demographic characteristics indicated that the number of persons reporting vision impairment was greater for those having lower incomes or less education, living in the South, belonging to the nonwhite population, or not living in standard metropolitan areas.  Approximately three of five persons with impaired vision reported limitation of activities, but less than one-half attributed this limitation to their vision. Limitations are further classified according to age and sex; employment, living arrangements, and use of aids, talking books, braille, and financial aid are considered; and functional limitations, age at which impaired vision first interfered with daily activities, and the relationship between vision impairment and other selected chronic conditions are treated.

Psychometric and psychological data obtained indicated that the subjects were above average in IQ (mean 115), emotionally stable, and relatively free from anxiety. Data on locomotion revealed the following: 91% of the subjects veered consistently in the same direction when asked to walk a straight line; and the subjects who walked faster tended to veer less and those who were more accurate in walking in a straight line and in performing 90 degree facing movements were better at position relocation in a field. The threshold to the perception of left-right tilt in pathways walked was slightly under 2 degrees; subjects were more sensitive to walking a  downhill gradient than an uphill gradient. On facing movements, the blind and the blind-folded sighted overturned 90 degree turns and underturned 180 and 360 degree turns. Practice modified the veering tendency significantly after 200 feet; the directions a subject habitually veered trying to draw a straight line and to walk a straight line on a field were related (p=.10). Results not reaching statistical significance are also reported. (Author/JD)",

Parents were invited to attend weekly meetings which were reduced to   hour in length during the course of the project. Parents could bring other siblings, family members, and materials from their own home. A single tutor worked with each family in separate rooms in language building activities. Fifty-two families who visited the demonstration home for 10 weekly visits were compared with 25 families who were enrolled in the John Tracy Clinic traditional service program. Language development in the children was assessed with the Boone Scale and changes in the parents' information and attitudes were  assessed by scales previously developed at the Clinic. The language scales were too unreliable to be satisfactory, but all showed substantial gains for the demonstration home children. The parent information scores showed that the demonstration home parents did slightly better than the control group of parents. There was no change in the parent attitude scales. Experience with the program was judged so satisfactory by the staff of John Tracy Clinic that the program is being continued as a Clinic function after the expiration of federal grant and has been extended to two similar branch programs.

During the first study, listening and discrimination rates were obtained, whereas during the second study the discrimination of gradually increasing and decreasing response rate requirements was investigated. The purpose of the third study was to establish subject preference for certain types of music, while the objective of the  fourth was to determine individual preference for a male or female reader. The fifth investigation sought to determine the relationship of sequential and simultaneous choice. (Author/JD)",

Charts give the progress of 153 TMR pupils in the physical fitness programs conducted in three schools while case histories indicate improvement of six children in a prekindergarten enrichment program. The progress of a video tape teaching project is mentioned and two examples of pilot filmstrips developed are given. Reports and case histories submitted by speech teachers who conducted oral communication programs for 105 multiply handicapped TMR children in five day schools are presented. Reported by charts and pupil progress reports are results from a 6-week summer school training program offered by training centers to 542 TMR  children; twelve independent studies resulting from the summer program are included. An account is given of an inservice teacher institute on new trends in TMR curriculum development which involved 150 teachers and supervisors. Finally, case histories and teacher reports from two schools which have home school coordinators provide an evaluation of the services obtained to solve children's school and family problems. (SN)",

The content score varied with the severity of the speech problem; the accuracy of rating nasality did not vary. C- and non C-mothers did not differ in accuracy of rating  intelligibility and estimating the percentage of words in error, when both were under manner instructions; but C-mothers under manner instructions were more accurate on both intelligibility measures, than such mothers instructed to listen to content.

Of these, 12 children in a unisensory program (U-) and 16 in a multisensory program (M-) were evaluated for speech and language development after they had reached their fifth birthdays. Children in the experimental U-group were first tested for hearing and fitted with an aid, then were given auditory training at home and in group therapy sessions. At age 3, they were evaluated for placement in an enriched nursery school program, which also trained them primarily through the auditory sense. Guidance and psychological counseling were provided for the parents. Results indicated that the U-group was markedly superior on all measures of speech and language acquisition,  although less so on the Templin-Darley articulation test. On all other measures (mean length of responses, mean of five longest responses, number of one-word responses, number of different words, and structural complexity score), results for the U-group appeared to indicate the advisability of unisensory management. Findings suggested that U-management may be of most benefit to children whose residual hearing extends into the high frequencies and whose hearing losses are relatively flat. (JD)",

A nine-family study was then done comparing three 12-week treatments (minimum contact 1, nonoperant 1, and operant 1) in terms of therapeutic process and outcome. A second 12-week treatment period 3 weeks after the first was designed, in part, to offer operant 2 to the six families who had not received operant in treatment period 1. Three measurement periods occurred: one before treatment 1, one after treatment 1, and another after treatment 2. Process data were collected during all treatment periods; and outcome data, based on objective ratings of videotapes of  parent-child interactions and parents' psychological test performances were collected during all measurement periods. Children in all groups improved in general behavior categories and in specific-to-each-family categories. Operant groups seemed better but there were not enough cases for statistical significance. The psychological tests of the six operant-only parent pairs improved more than did the three nonoperant-then-operant parent pairs.

For the remaining 8 weeks, the students, five in physical and five in recreational therapy, were assigned to an area where no extensive programing of this kind was previously administered. Two cottages consisting of 126 female profoundly retarded residents received an intensive systematic stimulation and training program with supervision by professional representatives. Results indicated that the residents showed  improvement in self care abilities, motor behavior and more mature social responsiveness. Evaluation of the students, involving an informational test on mental retardation and a 500-word essay offering a critique and subjective report of the work experience's effect on the students' career intentions, indicated involvement on the part of the students, a sense of professional identification, and acquisition of appropriate skills and attitudes.

        "description":"To investigate procedures whereby schools may achieve maximal results with otherwise normal underachieving pupils with neurologically based language-learning disorders, 100 such subjects were studied over a 2-year period. Fifty experimental subjects remained in regular classes in school and received individualized teaching outside of school hours from specially trained clinicians. Fifty matched control subjects were enrolled in special education classes and did not receive clinical teaching after school. Half of the experimental and half of the control subjects had anticonvulsive medication prescribed by their physicians; the others did not. Tests of academic achievement and mental functioning indicated that the experimental groups made significantly greater gains in both  variables than did the control. However, the medicated groups did not make greater gains than the unmedicated. (Author)",

Speech testing of 6,290 subjects indicated about 85% had articulation which did not deviate from the Adult General American standard while less than 1% deviated extremely. A total of 5% manifested some voice deviation; 0.3% were judged stutterers; and 0.3% deviated extremely in overall speech performance. Threshold hearing data on 6,157 subjects revealed that subject reliability was generally excellent, but increased with grade level. Males showed a higher degree of reliability than females. Superior hearing sensitivity was  exhibited by 91.8% of the sample, with females performing better than males in all but grade 2. Only eight of the children deviating from the superior hearing criterion were found to have bilateral impairments (.001% of the sample). The remaining 499 children had unilateral impairments which were about equally divided between the two ears, predominant in males, and well distributed among the grades. Further analysis of the data and modifications in the programing were planned to verify trends, define speech disorder, and describe hearing patterns. (Author/JD)",

A battery of tests measured auditory-visual integrative ability, visual motor ability, and perception of frequency distorted speech. Significant differences were found between the two groups in their visual-auditory integrative ability and the perception of frequency distorted speech. There was no difference between the two groups in visual motor integrative ability. Inasmuch as the two groups were significantly different for the auditory perceptual task it was difficult to determine whether the differences which exist between the two groups in the area of auditory-visual integrative skills were due to poor  integration between these two modalities or due merely to the auditory component.

There is a lack of uniformity and standardization in audiovisual equipment that amounts to chaos. There is no evaluative literature on such equipment and no better place to turn than to the &quot;Audio-Visual Equipment Directory&quot; which, essential though it is to this purpose, has many shortcomings. No machine listed in it, or discovered by an other survey, meets the requirements of MIP for individual programed instruction audiovisual (color slides and records) presentation. Factors that count in the selection of an audiovisual machine include the human factor, reliability,  safety, technical requirements, cost, manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance considerations. The lack of standards raises problems of conversion which, allied with resulting manufacturing difficulties, makes costs prohibitive. Servicing and maintenance constitute a chronic problem which may be solved by the adoption of removable modules. Modules may also solve the problem of adapting a machine to different uses. Commercial machines and the test machine are illustrated and described. (GO)",

There are many problems in preparing these programs, most of them involved with the fact that the medical consultant and the educational production group must work interdependently. The medical consultant must transmit hard-won and complex knowledge rapidly to the programing staff who will then transmute it into programs. The relationship between the two is crucial to the project, and this report details a recommended order of the tactics which specify the relationship. This includes initial contact by the administration with the medical consultant, the initial work by him, initial writing conference with him, writing by  a programer of the content outline and script, preparation by the medical consultant of the content essay, final script preparation by a programer or producer, and production of visuals by the producer. Then the skeleton program, consisting of slides, in-house tape, program book, and test, is validated, approved, put into physical production, and packaged. Programs are then mailed to sample. Attachments A, B, C, and D are comprised of forms, a medical essay, and a program script. (GO)",

This study offers a critical assessment of the reasons for the Board's success, with a view to formulating very general principles as to how a film board might be run successfully. The success of a film board is related to the formal structure of the board. National predisposition, though unmeasurable, is important. It is essential that the government be a social democracy, and that the commercial film industry not be too powerful.

Of possible simulation laboratories, a semi-manual computer-based laboratory might be the most effective, but its main contribution would be as a research vehicle; it would not bring about major changes. The methodology of this study consisted of seeking expert opinions, visits to innovative  installations, and a review of the multimedia state-of-the-art. No experiments were undertaken, nor was a prototype laboratory built or tested. Annual cost of a comprehensive, multimedia development laboratory is roughly estimated at $2,000,000.

The first of two conference presentations analyze the micromolar approach to education, with particular attention to the learning of response speed. The second presentation suggests  that although the conference objectives were practically oriented, theory development is needed for hypothesis production.

Diagnostic testing and careful analysis of test results were used to discover individual needs, for which relevant sections of a program were then prescribed. The role of the teacher in this situation was that of learning-manager. It was his job to test, score, interpret, and course-prescribe. He had to listen, observe, answer questions, and constantly evaluate the programs. Since more than usual counseling was needed, the learning-manager served in this role in association with a psychological consultant. Problems included scarcity of programs for basic and remedial education, score interpretation, instructor selection, student boredom, cheating, and  underestimation of number of instructors required. It was concluded that higher students' goals and motivation are achieved when instruction is geared to their preferences, in a pleasant atmosphere with respect for their dignity. It is believed that a similar undertaking will work in any educational setting.

Using empirical methods, this study was designed to test calculators with two groups of ninth grade students and one group of fifth grade students in three differing instructional settings. Experimental and control classes were designated for each group, and, in addition, one ninth grade group contained a class to control for the \"Hawthorne effect.\" An attempt was also made to control for differences in teacher performance. The findings were equivocal concerning the effect of calculators on the students' performance and on their self-confidence and attitude toward mathematics. Teacher enthusiasm for use of the calculators  bore no relation to the machines' effect on student performance. Rather, this enthusiasm appeared to be a function of the calculators' effect on student-teacher interaction and their potential as toys to provide classroom diversion. The lower the average IQ level of the group, the higher was teacher enthusiasm. At worst, the machines took up space and cramped daily operations. At best, they gave a feeling of increased productivity to students not previously capable of it, thereby easing classroom behavior problems. (GO/MT)",

The use of these packets (accompanied by study guides) during the following academic year, 1966-67, was followed by a second summer conference where interpretation of evaluation results was added to the basic procedures of the first conference. In the second academic year, 1967-68, the materials were used in more situations, enhancing the final assessment of evaluation results by the third summer conference. Objectives of the project to produce and evaluate audiovisual materials for all levels of music education were attained by an informal research procedure. It was  concluded that the use of non-book instructional materials is an effective means of improving music education, but the misuse of such materials will almost as certainly cause harm. The final conclusion was that a multimedia approach has its greatest value in allowing for variety of presentation modes.

The purpose was twofold: to determine if redundant information presented simultaneously through eye and ear results in more effective learning than if the information is presented through the ear alone, and to measure the relative effectiveness of varied types of visual illustrations used to facilitate student realization of varied educational objectives. The results of the tests indicated that visual aids are effective when learning objectives are similar to those measured by a drawing test, but that they are unnecessary and even  distracting when the learning objectives are similar to those measured by terminology, identification, comprehension, and total criterion tests. This may be because college students have already been selected for their verbal and conceptual ability. In televising presentations, therefore, for college level instruction, visual materials should be used only insofar as they are justified by learning objectives and achievement. (GO)",

Eight test groups were compared with a group that had only verbal symbols to learn from. These groups had, in addition to the verbal descriptions, the black and white of color versions of abstract line representations, drawings (detailed and shaded), heart model photographs, and realistic photographs. Five criterion measures were used to test the relative learning under the different conditions. The visually-aided programed material was not found to be significantly superior to the control group material consisting solely of verbal symbols. It was concluded that students do not know how to  learn from drawings and photographs, that a continuum of visual illustrations extending from line drawing to the object itself is not an effective predictor of learning, that color can aid some student achievement, and that, in general, students given the abstract line illustrations took longer to complete their instructional units.

Liaison between the students and the professor was provided by the  graduate assistant who transported the equipment. With proper maintenance the equipment proved to be completely reliable. Both on-campus and off-campus students achieved a satisfactory level, but the attitude of the latter, as measured by the course attitude questionnaire was somewhat above that of the campus control group.

Uznadze explains &quot;set&quot; by postulating a general tendency toward habitual action, but qualifies this by stating that the tendency is governed by special factors within the individual. The predisposition to respond in a certain way is determined by the experiences and character of the individual. The internal organization of the individual which organizes the experiences and creates the illusion of similarity between situations is, according to Uznadze, unitary; it cannot be categorized as motor or mental. Uznadze's experiments deal with illusions which are prepared by experience. The majority of subjects, after having  been asked to choose between spheres unequal in size a number of times, continued to perceive equal pairs as unequal. Uznadze also induced &quot;set&quot; in subjects under hypnosis, thus eliminating the influence of intent. The cognitive process is involved, however, through &quot;objectification.&quot; This process enables us to experience something as an object, and is closely linked with &quot;set.&quot; Their interaction keeps our subjective reality close to objective reality by a series of approximations.

After a discussion of the all-pervasive character of classical education, allusions, and ideas in the speech and writing of the American colonies, the speech ends with a statement of faith in the permanence of the great truths embodied in the ancient classics.

A review of such basic principles of the \"linguistic\" method as (1) primacy of sound, (2) intensiveness, (3) inductive grammar, (4) words in context, and (5) linguistic interference is followed by an evaluation of the intensive method that refers to the modifications made in the traditional foreign language context by the linguist. Programed instruction is defined, discussed, and evaluated in the concluding half of the article. Suggested for research is further experimentation  with more flexible (1) organizational frameworks, (2) use of the language laboratory as a teaching machine, and (3) student and teacher roles.

Linguistic development is charted through behaviorism and formal analysis to the combination of mimicry-memorization and pattern practice now in vogue. Cited as recent trends are programed instruction and transformational grammar. Also stressed is the role played by contemporary educational theory and national attitudes in language teaching styles.

Like all intruders, it will gain and retain ground slowly and with difficulty and will tend to lose ground quickly and easily. It will be difficult for a high school Russian program to continue to attract and hold the enrollment needed to justify its existence if it continues to be geared more or less exclusively to the high-ability student, and if its chief concern is to prepare students for the university Russian program. Instruction in the Russian language can be maintained successfully in the curriculum only with the tireless effort of the instructor as well as the profession to provide a program with compatibility and relevancy to contemporary teenage reality through the discovery of  efficient and economic procedures and the adoption of timely methods of instruction.

The traits included values, attitudes, and intellectual dispositions which may affect the educational process and in turn be modified by students' educational experiences. The Omnibus Personality Inventory, taken before the students entered college and again 4 years later, revealed that the students felt more socially acceptable as seniors than as freshmen, and that during the 4-year college period they tended to become more tolerant and less conventional and dependent. The  Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values was administered at the end of the freshman year and again 3 years later. For both sexes, there were significant increases over the 3-year period on the Theoretic and Aesthetic scales, and significant decreases on the Economic and Religious scales. Significant changes in opinions were revealed by questionnaire results between the end of the freshman and senior years. Analyses of the results on the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was administered at the end of the senior year, are in progress. (WM)",

        "description":"The fundamental character of US colleges and universities is being changed by a variety of forces and pressures which have created a period of confusion, uncertainty, and alarm for many educators and policy-makers in higher education. The traditional principles and modes of institutional leadership are being challenged by forces from within and without higher education institutions. These forces often conflict with each other in struggles for power which negate simple solutions, but at the same time they contribute to major shifts in the distribution of power, authority, and influence in higher education. The demands for change must be met by new strategies which stimulate more interest in the purposes and goals of higher education institutions in order to reduce uncertainty  about the institutions' contribution to society as they seek to maintain organizational flexibility to meet new and changing circumstances. The paper discusses; (1) the features of 3 major crises in higher education since World War II, (2) a theoretical framework designed to focus on the distribution of authority and influence in higher education, (3) conceptual issues concerning national and statewide scenes within the context of the theoretical framework, and (4) the consequences of changing centers of power and authority for institutional leadership, and a renewed identity for colleges and universities within an open, flexible system of authority.

Britain has lagged behind other industrial countries in providing a diversified system and might well undertake research on the problem of &quot;fit&quot; between students and institutions. As part of a longstanding interest in differential recruitment, the Center for Research and Development in Higher Education at Berkeley has been engaged in measuring the &quot;non-intellective&quot; characteristics of students, such as autonomy and creativity, and has attempted to determine to what extent institutions nurture intellectual  ingenuity. A high degree of variability among students at advanced levels and significant interinstitutional variations in intellectual disposition have been discovered. Increasingly, studies are being directed to the questions of how students change during their educational career and what is the impact on student development of particular university features. Problems of planning and coordination are related to the development of a diversified system. Alternative ways are being sought by institutions that wish to attain distinctiveness while conforming to the broad goals of the system. The constraints of concerted planning and pressure to conform to conventional academic standards are threatening the continuation of educational distinctiveness in Britain and the US. (JS)",

        "description":"Both Clark Kerr and Zbigniew Brzezinski argue that American society is becoming technologically complex or \"technetronic\" and that the new multiversity is the appropriate type of higher education institution to serve that society. The historically relevant man must adjust himself to these circumstances; the historically irrelevant one can continue his \"Sisyphian\" life. A different argument using historical inevitability begins with the needs of the individual. Here, the new era and its institutions will have to be modified to serve the individual. Thus, the humanistic protest movements, including the Third World's revolution for social justice and the Fourth World's revolution for quality, are historically relevant and represent sensitivity to the future. This dialectic argues  for a movement away from Society, a period of renewed emphasis on the Community, and, finally, a new synthesis: \"community-in-society.\" Two of the major issues reflecting this dialectic are the concept of individual participation in decision making and the revolt against the excessive rationalization of all life. Both trends are now at work in the university which has been the bastion of superrationalization. The present influential Establishment against change could well be called \"the military-industrial-educational complex.\" A university that would lead us into the new community-in-society would have to make rather radical changes in its own complexion.

The racism practiced throughout the US has produced potentially destructive forces that could lead to a second civil war between outraged minority groups and the rest of society. The college campus, which is in the center of the struggle, must seek solutions for some of the problems of race. The University of California at Riverside (UCR) has made a start in this direction. The Educational Opportunity Program provides financial help, special counseling, and tutorial assistance to needy minority group students. UCR also has a special admission policy for students who do not meet regular entrance requirements but  who have a good chance for academic success. The number of non-academic employees from minority groups has increased by nearly 50%, 6 non-whites have been appointed to high level decision-making positions, and there are about 4 or 5 faculty members from minority groups. The problem is more difficult in the field of academic personnel because of the degree of specialization required. This illustrates the long-range aspect of the race problem which will be solved only when more non-white students become qualified and decide to make a career of college and university teaching. Other current and future UCR commitments to the urban crisis are discussed. (WM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop a framework for testing the validity of 2 conflicting theories of college effects. The \"relative deprivation\" theory suggests that college selectivity is a negative determiner of college grades that a student's academic ability determines both college grades and educational plans, and that poor grades lead to a devaluation of a student's ability self-concept and thus to a decrease in educational plans. The \"environmental press\" theory suggests that college selectivity upgrades a student's educational plans and that the \"environmental press\" at highly selective colleges motivates students to increase their educational plans, which in turn will approach the norm of the college they attend. Input data for a statistical model were collected on  127,125 entering freshmen at 248 4-year colleges and universities in the fall of 1961. Follow-up data were collected in the summer of 1962 as part of a larger study of intellectual and social environments of undergraduate institutions. A linear regression equation was used to test the conflicting propositions of the 2 theories. The results confirmed the prediction of the \"relative deprivation\" theory. A possible interpretation is that test scores serve to adjust high school grades for the academic ability differences between high schools in the same manner and degree as selectivity adjusts college grades for differences between colleges.

The students were divided into 3 groups--Scholars, Finalists and Commended. The highest competition status group, the Scholars, were awarded 4-year college scholarships and the names of the other participants were circulated to US colleges and universities. In June 1966, 1 year after their expected date of graduation from high school, all of the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire dealing with their college experiences. The data were analyzed to assess the extent to which the program accomplished its dual objectives of encouraging talented Negro students to attend college and encouraging  colleges to seek talented Negro students. Results showed that competition status was directly related to college success on all major indices: number of colleges soliciting applications, number of college acceptances, percent of enrollees in 4-year colleges, percent of students completing freshman year, percent of students planning to return to college, etc. Most of the differences between the accomplishments of higher and lower status groups were small because students in the lower status groups did well.

This function should be changed to involve the development of understandings that leave students free to make informed and uncoerced individual judgments in a world that deals with constantly increasing bodies of knowledge. The old concept of liberal arts has been made inadequate by the tempo and extent of technological and social change in the US, and the rapid growth of college enrollments by students of higher intellectual quality. Today, institutions of higher education must not only cope with more young people but with a more diverse student body. Modern undergraduate students are searching for generous human relationships, educational relevance, and are trying to make  articulate in contemporary terms the very values that have been most cherished in the history of liberal education. Close observation reveals that the attitudes of these students reflect the forces at work in the larger US society. The small activist group is important, because it is composed of students who are among the highest in academic achievement and ability who also influence the tone of their institutions. The college or university that neglects this group in its curriculum and in its instructional effort invites both trouble and a kind of functional extinction. (WM)",

It is high time for educators in the US to admit that there is much merit in student desires for participatory campus governance, without which colleges and universities may cease to exist as viable and dynamic centers of intellectual growth. But the students' right to speak, protest, organize, and demonstrate for greater social justice and their perception of a more mature society must be safeguarded within the framework of campus law. Three considerations are offered that could ensure continuous inter-communication between students, faculty, and administrators. First, each campus should have an up-to-date  table of organization that reveals the major decision-making agencies and responsible personnel. Second, each student leader should have a clear-cut understanding of his campus organization, and take responsibility for explaining it to his fellow students. Third, student leaders and faculty members should be continuously informed on the status of their suggestions, petitions, and requests in the campus governmental structure. A part of the educational experience should be experimentation with structures within which students, faculty, and administrators may solve problems in an environment of mutual respect and trust.

The study instrument was the Polyphasic Values Inventory, which assess value commitments using 20 multiple-choice items with the responses organized on a conservative-liberal continuum. The items cover selected philosophical, political, economic, social, educational personal-moral, and religious areas of value difference. Some of the study's 20 findings on student values are that students strongly support  right-to-work laws, have a moderate viewpoint toward foreign policy, and feel that the US school curriculum is adequate, but that there is more need for practical application of the principles learned. They firmly believe in a personal God or a God common to all religions, but disagree among themselves about the nature of the Bible. They also feel that all men are entitled to equal opportunity to develop their capacities, and that a maximum of personal contact is necessary to overcome racial problems. Findings on some patterns of relationship between responses from students at similar institutions are also reported. (WM)",

With a research orientation that distinguishes it from the traditional US urban university, NYU is becoming more attractive to top-flight scholars and students who will eventually infuse new vitality into the city. NYU's present program places  emphasis on providing superior academic facilities, new buildings are designed in a style of architecture that is urban in concept, and dormitory facilities are expanding. For the enrichment of life in the city, NYU trains more professional people than any other university, provides the largest amount of clinical services in medicine and dentistry, organizes conferences and special training programs, conducts research for the benefit of city agencies, business, and industry, operates a continuing education program for more than 10,000 adults, and sponsors concerts, performances, and exhibitions of all kinds.

Contrary to expectation, college senior correlations showed the same pattern as found with high school tests: reasonable validities for the first 3 years and no correlations in the senior year. Although this sample developed intellectually in  college, aptitude change appeared relatively uniform throughout the sample.

Although the amount of state tax support is rising in dollars, it is declining as a percentage of total income for many public institutions. Because of the increasing competition for state revenue, it represents less than 40% of total income for public institutions today, and may drop even more in the future. Tax dollars can support basic needs such as the building and maintenance of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and can provide average salaries for staff members. But the \"margin for excellence,\" represented by such enriching features of a sound educational program as cultural  programs, continuing research, new courses of study, competitive faculty salaries, student aid, and museum and library collections, depends chiefly on private support. Recent figures from the Council for Financial Aid to Education show that public institutions receive only 15% of the voluntary support dollars for higher education. If public institutions are to maintain their educational quality and contribute to the country's needs for highly trained manpower and to a constantly evolving body of science and technology, they will require much more support from private sources.

        "description":"The processes of revolutionary change, particularly the dynamics of the egalitarian ideal, have affected the campus in 2 central ways. The first is the erosive effect of equality on the traditional status of higher education as centers for cultivating the abilities of an intellectual and social elite. Educators are faced with the difficulty of maintaining the vision of excellence in a mass educational system and maintaining standards of excellence when they can no longer be included in the criteria of admission. The second effect of egalitarianism is the use of the campus as a major lever for social change by ethnic minorities. Campus unrest continues to sharpen the conflicts between faculty and trustees, and political pressures are likely to increase the power of trustees. As  academic senates are brought into more direct and intense conflict with trustees and administrators, tactics used by both sides will sharpen the adversary character of their relationship. New procedural and substantive issues will create new tensions in the senate's relationships with external organizations. The senate is likely to respond by endorsing collective negotiation. And, if the academic union is involved in an issue, the senate may also find itself contending for the role of bargaining agent. There is also the problem of the ineffectiveness of the faculty in reaching agreement on any issue. Adversary relationships characterized by confrontation and bargaining, and backed by force, will likely increase within the university. (JS)",

What directions higher education will take will be determined by the methods the federal government adopts to allocate its resources. The alternatives are: continuation on the present course of supporting categorical programs, academic facilities and student aid; channelling funds primarily through the individual students; or providing support directly to the institutions. In its advisory report to the Secretary of HEW, the Wescoe Committee evaluated the  assets and liabilities of categorical support. The Committee described the effect of the lack of clear goals on higher education. One of the plans involving channelling funds through students is provision of tax credits for educational expenses. This plan is politically appealing but would hurt low income families, working students and veterans on the GI Bill, and would cost the Treasury a billion and a half dollars yearly. Another proposal is the Educational Opportunity Bank or &quot;Student Life Indenture Plan.&quot; The alternative of providing direct institutional aid is supported by the 7 major national higher education associations and bills proposing such general aid programs have been introduced in Congress.

These college failouts exhibit the full range of academic potential but are hampered by such things as low self concept, inadequate language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking, a lack of ability to make sound decisions, a lack of meaningful goals, or psychiatric disturbances. Currently used approaches to help low achieving students include: (1) academic suspension or dismissal with the possibility of readmission after a stipulated period, (2) remedial courses, programs, and how-to-study courses, (3) tutoring, and (4) individual and/or group counseling. A model is proposed for a comprehensive approach which may be adapted for use at individual institutions. It involves a  thorough educational diagnosis to identify specific causes for low achievement and viable alternatives for action. When appropriate, an individual rehabilitation program could pinpoint the causes of each student's underachievement. A 3-track system would enable the matching of emphasis in each track (language skill development, time and work scheduling, and improvement of self concept) with a student's primary problem in any one area. Since the goal is maximum student development, the staff member would act as a catalyst to facilitate learning and to encourage a great deal of individual responsibility on the part of the student.

        "description":"The basic assumption of the \"new direction\" in art is that US society treats persons as fragmented slivers of themselves and not as whole human beings, and its social impact is therefore a struggle to live. A happening is an experience that jerks one into the awareness of his environment. Living theater challenges the restrictions placed upon us by laws, taboos, and mores, and its impact should be to cause serious questioning about our lives. \"Soul\" is the poetry of the urban culture that tells of the misery, loneliness, agony, and joy of a people, and requires the body's participation in song such as the communication of the blues to an audience with \"singing\" body movements (called body gyrations by the uninitiated). The arts are saying that US society needs to be jerked  (happening), questioned and defied (living theater), and given an experience of what it means to be a whole, feeling person (soul). The aim of education may be defined as the preparation of students to participate as full human beings in society, but the educational systems of our urban centers are not making real education possible. The drop-out rate in the cities is approaching 50% of the student population. The only alternative for the educational system would seem to be the experiential tools of the arts in the hard core curriculum, so that students may begin to sense their wholeness and urban society may experience what it means to be human.

        "description":"During an analysis of the nature of the curricular-instructional process of US higher education, faculty members were classified into 5 prototypes based on their styles of teaching. The recitation class teacher limits the process of reasoning by students. The content-centered faculty member helps his students to master what \"knowledgeable\" people in the field are expected to know. The instructor-centered professor's students learn to approach problems in the field as he himself approaches them. The intellect-centered professor helps students to acquire intellectual skills and abilities that use reason and language as major tools, with problem-solving as the major means. The person-centered faculty member helps students to develop as individuals along all the dimensions where  growth seems necessary or desirable, rather than to develop their intellectual abilities only. Relevance has more to do with the nature of learning and how a student goes about studying than it has to do with the subject matter itself. What presents some serious implications for the future of college instruction is that traditional US colleges are hostile to the teaching style of the person-centered professor--the only style that can accommodate active student participation in the teaching-learning process and therefore make the subject matter relevant to today's students.

Settlements in which a majority of persons live are \"contiguous civil divisions\" radiating from the city and having densities of no fewer than 150 persons per square mile. SMSA's break down into numerous subdivisions each of which produces its own complex of unresolved problems and students. The students and problems, in turn, generate questions concerning their relationship to colleges and universities, although neither the composition of the urban impact nor the opportunities for institutional response are identical. Few colleges or universities are located in cities of 1,000,000  or more and the \"new, organic urban campus\" has not yet been created. Planning the relevant urban institution should take into account traffic moving in and out of the campus and the patterns, needs and commerce of urban man. Planners could utilize design concepts such as: extension of the campus perimeter, establishment of small, many-purpose sub-centers, and horizontal zoning of buildings based on velocity of circulation. They should consider: the separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, the spending potential of staff and students, housing, and primarily, how the college affects the neighborhood. (JS)",

        "description":"Some studies conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) have revealed possible causes of the uprisings on college and university campuses, and others suggest possible remedies for the agony experienced at many institutions. A survey of 5,200 college and university trustees shows that the ambivalence in their beliefs and attitudes, and the conflicting views among them as well as between them and other members of the academic community, may have contributed to campus turbulence. One of the most important findings in a study of 180 university presidents in New York State is an admitted discrepancy between their perceived accomplishment and their recognized responsibility. An examination of the relationships between 6 types of organized student protest and 5 measures of  institutional climate --as perceived by students at 109 four-year colleges--reveals a strong relationship between the incidence and the intensity of student protests on 2 sets of off-campus issues: civil rights and US militarism. In the same study it was found that on those campuses where there is a strong concern for national and international affairs, and on those where scholarly attainment is valued highly, one is more likely to find students who are active in promoting the rights of black people or in demonstrating against the US involvement in Vietnam. It is felt that campus disorders may possibly be necessary ingredients of institutional progress toward excellence. (WM)",

During the first 250 years of higher education in the US, administration depended on the character and attitude of the college president. Today, no standards exist for determining the number of administrative officers necessary for the most efficient operation of a university. Importance should be placed on the effect of various teaching faculty-administrative faculty ratios on the quality of instruction as measured by test scores, persistence to graduate, enrollment in graduate schools,  success after graduation, and other factors. A decrease in the teaching faculty, with a constant size student body, will naturally mean larger classes. Although a large segment of the faculty would react negatively to increases in the size of the administrative faculty, several studies of controlled experiments indicated that a decrease in the size of the teaching faculty would not have adverse effects on educational outcomes. Small classes were not shown to have any advantage over large classes. A critical test of leadership would be to shift more effort into administrative functions while minimizing teaching faculty losses. (WM)",

Pulver dealt with urban problems and used Milwaukee, Wisconsin as an example to illustrate the complexities of modern metropolitan life. Because communication among various groups in the city is necessary for finding solutions, the university needs a wide array of specialists committed to developing trust between its programs and services and those it wants to reach. The experience of University Extension's involvement in the development of Milwaukee has demonstrated the need for the urban university to engage in critical self-examination. Daniel J. Schler discusses the meaning of community development, the concept of a university's role,  the problems of assuming new functions and relationships, the nature of the university itself, and the proper institutional responses to community needs. Lee J. Cary cites Title I as indicative of the shift from a project to problem focus--a move toward a comprehensive systems approach to community problems. He believes community development is an appropriate way for the university to address social needs, and the state universities have a special responsibility to serve the people of their state. Discussion of the University of Missouri's extension program indicates the need for more professionals in the field and the broad scope of possible community action. (JS)",

Both sense a frustration and feel disillusioned with a society that rewards the rich and denies opportunities to the poor. They are also children of an electronic age and the exposure to instantaneous experiences reinforces their impatience. Yet the young share with other groups and institutions a deep sense of powerlessness. Although the anger of radical students and their sympathizers can be understood, it does not justify the violence seen at many institutions. It is ineffective to reply to student protests simply by trying to repress them. Administrators in colleges and high schools must make every effort to establish communication with their students  and grant them responsibility. Never before have students been better prepared to have a voice in the decisions affecting them. They are, too, often right in condemning the complacency of their elders. Students should be given full responsibility for their personal conduct on and off campus and the opportunities to evaluate their faculty's teaching performance and participate in curriculum reform. The most important concern of students--the quality of undergraduate teaching--should be shared by administrators and faculty. The idealism of activist students should be welcomed, their right to dissent rigorously protected, and their alliance sought. (JS)",

The results indicate that by the end of the first semester, the typical freshman's confidence in his academic ability wanes somewhat, although he still considers himself to be capable. He wants to obtain a salable skill, and seeks good teachers who will become personally involved with him in achieving this skill. He also wants a voice in the university's policymaking, would like to have advice and counsel available  when he needs it, and prefers autonomy in his personal affairs. Those students who were interested in the performing arts before entering college tended to achieve higher GPAs than those who were not. Also, those who were not interested in influencing public affairs and who were not very concerned about university supervision and policymaking tended to have higher GPAs at the end of the semester than those who were more interested in these items.

A collaborative relationship between correctional agencies and universities could be furthered if: university faculty recognized the educational and research needs of the correctional system; students engaged in work projects in correctional settings; and correctional personnel were involved in educational and research ventures. Because of its traditional isolation, academic specialization, and dislike of vocationalism, universities have resisted collaborative efforts but the  pressure of the public and students for more public service activities could help promote involvement in the correctional field. Although it is not ideal, the organization of schools of social work can provide a basis for developing an appropriate curriculum. Various colleges and universities have initiated work-study programs of potential significance for university-agency collaboration. Special training methods designed for personnel working in anti-poverty programs or with juvenile delinquents also merit special attention. Strategic considerations will determine what model of educational program is adopted. All of the many feasible models incorporate the concept of combining outside work with study.

Beyond meeting the current crises, faculty members study or analyze urban problems, and teach urban-related courses in specific areas such as city planning, urban renewal, education, business and finance. The 11 institutions offer courses dealing with general urban problems, including poverty, race relations, and the political structure of the city. There have been a few projects to develop better coordination and direction for future efforts, and others to enlist more widespread student support. Student organizations at 6 campuses concentrate their efforts on tutorial, recreational and rehabilitation projects. (WM)",

Separate housing for students, social activities space, and colleges, schools or institutes were specifically mentioned. While describing some curricular responses that have been made to the problems of US Negroes, the paper discusses priority issues raised by black studies other than those covered by the warning. The standard curriculum at most US colleges and universities is reviewed in the context of its design, orientation and failure to provide adequate preparation for students who plan to work with or in black communities.  Outlines of 3 proposed black studies curricula are presented, all of which are modifications of the standard curriculum. One ranges from a course in Afro American history to a bachelor's degree program comprised of related courses in several fields. Another, for black students only, is designed to \"adopt the viewpoint of black culture ... the learning needs of black students and the leadership needs of the black community.\" The third program would train students to effectively help black people of the world to overcome local health, economic, or educational problems. A summary of 10 issues on black studies and related programs is also included in this special report of the American Council on Education. (WM)",

The financial needs of the US university system have multiplied in the last few decades partly because of the rise in the number of students, but primarily because of the unceasing quest for new knowledge. Since 1966, more than 50% of the total annual costs of colleges and universities have been provided by the federal government. However, this support has been restricted in recent government budgeting which, together with the reduction in the availability of public funds, has placed privately supported universities with graduate schools in special jeopardy. The leading private universities with graduate schools represent a valuable  national asset. Their independence helps to further academic freedom in all institutions and lends strength and flexibility to the entire educational system. The dependence of corporate industry on the university system is as great as that of any other sector of the US. It is suggested that the corporate community increase its support to private colleges and universities that have graduate schools by providing a selected group of these institutions (5 or more) with unrestricted grants for a given period of time. The selection would be based on considerations of quality, contributions to research, and student training. (WM)",

Total federal support increased from $1,413 million in 1963 to $3,311 million in 1967. In 1967, $2,323 million were provided for academic science and about $987 million for nonscience activities. Colleges and universities in the East North Central US received $602 million, or the  largest portion of federal funds committed to a major geographic division, and 2-year institutions received more than $117 million.

Rapid change is usually accompanied by conflict, but a majority of educators are baffled by the turmoil at leading colleges and universities. Studies on student groups revealed that those who are opposed to the demonstrations of their activist peers and others who are neutral expressed desires similar to the militant students on matters such as greater student involvement in academic affairs and other educational policies that affect them directly. In other studies, faculty members under 30 years of age and another group who were 55 years of age or older differed widely on crucial policy  matters but tended to have similar permissive attitudes toward student unrest and other controversial incidents on campus. It was found that administrators differed among themselves on the principles and procedures of education but widely accepted the occasional need for the display of student power in order to bring about changes within the university. The broader academic community has not paid sufficient attention to institutional goals, and has failed to chart the purposes and directions of higher education. It is time for faculty, students, and administrators to unite in effective action for achieving peaceful educational reform. (WM)",

Since the Supreme Court approaches college cases and criminal law cases in the same manner, it is important to know what is happening to the shape of the law. At state institutions, a student is entitled to know with some specificity what the charge against him is, who is testifying, and what they are saying. He is also entitled to a fair hearing, but whether he should have a lawyer has not been held by the courts. The substance of the rules of criminal procedure are subject to constitutional limitation. For instance, the university may forbid disorderly protests on campus but it may not  discharge students for their participation in peaceful protests. The problems on campus are caused by student rebellion. It is suggested that they are rebelling because of the war in Vietnam and social injustices such as the plight of the poor blacks, whites, or Puerto Ricans. These are the same problems that burden life and create tension off campus. Since the law is not clear about the procedures required before a student can be expelled for civil disobedience off campus, administrators should try to protect the university community by dealing with on-campus affairs and letting off-campus authorities handle off-campus student activities.

Another role should be to ensure the involvement of faculty, student, trustee, and administrative staff in the governing structure, with areas of authority and responsibility properly delineated. Four other administrative roles are proposed for keeping the university within sight of its goals. The chairman of a governing board presents  some of his experiences in the third statement. Governing board members often feel that they lack sufficient information about the issues on which they make policy, especially when a multi-institutional system is involved. Administrators and trustees, when under pressure by the public and the legislatures, need to select a meaningful challenge, accommodate to it, and resist the rest with tact, understanding, and firmness.

Student, faculty, and administrative leadership are crucial, mutually reinforcing elements in the shaping of any institution committed to learning. The  third statement places emphasis on the student as an individual with human feelings, needs, and desires. The administration and faculty should allow the student to be an active participant in the college community, and should contribute to his individual development by seeing that the results of his participation are both productive and educational. The fourth statement presents 3 ways in which a student's role should develop, but for the present suggests that students serve on committees that have been under faculty control.

The assumption underlying the study was that significant differences in the predictability of GRE aptitude test scores would result as a direct function of age. The sample consisted of 393 students who had received master's degrees during 1966 and 1967, in 18 different areas of specialization. Findings revealed that the assumption underlying the study could not be substantiated. For the group as a whole, no significant differences in means of GRE total aptitude test scores or in mean  graduate GPRs were found. The oldest group had a lowest GRE scores, showed a tendency to earn slightly lower quantitative ability scores than the younger students, but earned the highest graduate GPRs. For education students, GRE total scores were found to predict graduate GPRs better for those 30 years of age and above than for those in their twenties. Age had little correlation with GRE scores for the men, but it was associated with both GRE scores and GPRs for the women. The men and women in the sample exceeded the 1964-1967 national norms for their sexes in all instances, except for male performance in verbal ability. (WM)",

It takes into account findings by Astin (1969) and Berkowitz (1968), calling for a model expressing the covert behavior of a subject in terms equivalent to those used to anticipate overt behavior. This paper presents the development of an attitude scale from \"real life\" phenomena based on the actual behavior of the individual, both covert and overt. It assesses the intensity of a given attitude toward or about campus life and suggests an improved method of assessing the reasonable degree of predictability in the linking of attitudes and manifest behavior. The model allows the partitioning of stimuli involved in attitude intensities in such a way that  they can be ranked in potency to yield a hierarchy of \"volatile\" areas deserving administrative attention. At the University of Tennessee, 5 areas of student life were chosen for investigation: classroom conditions, satisfaction with faculty, satisfaction with administrators, total University environment, and present level of morale. Black, white, and international students were selected according to race, sex, class, college and grade point average. The components for assessing the intensity of an attitude were determined by the students' responses during interviews to questions on their significant observations and experiences at the University.

A high level of social activity, universal participation and plentiful and close staff-student relations were evident at Worcester College of Education in 1961--a social structure produced by the interaction of a number of interrelated factors in the early history of the college. With physical expansion and accompanying changes in academic and professional work, these traditions came under strain although the values of the early period survived as references. The persistence of old expectations in a new situation helped in the search for remedies, yet worked to  conserve customary (and inappropriate) ways of organizing social life. Students resisted reform until 1967 when a small minority was able to dominate student affairs because of lack of participation by the majority. By 1967, there was an apparent anomaly of changes in the roles which student and staff felt obliged to play in an expanding college, not accompanied by any change in the perception of the staff's role by students, or the students' role by staff. The increased size of the institution resulted in more formal and limited social relations between staff and students not merely because of few facilities conducive to intimacy but because the motivation to participate had gone. The research investigating this total pattern of interaction was conducted from 1961 to 1968.  (JS)",

The structural and operational aspects of an \"ideal design\" for the new university that would integrate the disruptive forces of change are presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 outlines several innovations that may facilitate the transition from the present to the new design of the university. These include pilot system laboratories, interdisciplinary centers for integrative and policy studies, and the introduction of new teaching and research subjects linking scientific and technological issues to others of public policy and social concern. The report is generally based on the present structure of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (WM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop a semantic differential scale based on achievement motivation concepts by which grade point averages could be predicted. A scale was constructed and administered to 944 freshmen at Northeastern State College in Fall 1967. Two approaches were used. One was to combine semantic differential scale scores derived from motivation concepts with aptitude scores into a general multiple regression equation. The other was to hold the academic aptitude constant and apply the semantic differential scale scores to students of equal ability. In this approach, a separate multiple regression equation is necessary for each academic aptitude level. Students were grouped according to their academic aptitude and sex. Multiple correlations between grades and  semantic differential scale scores which were significant at or above the .05 level of confidence were found for each group of subjects. The conclusions were that the semantic differential technique constructed from achievement motivation concepts can predict grades but the scale devised here is unsatisfactory for predictive purposes. Through further study and improvement, it could possibly become useful for screening, counseling and admission activities. (Author/JS)",

Questionnaires were returned by 582 students, approximately 49% of the class. Respondents recorded their feelings about the general value of specific requirements and the worth of continuing certain courses. They also suggested changes for making the educational experience more meaningful. It was found that most students had selected their major field before entering their sophomore year; believed the total number of credit hours required outside their major was too high and the maximum number of credits in their major was too low;  felt that several core requirements had contributed little to their understanding of the subject; believed subjects in the social sciences had contributed most to their understanding of a particular area; and expressed a desire to change 7 out of 8 of the core requirements. Further analysis showed the influence of grade point average and major on response and the relationship between the respondent's perception of a requirement's contribution to his understanding of an area and his recommendations that the course be retained, increased or reduced in scope.

This study was designed to identify and to quantitatively evaluate the importance of fringe benefit policies and practices, as well as other factors from which faculty members could derive satisfaction. The majority of faculty turnover was found to result from a cumulative dissatisfaction with general administrative policies and practices relating to facilities and faculty personnel policies that do not meet faculty needs, rather than from offers of more desirable positions. The study also  revealed 57 factors relating to the institutional environment that could provide a high motivational influence upon a faculty member to either remain at his college or seek employment elsewhere, many of which could be implemented by an institution without substantial out of pocket cost. Among other things, each institution should employ an administrator who is well qualified in the field of employee relations to formulate faculty personnel policies designed to provide optimum faculty satisfaction.

It was designed to explore a new method for describing the various models used in thinking and to determine whether this approach would yield results that were consonant with current cognitive theory. At the beginning and end of an introductory course in Social Psychology, college freshmen and their instructor filled out association matrices for 20 words that were central to the course. Using 1 word as a subject, the students assigned associability scale values to all possible pairs of words on a 7-point scale, indicating to what degree each of the other words would \"fit in\" with (top of scale) or change (bottom of scale) the subject.  At the end of the term the association matrices were analyzed by a new, non-parametric method of factor analysis, the Matrix Optimizing System (Mopsy). Two major hypotheses of the study were confirmed with levels of correlations in the .3 to .4 range: students whose associative matrices yield a larger number of dimensions under the non-parametric factor analysis tend to get higher grades, and those whose cognitive dimensions match those of the instructor also tend to get higher grades. The Mopsy, which is discussed in detail, is suggested as a probably alternative to standard parametric methods of factor analysis. (WM)",

Shortly after World War II, many voluntary higher education associations established offices in Washington DC as an indication of their interest in shaping federal educational policy. They have been important in preserving the autonomy of the decentralized education system in its deepening relationship with the government. There are differences in the degree to which they function as significant links between the government and academic community. Those representing institutions have tended to promote: institutional support for universities that would give academic administrators full responsibility  for allocating funds within the institution; increased federal aid to previously \"deprived\" areas (e.g., humanities); and reduction of the indirect costs of federally sponsored research. Many professional associations promote discipline interests. Faculty oriented organizations have defended academic status and autonomy within the university. Special task organizations focus on specific problems of development, coordination, programs, etc. Politicization of the associations has been nurtured by political and social factors and by the development of effective cooperative arrangements among the various groups.

It must supplement in every way the  teacher and classroom environment.

Evaluation allows the teacher to identify his goals with those of the institution and to know the status of his skills, attitudes, and knowledge in relation to it. Sound evaluation makes goal achievement more effective by identifying strengths to be reinforced and weaknesses to be corrected. The literature covers various ways to observe and assess teachers; the author offers a proposal based on their common elements. It combines selected goals for the learner and an assessment of the attributes of the teacher. The goals must be developed cooperatively by teacher and administrator, for, without agreement on those, they can have no  agreement on procedures or judgments, or on acceptable evidence of the teacher's success in reaching the goals of learner behavior. The teacher's skills, attitudes, and knowledge must remain flexible, to be adjusted or modified as required, helping him to develop over time and to seek advice more readily. If acceptable evidence of student attainment is predetermined, judgment will shift from procedures to results and, with constant modification and clarification, evaluation will become more precise. Since, in some cases, teachers may feel threatened and oppose this plan, the author describes three alternative ways of implementing it. The methods vary in both philosophy and organization. (HH)",

The criterion of achievement was freshman and sophomore GPA. Efficiency of the predictor variables was determined by (1) choice of predictor technique (multiple regression equation), (2) obtaining the five prognostic and the one criterion measure for the students, (3) deriving the equation to use on the try-out population, (4) analyzing the difference between the predicted and actual GPA, and (5) determining any relationship between GPA and withdrawals,  probations, or dismissals. The equation used to predict the first-semester GPAs, the relative weight of each factor, and the equation efficiency percentages are given. The same equation, used to identify withdrawals, probations, and dismissals succeeded for 16%, 65%, and 42% respectively. It also succeeded in predicting at least 60% of the GPAs for both freshmen and sophomores within plus or minus one standard error. It also identified 66% of the probations and 40% of the dismissals.

When local universities used the campus for their practice teaching in nursing (clinic, classroom, conference), the faculty found their own teaching improved. Several hospitals and health agencies have cooperated in providing clinical experience for the students in such varied areas as medical/surgical, obstetrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, intensive care, patient-orientation, chronic illness, and  Medicare. Although the faculty still responds to high school requests for talks to recruit students, it no longer seeks them out; applicants, recruited mainly by current students, now exceed accommodations.

Because of the many social and emotional (non-academic) advantages of exposure to a college environment, it appeared to the writer that the extra guidance and counseling to keep the probationary students on campus was worthwhile --so worthwhile, in fact, that even the failures, with still more testing and attention, could possibly be guided into programs where they could do successful work.

        "description":"This address, given at a workshop on distributive education, dealt primarily with the coordination of classroom theories of retail selling with their application in the store. The teacher-coordinator, who is responsible for this step, often has such a full program that he tends to overlook it. The teacher must work with the merchant for an effective coordinating plan, adhere to it, and record the findings for evaluation. He should make more use of the \"downtown teacher,\" someone designated by management to sponsor the student while he is actually working at the store. Thus, the teacher, the sponsor, and management all have a part in this coordination. A well-trained and enthusiastic sponsor can add effectiveness and meaning to classroom learning and, at the same time, improve his  own supervisory techniques. He should receive recognition for this task not only from management but also from his colleagues. An active teacher-coordinator will keep up to date on retail activity and change, build up the confidence of management in the program, provide good public relations for the college, and find relevant case studies for the classroom. Coordination may be handled as (1) routine observations at the store, (2) visits with the student to demonstrate on-the-job training, (3) discussions with the sponsor on special techniques needed by the student, or (4) formal conferences with the sponsor on the student's progress.

In general, it was found that the predictors for individual courses were more accurate than predictors for grade point averages. A correlation of about .60 appears to be the highest that can be expected when grades and grade point averages are the criteria. Conclusions include the warning that there is no philosophical reason to expect or desire a high degree of predictability of grades and grade point averages from ability measures. Low correlation coefficients on these measures may well indicate that the college is providing appropriate programs. A low multiple  correlation could also mean that there is not a linear relationship between the criterion, grade point average, and the predictors. (JC)",

Relationships between ACT scores, grades earned in guided studies courses, and subsequent success in college courses were examined.

These problems result from increases in numbers of students and faculty, expansion of academic programs, increase in the number of books and periodicals published, high deterioration rates of existing holdings, and inadequate financial support. The Board of Higher Education recommends that: (1) the book, periodical, and binding budgets be increased at all public senior institutions depending upon needs; (2) institutions reach specified goals for minimum numbers of volumes by 1975;  (3) institutions not designated as depositories for Federal Government publications become depositories; (4) the ratio of clerical staff to librarians be raised to two to one; (5) the ratio of librarians to students be raised to one librarian for every 300 students; (6) library seating accommodate 25% of student enrollment; (7) administration, faculty, and library staff explore ways of cooperating to improve services; (8) a study be initiated to determine the feasibility of a central research library facility for the state (Author/CC)",

Faculty in library education should be specifically prepared for roles in education, research, and scholarship. Library education must draw on related disciplines and provide laboratory experiences for students. More research, other than historical and bibliographical studies and applied surveys, must be done, particularly at the doctoral level.

The purpose is the development of cognitive memory systems which are capable of responding with structured information that matches the gap in the knowledge of the querist, rather than with the delivery of a \"document,\" i.e., an accidental linguistic representation of the information about a particular fact, that may or may not cover the  point in question. This report, arranged chronologically, describes the work done in each of the five report periods. The initial research action centered around the development of a linked data structure concept (called \"cylinders,\" based on a use of \"rings\") and other technical aspects. Later, the study concentrated more on the fundamental interactions involved in cognition, attempting not to duplicate human intelligence but to design machines to accomplish results that are similar to the results of cognitive processes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the network after six months of operation. Part I of the study consists of a general evaluation by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co., based on operational data collected by the Texas State Library System, network evaluation criteria, a questionnaire administered to network participants, and analyses of data summaries. Findings are presented in terms of network costs, improved interlibrary cooperation, accelerated processing of interlibrary loans, improved patron satisfaction, adequacy of basic collections, and network use. The overall conclusion is that the network is achieving the initial objective  of improving the interlibrary loan capabilities of participating libraries. Specific recommendations for improvement are made. Part II consists of a more detailed analysis by the Texas State Library Field Services Division of the data from the transaction sheets which the Division administered and tabulated for Part I of the study. This analysis includes comments on the ten Major Resource Center public libraries and size II libraries, general evaluations, recommendations, and discussion of network costs. An addendum includes data on the relationship of the network with the libraries. (JB)",

Auditory discrimination is important because, among other reasons, studies have shown the existence of a high positive correlation between a child's ability to listen and his ability to read. It was hypothesized that the environment of disadvantaged youth produces so much noise that a blocking of individual sounds occurs. One hundred and six Head Start children took part in this study. The first training group listened to tapes containing 12 categories of sounds familiar to children. The second training group listened to narrative materials played on tape recorders. Posttraining test scores showed that  group one children performed better than group two children for both verbal discrimination and following directions. Both training groups performed better than the control group, and girls generally performed better than boys. (WD)",

Primarily found in the infant schools, this new concept in education emphasizes an environment in which a child is encouraged to learn but is given the freedom to do so in his own style at his own pace. The children are regarded as individuals capable of taking an active part in their own learning instead of disruptive creatures who need to be managed and guided through series of detailed tasks. The pupils in these English schools, although allowed great freedom of movement, display a remarkable self-restraint, integrity, and learning level. Several of the Leicestershire infant schools have done away with classes organized on  the basis of age and have replaced them with vertical grouping. Leicestershire has also done away with the eleven-plus examination (used in England to qualify high scorers for high status grammar schools) because of its harsh effect. Many classes no longer need to make a distinction between one subject and another or between work and play. (WD)",

Some overlap of their concepts and principles with perceptual motor training methods occurred in the United States, according to the authors. The focus of the theoretical discussion integrated developmental and personality concepts from psychoanalytic theory and Piaget cognitive theory. Four &quot;practical&quot; aspects of psychomotor education were also discussed: (1) its structure, which included basic elements of motoricity, body ego, organization in time and space, and education through movement; (2) its indications in psychomotor disorders, which included motor debility, inhibition, and hyperactivity; (3) its application in practice;  and (4) some pedagogical considerations. It was noted that training procedures modify body motor symptoms and signs and make possible the use of the body in emotional expression, social relationships, and the development of body skills. Further research was suggested to establish more clearly the relationship between mental and motor development. (JS)",

After an IQ test, individual identification tests (word, letter, and numeral) were administered to determine the children's knowledge. Home interviews and classroom visitations by parents were conducted. The program had a language arts focus rather than a reading focus, used all phases of language arts appealing to children's interests, and developed reading vocabularies through the whole word approach. Letter, word, and numeral identification was stressed. Reading and conversation periods were held at least once a day. After 8 months, tests were readministered. While achievement in some  goals was not assessed quantitatively, it was assumed that such achievement would have a positive effect on later school performance. Because this study concerns only the first of a two year project, overall results will be reported later. (DO)",

Each child was subsequently given a new  learning situation in which the same type of response was required, but to a slightly different task.

Achievement in listening, vocabulary, and reading were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Any generalizations based on the findings can be applicable only to  like subjects and teachers and to similar conditions. It was concluded that (1) listening comprehension of the experimental group was significantly improved; (2) instruction used in basal reading programs improved listening comprehension when adapted for use with aurally presented material; and (3) listening instruction had a strong positive effect on reading achievement, although it did not produce highly significant improvement in reading comprehension. Implications of the findings and suggestions for further research are delineated. (DO)",

        "description":"In an attempt to find a test which minimized cultural bias, three tests were administered to 335 first grade pupils. The subjects comprised 2 groups (123 Anglo children and 212 Spanish surnamed children). The Goodenough Draw-A-Man Test (GDAM) and the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test (LT), Form A, were administered as measures of intelligence. The California Achievement Test (CAT), Form W, 1957 edition, was used as a measure of achievement. Results showed a mean IQ difference between the two groups of 4.39 on the LT and of 2.63 on the GDAM, with the Anglo group scoring higher on both tests. When the CAT scores were covaried with the LT IQ scores the only significant difference found between the two groups at the .01 level was in the &quot;meaning of opposites&quot; subtest. When the CAT  scores were covaried with the GDAM IQ scores, differences in six categories were revealed at the .01 level: (1) meaning of opposites, (2) total reading vocabulary, (3) total reading, (4) arithmetic problems, (5) total arithmetic reasoning, and (6) total battery. With this particular population, the GDAM and LT were nearly identical in predicting the CAT. The GDAM tends to bring these two divergent populations closer together as far as IQ scores are concerned. A bibliography and tables are attached. (NT)",

Four raters scored each essay independently and without knowledge of the other three ratings by following standardized procedures. Four mean test scores for each student formed a chronological sequence from the fall of 1966 through the spring of 1968.

Global quality is a broad measure of the level of ability and development evidenced by the pupil in his particular writing. Syntactic maturity is a measure based on the existence of various syntactical structures in the writing. Considered in this study were (1) the number of T-units (minimal terminable syntactic units), (2) the mean T-unit length, (3) the number of subordinate clauses, and (4) the number of all clauses. High correlations were found between global quality measures and the number of T-units, the ratio of the clauses per T-unit, the number of subordinate clauses, and the number of all clauses.

A solution to some of these drawbacks is the use of the matched-pair scoring technique. For each &quot;yes&quot; item on the test there is included a &quot;reversed&quot; or &quot;no&quot; item on the same concept being tested, and vice versa. The pupil must respond correctly to both in order to be given credit for either one. However, the drawback then becomes the necessity of doubling the size of the test. A 30-item test, based on &quot;families at work&quot; economics, was administered to six first grade classes; three had bee n studying the material, and three had not. The test results showed that (1) the matched-pair scoring technique  increased the reliability of the yes-no test and also increased and general discriminatory power of the test and (2) the students who were studying the economics material scored higher than students who were not, indicating that the program was resulting in demonstrable learning.

Some problems encountered appear to be resolved by using verbally administered yes-no tests. But such tests are criticized as having a low reliability because they offer only two choices. Two modifications of the yes-no test have been proposed to increase reliability. One is the &quot;matched-pairs&quot; technique, in which every &quot;yes&quot; item has a matching item to be answered &quot;no&quot;. Both items must be answered correctly for either to be counted. The second technique of the all-no test, an attempt to counter the children's proclivity to answer &quot;yes&quot; even when the answer is not known. Some 200 first grade children were administered an economics test, in which all three techniques were used. The test  scores indicated that the all-no test had the greatest reliability, but it was less valid than the matched-pairs test. Thus, the matched-pairs test would be the best way to construct the yes-no type of achievement tests. Another article by the same authors (see PS 001 819) also deals with the subject. (WD)",

Results of screening by nonprofessionals were compared with results of the traditional pediatric examinations. The nonprofessionals were trained by a pediatrician and a psychologist and used the following instruments to facilitate screening: parent interviews, physical observation forms, a revised Denver Developmental Screening Test, the Ammons Quick Test, and a revised Willoughby-Haggerty Behavior Rating Scale. There was a positive correlation between the results of pediatric examinations and those of the nonprofessionals. Their referrals for intellectual and developmental problems also reflected a low but  positive correlation with those of psychologists. The correlation between pediatricians' and psychologists' referrals was even lower. These results suggest that with more training, nonprofessionals could be useful in health screening under proper supervision and thus provide a valuable service to areas short of medical and nursing personnel.

An eidetic image was defined as a long-lasting visual image of a figure localized in space in front of the subject, positive in color, and usually on the place where the original figure was shown. The image persists after the stimulus is gone. Subjects were shown pictures one at a time for a brief period and asked to comment on each picture once it had been removed. Study results suggest that eidetic imagery is a stable perceptual ability,  without developmental trends as the subject grows older. The amount of information reported on a picture in eidetic imagery differed little from that of normal memory.

During the 1967-1968 school year it comprised 23 classes situated in 14 schools and was designed to serve up to 405 pupils and 345 parents. The classes were financed by California State and U.S. Government funds. The programs for the children were basic preschool programs stressing language development, experience building, and readiness activities. The programs for the parents stressed child growth and development, nutrition, health, preschool education, and the nature, availability, and use of community resources. Each class employed a work experience aide and a teacher aide from the neighborhood. Data were collected  from a kindergarten teacher assessment of pupil readiness and the effects of compensatory programs on incoming kindergarten pupils. The Caldwell Preschool Inventory and the Slosson Intelligence Test were administered to 100 pupils in the fall and to 77 available for retesting in the spring. A field trip program report, parent questionnaire, teacher questionnaire, and reports from the staff members completed the data available. About half of this report is a detailed account of the &quot;findings,&quot; but no general conclusions are listed. (NT)",

Nine stimulus cells and six attribute cells made up the apparatus. The attribute cells consisted of three colors and three geometric shapes; the stimulus cells made up a matrix consisting of the nine possible combinations of the two basic attributes. The subjects were asked to perform three operations on the matrix: (1) to define the covered contents of the stimulus cells by looking at the attribute cells, (2) to place the stimuli in their correct cells while being guided by the attribute cells, and (3) to define and fill the attribute cells by viewing the stimulus cells. The results showed that on all three tasks the performance  of the 4-year-olds was close to chance, the performance of the 8-year-olds was near maximum, and there was gradual improvement of performance for the ages in between. For subjects 4 to 7 years of age, tasks (1) and (2) were positively related but were independent of task (3). For the 8-year-olds, tasks (1) and (3) were positively related and tasks (1) and (2) were independent. This difference in task relationships is probably due, in part, to differences in the types of verbal mediators involved. (WD)",

Two first grade classes from an Oakland, California, inner city school were chosen to participate in this experiment. The pupils were all pretested. Half of them were then randomly chosen to be the experimental group and subsequently received special dialect lessons in certain features of standard English. The control pupils received no special lessons. It was hypothesized that (1) in 8 weeks, Negro children could be taught to use elements of standard English dialect which did not occur in their native dialect; (2) this knowledge would have a positive and significant influence on their word reading scores; and (3) dialect  lessons would have a positive and significant influence on scores of word reading tests in which the relationship between letters and sounds was controlled. Posttests were administered to all the pupils at the conclusion of the program. On the basis of this testing, all three hypotheses were rejected. (WD)",

Informal ratings were also made by pediatricians. This phase of the project involved the initial screening of 100 preschoolers on the six tests. The tests were administered at two pediatric offices. The test results indicated that the instruments had a moderate to high relationship with the  chronological age and mental age of the children and also a high correlation among themselves.

The data, collected by interview in 1963, were based on the responses of 299 individuals who were operating farms in 1949. The study revealed that 81% of the respondents considered a major occupational change in the 12-year period preceding the survey. A large number of the 81% did make the change to either more or less dependency on farming. The most important factor given in deciding to change to non-farm work was financial gain and the economic pressures of supporting a family. The ones who decided to go into full-time farming stated they could make as much or more money in farming. The study concluded that since  most of the farmers interviewed changed occupation for financial gain, one of the most powerful value standards in American society appeared to be the obligation each man felt to support himself and his family.

Emphasis is placed upon the need for an intermediate role which could serve the \"linking\" function between the researcher and the practitioner. A typology of linking roles is developed. It is suggested that strategy for changing rural education should rely heavily on logic, reason, persuasion, showing, helping, involving, appeal to values and training, to the relative exclusion of telling,  force, compulsion, intervention, and deprivation.

Teachers, preferably from Spanish-speaking background, should be trained in both Spanish and English.

School counselors, should possess  guidance skills to help solve Mexican American students' problems of role acceptance, self-concept, and social values.

While the number of one-teacher schools in the United States has decreased from 148,711 in 1930 to 15,018 in 1961, a similar trend is not taking place as rapidly in other areas of the world, resulting in a continuation of already inadequate educational programs at both the primary and secondary levels. Innovative programs in rural education are, however, beginning to emerge throughout the world. For a number of years in New South Wales, for instance, there have been Mobil Instructional Units which serve remote areas. A recent study in Alaska recommends the building of 6 regional boarding high schools in remote Alaskan regions  by 1975, with 8 additional boarding schools planned for 1980. Goals developed during a recent Conference of African States for the Development of Education in Africa include universal primary education in this century, with provisions for at least 20% of all children leaving primary schools to enroll in secondary schools.

        "description":"Today adult education is recognized as one of the most important factors in bringing about social and economic development. However, there are some problems which serve as impediments to adult education in the less developed arid regions. These problems include: (1) entrusting adult education to agents who may not have the necessary qualifications; (2) a shortage of suitable teaching materials prepared by competent authors and lack of suitable audio visual aids; (3) the need for regular professional supervision and on-the-job training; (4) lack of adequate funds for implementing adult education programs; and (5) the role of local traditions and customs as a reason for resistance from adults. The advantages and potentials of adult education in rural areas are: (1) increasing  self-assurance of the individual; (2) improving the social development of adults, which in turn has positive effects on various relationships; (3) increasing and improving crop and livestock production which contributes to economic development; (4) introducing improved farming practices and better techniques to arid regions by extension services. Adult education is seen as one of the most economical ways of developing arid lands. (CM)",

Usually, the educational system of an area reflects the dominant culture of the political power in control. However, the educational system of the dominant culture might not be relevant to the people of arid or rural areas. This situation can be seen by comparing the public schools of Nogales, Sonora, Mexico and Nogales, Arizona. On the Mexican side of the border the schools are controlled in part from Mexico City and reflect a strong French tradition of intellectual development and no practical application of knowledge. In Nogales, Arizona, the schools reflect more local control, and the curriculum is more flexible, pragmatic, and  meaningful to the population affected by it. To be more effective, any curriculum should be developed from data collected about the learner which reflect the following: (1) biological and psychological factors; (2) sociocultural factors; (3) subject matter content; (4) philosophy of education; and (5) learning theory.

Since arid areas have special characteristics, it is necessary to find applicable solutions. For example, many of these countries have many villages that are isolated from urban centers. Teachers, who usually want to work and live in the cities, have no desire to go to isolated areas. Therefore, radio could be used as an effective instrument, especially for adult education. In the field of institutions, 2-year technical institutes are more practical in developing countries than 4-year schools. More engineers are not needed,  but rather more technicians to apply the theories. Agriculture will be the base for many years to come for most of the arid areas. Consequently, agricultural and vocational schools that teach practical skills are greatly needed. It is not enough to simply have the knowledge available, instead it is the useful application of knowledge that is important. (RH)",

Regional high schools which meet the needs of the rural people of Alaska seem to be an answer to the geographic problem. Other steps toward solution include: (1) establishing Head Start classes; (2) having local people teach at the pre-school level; (3) continuing teacher-aid training program as well as teachers' assistants and teachers' associates; (4) changing the educational  curriculum to meet the needs of the village children; and (5) involving Native leaders in the conception of an over-all educational plan for rural Alaska. By improving the education system, the economic and industrial situations will also develop.

The behavioral objectives for children were formulated descriptively in terms of expected outcomes in the areas of language, literature, numbers, self-concept, perception, and social skills. Thirty-six educationally disadvantaged, Caucasian preschool children, 35 mothers, one father, and one parent substitute enrolled in the Praire Grove,  Arkansas, program, which consisted of attending school 2 hours on Saturday mornings. Preliminary test data indicated the program may have produced favorable changes in the participating children. Mean IQ scores were significantly in favor of the experimental group as compared to the control group. The Saturday School model appeared to be acceptable to low-income families as evidenced by their participation and adaptable to other groups as evidenced by the subsequent use of the model for 3- and 4-year-old Negro children and their parents.

Separate questionnaires were filled out by 145 students and their mothers. Sixty of the students were from families receiving public assistance and 85 of the students were from  families who were not receiving any aid, but who income was below $4,000.

Poor communication between inventor and user is probably the weakest point in the educational system. Most innovative decisions are made by the school system rather than individual teachers. Characteristics of small school situations, such as limited financial and faculty resources, physical isolation, and apathetic community attitudes toward education, contribute to a slow rate of acceptance of innovation. Sharing services and pooling financial resources may permit small schools to initiate more innovative programs. Educational research and development should focus on producing innovations designed especially for the conditions of small and  rural schools. (JH)",

In order to overcome this waste of money and human resources, book committees need to employ standards and methods of evaluation to identify books appropriate for disadvantaged children. An example of this technique is developed through an illustrative textbook evaluation based on interest appeal of the illustrations, readability of the content, and usefulness of the glossary. These three areas were chosen because they evaluate very different aspects of a book and are especially important in teaching disadvantaged children to read. References are listed. (BS)",

Critical thinking is defined (1) as the habit of examining and weighing an idea or a thing before accepting or rejecting it and (2) as a three-factor ability consisting of attitudes, function, and knowledge. Reading is seen as an effective vehicle for influencing critical thinking abilities through the enrichment and extension of concepts and through the facilitation of the use of language. The paper concludes that critical thinking can be fostered through reading if: (1) planned instruction in the essential knowledge and skill areas is provided; (2) materials are selected to teach specific knowledge skills; (3) teaching is planned to broaden the scope and raise the  level of pupil's thinking; (4) students, while reading, are induced to actively engage in thinking about the communication; and (5) students have breadth of experience and opportunities to exchange ideas and beliefs in a nonthreatening classroom.

Passages and questions from a standardized reading test were displayed via an electro-mechanical device which allowed reading times to be recorded. Five experimental chunked formats were compared with each other and one selected for further study. There was no important or statistically significant difference between the experimental chunked format and the control format either on the reading rate or on comprehension measures. However, another control format (no punctuation or capitalization) did result in significant decrements  in reading rate and comprehension.

The role of the library includes extending the day school program, offering a place for study, and teaching reference skills in addition to developing interest in reading. This review includes examples of school and class publications, attendance records, and  certificates; it describes the materials and methods used for reading, mathematics, and library work; and it suggests additional organizational routines.

Russian formalist criticism was used as a basic approach to the study of literature, and Vladimir Propp's approach to the folktale was used as an analogy for a structural approach. The appropriateness of such an approach was examined in an experiment with approximately 25 fifth-grade students. Results of the study seemed favorable; although, a complete curriculum could not be worked out due to the 1-semester time limitation.

Two sample groups were used: 50 lower-middle-class kindergarten children with a median age of 6 years and 25 upper-middle-class nursery school children with a median age of 4 years 4 months. The subjects were required to match a stimulus letter with one of two choice stimuli. A one-way analysis of variance was used for error scores. The most frequent confusions were reversal and rotation transformations.

The effect this might have on the future supply of physicists is a major concern. A 1966 survey revealed that (1) well-known, high prestige college physics departments rarely had many courses to meet the needs of prospective high school physics teachers, (2) these departments typically graduate few physics teachers, and (3) less than 10 of the colleges surveyed graduated annually more than five physics teachers having a minimum of 18 semester hours of physics. Recommendations for improving high school physics  teacher preparation programs include (1) preparing the physics teachers in at least one other area, (2) providing some courses other than the research-oriented bachelor's degree program, (3) planning the sequence of physics courses to recruit and accommodate students, (4) providing instructional styles that are compatible with high school methods of presentation, (5) including a course in the history and philosophy of physics, and (6) providing courses for inservice teachers.

Analyzed was the extent to which educational policies under the new regime actually succeeded in departing from cultural patterns established in the older society. Since mathematics education is less susceptible than many other disciplines to ideological inroads, it provided a particularly good vehicle for determining the amount and quality of a key segment of cultural heritage transmitted from one generation to another. This research indicates that mathematics education has retained significant amounts of its heritage throughout the period. The probable significance of the Soviet experience for developing  nations is clear: Ambitious educational borrowing from more advanced industrial countries, and bold new strokes of reform by revolutionary idealists, do not easily fit into the social and cultural context of the time and place.

Students were first taught the mechanics of utilizing a computer-based teletype to solve arithmetic word problems. Following this, a series of word problems was presented. A central characteristic of these mathematical problems was the requirement of a quantitative answer, but the arithmetical operations were not explicitly indicated. Six factors were analyzed to determine the predictive worth of each for determining problem difficulty. These were the operations variable, the steps variable, the length variable, the  sequential variable, the verbal-clue variable, and the conversion variable. The sequential variable was identified as the most important of the six variables.

The students in each of the two classes were divided into three randomly selected groups. Differences between the treatment groups were evaluated utilizing objective tests, student opinion questionnaires, time records, instructional costs, and loop film production costs. Results for the anatomy units indicated (1) there were no significant difference apparent between treatment groups immediately following the presentation of a subject  unit, (2) the addition of film loops to a method of presentation appeared to aid retention, (3) a savings of time was apparent for the treatment group having loops as their guide in a technique-oriented exercise, (4) students liked the loops as aid but had doubts about their effectiveness as a primary means of instruction, (5) there were no significant differences in achievement as a result of the different procedures, (6) students preferred the film loops for review over active dissection or viewing the prosected cadavers.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between school system innovativeness and selected dimensions of interpersonal behavior in eight Wisconsin school systems. A composite ranking of school system innovativeness was developed from three sources: the district superintendent, the professional staff of the system, and a State Department panel. Selected sections of an instrument designed by the Cooperative Project in Educational Development (COPED) were used to obtain data regarding nine interpersonal behavior (independent) variables related to professional staff perceptions of the principal, the school system interpersonal process norms, and professional staff meetings. Factor analysis, Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance, and Olds' rank order correlation were used in analyzing the  data. Those variables that were significant (p .05), when taken collectively, suggested that school systems have a measurable social-psychological climate that can enhance or retard the potential for innovativeness. Implications are that changes of climate might be prompted by the utilization of self-diagnostic instruments, inservice training, and the inclusion of human relations courses in preparation programs for teachers and administrators.

Further, to insure rater objectivity, delayed postcourse video tapes were mixed with pre- and postminicourse video tapes from another study and scored. Results of analyses of pre- and postminicourse scores showed that teachers made significant gains after the minicourse on 10 of 12 behavior scores and demonstrated a reduction to half the precourse level of teacher talk. Additional analyses of these data showed that when the sample was divided according to teacher grade level and compared on four  behaviors relating to teacher talk and pupil response, teachers in all grade levels increased their use of higher cognitive questions, and students increased the length of their responses; when the sample was divided according to middle and lower class school setting, teachers serving lower class areas made greater gains on most of the skills; and when the sample was divided by sex, there were found to be no significant differences in each group's learning of teacher skills. Two months after completion of the course, a refresher course was given to one third of the group. Results of a posttest administered two months later showed no significant differences between this group and the rest of the sample, indicating that the teachers had retained most of the skills acquired in the minicourse  without a refresher course.

To shift the balance toward change in the 24 inner-city schools of the Model School Division, this experiment in innovation trained 300 District of Columbia public school teachers in new curriculum materials and methodologies during two 6-week summer sessions. Fifteen teachers, relieved of classroom duties, collaborated with an outside change-agent and a behavioral scientist in a team for internal change. Five stages can be discerned marking the progress of the team as a group and working organization. (1) Although it only served teachers who requested assistance, the team experienced immediate success in bringing new ideas into the school system. (2) Modifying  the leader's authority, the team became a genuine participatory decisionmaking group. (3) During a period of self-evaluation, successes (in 60 workshops using the team's innovative teaching methods in the process of teaching teachers and in improved and experimental classroom environments) and failures were considered. The team met resistance to departure from tradition and faced the danger that restraining forces, when challenged, become more powerfully inhibitive. (4) The struggle of dealing with its success was recognizing its limited ability to meet requests following its coordination of student expressions of feelings and experiences regarding the King assassination riots. (5) Group members became leaders of other groups in the 1968 Summer Institute. (DL)",

Six implications emerged from the study: the campus school exists to serve the institution of which it is a part; the Wisconsin campus schools are attempting to perform a variety of functions with insufficient resources; the functions of the campus school must be clearly defined in relation to the institution of which it is a part; it is  unrealistic to consider closing the campus schools for reasons of economy; the development of cooperative programs with public school systems would ease the burden of campus schools; and the campus school should be maintained only so long as it can perform essential functions for the institution of which it is a part.

        "description":"This latest in a series of studies (of conditions which support creative problemsolving activity of gifted children) attempted to assess the immediate impact of an inservice training program to promote inductive and nondirective teaching behaviors. Subjects were 160 teachers (124 who participated in the training program and 36 constituting a control group; half from disadvantaged and half from advantaged schools) obtained from Chicago grade schools through three processes of random selection and assignment. Trained raters using Flanders' interaction analysis were employed to assess each teacher's behavior, pre and post, as 15 to 20-minute lessons were conducted. In all three dimensions analyzed--teacher talk, indirect teacher talk, and content--experimental teachers showed  significantly greater change toward inductive teaching styles than control teachers, whether they began the project with relatively high or low patterns. The same dimensions of teacher behavior were assessed when the teachers conducted a lesson which involved a problemsolving task of a non-academic kind using materials designed to encourage display of whatever inductive potential they might possess. All teachers showed significantly greater inductive tendencies in their behavioral response to the specially constructed lessons than they showed in reponse to the earlier regular academic ones. (Implications are discussed and hypotheses for further study suggested.) (JS)",

A study was designed to investigate (1) the common variance in the Difference score of the 150-item MTAI and the D score of Kerlinger's 30-item ES-VII with respect to the variables of sex and college classification and (2) relationships between subgroups on the Difference score of the MTAI and the D score of the Kerlinger's ES-VII. Both tests were administered to a modified random sample--103 prospective teachers enrolled in the introductory education course in a large state university. Product moment correlations were computed between the Difference score of the MTAI and the D score of Kerlinger's  ES-VII for the total and the six subgroups; t tests were computed to test for significant relationships between subgroups on both scales. Students ranking at the high end of the MTAI scale tended to score significantly progressive on Kerlinger's scale while those scoring low on the MTAI tended significantly to hold a traditional philosophy. Only one t ratio was significant: boys and girls differed significantly at the .01 level on the Difference score of the MTAI. The study supports the suggestion that the 30-item likert type scale (Kerlinger's) may yield more consistent results than the more widely employed 150-item true-false MTAI. (JS)",

Introductory sections trace the historical background and philosophy of the Center, which began in 1967 to provide educational agencies with technical assistance, facilities, and inservice training programs necessary for them to assess their current and innovative instructional programs. The major section describes the organization of the Center (under a director responsible to a board of directors) and the  responsibilities of each of the two divisions: the Field Services Division, which established and maintains contact with school districts requesting Center services, and the Evaluation Services Division, which (1) provides technical assistance for the selection of treatments, measurement instruments, evaluation designs and statistical analyses; (2) processes data; and (3) reports the results of the evaluation process. Job responsibilities are outlined for the division coordinators and the 11 members of their professional staffs.

        "description":"A study compared instances of self-supervision with more traditional supervision of student teachers to determine the relationships between this variable and teacher attitudes and interaction behavior. Eighty-four secondary education student teachers were engaged in self-supervision, or were more traditionally supervised, or both. Self-supervising student teachers were videotaped with no supervisor present during each of two 20-minute microteaching sessions; after each session they analyzed their own video tapes using interaction analysis, in which they had received previous training. Traditionally supervised student teachers, who had not had interaction analysis training, were observed by a supervisor during each of their two 20-minute lessons and then met with him for a  30-minute conference. Each student teacher estimated the amount of his indirect and direct influence behavior after each lesson. Pre- and posttest Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) scores and the results of the investigator's interaction analysis of each student's video tapes provided the data which was subjected to analyses of variance and covariance. Among the conclusions were that self-supervision tends to promote indirect teaching and higher scores on the MTAI and that estimates by student teachers of the percentage of indirect teaching they exhibit in their lessons are very inaccurate under both traditional and self-supervision.

A more realistic alternative to professionally unsound hierarchical arrangements would be one which places the differentiated tasks of the specialists (in media, in diagnosis, in instructional technique) and the \"generalists\" on a horizontal continuum. And until we find a workable and justifiable alternative, the present salary schedule concept is the only manageable choice we have--unless we consider one schedule  for both teachers and administrators. Stabilization of the teaching profession will first require (1) a reinforcement of the attitude that teaching is a cooperative, fraternal effort calling for solidarity among teachers, and (2) an effort by teachers and administrators to encounter the divisiveness evident in vertical certification and vertical differentiation plans. A Continuous Progress Alternative to the hierarchical ladders should be developed in the form of individualized inservice education programs--within a framework of certification justice for all teachers.

Seven 20-minute experiments were conducted using a sample of 84 teachers who were randomly assigned to an experimental treatment and then reassigned for each subsequent experiment regardless of their previous assignment. Treatments consisted of presenting hypothetical students' cumulative folders to the Ss. Based on the information therein, Ss answered six questions (each with five possible responses) involving their expectations for the academic performance of that student. In any given experiment, the information in the folders was identical for all Ss with two exceptions: grade level (first or sixth) and one of the other variables (IQ, grade average, sex,  chronological age, standardized test performance, anecdotal records, or socioeconomic background) which were systematically introduced and varied, each in a separate experiment. Data resulting from Ss' composite scores on the six criterion questions constituting the dependent variables were analyzed by analysis of variance, and multiple comparison tests (Newman-Keuls) were run. It was inferred that IQ, course grades, standardized test results, and socioeconomic background are perceived by teachers as the characteristics on which they can most validly base their expectations of students' performance. Findings stress the importance of training teachers in measurement and interpretation of socioeconomic information. (JS)",

Roger H. Garrison reported that the evolving status of the junior college locates the junior college teacher's position between the high school teacher and the college professor, but the pragmatism of junior college instructional aims--producing transferable students as well as technical and lower level management personnel--requires unique skills. Preparation of teachers of academic subjects should include interdisciplinary studies, supervised junior college teaching experience, and a professional seminar to meet throughout the graduate program. Teachers of vocational subjects need extensive work experience,  background courses in their specialties, and methods courses. Elmer J. Clark recommended the establishment of special graduate programs where prospective junior college teachers take graduate majors emphasizing breadth rather than specialization or research, professional courses in educational psychology and junior college teaching, and supervised internship. The value was noted, in general discussion, of short courses, seminars, and brief institutes stressing the history and philosophy of the junior college, the nature of teaching, characteristics of students, group dynamics, and general orientation to junior college procedures.

Personally he must be knowledgeable, possess the temperament of a leader, and believe that the \"finest ideals of American life depend on the schools for their  realization.\" The community must support educational leadership, especially during controversy, yet be willing to replace an inept or dictatorial superintendent.

The data variables which were analyzed against the criterion of persistence were, in addition to the above-mentioned factors, from achievement test scores and postbaccalaureate questionnaires. Eight questions framed the collection and analysis of data. Results are of descriptive value, especially from questions regarding the characteristics of juniors entering the college of education, the number and location of students teaching after graduation, and the achievement levels of five standardized tests of juniors  and seniors. Additional findings indicate the following: in determining differences between \"persists\" and \"nonpersists,\" only overall grade point average contributed significantly, and information available at the time of admission is not an effective predictor; men and women who persisted had different patterns of scores, with high school rank being the most effective single variable; generally, persistence or nonpersistence could not be determined by achievement tests, even after adjustment was made for ability differences; and the pattern of significant gains in educational development differed but personality test scores did not differ among students grouped according to major fields.

The variables were dichotomized yielding a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design which allowed observation (through an electronic monitoring system) of two groups of four elementary school teachers (high and low manifest anxiety) under four conditions. The comparisons between teacher's behaviors when an observer was present and their behaviors when no observer was present indicated that teachers become more like their perceived ideal teacher when an observer is present. But it was found that they do not behave more like  their perceived ideal teacher when informed of an observation prior to its occurrence than they do when not informed. No support was given to the predicted interaction between a teacher's level of manifest anxiety and &quot;observer present/teacher informed&quot; compared with &quot;observer not present/teacher not informed&quot; conditions. Additional analyses of variance on 41 other interaction variables indicated that the presence or absence of an observer is significantly related to teachers' classroom behavior; changes are in the direction of more indirect behaviors when an observer is present.

Misguided motivation and resultant disinterest in learning in underachieving students may be due to unhealthy self-concepts: if students believe that they can't learn, they usually don't learn.

A wide variety of teaching strategies (emphasizing individualized instruction) are necessary for dealing with student personality variability in such a way as to develop healthy self-concepts and enhance motivation and learning: the use of spaced learning and rest periods, frequent  sessions for review of already known material, immediate feedback on student progress, recitation during learning, praise rather than blame, whole and part learning depending on type of student and material to be presented, divergent rather than convergent questions, and psychological relevance in curriculums.

Each teacher administered a pretest, also keyed to the grid, to students in two of his classes, and planned and taught lessons over a four-day period to one of these classes for recall and to the other for application. These lessons were observed and rated using the Observation Schedule and Record (OScAR) 5V. On the sixth day, a posttest (also keyed to the content grid) was  administered to the students, and results were compared with those of the pretest revealing differences in pupil learning by teachers and also by goal. Audio tapes of the lessons were used to code psychological-social behavior of teachers (using OScAR), content covered, and type of instructional goal, and a visual display of interaction between these three types of teacher behavior was prepared. Teacher verbalism frequencies were tallied into content grid cells to show content coverage, and analyzed by goal, teacher, and observer visit revealing significant goal, visit, and observer, revealing 21 keys which reliably identified significant differences between teachers.

Students indicated that the program increased or provoked an awareness of poverty conditions; parental concern,  student motivation, and excellence; and the vastness and complexity of inner-city problems.

Under the guidance of the experienced teacher (a faculty member who attended a six-week summer institute on team supervision), the team proceeds through a four-step clinical analysis process known as &quot;cycling&quot;: (1) One member who is selected to teach a lesson prepares objectives which are studied by the rest of the team in a preobservation  planning session in which they determine what data to collect, how, and by whom. (2) The lesson is taught and raw data is collected by team members. (3) The team meets without the teacher to analyze and organize the data and to plan the strategy for presentation of feedback. (4) Feedback is presented to the teacher who interacts with other members in a self-analytic manner. The team's role is not to evaluate the teacher but to provide a multilensed camera through which he can see himself as objectively as possible.

Several steps could be taken to raise teaching to the level of other professions: reduce the number of teachers (as in differentiated staff), raise the levels of training and competence (which should be demonstrated) required to enter and advance in the profession, increase salaries, develop a hierarchy of teaching positions (as in college), and provide working conditions in which the teacher has control over his practice and has time to plan lessons and continue inservice training. Yet there is not adequate  reliable information about teacher dropouts. Certain generalizations are known about professional differences for men and women, between the United States and foreign countries, and among elementary, secondary, and college levels; but a longitudinal study of at least 20 years is needed to follow the progress of those who begin teaching.

        "description":"A teacher should encourage self-expression, especially in kindergarten and primary students, by creating a sympathetic, free atmosphere in which a student can state in oral or written form his own thoughts in his own way. Self-expression in a student can be developed through his telling about himself, making up stories about pictures, or taking part in word games. If a teacher chooses topics that interest the class, free expression will follow. In all of these activities, the aim is to increase the child's powers of observation and his ability to clarify ideas through analogy. Providing ample practice in oral communication, the teacher is able to increase the student's vocabulary and his confidence in expressing himself. By giving encouragement and showing interest in what is  written or composed orally, the teacher can assist the child in developing fluency of expression and an interest in words, while maintaining the freshness and excitement the child experiences when his work is appreciated. If begun in infant grades and developed through primary classes, this teaching approach will produce fluent and interested students at the secondary level. (LH)",

The right of an individual to read rests on the fundamental democratic assumption that an educated free man possesses powers of discrimination and should determine his own actions. To avoid objections from pressure groups, national or local book committees tend to carefully exclude from textbooks and reading lists those sections and volumes that offend such groups. Consequently, several American writers are inadequately represented in the public secondary schools. Cut off from many of the great ideas and feelings of Western man, a  student is unlikely to develop into a free, reasoning person who can make up his own mind, who can understand his culture, and who can live compassionately with his fellowman. To preserve the unity of Western thought and culture, American citizens who care about the improvement of education are urged to join teachers, librarians, administrators, boards of trustees, and professional and scholarly organizations in supporting the students' right to read.

The method involved two phases: (1) the training of four high school English teachers, in one school district, in transformational grammar, and (2) the production of a series of introductory lectures for all district English teachers of grades 7-12. Training in the first phase was intensive, involving outside reading and 10 two-hour sessions. At the end of the seminar, each teacher taught a unit in transformational grammar and was video-taped teaching part of the unit to one class. The second phase was made up of four one-hour lectures and was meant to provide only a very general picture of the material.  Effectiveness of the program was measured by pre- and post-tests for seminar participants and by questionnaires distributed to all teachers attending the second-phase lectures. The intensive in-service education course was judged successful, but the lecture series, although beneficial, was considered generally inadequate.

        "description":"Evaluations of three English methodology courses at Bradley University, Illinois, were made to determine which course or combination of courses was most effective in preparing the student to teach English in the secondary school. Questionnaires completed by Bradley graduates teaching English in secondary schools indicated that none of the three courses, individually, met the methodology needs in all areas of English. One course, &quot;Methods of Teaching English&quot; was found to be inadequate primarily because of its time limitations as a 1-hour course. &quot;Senior Internship&quot; was rated of definite value for teacher preparation but was limited in enrollment and to experience in college Freshman composition classes. &quot;Advanced Composition&quot; was rated high in value in methods of teaching  composition and in strengthening the student's writing knowledge and skills. The weakest areas in the English methodology curriculum were presenting grammar and linguistics and teaching culturally disadvantaged and slow students. The evidence indicated the need for expanding the 1-hour English methods course and establishing it as a required course, possibly merging it with the education methods course. &quot;Advanced Composition&quot; should be recommended, if not required, for all English education majors. &quot;Senior Internship&quot; should be studied further as an elective.

Becuase good poetry can encourage the child's imagination, a teacher should avoid the mediocre \"children's poems\" generally found in textbooks and should present students with worthwhile poems from other sources that meet the standards of adult poetry. Having students examine two haiku poems, one by Pound and one by a student, can help to create a working definition of poetry and to indicate three possible levels of meaning in a poem--surface, symbolic, and personal. Students who consider these three levels in studying Blake's \"Tyger\" and Frost's \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" frequently have less difficulty with the obscurities  of the poems (ignoring those they cannot deal with) than do professional scholars. To teach poetry, the teacher must utilize his interpretive ability to discover the metaphorical level and the deeper significance of the work. As a result, the questions he asks in a discussion will be guided by the sense of the metaphorical significances of the poem, known by the teacher but held open for the discoveries of the students.

The internship involved an introduction to planning units and lessons, to practical aspects of instruction, and to evaluation techniques under the personal guidance of an experienced teacher. Scores on the  National Teacher Examination in English Language and Literature given at the end of the internship showed gains over scores made on the same test given at the beginning of the experiment. Overall, the study did not lend itself to statistical analysis. Instead, anecdotal records by the interns themselves, their &quot;master&quot; teachers, their public school teachers, and their college supervisor in the student-teaching semester gave evidence of gains in motivation, poise, flexibility, open-mindedness, and teaching insight.

The lessons using symbolic notation and diagrams were each superior to the verbal presentation. Low ability students did not benefit from the diagrams and only high ability students mastered the strictly verbal presentation. The symbolic notation produced significant learning at all ability levels.

        "description":"This study, conducted at Loyola University, Chicago, tested the effectiveness of two short courses on the performance of student teachers in high school English instruction. Eleven student teachers, during 1965-66, formed the control group which followed the usual teacher training syllabus. Eleven others, during 1966-67, formed an experimental group which reviewed the fundamental principles of a high school speech course, focusing on those elements particularly applicable to teaching high school English, and which participated in a course on the art of questioning in addition to regular course work. Students in both groups were asked to tape record four (one-half hour) lessons in the teaching of one or more literary selections. These tapes were analyzed for teachers' performance  in regard to speech and the art of questioning. Statistical analyses of the results revealed no significant differences in the performance of the two groups. Possible explanations for these results may be (1) the complexity of the teaching situation for beginning teachers, (2) insufficient time and opportunity for preparing student teachers in the techniques within the time allotted, and (3) the fact that developing the art of questioning as well as the poise that is needed for speech proficiency on the part of the teacher demands prolonged practice.

        "description":"Based on the assumption that skill in oral interpretation is essential to effective teaching of high school English, this study sought to describe a one-term course in oral interpretation that would be most compatible with the needs of the prospective secondary school English teacher. Therefore, a conference of speech and English educators (ISCPET Oral Interpretation Curriculum Study Conference, Monmouth College, Illinois, July 24-28, 1968) was called to consider the development of such a course. The recommendations from this conference included a statement of objectives, suggestions for content, recommendations for methods, and a selected bibliography. The proposed course syllabus was tested at three colleges and universities and found to be suitable for the study of oral  interpretation. The recommended course can be either adopted entirely by universities and colleges or partially adapted to existing courses or to individual needs. On the basis of the conference and the use of the syllabus, oral interpretation appears to b e a valuable part of the preparatory curriculum for prospective secondary school English teachers.

        "description":"This study purposed to develop a means of evaluating student performance in auditions for festival bands which would minimize the inconsistencies of subjective judgment. Tape recordings of student auditions were played three times to judges. During the first audition, evaluators rated students on a continuum scale with numerical divisions, and during the second audition, they rated them on a scale containing verbal descriptions of the performance characteristics. In the third session, judges heard a professional instrumentalist play the audition music and then listened to and evaluated the student's performance using the verbal score sheet. Students were ranked by their scores, and interjudge reliability measured by analysis of the rank order was significant at the .01 level of  confidence. Conclusions were (1) the three scoring techniques were equally reliable for evaluating musical performance, (2) the second technique was preferred by most adjudicators, (3) the performance characteristic of musicality was the most consistent factor in determining rank order, and (4) the graphic scale evaluation concept can be used effectively to score and rank instrumentalists who audition for festival bands.

Subjects were chosen from the United States, Japan, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and Peru, and were grouped by age, art involvement, sex, and education. They were shown pairs of slides or prints of visual art, and were asked to indicate either which of the pair they preferred or which they considered the better work of art. Responses, compared with the aesthetic judgments of United States art experts, showed a higher agreement with the experts among art-involved and better-educated groups. Resemblance of responses was greater among groups within a cultural region than among groups of differing cultural regions. In addition, data was  included and analyzed to determine the stimulus correlates of choice in Japanese and American groups. The results supported the view that a transcultural constancy in aesthetic orientation underlies the great diversity in art preferences. (JM)",

The Mass Media Committee of the Center for Urban Education maintains a representative panel of parents from whom information about communication experiences and responses to educational issues can be gathered. Telephone interviews elicited the panel's responses to a number of facets of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school crisis and to the decentralization question. Both white parents favoring decentralization and Negro parents in communities where the leaders support decentralization showed little agreement on how &quot;parent influence&quot; can achieve better education for the children. Supporters of decentralization are not demanding parental control. These &quot;suggestive&quot;  poll findings imply that decentralization must be debated as an educational issue with specific application to the children. (NH)",

The program was operated by the Board of Education and was to offer services comparable to those in the public schools. Based on data gathered by evaluation instruments, observation, interviews, and certain supplemental information, it was clear that the program suffered most from staffing shortages which made it impossible to achieve the stated goals of the project. Moreover, the ratio of professional to pupil was far too high. Other difficulties involved differences in culture, religion, and educational practices between the professionals and the parochial schools. Also reported are  problems of administration, lack of teacher orientation, articulation and communication between related programs, and inadequate facilities and materials. The project has potential and many participants felt it was valuable. However, adjustments in policy and practice are needed.

In 79 elementary and 37 junior high schools, teaching and nonteaching staff were added so that corrective reading, counseling, special classes, and reduced class size could be provided. Selected was a sample of 20 elementary schools where no other programs were operating and where ethnic groups included 35% or more &quot;others&quot;. Questionnaires were sent to principals and teachers in these schools to discover types and uses of specialist services, changes in ethnic groupings, changes in pupil achievement, and opinions of the professional staff of the program. It is recommended that this program be continued in specifically  defined elementary schools in transitional areas, with emphasis on personnel and remedial reading. Further emphasis should be placed on libraries, enrichment, and guidance activities. Administrative assignments should be limited to teacher training and support.

        "description":"Evaluated is a project to increase services for socially maladjusted pupils in four New York City schools located in institutional settings. Additional teaching staff, equipment, and supplies were allotted to these schools under Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I programs. The degree of implementation of the plan to augment staff services and the behavior, achievement, and attitudes of the pupils were appraised, based on information derived from evaluations of staff members and pupils. Although Title I funds expanded and enriched these programs, the special problems of their populations point to the need for further program improvement. It is recommended that: (1) remedial reading and math should be further expanded; (2) testing and record keeping should be  more uniform and comprehensive; (3) physical space should be increased; (4) a teacher training program should be initiated; and (5) in three of these residential schools homeless children without serious disturbances should attend regular community schools. For a history and description of ESEA Title I in New York City, see UD 007 904. (NH)",

The major importance of occupational placement can be viewed from at least two interrelated perspectives: the needs of society in fulfilling required positions in such a way that the system will operate efficiently, and the needs of the individual trying to find a place in the occupational structure that will help him satisfy his felt needs. This conceptual scheme focuses on two major areas of orientation: (1) status orientations, that is, aspirations and expectations, and (2) job preference, that is, non-status orientations such as to work with people or to have a chance to travel. Although  prior studies suggest a weak to moderate positive association between occupational aspiration and subsequent behavior, it is concluded that almost nothing is known empirically about the nature or extent of the relationship of occupational expectations to long-run occupational status attainment.

        "description":"In 1965, a 3-year developmental program was begun to determine the desirability of modular scheduling for comprehensive and vocational schools and to investigate the impact of such scheduling on 18 secondary schools. During this time more than 15,000,000 data were provided by the schools. The Stanford School Scheduling System, a computer program for schedule construction based on course design and student course selection, was developed. Over 250 modular schedules have been produced by this program. Some of the findings were: (1) Courses were substantially modified as a result of alternatives provided by modular scheduling, (2) The use of team teaching and large and small group instruction increased, (3) The use of student performance criteria as the basis for advancement  increased, (4) Space utilization was different but more space was not required, (5) Disciplinary problems increased and later subsided while attendance problems increased, (6) There was increased interaction between students and school personnel in all schools except one, (7) Staff utilization patterns changed to increased responsibilities but involved less after hours work, and (8) Most students and teachers would prefer not to return to traditional scheduling. Descriptive information for the schools, data tables, and data collection forms are included. (EM)",

A review of the literature does not reveal a neat group of hypotheses that can be clearly delineated.

The major social and economic developments, the enabling legislation, and the issues and problems regarding the proper role of that service are discussed. Some of the historical roots of employment service concepts are traced as far back as 1834. The various services available through the Employment Service such as placement counseling, labor market information and research, industrial services, training, and others are described and the rationale for their existence is presented. Some of the problems and issues analyzed are: (1) for whom is the Employment Service intended, (2) relationships with colleges and  universities, (3) relationships with private employment agencies, and (4) federalization versus federal-state system. A variety of proposals for strengthening and improvement are presented along with a critical discussion of the proposals. Seven specific suggestions for improvement are advanced in the areas of: federal leadership, finance, evaluation, personnel, local office operations, community support, and research.

A proposed framework for curriculum development and child care contains task analysis, knowledge derivation, behavioral objective development, and organization of objectives into the curriculum. The knowledge required for the performance of many given tasks may transfer to the performance of others. General sets of capabilities increase the occupational opportunity and choice of individual students. To be useful as a component in vocational curriculum building, functional definitions of the characteristics and capabilities of a person who has attained an educational objective are needed. A behavioral objective  states what the student can do, but it does not in any way state how the behavior must be learned. Teaching then becomes an act designed to facilitate learning, not an act having relevance in itself. A curriculum in child care should be a meaningful collection of behavior objectives which enables the learner to perform certain tasks and assume more responsibility for his own education. By beginning with knowledges and developing a curriculum of behavioral objectives, one exposes the communality of tasks and opens up a large potential for further generality. (FP)",

The term &quot;occupational training&quot; includes the supportive services associated with skills training, such as basic education, counseling, and testing, as well as skills training itself. The task force concluded that training and education undertaken by business and industry and by public and private institutions, ranging from very informal to highly structured programs, generally have equipped a large part of the work force with the skills needed for employment. However, training and related services have not  been sufficiently available and are needed by large numbers of disadvantaged persons to qualify them for job entry and for continuing employment, and by many thousands of young people to help them successfully bridge the gap between school and work.

        "description":"This teacher's manual grows out of a major research project that is attempting to discover the most effective methods of increasing motivation of the adolescent. The methods under study are combined into special courses that are given in schools by teachers, not in laboratories by research scientists nor in clinics by psychotherapists. &quot;Pyschological education&quot; is described as a new educational movement of which the achievement motivation course is a part. The history, goals, methods, and rationale for this movement are discussed in some detail. Also, a fairly detailed course outline is provided to suggest how one course was put together. Chapter 2 is a set of instructions and suggestions put together to allow potential motivation course teachers to experience a course  themselves. Chapter 3 builds on this experience by providing a review of the research on achievement motivation. Chapter 4 is a detailed, down-to-earth description of what goes in an achievement motivation course for students. The appendixes include an array of games, case studies, and role plays for achievement motivation courses. A related document is VT 008 373.

The teaching system used programmed question and response booklets, tape recordings, color slides, structured practice, and human  supervision. It was concluded that the programs imparted the necessary skills to poor learners, and could be effectively used in non-educational settings. Individualized vocational training for poor learners has some distinct advantages, and the techniques can be used with similar job training programs for other occupations.

        "description":"To acquire information concerning the counselor's feelings and ideas about his profession, about himself as a professional practitioner in the field of rehabilitation, and about the organizational structure within which he is employed, data were collected by questionnaire from 114 counselors in the New England State Rehabilitation Agencies. Results showed that the rehabilitation counselor in the state agency classified himself as either (1) a type of psychotherapist with the responsibility of helping the disabled person achieve an adequate total life adjustment, or (2) a manipulator of the environment with the major goal being return of the client to employment. The personal self image was one of low prestige, evidenced by the fact that 40 percent of the rehabilitation counselors  sampled indicated they would leave the profession if they could. These findings cannot be generalized to counselors in other parts of the United States; however, with reference to New England counselors, there is certainly room for concern if the results of this study are viewed in the light of the counselor's ability to motivate his clients. Further research is needed on the role of the vocational rehabilitation counselor in the state agency and on the training and administrative climate in which he works. (CH)",

Initial annual earnings differential figures at $525,650 and $719,629 were projected into the future at various rates of promotion and various rates of discount on the benefit stream. Resulting lifetime benefits (for 30 working years) range from $2,556,110 at a zero promotion rate and 20 percent discount rate on the first figure to $15,162,977 at a 3.5 promotion rate and a 5 percent discount rate for the $719,629 figure. These projected benefits may be compared with the total program cost of $3,097,616. On the other hand, the internal rates of return on the training outlay of $3,097,616 range from 16.29 percent at zero rate of promotion for the  $525,650 figure to 26.20 percent at the 3.5 rate of promotion for the $719,629 figure. An alternative for the cost outlay would have to exceed the rate of return if the training were to be considered economically unprofitable. It was concluded that, under the circumstances and assumptions of the study, training conducted under MDTA is worthwhile with benefits greatly exceeding costs and internal rates of return high.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an attempt to establish the equivalent of a system of market principles for various types of government activities. One should not talk about education in terms of cost or needs alone. No cost can be justified without a reference to pay-off, and the satisfaction of any need cannot be justified without reference to cost. Cost-benefit analysis forces  administrators to think through their objectives, concentrate on cost, and think in terms of alternatives. Some misconceptions are: (1) It seeks to conduct education on a least-cost basis, (2) Benefits are measured only in dollar terms, (3) Some things are not quantifiable, (4) The technique has not been fully developed, and (5) It tends to ignore political considerations. A Pennsylvania study was reported which revealed certain values of vocational-technical programs over other high school curriculums. (DM)",

The basic goals were to develop sound methods and techniques for producing positive changes in the attitudes and behaviors of deprived youth, and to provide an educational environment in which youth could learn the necessary vocational, personal, and social skills. Of the 544 trainees who were enrolled in the TRY project, the results show that 48 percent graduated, 45 percent dropped out or were discharged, and 7 percent terminated for reasons not related to the project. A followup study of TRY graduates shows that 12 percent  went to college, 76 percent were placed in training-related jobs, 7 percent went to the armed forces, 4 percent were placed in nontraining-related jobs, and 1 percent went on to other training programs. The mean starting pay for all placed graduates was $82.00 per week or $4,264 per year. (CH)",

The sample of 216 inmates, ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, were from a correctional institution in North Carolina. The treatment consisted of manipulating the perceived relevancy of parole information to the prison inmate's chances of achieving parole. The data are presented in three parts, by test of (1) the retention hypotheses, (2) hypotheses concerning participation in occupational education, and (3) reliability of the instruments used in the study. It was concluded  that a person can be described as possessing a generalized expectancy of control or lack of control over his environment, and that this characteristic can affect his willingness to learn information or engage in activities that could reasonably be expected to increase his chances of control over his environment, such as participation for employability.

A questionnaire to determine: (1) course work required in the exact sciences, (2) classroom use made of background knowledge gained from the exact science area, and (3) recommendations for curriculum change was developed and administered to 356 graduates of Oregon State University and Texas Technological College where chemistry was not a requirement, and to all the home economics teachers in the state of  Utah. Results were compiled into tables of percentages for comparison. Conclusions were: (1) Most colleges and universities required chemistry for home economics education teachers, (2) Chemistry was found useful but not directly applicable to classroom teaching, (3) More emphasis on behavioral sciences was desired by home economics education majors.

Data were collected by questionnaire sent to 537 persons of which 339 or 63 percent responded. Findings include: (1) In spite of the apparent support of vocational education, the respondents indicated that they did not feel present vocational programs were effectively preparing students for today's world of work, (2) Respondents reported that they did not feel their respective counties were  providing a wide enough variety of vocational education programs to meet the diverse interest, abilities, and needs of students not going to college, (3) A lack of sufficient money for support of vocational education was identified as the major reason why there was not more vocational education in public schools, and (4) The respondents felt the cost of vocational education could be justified in terms of the numbers of persons it made useful members of society. Part II, dealing with attitudes held by West Virginia employers and labor leaders, will be published later. (CH)",

The 172-page \"Nurse Aide Handbook\" which had been begun during the previous quarter was completed and utilized. Unit quizzes, work sheets, progress records, daily lesson plans, and an overall schedule were developed and applied. The research team conferred regularly with course instructors in order to obtain maximum utilization of techniques suggested in the second quarter in-service program.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if Michigan schools can conduct an evaluation of their own programs of vocational education, with emphasis on outcomes and attainment of local objectives, maximizing the use of local personnel and resources, and utilizing consultant leadership and related professional assistance. The study was conducted with the cooperation of 10 school systems. Four of these were classified as small size, three as medium, and three as large. The emphasis was on local staff and citizen involvement, curriculum analysis, assessment of outcomes through follow-up, and special activities and projects of interest to each school. The study involved 317 staff members and 45 advisory committees for local problems of vocational education, consisting of a total of  303 citizens. The following elements were established as relevant in a local program self-evaluation: (1) administrative endorsement and support, (2) a local leadership team, (3) a program of local leadership preservice and inservice training, (4) an evaluation program plan, and (5) a staff committee for evaluation.

A major portion of the data consisted of long-term historical analyses of educational attainment in the United States, principally from Census sources, and of the historical evolution of higher educational institutions. Shorter term analyses from the late thirties to the near present, derived from a number of independent surveys, plus OE statistics and Census Bureau Current Population Surveys, permitted the relation of student and college characteristics to college plans and enrollments. Considered as a totality, long- and short-term trends plus the current  higher educational realities form the base for future predictions. These materials also specify the significant educational \"problem areas\" which are emerging, and which may be presumed to mount to relative significance as time passes. The authors will devote a considerable part of this summary to identifying these \"problems.\" (Author)",

Whether he is working at the pre-doctoral level or the post-doctoral level, the researcher has a recurrent need to know the results of previous research, and the status of the topic to be explored. One of the difficulties which any researcher faces is locating those studies which will be of most use to him. Prior to this time, no single source of information on research in elementary school mathematics was available. Instead there were various types of lists, no one of which was complete or current. The compilation of reports of research on elementary school mathematics was begun in a dissertation  by Suydam in which 799 reports are categorized, annotated, and evaluated. This volume extends this compilation, with 306 additional reports listed. This represents an updating to include reports published in journals between 1966 and 1968, plus those with pre-1966 publication dates which were not included in the first compilation. (Authors)",

The 2,000 participants included mayors, county and city commissioners, fire chiefs, businessmen, and educators. A major objective was to stimulate thinking and action about the desirability of continuing education of political leaders. A survey was made of educational interest among public officials; information was spread through the mass media and a newsletter; and conferences on Urban Exploration, Communications, and Recreational Facilities  were held. A series of locally sponsored Community Development Seminars were led by three social science interns, who also were concerned in an educational, and a social planning, project in Brevard County. The cost of the programs averaged $13.00 per participant and $13,000 for the interns. Most of the programs were considered very successful. (jf)",

The study focused on the impact which the field test and other education and/or training programs had on the participants in terms of educational gain and retention, social awareness and functioning, and economic improvement. Testing and retesting six and 12 months after the field test provided data on over 1,600 persons. Other data were obtained through in-depth interviews with field test participants and teachers, nonparticipant welfare recipients, and personnel of various agencies. Findings on academic achievement, employment, income, welfare grants, interagency  cooperation, and attitudes toward involvement in the programs reinforced the results of the original field test with respect to the need for education and training for the functionally illiterate, and the necessity to upgrade and improve all aspects of adult basic education, including curriculums, teacher training, materials, and supportive services.

The urban university is asked to examine its purposes in adult education, which is often its largest educational activity. Questions are raised and answers suggested about the differences between teaching the adult and teaching the schoolboy. What does it mean to our teaching that the adult has more experience, different experience, and experience differently organized? Will the goals, patterns, and procedures of education that succeed with the undergraduate succeed equally well with adults? How much general education, and how  much specialized education, should an undergraduate have? and in what order? If we assume that graduates will continue to learn throughout their lives, what education is most appropriate for them in school and after school? (eb)",

Few companies hired workers without a high school diploma; the majority required experience. Personal contact, public employment service, gate hires, and advertisements were the major means of hiring. There was a positive correlation between size of company and formal training; management training was the most common offering in large companies; in small companies training was more likely to center on specific skills. Some companies, particularly in Hartford, had formal apprenticeship systems; formal inplant programs were for females, or blue collar workers, or for specific jobs; 32 companies made use of  community facilities, especially for tuition refund programs. The large majority of blue collar workers learned on the job. Employers felt there was need for improved basic education, extended preemployment occupational training, enhanced motivation, extension of on the job training, a positive labor market policy, change in the image of service jobs, and improved guidance.

Canada was chosen as a source of help, because the comprehensive purpose and program of university extension in North American approximated the needs of India. Dr. Mehta sought financial help from Canada via the Canada External Aid Office, which later was aided by the University of British Columbia. In 1964 a contract was approved; in November, the first two Canadian advisers arrived at Rajasthan and immediately conducted a state-wide exploratory study to find out how university resources could best serve the people. The followup resulted in the beginning of five programs: correspondence study; evening colleges; both a Center and an Institute for Continuing  Education; and a degree program in adult education. The entire 4-year project can be evaluated as a success if the criterion was that a good adult education department was set up and being run by Indians by the time the Canadians left. (se)",

Analogies from urban problems to rural problems will not easily give us the methodology necessary for improving the quality of urban life.

Special programs and arrangements at Northeastern University, Brooklyn College, and elsewhere were examined, along with a program proposal by Hacker of Columbia University, and such issues as the transferability of credits, suitable  evaluation, instruments, course content, and residence requirements. Findings indicate that the problem of advanced status is a source of concern and confusion for many administrators and faculty in higher education, and that steadily increasing college and university enrollments create a favorable climate for trying to accelerate the programs of qualified students.

Two questionnaires, one for the County Extension Chairmen and one for the county staff members, were prepared by a team of researchers for the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service during 1968, to examine various aspects of staff relations, job performance, and satisfaction associated with the leadership role of the County Extension Chairman. Perceived  level of involvement was highest among (1) agents in counties with small staff sizes, (2) youngest and oldest staff members, and (3) agents who rated chairmen highest in interpersonal skills. Moreover, perceived involvement was associated with the level of job satisfaction and performance of county staff members, but was not significantly associated with the level of career satisfaction, as measured in the study.

The General Aptitude Test Battery, five other diagnostic and achievement tests, and a self-image questionnaire proved especially useful as measurement instruments.

        "description":"Five bureaucratic characteristics of organizations determined by the perceptions of staff members in 45 Cooperative Extension Service organizations and obtained through a mailed questionnaire, were compared with organizational innovativeness in program development as demonstrated over the past five years and reported by 53 raters composed of extension administrators responsible for programs on a state and national basis. When tested individually, the dimensional bureaucratic administrative characteristics -- &quot;hierarchy of authority&quot;, &quot;rules and procedures&quot; and &quot;interpersonal relations&quot; were not significantly related to innovation. Forty-nine percent of the variation in innovation was found to be attributable to four variables which were grouped in pairs -- &quot;rules - rewards&quot; and&quot;personnel - budget&quot; or &quot;resources.&quot;&quot;Rewards of Office&quot; and &quot;rules and procudures&quot; when tested as grouped or combined variables in regression analysis, proved to be significantly related to innovation. The human and material resources possessed by an organization were significant predictors of innovation.

The research was designed to test the general hypothesis that a relationship exists between certain social and personal characteristics and migration performances. In addition, characteristics of those with migration performances congruent or incongruent with expectations are discussed. Of the 63% of the sample which in 1948 stated their intention to migrate, 83% achieved their goal in 1956; however, only one half of the undecided migrated. More females than males migrated, and more nonfarm than farm males left. The males who migrated had a higher socioeconomic background, more frequently  discussed their future plans with their parents, and aspired to obtain additional training beyond high school than those males who remained in their home communities. For these variables, no differences existed between females who migrated or remained in their home communities. (author/nl)",

        "description":"Charles A. Ferguson's concept of \"diglossia\" (1959, 1964) is used in analyzing sign language. As in Haitian Creole or Swiss German, \"two or more varieties\" of sign language are \"used by the same speakers under different conditions\"--these are here called \"High\" (H) sign language and \"Low\" (L) sign language. H sign language is formally taught \"Manual English,\" English words fingerspelled or signed. L is the less prestigious form which is used, for example, in communicating with children or in informal conversations. As in other cases of diglossia, speakers may not be aware of, or may even deny the existence of, two distinct varieties, preferring to believe they use only H. Also as in other forms of diglossia, sign language L is simpler grammatically than H. The bulk of vocabulary  of H and L is shared, H having more technical terms and L often being used to explain an idea \"in words of one syllable.\" In applying the phonological analysis of diglossia to sign language, it is necessary to ask if H and L constitute a single \"gestemic system\" and if this system is common not only to users of sign language but all human communicators. It is concluded that sign language diglossia is a special situation but relatively stable and that this condition should be recognized in teaching sign language to the deaf.

Described in this paper are materials prepared as a part of the education program for migrant preschoolers, most of whom speak a nonstandard dialect of Spanish. The Oral Language Lessons, the &quot;heart&quot; of this program, provide the teacher who has little background in either linguistics or in teaching English as a foreign language with linguistically controlled activities while at the same time preparing her to develop similar activities of her own. The 59 English and 61 Spanish lessons, each taking approximately 15 minutes, are designed to be used at the rate of about three per day for eight weeks. The non-English  speaking children are taught to understand and discuss basic ideas about size, color number, time and space; identify and describe familiar objects and relationships; and ask questions, all in standard English. The Spanish lessons, taught by a Spanish-speaking person, prepare the child for the conceptual content of the English lessons and also help him acquire standard alternatives for certain nonstandard features of his own dialect of Spanish. These lessons correlate with similar materials being produced by the Department which are available at the kindergarten and first grade levels. (AMM)",

        "description":"From the sixth to the eighth century A.D., Japan was the recipient of massive cultural infusions from China. This acceptance of the Chinese pattern included, and to a great extent was based on, the acceptance of the Chinese language. The Chinese writing system was applied to Japanese because there was no other model to follow and in spite of the fact that the languages are quite dissimilar. While most of the basic characters used in writing Japanese are of Chinese origin, there are also a small number of &quot;Japanese characters&quot; called &quot;kokuji.&quot; These forms are conscious creations of the Japanese mind in the form of Chinese characters and in accordance with principles for writing Chinese characters. On the average, these constructed characters are of rather recent origin and tend to  be complicated to write. Most of the &quot;kokuji&quot; are constructed of elements which suggest the meaning rather than indicating the pronunciation. For example, to denote &quot;killer whale&quot; the two Chinese characters for &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;tiger&quot; were combined into one. It would seem that most Japanese characters were devised to represent highly specific units of measure or objects such as types of trees, fish, articles of clothing or equipment. Only three of these characters are included in the Japanese Government's list of 1,850 basic characters but they are still used informally. (JD)",

Interest in bilingual education, or at least in the inclusion of mother tongue in BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) schools goes back to the late thirties. A simplified Navajo alphabet was developed; a pre-primer, primer, and first reader in English and Navajo were written and used in reservation schools. Other materials in Navajo--technical programs for adult education, a newspaper and dictionary--were followed by bilingual texts in Hopi and Sioux. English-Spanish texts were also prepared, in response to requests from  Pueblo and Papago leaders. (It was assumed in using these texts that reading and writing would be taught first in the child's mother tongue, and written English taught only after control of oral English had been achieved.) The &quot;Five-Year Program,&quot; begun in the mid-forties by the BIA; ongoing bilingual programs in Navajo and Hopi; as well as various proposed programs, including Alaskan, are discussed in this paper.

Young children, actors, and foreigners seem to learn new dialects and languages easily because they have a strong motivation as a part of their environments. In order to motivate students, we must take into consideration the two functions of language--revelation of the self and communication. Any motivation used with these learners must consider them as human beings who have already learned a first language that is a part of them, that defines them and communicates for them. Teachers need to be motivated to accept their students' first language or dialect, in both its verbal and non-verbal manifestations, and to expect success in learning another language or  dialect. Once the teacher has communicated this acceptance and expectation to his students, he is ready to move on to specific varieties of motivation. The methods chosen must involve honesty on the part of the teacher and an attempt to recognize the students' culture. One suggestion in such a way that the learner feels that the dominant community and the teacher want to learn about him. The the learner is willing to accept and learn poems and stories in English or the standard dialect. (JD)",

Other members of the child's family are deaf and the child received training at the Gallaudet preschool from the age of 30 months. The author believes that there are distinct advantages to a \"bilingual acquisition of English and sign language,\" especially in allowing the child to express his needs, questions, and responses in either language. Without early training in sign language, a deaf child may have some language competence (if he becomes a very good lipreader), but \"he will be terribly hampered in his formative preschool years.\" The author concludes from her experiences that sign language can be  made into a visual equivalent of English and should be used at an early age as one means of communication between children and their teachers.

Beginning materials in this area, however, have made only minor strides to this goal and these strides are not yet based on a theory of the relationship between oral and written language. As a partial solution to this problem: (1) Textbook writers should provide beginning reading materials which use the syntax of the child's oral language and avoid ambiguity and rapid shifts in tense or viewpoint. (2) Teachers should recognize a hierarchy of importance in children's reading and speaking errors. The child's errors in  learning standard English should not be confused with his errors in learning to read. (3) Administrators should assess the classroom teaching situation to decide if the schools are putting restrictions on the normal use of oral language. They should also devote greater attention to matters of content in the curriculum. (4) Researchers should study the process of acquiring standard English. A \"new language arts\" is needed--one coordinated with a complete overhaul in the objectives of education.

The focus is on the American urban situation, especially as it relates to poor black children. One of the greatest deterrents to describing such situation has been our lack of tools and frameworks for studies to be made. The concepts noted in this paper--the linguistic continuum, the linguistic variable, and the linguistic situation--coupled with the development of quantitative measurement in linguistic analysis and a wider approach to fieldwork are leading to a realistic assessment of the social dimension of language. Certain pedagogical strategies are growing naturally out of this research, for it is obvious that  a more detailed analysis of the feature being taught will suggest aspects to follow or avoid. A careful analysis of the focus and target forms suggests that foreign language teaching techniques be considered in bidialectal or biloquial education. The exact ways to apply these techniques to native language learning have not been found, and it appears clear that some of these techniques (such as repetition drills) may not be very useful. Suprisingly, we have learned that even the linguistic research that is being done suggests strategies for pedagogy, especially in the sequencing of lessons with these stigmatized features.

In a \"conventional FL (foreign language) class\" of 120 class hours a year, the amount of time spent in active, immediately reinforced responding by any individual student would be less than 100 minutes. This is in contrast to the shortest PLI program (53 class hours a year), in which a student spends at least 40 percent of his time responding. The implication is that the intensive, controlled responding that characterizes PLI (and many other methods of FL education) may be quite effective, but that it is not merely as effective as other processes of learning.\" The most relevant and effective processes may be under the student's rather than the pedagogue's control. The author examines the  relevance of transformationalism to FL pedagogy and the various possibilities of using such language learning mechansims as \"intentional imitation,\"\"shadowing,\" and \"feedback.\" In discussing how programing can develop various skills for further learning, he points out that developing \"self-critical skill\" can serve in the future acquisition of phonology, and \"inferencing\" can aid in acquiring new vocabulary. Branched, rather than linear, programing implies an acceptance of individual differences among students. Programers should study artists' control of audience responses. (AMM)",

        "description":"In this speech Congressman Pucinski reviews the outlook for bilingual education in the United States. He reminds us that the gains that have been made in the past two or three years &quot;are impressive in their intent,&quot; but that we must renew our dedication to this ideal or lose &quot;the initial momentum which has been so long in the making.&quot; Although there were programs for non-English speakers underway in several states, and although Federal committees were working at the national level to study bilingual problems, the Bilingual Education Act of 1967 was a milestone of progress toward bilingual-bicultural education. Wide bipartisan support was given the bill and 310 preliminary applications for aid were filed under its provisions, proving that bilingual education was an idea whose time  had come. The fiscal realities of the year 1969 were to prove disappointing, however. Although $30 million was authorized for 1969, only $7.5 million was finally available. &quot;The need has been recognized but the legislation has yet to be translated into a real fiscal commitment.&quot; We must therefore concentrate our efforts and resources on three major problems: changing state laws forbidding instruction in languages other than English, developing suitable bilingual materials, and, most importantly, preparing teachers to participate in bilingual programs. The public should support Congressional action to fund such projects. (JD)",

Linguistics describes the student's home language, shows the teacher what needs to be noticed about the target dialect, and how that feature of the dialect works. Cultural Anthropology shows the culture within which the student's language functions--the values, allegiances, and sources of pride--and calls attention to such features as gestures and spatial distances between speakers. (Both Linguistics and Cultural Anthropology must be interpreted by staff members who understand the concerns of specialists in those fields.) The School of Education has specialists in curriculum and related  subjects who know about songs, games, and stories that appeal to various age groups, and can also give guidelines for classroom management. Other relevant disciplines are Communication with its emphasis on &quot;What to say to whom, for what purpose, and with what effect;&quot; Rhetoric, which offers an antidote to misapplications of transformational grammar; and Literature, which enlarges the mind and &quot;opens windows on the world.&quot; In planning teacher-preparation programs, resources from all these fields should be used.

(2) There is always some minimal linguistic or situational context which must be specified if a sentence in which some given determiner, or determiners, occur is to be unambiguous. (3) There are numerous minimal contrasts which exemplify the various uses of determiners. (4) A specification of the various uses of both obligatory and optional determiners is not so complex as some grammar books would lead us to suppose. Assuming Bertrand Russel's definitions, the author formulates the concepts common to sentences involving the  words &quot;the,&quot;&quot;a/an,&quot;&quot;some,&quot; and zero-determiner. Examples are given to provide evidence for the &quot;incompatibility of natural language and exact thinking,&quot; based on the following reasons: (1) It is awkward and confusing to represent variables in natural languages. (2) It is impossible to clearly separate names from descriptions. (3) Grammatical conventions result in the representation of the same concepts in different ways and different concepts in the same ways. The author concludes that natural language cannot be used in exact thinking or for the exact description of natural languages. (AMM)",

        "description":"The regularity with which much variation between forms, formerly dismissed as &quot;free variation,&quot; can be accounted for on the basis of extra-linguistic and independent linguistic factors has made the concept of the linguistic variable an invaluable construct in the description of patterned speech variation. The linguistic variable, itself an abstraction, is realized in actual speech behavior by variants (individual items which are members of a class of variants constituting the variable). The particular value of a given linguistic variable may be viewed as the function of its correlation with extra-linguistic or independent linguistic variables. The extra-linguistic variables considered in the Detroit Dialect Study were socio-economic class, sex, age, contextual style, and racial  isolation. Independent linguistic factors taken into account were linear environment and construction type. The author also summarizes in this paper several basic research questions concerning the function of the linguistic variable as a marker of social status in the black community: (1) the intersection of various social factors in accounting for patterned speech variation, (2) the extent to which social differentiation is quantitative or qualitative, (3) the relation between socially diagnostic phonological and grammatical variables, and (4) the effect of independent linguistic constraints on variability.

Data are presented on the free use of adjectives, and also on rates of verbal production when the amount of such production is largely determined by the producer. From a large survey of Maryland ninth graders, plus smaller samples of fifth- and sixth-grade blacks, middle-class white adults, and  lower-class white women, the use of 30 high-frequency adjectives was observed in written productions. It was found that (1) there was no difference in adjective usage (common adjectives only) by race; (2) there were large sex differences in verbal productivity; (3) females use more adjectives than males, even with productivity controlled; and (4) social class differences were minimal.

The same life conditions that foster dialect differences may be presumed to lead to semantic differences. At simple levels of discourse, difficulties in communication may be minimal, but semantic differences, when added to phonological and dialect differences, may have very serious consequences for the reading instruction of young children. Much evidence suggests that from first grade on there are widening gaps between the language of children from poverty environments and those from middle class groups. Word association research suggests  specific kinds of deficits, particularly in consolidation of verbs and adverbs. There may be a lack of environmental forces to encourage semantic development which not only causes reading deficits but rules out reading as a source of semantic enrichment. The author describes studies in word association of black and white inner city children, compared with rural Maryland and old order Amish children. She suggests developing semantic structures through schools games which provide drill on particular skills, and more mixing of students in the school and the community. (AMM)",

This facetious model for research is based on a \"total fiction: that language can be  judged on a single norm and that language difference and language deficiency are synonymous.\" Every child achieves a basic mastery of his dialect well before beginning school and can express anything important to him to the people in his speech community. He speaks his dialect grammatically: if he didn't, he couldn't be understood since grammar is the system of language and all language is systematic.

Learner performance is compared when required either to recognize sentences identical to those in the original list or, alternatively, to recognize non-identical sentences incorporating the gist of the original sentences but with one or more of the original words replaced by synonyms. In addition, memory for simple, active, declarative sentences is compared with that for each of the principal transformations--from active to passive, from affirmative to negative, and from declarative to either interrogative or exclamatory. Finally, since there is growing ambiguity with respect to word frequency as a factor in  remembering, three levels of sentence subject word frequency are included. Subjects used were 87 university freshmen. Results suggest that: (1) memory for spoken language and for print share much of the same effect, (2) memory for interrogatives is somewhat facilitated when such sentences are also in the active voice, but there is little effect or none when they are passive, and (3) word familiarity, indexed by frequency of use, is not always the aid in sentence recall, or at least in recognition, as was thought.

For this purpose an 18-question test dealing with conservation (awareness of invariance) and measurement of length was constructed. The six subtests and the questions used were similar to the tests used by Piaget and dealt with the following topics: reconstructing relations of distance, conservation of length, conservation of length with change and position, conservation of length with distortion of shape, measurement of length, and subdividing a straight line. According to Piaget the concepts  represented by these subtests are dependent on each other and are acquired in a definite sequence. Fifty monolingual first grade children and 50 bilingual first graders were tested individually. The mean for the bilingual sample on the conservation test was significantly higher than the mean for the monolingual sample.

Even advanced students who are linguistically competent to read scholarly articles on Japanese history find them difficult, not because of the language, but because  of the content. The time an undergraduate student of history spends in language study could be more profitably used to take courses in anthropology, literature in translation, political science, or sociology. While Japanese language study \"has utility at every level for generally recognized purposes,\" language instruction should not be expected to help in understanding Japanese history.

Their ideas on vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation were formed by popular folk-lore rather than linguistic knowledge. Current teacher training programs are inadequate and weak in this area. To begin with, the preparation of language arts teachers must be overhauled to put language at the center of the program. Teachers need to know how to deal with the child's language, how to listen and respond to it, how to diagnose what is needed, how to best teach alternate linguistic systems, and how to treat it as a positive and healthy entity. This ability can best be achieved through such pre-service  college courses as: (1) \"The Nature of Language,\" (language attitudes, stereotypes, phonetics, grammar, the systematic nature of language); (2) \"Language Variation,\" (geographic and social dialects); (3) \"Fieldwork in Child Language,\" (experience in recording and analyzing language data from at least one child-subject); and (4) \"Teaching Standard English to the Disadvantaged Child,\" (definition of the problem and implementation of solutions).

Board of Education in cooperation with the Research Foundation of City University of New York, was held in the summer of 1968 in four local colleges: (1) Brooklyn College of City University, for teachers of kindergarten through grade 4; (2) Ferkauf Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences of Yeshiva University, for teachers of grades 5-8; (3) Hunter College of City University, for teachers of grades 9-12; and (4) Teacher College of Columbia University, for special teachers and coordinators. Discussed in this Report are some prime objectives of the consortium--meeting the critical need for teachers trained in  English as a second language, providing study and training locally for teachers at every grade level, acquainting teachers with ongoing research and modern methodology and resources. Also discussed are the selection of participants (over 150); special features of the various programs (sensitivity training, parent involvement, community relationship, skills development, shock language learning); special consortium activities; publicity; and program evaluation by the directors. Appended are lists of participants, sample questionnaires and a follow-up letter. (AMM)",

A major aim of the program is to develop and implement a curriculum in which Navajo is the primary medium of instruction and English is taught as a second language. While the teaching of English is only one part of the total kindergarten curriculum, it is a part upon which future school achievement and social mobility largely depend. This preliminary guide outlines the distinctive sounds of English which need to be mastered, the basic sentence patterns of the language, and a vocabulary sufficient for classroom procedures and beginning reading texts. The content and ordering of the language lessons are based on a contrastive analysis of Navajo and  English, which allows the prediction and description of problems the speakers of one will have in learning the other. This curriculum outline will be the basis of forthcoming teaching materials being prepared by the author. (AMM)",

A random sample of sixth grade children was selected from 10 classes in a middle class and a working class school to fit a balanced factorial design with two factors, sex and social class. The groups were controlled for I.Q. Teachers rated the subjects on three scales of morality: (1) trustworthiness, (2) obedience, and (3) respect for others' rights. To assess the accuracy of the teachers' perceptions the behavioral measures of morality employed were Kohlberg's Moral Judgment Inventory, and three cheating tests. Teachers were found to view girls as more moral than boys, but the teachers' viewpoint  was not supported by behavioral evidence. The possible causes of this discrepancy are discussed. (PS)",

Four treatment conditions were set up: (1) topic similarity and positive attraction for counselor, (2) topic discrepancy and positive attraction, (3) topic similarity and negative attraction, and (4) topic discrepancy and negative attraction. Each of three counselor accomplices saw 24 undergraduate volunteer Ss; six Ss in each of the four treatment conditions. Topic discrepancy and similarity were obtained from the Ss ranking of nine discussion topics in the order of preference. Ss evaluative attitudes about counselor helpfulness were obtained from a 13 point rating  scale. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied to the data. The major finding suggests that response to his counselor's influence attempt depends both upon his attraction toward the counselor and upon the congruency between the expectations of the counselor and the subject about discussion topics.

Disciplined reflection by students can be sided by the presence of older people, manageable groups for easy and open communication, and flexibility in organizational arrangements which permit the formation of groups around topics important to the individual. Changes in relationships between students and the college which replace the in loco parentis role are discussed. The  need for improvements in present and proposed student housing is studied.

An appraisal of the nonmedical use of hallucinogens centering around the types of users, and the results of drug use, shows that the principal social impact of hallucinogens is on the personalities and values of the users. In an examination of the consequences of legal repression as a method of drug control, the following were considered: (1) the consequences of unrestricted use or of nonpunitive controls, (2) whether the laws are enforceable, (3) whether the prescribed punishment is commensurate with the offense, and (4) the value of deterrence versus the law's unintended side effects. Legal repression at the user level will probably be reduced in the  future. The society will continue to disapprove of cultist withdrawal centered around the use of drugs, but individuals who seek pleasure or growth through drugs and pursue these goals within the social order will enjoy increasing social acceptance.

Reasons why people use drugs are organized in terms of the functions drugs serve. Drugs may serve psychopathological functions. As such they may reduce psychological pain, provide partial resolution of maturational difficulties and aid in the reduction of intimacy in human relationships. Drug use in terms of interpersonal pathology is studied as is the problem of ethnocentrism in groups of drug users. Other aspects of drug use are examined. These functions include the  use of drugs as: (1) a source of mystical and religious feeling, (2) a creative and esthetic experience, (3) an escape from the constant obligations of society or from computer reality, (4) a way to induce feelings of invulnerability, (5) a reflection of the new morality, (6) a mild form of rebellion, and (7) simply as a source of fun.

Two factors were considered: group interaction as a source of motivation and discrimination learning, and the effect of a progressive hierarchy of problem-related situations upon anxiety arousal. The design of the study involved a 2x2 paradigm with a no-contact control group. Groups were formed according to two dimensions: the amount of group interaction and the nature of the desensitization hierarchy. Subjects were 25 psychology students in the upper 30% of the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS). Results indicated that test anxious college students completing a short-term program of group desensitization tended to report more anxiety reduction and achieve a greater increase in  grade point average (GPA) than students with equivalent TAS scores who did not participate in a desensitization program. Motivational variables were more plausible than discrimination learning variables. The lack of significant differences between Progressive and High Anxious groups brings into question the necessity of using a progressive hierarchy when treating test anxiety and adds to the evidence against the advantage of using displacement to resolve certain conflict situations.

Aspects of the problematic situation to be changed, are defined. In  the third phase, the production of alternatives, the client produces associative responses related to the particular problematic situation in question.

The Institute is independent although it is allied with the Department of Psychology. It is also organizationally separate from the department and the college. The Institute was established using the corporate form of business ownership. As a corporation, it is capable of entering into legal contracts, such as a contract for research with an industrial firm. The institute is administered and operated by a staff who are all members of the Psychology Department. There is also a Board of Trustees. Institute activities are categorized as (1) education and training of psychology students, (2) research, and (3) the provision of  psychological services.

Groups whose success within a curriculum exceeds that expected from the normal prediction equations, were identified. Participants were 403 students in the academic curriculum, 166 students in the business curriculum, and 137 students in the general curriculum. Rank in the senior class, independent of curriculum, was compared with seventh grade Sequential Test of Educational Progress math, science, social studies, reading, and writing scores. The potential moderators were: (1) the number of semesters of math, (2) father's feelings about post high  school education, and (5) the extra-curricular activity level. Father's education level, and parental encouragement were positively related to prediction, parental encouragement for post high school education, and a high level of extra curricular activity were also related. The one characteristic finding throughout was that an indifferent or negative parental attitude led to underachievement. (PS)",

Research design characteristics recommended are: (1) simultaneous consideration of client characteristics, counseling strategy, and outcome measures, and (2) development of codes for describing clients, counseling strategies, and outcome measures precisely. Counseling research designs should focus upon individual differences within and between clients,  and should develop simultaneously a system for communicating this individuality. Counselor selection criteria should emphasize what a counselor can produce, as well as what he is. Longitudinal studies to ascertain the predictive relationship between counselor characteristics and client outcomes should be made. Three general propositions on the assessment of counseling outcomes are reviewed. These propositions begin to bridge the gap between overspecific behavorist goals and generalized counseling goals.

Professional psychologists can help to control the content and quality of training programs for nonprofessionals on the job, in a university setting, or in a specialty school. When nonprofessional personnel becomes available, controls which insure the protection of the client, and the effectiveness of the service must be established. The various types of controls discussed include organizational controls, professional liason, and  legal controls. Positive approaches to the interaction between psychologists and nonprofessionals in the community setting described involve: the setting of community standards, the establishment of supervisory controls, the longitudinal evaluation of the effectiveness of services rendered by nonprofessionals, quality control in community training programs, the role of the local professional group, and the setting up of programs to help common \"needers\" in the community such as alcoholics and drug addicts.

The interviews were conducted under four conditions: (1) normal counseling, (2) normal counseling plus training in writing a self-counseling manual, (3) having the student use the self-counseling manual, and (4) counseling in which the counselor conducted the interview by following the text of the self-counseling manual.

While multiple regression is the best known technique for deriving fixed empirical weights for component variables (such as tests and test items), other methods allow one to derive weights which equalize the effective weights of the component variables (their individual contributions to the variance of the composite). Fixed weighting is most effective, in general, when there are few variables in the composite, and when these variables are not highly correlated. Variable weighting methods are those in which there is no nominal weight, constant over subjects, applied to a single item or response option. Of most interest are variable response-weighting methods such as those recently  suggested by de Finetti (1965) and others. To be effective, such weighting methods require that the subject be able to maximize his expected score only if he reports his subjective probabilities honestly. Variable response-weighting methods, perhaps in conjunction with fixed response-weighting methods, show promise for increasing the reliability and validity of test scores. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"Development of a healthy adult personality depends upon the healthy growth of emotions which results from the fulfillment of certain needs. Emotions are learned and are continuously developed. Fear of emotional confrontation and lack of ability to express feelings result in conflict. Love is the first felt emotion. The need for individual affection is paramount in children. It is the base upon which security, a second need, is built. Security implies acceptance of self by others. Another childhood and adolescent need is self-respect generated by receiving respect from others. The child needs to experience achievement, to explore his environment, and to practice skills. His achievement will result in self-esteem, pride, and ambition. His true accomplishments require recognition.  He needs gradual granting of independence, coupled with understanding authority. Errors of child-rearing practices in the historical development of the family in America point to the necessity of reorientation, the focal point of which may be managing emotions. (AE)",

The contention is made that the learning behavior of children from these families is affected by their pre-school and early school experiences, which may be unsatisfactory in preparing them to learn. Three types of aberrations may affect their learning: (1) those of a sociopsychological origin, (2) those resulting from peripheral nervous system impairment, and (3) those caused by central nervous system disorders. Models are presented of sociopsychological development, along with schematic representations of interactional behavior. Techniques are suggested for alleviating poor reactional behavior, including drugs and their effects, and the training of parents. The latter is  supported as having positive effect on inter-personal and intrapersonal behaviors which affect learning. Discontinuities are presented between those in the community responsible for ghetto conditions and their attitudes toward these responsibilities. Statistics on unemployment, school expenditures per pupil, education, income, occupations, and economic priorities of white vs. non-white populations are reported. (AE)",

The population studies consisted of 223 third grade children from Western Pennsylvania. An interview sheet was constructed to measure socioeconomic status, and home visitations were utilized to check student responses on the sheet. Several tests of reading and mental ability were administered, and intercorrelations were computed between the stated variables, sex, and socioeconomic status. Correlations were positive in all areas, strengthening the accumulative evidence that socioeconomic status affects school achievement. Children from lower socioeconomic areas do not overcome this  cultural deficiency by the third grade.

Specifically, it explores interpersonal feelings, intrapersonal feelings and conflicts that occur when these two are not in harmony. The technique calls upon the group to walk through a low level intrapersonal conflict (in a group setting), and to react to interpersonal behaviors in a conflict resolution. It is also expected of the group to respond to intrapersonal high level conflicts. To work with the force field concept, the following process is used: (1) Fact Assessment, including refinement of the problem and problem preparation; (2) Idea Exploration, including idea production and idea  development; and (3) Solutions, including reality testing via gaming and group discussion, and action steps. Several types of interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships are explored, and old problems are restated through force field analysis. Various games are outlined for use in problem solving and task fulfillment.

In an attempt to measure the effectiveness of the OSCICT on employability of participants, a followup was made six months after the students left the program. The three groups used in this study were drawn from enrollees of two Manpower Development and Training Act Special Youth Projects in Utah, in 1966-68. It was hypothesized that members of the Experimental Group would have lower ending scores on both the California \"F\" Scale and the Mooney Problem Checklists, and higher ending scores on the Winger Behavior Inventory, Iowa Tests of Educational Development,  and the Lorge-Thorndike. It was further hypothesized that the effects of the OSCICT would carry over to the world of work. Most hypotheses were substantiated. Followup results were inconclusive for lack of sufficient returns for statistical analysis. The author recommends the OSCICT as an effective method for improving a maladjusted underachiever in the areas of personality deficiencies. Tables of test findings are appended. (Author/CJ)",

The present outline accepts as a frame of reference the conceptualization of behavior as a function of inherited tendencies, motivation, and experience, all of which contribute to individual differences, as well as of environmental settings and the context of immediate situations. The strategy that appeared most promising to the group was that of assigning small groups of outstanding contributors, currently working in fairly specific problem areas of research, to carry out the following tasks in their respective areas; (1) specify needed research and  research approaches, and (2) describe specific theoretical and methodological problems related to that research. Flexibility was considered desirable to provide for any modifications of the outline suggested in the course of the reviews. The report as presented has the substantial concurrence of the Chicago panel, and incorporates most of the suggested revisions.

Four principles for designing clarifying environments are: (1) Perspectives Principle-one environment is more conducive to learning than another if it both permits and facilitates taking of more perspectives toward whatever is to be learned: (2) Autotelic Principle-one environment is more conducive to learning than another if the activities carried on  within it are more autotelic; (3) Productive Principle- one environment is more conducive to learning than another if what is to be learned within it is more productive; (4) Personalization Principle- one environment is more conducive to learning than another if it is more responsive to learner activities and permits and facilitates the learner's taking a more reflexive view of himself as a learner. As an illustrative example of a clarifying environment, the author discusses the talking typewriter. (Author/CJ)",

Rate of response was 64% from California schools and 68% from Oregon schools. Minor distinctions reduced analysis to responses from 105 schools in Oregon and 309 in California. Dependent variables, for which correlation to adoption of innovations was determined, included superintendedt tenture, principal tenure, faculty tenure, district size, school size, and expenditure per pupil. Testing of five major hypotheses indicated that length of  tenure of superintendents, principals, and faculty is not significantly correlated with adoption of educational innovations. In California the manner of recruitment of superintendents (from within or outside the system) is supported as a determinant of high, medium, or low structural innovation. Testing of three minor hypotheses generally yielded a positive correlation between the extent of structural innovation and the three variables of mean size of district enrollment, mean size of individual school enrollment, and mean expenditure per pupil.

Next, the emerging role of the school administrator as a management specialist rather than an authority figure receives attention along with the related topics of systems analysis, interaction analysis, group organization, and decision making. To demonstrate school programs that are the products of superior educational leadership and planning, unique aspects of programs in a Las Vegas, Nevada, high school, a  Hughson, California, high school, and the Niskayuna, New York, Public Schools are presented. Finally, that administrators and educators must broaden their conception of education to cope with the wide range of pressing problems faced by society is emphasized as the school's role in contemporary society is analyzed.

To produce significant gains in pupil learning, four basic changes in school operating procedures are essential: (1) The principal should give about three-fourths of his working time to instructional improvement, (2) teachers should have more free time to improve their teaching skills, (3) pupils should have more time for independent study, and (4) there must be better utlization of educational funds, facilities, supplies, and equipment. Suggestions to help the  principal discharge his primary responsibility to improve instruction include freeing him from other responsibilities by enlarging his administrative staff, increasing staff productivity through a horizontal and relatively informal type of organization, delegating decision-making and administrative responsibilities as much as possible, improving his own communication skills, and maintaining a clear understanding of roles and relationships among school system administrators.

For statistical analysis, the two cohorts--753 students from the larger school in a university community of about 70,000 and 404 students from the smaller school in an industrial community of about 20,000--were combined into a single sample of 1,157 students. Control variables for the study included sex, father's occupation, intelligence test score, and GPA for the final semester of junior high school. Analysis of zero order correlation data supported the study's major hypothesis; tabulated  findings indicated also that track position and academic achievement are positively correlated when controlling for the four confounding variables and when considered in the light of trend data showing the differential improvement in grades for college preparatory and noncollege preparatory students. Further research is suggested to determine the influence of five mediating processes as explanatory variables of the basic correlation. (JK)",

However, the input-output method is structurally inadequate to reflect the true behavior of the educational system. To introduce some elements of decision making into the model, some investigators have attempted to apply optimal control theory. Application of optimal control theory involves the addition of control variables, which are constrained in their values and thus reflect political or policy limits, to a general mathematical model consisting of equations defining the interdependence of sets of variables characterizing the educational system. Control theory models are theoretically attractive planning  devices because they allow for the specification of a system's initial states and certain desired targets while providing for the selection of a policy which achieves these targets at a minimum cost while satisfying existing constraints. Although barriers to practical implementation exist, this approach promises to aid in revealing the values of a systems approach to social and economic problems. (TT)",

Curriculum writing consultants specified program content, methods, and staff. An opinionnaire was circulated to test administrators' attitudes towards the model. Three presession programs were conducted to test the reactions of administrators to program content, staff, methods, sites and facilities, fees, and amounts of time involved. It was concluded that (1) school administrators  showed considerable interest in the model; (2) NASE should offer programs at several levels, including short term clinics and seminars and longer residential sessions; (3) it is fiscally feasible to launch the short term seminars and clinics but more development is needed on the other levels; (4) the probability of attendance by administrators at short term programs is primarily related to the program content, length of the program, and the fee charged; and (5) NASE should be sponsored and implemented by the AASA.

Curriculum theory may be regarded as a body of beliefs, assumptions, and knowledge derived through a process of critical analysis and substantiated by study and observation. Four main approaches to curriculum design have evolved. The subject centered approach emphasizes subject matter and the memorization of facts and might be called the traditional approach. The interest curriculum approach places emphasis on the learner, often to the neglect of content. The structure-of-knowledge approach focuses on understanding, development of perceptual skills, and symbolic operations which lead to an extension of learning and  knowledge. Finally, the humanistic approach provides for motivation by considering the needs and interests of youth while retaining emphasis on subject matter. Curriculums of comprehensive high schools are designed for the areas of required courses, elective courses, and cocurricular activities. Rapid changes in society, however, generate many problems for secondary educators who attempt to keep curriculum vital. (TT)",

The model combines well known elements of the change process--notions of external and internal inputs, the adoption process, and relating the adoption process to the entire system--in a new configuration. The structural design of the model, developed through observation of three Wisconsin school systems over 2 years, permits a progressive flow of ideas in the process of change and includes an improvement module. Data used to test the model's validity were provided through tape recordings and observations of meetings of change-agent teams operating in three school systems. Results  indicate that the model is a suitable instrument for describing developments of the change process in school systems. Further indications are that the model has potential for serving as a prototype for decision makers to objectively observe the efficiency of improvement processes operating in their respective school systems.

        "description":"As a product of judicial rulings on the legality of acts of educational authorities and on the constitutionality of educational legislation, the common law authoritatively constrains the actions of school officials. Courts have recently delineated general boundaries in two important areas of school law: (1) Tort liability of school districts, and (2) civil liberties of pupils. The school district's traditional immunity to tort liability and the ability of school officials to enact and enforce reasonable rules and regulations governing the conduct of pupils have been redefined by judicial decisions. Although these decisions have left some specific questions unanswered, school administrators must understand the principles of law that the courts have enunciated, and attempt to keep  abreast of the changes in school law likely to be announced by the courts in the near future.

Multiple regression analysis was performed with data gathered separately for Negro and white students in grades 6, 9, and 12, from which the Northern and Southern regions of the country. For each group under examination, the following clusters of school resources were changed to be the same as those held by students in another or by students of another race: (1) School facilities and programs, (2) school  teaching staffs, and (3) characteristics of fellow students in the school. In general, changes in the composition of the student body were found to be the most important influence affecting student achievement, while school facilities ranked as the least important. The inequalities of total school resources were found to be greater between races within regions than between regions for a given race. (JH)",

        "description":"The longrange goal of the Instructional Tasks Project is to determine the requirements for an effective community-school communication model and its implementation. In the project's first year, the critical incident technique was used to identify the specific behavioral concerns of the community served by the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, for its youth. Over 1,000 persons sampled from parents, youth, school staff, and the social community contributed data from which several thousand specific valued behaviors were abstracted and then classified via content analysis into a taxonomy of community concerns. Although subsequent data obtained from nonrespondents to the original sample and selected citizens indicated that the taxonomy was comprehensive, ratings of importance were  not significantly associated with frequency of behavioral concerns mentioned by respondents in the initial sample. Hopefully this taxonomy will serve to progress further toward (1) an effective model and language for school-community communications about student performances, (2) development of instructional objectives based on community concerns, and (3) a description of similarities and differences among parts of the community in their concerns for youth.

Estimates are provided of the impact of the project on children in the areas of reading achievement, achievement in arithmetic, verbal fluency, self-perception, and control of environment. Next, the evaluation sought information from teachers on aspects of role perception and decision making and ended by surveying parent opinion of the program. The sample used involves 30 schools: 16 MES schools, 7 control schools, and 7 SS schools. The study is based on a simple comparative  survey design using 15 different data gathering instruments ranging from questionnaires to standardized tests. Data collection activities conducted in MES schools were replicated in control and SS schools by the same staff to insure consistency of results. (TT)",

Following pre-unit tests of achievement and of attitudes toward independent study, programed texts, and mathematics, 42 students were divided into three sections taking 10, six, and three modules of class per week, respectively. Each section was then halved; one half using a programed text and the other using a conventional text. Tests were given again at the end of the unit. The results indicated that achievement may be inversely related to the amount of scheduled class time and bears no relation to  type of text used. A decrease in preference for independence was noted both when the group was divided according to time and when divided according to type of text used; a similar change in attitude toward programed materials was observed. Attitude toward mathematics seemed to remain unchanged. Because of the small sample size the results of the study are somewhat inconclusive. A larger study conducted over a longer period of time is urged. (DE)",

In conjunction with the School of Education at Stanford University, a computerized modular-flexible schedule was made operational and put to use in September 1963. Prior to implementation, experimental teaching techniques such as team teaching were undertaken, and inservice training workshops for Marshall staff members were used to prepare for the new instructional program. When the program was implemented, the basic schedule was changed from the conventional seven-period day to one divided into 21 20-minute modules. Students, with advisory help, preregister in the spring for the following year. With these  student schedules, a master plan is prepared with the use of a computer. Flexibility is permitted by use of four teaching-learning modes--large group instruction, medium-size groups for laboratory activities, small group learning experiences, and independent study. (LN)",

Although the design is geared primarily to evaluation of Title I programs in large cities, it should also apply to other situations. The plan for measuring treatment effects is to (1) identify the major objectives and the most important side effects of the programs, and (2) develop measures of the objectives and side effects. When several programs are being evaluated, careful selection of the comparison group is necessary to avoid the statistical problems of confounding and interaction of treatment effects. Evaluation of treatment effects is the process of judging the value of a  treatment. In education, where the consequences of programs have much greater importance than the programs themselves, program evaluation is consideration of the consequences of the program. Therefore, program ratings should be based on how favorable and important the consequences are to the users. (LN)",

This results in continuous modification of objectives and procedures which, in the traditional view, is poor scientific practice and prevents generalizability. To compensate for the lack of control, (1) a broad range of data from very large populations should be collected to allow analysis of all major variables, and (2) an educational information system should be created to provide the information necessary to evaluate replications of treatments across schools. This approach differs from a traditional research and evaluation study in determining under what conditions  a particular effect occurred rather than trying to specify and enforce a particular set of conditions.

        "description":"Three major areas of confrontation within the educational system stem from power shifts taking place within the social system as a whole. The taxpayer's revolt against increased school expenditures as juxtaposed to teachers' collective demands for salary increases forms the nucleus of one major confrontation area. Secondly, urban schools face a dilemma while attempting to reconcile black power demands for community control of schools with the principle that centralization is a logical corollary of increasing interdependence and homogeneity within the society. The revolt of college and high school students against their administrations forms the third major area of confrontation. Although the educational subsystem must be capable of adapting to new social demands, these three  distresses are symptomatic of societal, rather than strictly educational, ills. As such, the root causes of these distresses can only be treated by the integrated efforts of the many subsystems comprising the total social system. (JH)",

Most of the respondents (88%) indicated that communication about local school issues was satisfactory, and approximately one-half of the respondents rated State and national  school communications as satisfactory. Sixty-two percent of the mayors expressed a desire to increase their involvement in school issues.

Each subject's mental age was used in the Horn formulas (1947) to determine reading and arithmetic expectancies; the Stanford Achievement Test in large and regular size type was used to determine actual achievement; and oral reading was measured Gray's Oral  Reading Paragraphs tests and four subtests of the Monroe Diagnostic Reading Examination. The following hypotheses regarding the partially seeing were upheld: they are not achieving at a level equal to their abilities (discrepancies at .05 level); their psycholinguistic processes which involve visual and motor abilities are inferior to their auditory and vocal abilities; they are less well accepted in class than normal seeing peers. The data did not support the hypotheses that, compared to the seeing, partially sighted childred have inferior visual memory, are less socially mature, or show poorer personality adjustment.

Eight stimulus sentences were spoken for four pairs of pictures, simple declarative or kernel, negative, passive, and negative passive. Subjects were asked to select one of a pair of pictures for each sentence and then to repeat the sentences. They correctly comprehended kernel sentences significantly more often than other kinds of sentences. Among nonmongoloid subjects, imitation of sentences to which one optional transformation had been applied was significantly better than imitation of sentences modified by two potential transformations. Chronological  age was significantly associated with imitation ability in nonmongoloids (p .04); IQ and imitation ability were significantly associated in mongoloids (p .05), indicating that the ability to store verbal material for immediate recall is associated with general intellectual or cognitive abilities.

Poor readers were deficient in lower-order visual discrimination and memory abilities; higher-order visual discrimination skills were important to success for good readers. Higher-order rule abstraction skills were important for continued progress by the relatively successful readers; however, lower-order rule abstraction was important to successful visual discrimination at initial levels of reading for poor readers as well. Successful rule abstraction was significant at all levels of reading; and visual discrimination (visual search and sequencing) was significant to the  advanced reader for the processing of higher-level printed text. Implications were that rule abstraction is important at all levels of the reading process, visual discrimination activities at prereading and higher reading levels should be re-evaluated, and investigation is needed to determine sentence structures that are obstacles to progress beyond intermediate levels of reading.

Difficulties that mitigated against the most effective involvement of the state organization included rapid turnover in leadership, political orientations, lack of local structure, and lack of experience with or commitment to research. The study demonstrates that there is a need for a vastly improved flow of information to teachers about  available resources. There is a critical need for supportive interpersonal relations among teaching colleagues to create a climate of freedom to innovate, and to provide the motivation to do so. In-service educational activities (for teachers) are needed for a climate supportive of innovation.

What is the connection, if any, between interest and appeal in the different types of program? 5. To what extent do interests influence judgment? 6. Is there any relation between the ratings and the scenes and details retained in the foreground of the memory? And 7. Is it possible to determine any basic tendencies of partialities that are  influenced by subject matter and make-up? The publication opens with an introduction and statement of terms of reference and methods. This section also includes a bibliography. The remaining sections deal with the results of an interpretative analysis on children and with the results of tests on juveniles. The closing pages contain a summarization of results. (Author/GO)",

        "author":["Merrill, I. R."],
        "description":"Because Michigan has developed one of the outstanding driver education programs in the U.S. for high school students, it was selected for an investigation of how educational films were used to aid that program. The study described here focuses on three questions: 1. What is the amount of educational film use (how many, where, what kind)? 2. What film titles are used (which ones, how often, for what purpose)? And 3. How skillful is the film utilization? Driver education instructors in Michigan (N=1,228) were sent questionnaires in May 1959 and their replies analyzed. Though instructors make substantial use of educational film in driver education classes, they should take steps to use them more effectively. Producers of driver education films should study this report closely. Units  within the course of instruction should be more minutely titled. The announcement and description of new film titles should be expanded. A final recommendation is that a continuing series of brief regional workshops in driver education audiovisual training techniques be instituted. (Author/GO)",

The audiovisual materials and the equipment needed to present them included an overhead projector and various types of transparencies. The use of varied media in music education showed advantages over traditional modes of presentation in teaching and learning efficiency, meaningful reinforcement, and creative use of color for added motivation and interest. The media approach offers variety and caters to individual differences in learners. A list of specific situations in which transparencies can be used (i.e., to illustrate the concept of enharmonic tones) follows a description of  the advantages of using an overhead projector. Although project members encountered difficulty in the reproduction of high quality sound, use of available sound equipment proved to be adequate. The techniques employed and the equipment needed are described in detail. Funding for the project was provided under Title IV of the Elementary-Secondary Education Act of 1965.

The Farr-Quimby Act and assessments on the schools pay the costs of the television programs. A number of programs (28) produced outside the region have been found to be appropriate for local use. Various programs have been developed to integrate television into the general educational demands of the area, including the utilization of teachers on selection committees and adaptation of television to high school scheduling demands. Implementation of State-mandated educational programs, efforts to encourage creativity and use of local resources in ETV, programs for  preschool (particularly, preschool disadvantaged), and programs aimed at instructional staff are all areas in which SDA ITVA has initiated action. The use of television in other areas relevant to education is being experimented with. Various graphs of the actual and projected use of television in San Diego County are included.

In other words, is a long presentation more tiring than a short one? Groups of psychology students and Navy recruits were given equivalent amounts of instruction time, but according to different protocols--either massed presentation or spaced presentation. For each of the four film series used, the learning was very significant, but the difference between the massed and spaced presentations, as measured by total scores on the film tests, were no greater than could be accounted for by chance alone. Furthermore, the experimental subjects stated that one mode of presentation was not more effective in  maintaining interest than the other. The conclusion drawn is that military training films, presently constituting a twenty-minute aid to lecturers, may be lengthened to an hour and become a more central form of instruction. (BB)",

This study investigated the impact of the two types of change on the social system of the teachers' college from the point of view of the staff. A reaction process paradigm was conceptualized and 31 members of the staff were interviewed to test the validity of the paradigm. The interview data were content analyzed to isolate basic themes associated with reaction to change. Television made a minimal impact. The proposed merger produced a high stress reaction. Teachers felt threatened in their positions. It was evident that the reaction process paradigm provided a suitable model for understanding and documenting change as a process phenomenon  in which the components of the process determine the impact of change on a social system.

The first is whether that image varies from one film to another and, if so, how and to what extent. Secondly, presuming such variations, are they related to the time period in which the films were produced? Thirdly, are such differences affected by the source for the character of the film? And fourthly, is there an accurate verbal profile which would describe this image, based on similarities among the films viewed? Accordingly, a number of films in which visual artists were either major or subordinate characters were compiled, and nine films which reflected an appropriate time span and type of character were selected for viewing. They were  classed in three groups: Biographical, Fictional, and Subordinate Character. The respondents or viewers were graduate students in art education. Findings indicated no substantial variations in the image from one file to another. The time element was found insignificant, and so was the character of the film. It was concluded that a verbal profile can be formulated that describes the artist's image--an image which does not differ much from the expectations of most people in art education. (GO)",

In order to determine whether television would be more effective, several factors needed to be investigated. Priority was given to the design of the instructional program. A multisensory method (the simultaneous method) was adopted. Tests showed that the program should have a determined pace rather than one that was individual. Sixteen-millimeter films were used, because video tape recorders are not standerized. Special standards were evolved for selecting the television instructor and interpreter. Tests were made to determine what kind of visual and tape formats to use. Regular films proved more effective in teaching than slow-motion films. The finished product, a 16mm television film on  child psychology was found to be useful for instructing deaf people, although several modifications were suggested. There are recommendations for future research, and the research methods are fully documented and illustrated. (GO)",

In this notation, there are three equidistant lines representing the same three notes in all octaves. Slides were made of the graphs and then 'scanned' by the camera. As in most of the other technical phases of the program, some degree of failure was experienced. This was considered unavoidable in a developmental effort.

To update and revitalize the curriculum, to bring efficient teaching to isolated classrooms, and to make available modern audiovisual aids the Center for Educational Television on the campus of Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City broadcasts telelessons for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 10 months of the year, to 30,000 Philippine students in 112 schools. The Center supplies training, programing transmission, production, publications, and school coordination services. Three systems of broadcast are used--2500-megahertz, closed-circuit, and open broadcast. The Center plans to establish an instructional television service and, later, a national media service. Other plans include  extending coverage to the provinces, a telecourse library, and a tape duplication service. In order to provide the additional service, the Center will buy more equipment, train more personnel and erect a new production service building. (JY)",

To distinguish between the two writers' styles, and thereby determine the authorship of a 16th Century literary work of particular interest to Shakespearean scholars, computer-aided techniques were employed. The two authors' differing practices in word choice and other linguistic variables were collected, computated, and analyzed. The vocabularies in their other writings were organized by electronic data processing in the form of verbal indices, concordances, and order-of-frequency lists, and were then compared to a similar analysis of the language in &quot;The Groatsworth of Wit.&quot; A great deal of objective evidence in precisely quantified form emerged to testify to Chettle's authorship and forgery of  the &quot;Groatsworth.&quot; The procedure used has important implications for studies in style and may be applied to advantage in undergraduate and graduate studies, providing, as it does, a way of identifying, surely and verifiably, distinctive stylistic traits of a noted author, and producing ample evidence for their observation and study.

The factors that condition what and how much he knows are myriad. Of importance are time, education, income, sex, age, race, occupation, and where a man lives. Controlled, education tends to nullify the other factors, although they may re-emerge as predictors of what, and how much, a man is likely to know. Status in life is a noteworthy medium. Thus income, occupation, age, and race count. So does sex: women know more about health, and men know more about science and public affairs. In public affairs, the best predictors of knowledge are education, exposure to television, and interest in political campaigns. In health, the best predictors are  education, print, and sex. In science, they are education, status in life, and print. If controlled, education can be used to stimulate a desire to know. The conclusions result from re-analysis of data collated between 1940 and 1967, in 35 national surveys. (GO)",

Production of the tape involved preparation of a script, choice of appropriate visual materials, preparation of a short pretest film and development of the full program. Although the tape was produced by faculty and production personnel, students were continuously involved at all levels. It was found necessary to formulate specific objectives in behavioral terms in the first phase of production. Student participation later in evaluation was considered highly important to the effectiveness of the finished product. Some tentative guidelines for  development of programed video instruction were developed pertaining to student audience, subject matter, and the learning atmosphere, as well as to construction of the student response sheet, concept presentation, and considerations of pacing. Because of the time and expense involved in such a production the researchers felt experienced personnel to be a necessity. A short bibliography and a sample student response sheet are included.

System integration could be accomplished by the processes of feedback, feedforward, and by the deliberate interrelating of subsystems and subordinating of the subsystems to the system objectives. As the system was installed and implemented, evaluation by monitoring and performance testing  could constantly oversee and test the operation of the system and the adequacy of the product.

Special attention is paid to the Puerto Rican Study, co-sponsored by the New York City Board of Education and the Fund for the Advancement of Education, that undertook to seek a sound basis for improving educational opportunities for non-English speaking children. A summary of the Study's final report is comprised of concise explanations of chapter contents. Eight recommendations for administrators and teachers responsible for these programs conclude the paper.  (AF)",

Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese can assist the new program by breaking out of the narrow academic community in which they have long been placed by supporting the new concept in their communities and by helping school systems develop and carry out the program.

The relationship between student unrest and the poor quality of education in American colleges has long been evident to educational researchers. The project underway is based on the assumption that since the curricular-instructional process works as a system, we cannot change only 1 element in the system in any substantial way and expect the change to &quot;take.&quot; Also, researchers don't understand what these interrelationships are or how they work and have not yet developed a language adequate for research. A new analytic language consisting of 3 structural and 3 implemental elements was  thus developed. Each structural element is formally planned by a faculty group and constitutes a set of potentials. Implemental elements are unplanned and consist of sets of conditions under which structural elements are realized. It is necessary to understand that beyond the colleges and universities are hundreds of &quot;supersystems&quot; of which the institution is a part and which affect individuals, groups and activities at the institution. Thus, if reform of the curriculum and the instructional process is to be intelligently sought and have any chance of lasting success, more needs to be known about the workings of the entire System.

        "description":"A taxonomy was devised for describing and classifying organizational characteristics that have set the pattern for the coordinating mechanisms in 41 states. The information assembled covers a period of years dating back to the beginnings of coordination in each state so that historic trends can be seen. The significant emerging trends are: (1) The number of states relying upon neither statutory nor voluntary organizations for interinstitutional cooperation markedly decreased, particularly during 1955-65 when demand for higher education showed its greatest growth and institutions became more complex. (2) The number of states relying upon voluntary associations to perform the coordinating function increased in 1960 but several were supplanted by other organizational forms  (statutory in every case). (3) The number of states creating various forms of statutory coordinating agencies, boards, or commissions markedly increased after 1960. In 22 states, there was no significant change in the pattern of coordination from 1945 to 1965. Among most of the remaining 28 states, however, the trends seem to indicate an evolutionary movement from no coordination, to voluntary coordination, to a form of public regulatory coordination.

        "description":"The need to identify the mode of integration of learning resources on contemporary US campuses grows as institutional expansion becomes a primary organizational concern. The implications drawn in this paper from the culture of the campus to the organization of learning resources is that many of these resources must be drastically decentralized around clusters of students and their interests rather than around the scholarly requirements of faculty and the dictates of administrative order. The internal diversity of US colleges varies from extremely monolithic in many small colleges, to extremely pluralistic in large universities and colleges, both in formal structure and student life outside the classroom. Many small colleges have fought to reduce the autonomy of extracurricular  activities and to make them serve the intellectual pursuits of the institution. But large, impersonal universities are still faced with the problem of clustering students with similar interests in order to encourage the intellectual stumulation and self-identity that contribute to a meaningful educational experience. Large campuses should cluster the classroom, cafeteria, library, and lounge into communities that are conveniently available to, reflect the interests of, and provide room for intellectual interaction between students. What really matters is the tone and autonomy of cocurricular student life and how it affects what is done in the classroom. (WM)",

        "description":"Because the phenomenon of delayed graduation--the practice of prolonging the college career beyond the normal 4 years of undergraduate study--is so widespread researchers speculated that &quot;continuers&quot; might have certain common characteristics which would differentiate them as a group from &quot;completers.&quot; The objective of this paper was to investigate characteristics differentiating completers and continuers which might account for the the ability of the former to complete school. A group of dropout students was included to identify characteristics differentiating continuers and dropouts which might account for the ability of continuers to return to school. Hypotheses to explain delayed graduation were derived from Erikson's (1958) psychological theory, in which adolescence is  conceptualized as a period of trying out, in reality or fantasy, a variety of social and occupational roles. Three scales of the Omnibus Personality Inventory administered to 10,000 high school graduates were selected and combined to form an operational measure of intellectual disposition. Evidence substantiated the thesis that the greater the degree of intellectual involvement a student manifests, the greater are his chances of successfully completing college within the conventional time limit. Hypothetical differences between the family climate of completers and continuers were also substantiated: continuers were less likely to perceive their parents as intellectual, energetic, ambitious, loving, or appreciative.

ACE's research data file is designed to incorporate the best features of a data base (descriptive information that will eventually become outmoded) and a data registry (information that is stored for future use). It will include longitudinal records on students, with special emphasis on student development,  and 4 categories of institutional data: finances and financial policies, curriculum, administrative policies and practices, and faculty. The research data file is designed to serve 3 basic functions: research, information, and training, and will possibly be used by other educational organizations and individuals as a research tool.

Data are presented which bear on the nature of citation counts and  the usefulness of these counts in evaluating the statistical evaluation of experimental groups. The control of these groups includes control of the academic fields in which individuals work and publish.

The pluralistic framework within which government support currently operates must expand as the demand for this support grows. Despite present stringency, there is reason to believe that the federal-university partnership in cultivating intellectual resources on the graduate level is a permanent one. Graduate schools could prepare for increased government involvement in the future by diversifying their resources through new forms of the existing partnership. In the field of science, this would involve university use of government laboratories, university-government cooperation in the  management and support of large research facilities, and interinstitutional programs that are funded by both government and universities. As the partnership develops to include growing support for the arts and the humanities, both parties will have increased responsibility to ensure university freedom from excessive government regulations. Graduate schools will be challenged to preserve the quality of education in the face of strained academic resources and increasing numbers of students. Universities should provide outlets for constructive contributions of activists, thus keeping themselves intact and enhancing the continued success of the partnership. (WM)",

These students gave some legitimacy to their activities by associating themselves with other students to exploit basic issues of widespread concern: the war in Vietnam, the selective service system, and racism in the US. The black students had their own genuine issues and were essentially uninfluenced by the white extremists, although the activities of both groups eventually converged. The dilemma faced by the university was either to capitulate or to use force. The situation was further complicated by faculty grievances and local criticisms of the university's relationship with its surrounding  community. The Columbia experience may have been different if responsible, effective communications existed within the university to compete with the unreliable student press and local media, thus making it difficult for a small minority to exploit the uninformed majority. Also, a body of faculty members representing several of the university's schools --and not several self-constituted faculty groups-- should have constituted the mechanism for decision making. Campus disorders may continue, but only the legitimate faculty bodies can decide to resolve differences by means of civility and reason, on which the survival of the university rests. (WM)",

The college professor is described as an individual who is low on economic motivation, is not survival oriented, and has high ethical standards and a strong need to communicate facts and ideas to others. In terms of college teaching as a motivated behavior, the professor is not stimulated by internal systems of basic biological drives and their derived drives for money and material gains. Competence appears to be an important motivational source. However, in the model described, the primary motivational system for entering and remaining in college teaching is called the central incentive system, which is powerful in initiation and maintaining  qualities, has little to do with survival, and is compatible to other motivational systems. Man can respond to this system by enjoying pleasure for pleasure's sake. In the case of a college professor, pleasure is derived from the maintenance and perpetration of scholarly, intellectual, and unproductive ideas. It is only within an academic community that this form of pleasure may be maintained. Students in their junior year who evince a motivation toward curiosity and the manipulation of ideas should be challenged with a central incentive. The ensuing interaction of the competence incentive system and the central incentive system will increase the quantity and quality of students entering the profession of college professor. (WM)",

This blueprint was developed by the Board to make room for increasing numbers of college students and to provide a rising level of educational quality by the most effective methods possible. The Board proposes that the higher education system of Texas be divided into 3 interrelated groups: a community junior college division, a division of senior colleges with program expansion possibilities through first-level graduate offerings, and a division of universities with program jurisdiction over graduate work at the doctoral level and post-baccalaureate professional education. Community junior colleges would provide  2 years of college training or a technical-occupational skill for all who wish to continue their education or improve their economic status. The 7 detailed recommendations presented for the senior colleges are based on projected enrollment increases up to 1980 and on the maintenance of quality education through careful program planning. Doubling of the current medical and dental school enrollments is suggested, to produce the manpower required for alleviating the state's critical shortage of physicians and dentists. Projected financial needs may approximate $404,200,000 annually for educational programs and $401,400,000 for facilities by 1975. (WM)",

The realization that this drop may have been caused by increased recruiting of Negro students by northern colleges and concern about the small number of black students at the graduate level led to the establishment of the Southern Teaching Internship Program in 1963, when 15 Woodrow Wilson fellows joined the staffs of Negro colleges as faculty members for 1 year. By 1968, over 250 interns had participated in the program. The hope that these interns would recruit more black Woodrow Wilson fellows has not yet materialized, but many students have been motivated to seek education beyond the bachelor's degree. For those interns who  continued their studies, the year provided a renewed sense of the importance of graduate training. Of 174 ex-interns surveyed, 34 hold the Ph.D, and 107 of the remaining 140 without the doctorate had returned to graduate school following their internship.

Their current moralistic protest concentrates on the Vietnam war and racism in the US. They are most dissatisfied with war-related university policies and administrative response to political pressures and not with the quality or relevance of their education in itself. On a world-wide basis, student activists are searching for new values that involve an identification with the process of social and personal change and emphasize openness, mobility, fluidity, and continuous self-transformation. They also feel that existing society is hypocritical, outmoded,  oppressive, unworthy of respect, in urgent need of reform, and suffering from symptoms of exhaustion. The problem in the US may be that society has exceeded its earlier goals and, lacking new goals, has become exhausted by its own success. With the loss of a moral imperative behind production, acquisition, materialism, and abundance, modern society does not inspire an implicit sense of allegiance, fidelity and moral respect in its most affluent, idealistic, and talented youth.

Future scientists should be instilled with a sense of responsibility to increase the understanding of science by the public at large, and to alert society to the perils brought about by scientific applications that are unfavorable to human welfare. Graduate departments should relate individual disciplines to other disciplines, to the needs of society, and to legal, moral, or other issues that are appropriate.

        "description":"Looking back at what has been happening ON university campuses since 1963, one may become concerned about what may happen TO the institutions involved. There is nothing immutable or sacrosanct about the way colleges and universities are organized and operated, but they must be able to resist pressures for changes that would threaten their integrity and distinction as centers of higher learning. The common theory that the university is a social microcosm is erroneous. It is a specialized community and should not be viewed as a stage for partisan politics or be expected to reflect the interests of each of its members. It is necessary to protect the university from becoming an agency for offsetting inadequacies that stem from other sources such as poverty, criminality, unemployment,  and urban blight, for while it provides distinctive functions in its services to society, it cannot be expected to direct its attention to all social problems. Neither can it survive as a battleground for organized disruptions, collective bargaining and other tactics, nor as a haven for escapist students and overly permissive young faculty. Where reform is needed, dialogue should replace negotiation between the parties concerned, for the traditional testing of ideas must not degenerate into a conflict which destroys academic freedom. If academic freedom is to be preserved, student duties must be considered along with student rights, and responsibilities kept in balance with privileges. (WM)",

        "description":"The problem with interdisciplinary policy research in the academic community is that it is often approached simultaneously but independently by each discipline involved. A solution to this problem could be the \"metadisciplinary\" approach. The \"meta\" coalition is based on the notion that a commonality of interests between individuals of differing disciplinary backgrounds, and a shared experience in solving problems, provides the research team with a necessary common language to communicate effectively and fruitfully. At the University of California, Berkeley, the Professional Schools' Program is attempting to increase the international sophistication of the schools by financing conferences, seminars, faculty and student research, mostly in developing countries. The program is  administered by a rotating committee representing the various professional schools, many of whom have had a commitment and some experience with the realities of development in low-income countries. The \"rotation\" and \"commitment\" characteristics of the commitee have prevented polarization around the interests of single individuals. The report discusses a number of \"metaprojects\" conducted abroad by alliances between faculty and students from several departments, projects underway, others planned, and the problems of financing for this innovative program, which is currently financed by a grant from the Ford Foundation.

Since participation in federal programs requires a commitment of institutional funds, the reduction or curtailment of federal support could result in financial disaster for such institutions. The project system, on which the federal government has relied to support good programs that were directed toward worthy national goals, now needs improvement. Congress should be persuaded to finance undergraduate institutions as institutions so that sustained support may be provided for higher education programs. Regional accrediting should be enhanced, and funds  provided --through an egalitarian formula approach-- to the most distinguished institutions as well as to those which meet only minimal standards. University needs for teaching assistants in undergraduate schools could be met through this formula support. The graduate fellowship program could be expanded, and all federal agencies could provide sustained support for basic research. The federal government should undertake virtually total support of medical education, and continue to provide funds for college housing, academic facilities, and undergraduate student aid. A prime goal of all federal programs must be to help institutions keep down the charges they must levy on students. (WM)",

The filing of these cases seems to suggest that judicial processes can be substituted for academic ones. Although many courts have recognized the distinctive nature of the academic community, the danger of shifting final decision making from campus to court remains. The great influx of public funds, the view of education as a social necessity, the strong egalitarian drive, the expansion of civil rights protection, the erosion of disciplinary supervision by home, school or college have made academic decisions vulnerable to judicial review. The university can benefit from measuring its private  rules against public canons of due process, but examination differs from actual substitution of the courts. By abandoning disciplinary responsibilities, the university may be sacrificing rights to make qualitative judgements about human talent and to protect academic freedom through institutional autonomy. To prevent judicial instrusions, the purposes and values of the academic community must be clearly defined and the forces of public interest, social criticism, concern for human quality and aspiration brought into balance. Members of the academic community must make the effort required to sustain it. (JS)",

The agonistic behavior system, which adapts to situations of social conflict, includes several patterns of conduct ranging from overt fighting to complete passivity. In view of the complex causes of and the multiple factors which influence aggression, and theory that postulates a simple solution to ALL problems of aggression is grossly inadequate. Our cultural ideals are not completely consistent with respect to aggression. On the one hand we express the religious and ethical ideal of peaceful and nonviolent behavior, and on the other we emphasize completition and conceive of every major activity in  our society as a fight. As long as these cultural ideals are maintained, problems of aggression will be inevitable. Unlike political institutions, which include a mechanism in their organization for making change possible, universities have been set up as autocratic, hierarchical systems that are based on the notion that he who controls finance eventually controls educational policy. This kind of organization, lacking a mechanism for peaceful social change, has caused college students and faculty to use agression as a tool for obtaining certain goals. A rational division of powers and functions within the university is necessary, as well as a new organization by which the system can be changed in some way other than by violent confrontation.

The knowledge explosion and growing demands of technological society, however, have made graduate and higher professional education necessary for increasing numbers of citizens. As a result, the nation is deprived of the services of these students for 2 more years and greater financial, social, and psychological burdens are created for the students and their parents. A program that would enable gifted youth to achieve their professional and vocational goals 2 years earlier is the 1-8-1-8 Plan being initiated by St. Louis University and 6 area high schools in September 1968. It allows students to save 1 year of the first 8 years and 1 year of the  second 8 while moving through the program with the same peer group. Students will be able to take regular college level courses in high school and receive as many as 25 college credits for them which are held in escrow by the University. They will thus be able to complete a BA within 3 years and proceed to graduate school, if they wish. Approximately 120 7th grade students will be chosen from public and private elementary schools for entrance into the participating high schools in September 1969. All of the students will be selected from the top quartile of the Scholastic Testing Service High School Placement Tests. This model can be adopted in any urban area where there is at least 1 strong university and 1 or more school systems willing to cooperate on an individual or system-wide  basis. (JS)",

Despite the large sums involved and the percentage increases, however, the states have not generally kept up with the increasing responsibilities placed on public higher education. While annual operating costs rise faster than enrollment, the rapid growth in enrollment has been a major contributor to the unprecedented financial and other demands faced by higher education. Also contributing to higher operating costs are: continuing inflation, rising faculty salaries, the knowledge explosion with its implications for curricula and staffing, and the flood of new costly but necessary apparatus and equipment.  The report covers only appropriations of state tax funds for operating expenses of institutions and does not include appropriations for buildings and other capital outlays. The appropriations include support for instructional programs, research (including agricultural and engineering experiment stations), and a great many public services, such as general extension, adult education programs, etc. The data are derived from the month-by-month and year-by-year operation of \"Grapevine,\" a small monthly newsletter circulated to key persons in each of the 50 states.

The most common formula relates faculty positions in some way to the number of students, but some do not recommend the appropriate numbers of necessary support personnel. Most salary requests are related to the regional or national academic market, but 1 board in a state with a high per capita income recommends &quot;target salaries&quot; that are based upon the midpoint between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; on the AAUP compensation scales plus fringe benefits at 8% of salary. Libraries are  being justified by boards that have adopted the Clapp-Jordan formula guidelines, which include faculty size, number of students, and the numbers and nature of fields of study at various levels of instruction. Formulas for maintenance are related to gross square or gross cubic footage. It is felt that unconnected formulas could be integrated through or replaced by a model that would simulate the total instructional program. This model would identify the allocation of resources as a total package rather than as separate units, and may be more appropriate for techniques of program budgeting than are formulas. (WM)",

The simulation materials used in the experiment were adapted from Clark C. Abt's &quot;An Education System Planning Game.&quot; During simulation sessions, faculty members assumed faculty  and administrator roles and proposed ways of implementing their participation in governance as suggested by lists of data that were developed for the sessions. Their revised proposal was submitted to an Ad Hoc Committee which developed a new decision-making body, the College Council, which replaced the former Administrative Council and provided for more representative involvement in decision-making by faculty, students, and administrators.

The first paper outlines the methods, dimensions, and benefits of studying student characteristics. The second paper traces the factors that led to the founding of the Student Information Record System project, its philosophy, potential, and applications for the transmission of student data. In the third paper, results are reported of a pilot study that explored the academic rehabilitation role of the community junior colleges in Florida. This study involved students who entered Florida State University as freshmen, experienced academic difficulties, transferred to  community colleges, and returned to FSU after attainment of the associate of arts degree. The fourth paper describes Florida Southern College's use of the College Level Examination Program in admission of upper level students. The next paper delineates technical problems of preparing computer printouts of survey data and describes the present and future use of such data. The sixth paper discusses the role of the recently founded Interinstitutional Research Council of the University of Florida. In the final paper, some of the methodological problems encountered by researchers studying the impact of colleges on students are reviewed and approaches suggested to this type of research. (JS)",

        "description":"American colleges and universities have long been deeply involved in research sponsored by the federal government. The total cost of such research, which is conducted primarily in the service of government missions, has been borne jointly by the government and the universities. In recent years, a growing concern with the costs of government-sponsored research has revealed some misunderstanding of the federally prescribed accounting procedures used to determine the extent to which institutions receive government reimbursement for the costs they incur in providing support for government-sponsored research. Recognizing that such misunderstanding ultimately could work to the detriment of both the government and the universities, the American Council on Education appointed an Ad Hoc  Committee on Indirect Costs to study variations among universities in the procedures they use to allocate the costs of research. The committee subsequently prepared this brochure in an effort to explain factors that are involved in the determination of the rates at which institutions are reimbursed by the government for the indirect costs of research.

        "description":"Charged with developing rigorous and exacting selection procedures, the professional schools at the University of California, Berkeley, must continually evaluate their programs and students. The aim of this study was to identify on the basis of past experience those factors which have been the best predictors of a student's ability to succeed in the master's program of the Graduate School of Business Administration (the MBA). Attainment of the degree was considered the primary indicator of success; grade point average (GPA) was considered only secondarily as a means of differentiating between groups of students equally likely to earn the degree. Application and performance data of all 432 students who entered the MBA program in Falls 1961, 1962 and 1963 were collected. Because  academic performance can be partially explained by a student's proficiency in English, citizenship designations were established. Age at admission appeared to be an important factor in determining the rates at which degrees were earned. Undergraduate GPA had little relationship to success in the MBA program although undergraduate academic recognition and extracurricular activities appeared relevant to later success. The Admission Test for Graduate Study in Business did not prove to be a significant tool in predicting success. Other significant variables are discussed and lists of the factors that encouraged and discouraged degree production are included. Tables illustrate the findings. (JS)",

Tables document: distribution of appointed faculty by rank, by college and by departments within the College of Arts and Sciences; hiring salary by rank and college; number of faculty in each rank by highest degree held; previous position by rank of appointed faculty; and a comparison of Nebraska's 1968 full time faculty appointments by rank with other universities. It was concluded that the University's ability to recruit senior faculty has improved somewhat, but it remains a significant problem  for many units. The University is apparently able to recruit highly qualified faculty at the lower ranks within its salary ranges, but it is still not competitive at the senior level. The implications of the data gathered for a possible strategy in future recruitment are discussed. (JS)",

This MA thesis examined the feasibility of developing computer simulation models of economic systems in higher education to assist decision makers in allocating resources. The report discusses: the relationship of the systems approach to the decision making process; the design of computer simulation models; and the development of a model consisting of mathematical equations and logical flow charts to depict an economic system in a university department. Since the model can be used to establish costs for programs in a department, it should become an integral part of a program budget analysis. Although the writing of a  computer program and validation of the model have yet to be accomplished, the project was successful in designing a significant administrative tool. (JS)",

        "description":"College populations may differ greatly, not only in terms of traditional academic variables such as high school grades and test performances, but also in terms of student interests, values, educational aspirations, occupational plans, and socio-economic background. The recognition of biographic variables as potential predictors of academic success in college led to the development of a 20-minute questionnaire, Survey of Educational Plans after High School, which was administered to over 7,500 high school seniors between 1966 and 1967 by the Washington Pre-College Testing Program (WPC). This paper, the first of 3 that will describe and analyze results of the questionnaire, deals with 1 biographic variable--the type of college a student plans to attend-- and relates it to WPC  aptitude and achievement variables. Twenty graphs compare cumulative percentage distributions of the overall high school GPA, the 6 high school subject GPAs, and 13 WPC Test scores for students electing to attend 3 kinds of institutions: 2-year colleges, 4-year state or private colleges, and state universities. On each of the 20 cognitive variables, students choosing universities ranked first as high achievers, those electing state and private colleges placed second, and those going to community colleges came third. In Tables 1 and 2, GPA and WPC Test scores differentiate between students who will attend each of the 3 types of institutions, and Table 3 lists WPC standard score means based on a 1968 high school standardization group.

        "description":"The claim that the US has the most diversified system of education stems primarily from the system's organizational variety and not from variety at the level of basic values. Institutions of higher education are now being challenged to extend their narrow regard for diversity into complex social realities and individual actions, and to enrich this new concept of diversity by combining existing organizational structures with a variety of fundamental values. In recognition of this challenge, a research project was conducted to determine how administrators, faculty, and students defined institutional character in the present climate of social and educational change. Findings reveal that the institutions are characterized by conformity at the level of basic values and institutional  goals, that diversity has been constricted and superficial rather than substantive. Current dissatisfaction with what is called the Standard (a unidimensional value orientation set by academic professionalism and expressed in superinstitutional conventional criteria of excellence) and other factors will eventually make more substantive diversity possible, such as changes in grading practices, classes, and institutional governance. The report presents case studies of 4 liberal arts colleges, 2 private and 2 state universities, with highlights of data from students, faculty, and administrators. These are followed by comparative institutional data on faculty, and general conclusions and implications for higher education. (WM)",

The study revealed more Negro than white female enrollments, a Negro drop-out rate nearly double that of whites, and more Negroes than whites in graduate and graduate professional programs. A majority of both student groups were Michigan residents, and more whites than Negroes were engaged in full-time study. Two-thirds of the Orientals, and 65% of the American Indians were male. Most of the Orientals were foreign students, 29.5% of the American Indians were non-residents of Michigan, 25% of both groups studied on a part-time basis, and a high proportion of both groups pursued graduate studies. These and  other findings have outlined the degree of minority group participation in higher education, a restricted program involvement of minority students enrolled in higher education institutions, their concentration in urban institutions, and their dependence on jobs or federal and local financial support. Recommendations, based on these areas of concern, propose steps that colleges and universities may take to increase the number of minority group students, and high school and college collaboration to identify, motivate, recruit, and help low-income minority students to further their education. Joint action by educational institutions and state agencies is also suggested for the development of a coordinated approach to equal educational opportunity problems in higher education. (WM)",

These institutions are situated at a great distance from adequate library facilities and need more experience in graduate instruction and research. This study was conducted to determine whether it was feasible to strengthen the institutions' graduate programs by orienting them around regional problems and topics, and by establishing centers of regional materials on each campus. There was strong administrative but little faculty support for such a project at 6 of the institutions. The Area  Research Center (ARC), which is adjacent to a state college in Wisconsin, began with a small collection of regional documents and, following gradual expansion, entered into an agreement with the State Historical Society for the exchange of documentary materials. ARC has stimulated faculty research on regional topics and the writing of 160 undergraduate and graduate research papers. It was concluded that: graduate programs among these state institutions could be strengthened; if the 6 most interested institutions established programs, others would follow suit; and a 3-year program should be established. If successful, this method could serve as a model in other parts of the US. (WM)",

Ten predictor and eight criterion variables were measured for all associate degree freshman classes at the college for the years 1959 through 1963. Total number of subjects was 328. Predictor data were collected from the Admissions and Counseling records of the subjects and criterion data were collected from the subjects' transcripts. Descriptive statistics were calculated and t-tests run comparing graduates with non-graduates. A series of regression problems were also run. Findings revealed that the best predictor of the percentage of a given class  who will graduate in six terms was the first-term GPA. The overall increase in mean GPA between first and sixth terms was attributed to the poor achievement and resultant dropping-out of non-graduates by the end of their freshman year. An optimum subset of four intellective variables for predicting three achievement criteria was determined by regression analyses. If entrance requirements are increased and instructional and grading practices remain the same, a higher proportion of entering freshmen should be graduated, while the probability is increased of rejecting applicants who would have graduated if admitted. Such problems must be faced under any selective system of admission and final decisions are dictated by school admissions philosophy. (RM)",

To get the right students and colleges together, an automated information system was considered. It led to the development of the College Suggestor, defined as a data retrieval device for use as a guide to college choice. The system used 1931 institutions and 213 characteristics (in 12 categories: location, size, control, prerequisites, admission information, costs, financial aid, program, student body, faculty, degree majors, occupational  programs), giving a total array of 460,000 information pieces and representing American higher education as of 1966. The characteristics were defined by a panel of experts (who included in their definitions opinions solicited from students and prospective students); descriptive data came from Office of Education files and from the colleges themselves. Combined use of computers, graphics, and printing made it possible to produce the device at low cost. Prototypes were manufactures in 1967 for controlled field trial in 1967-68.

He isolates five general characteristics of current literature: (1) there is a posture of defensiveness, (2) much of the literature focuses on means, rather than ends, (3) there is a belief that the junior college can do nearly all jobs of community education, (4) the question of junior college identity is still unresolved, and (5) the most definitive examinations of the junior college are  coming from writers outside the field. Cohen makes a plea for dialogue in depth and indicates significant issues in junior college education that deserve research.

        "description":"To gather information about the administrative relationship between the district office and the various campuses of a multi-institution junior college district, administrative officers in 21 districts were studied. In addition, opinions of 45 district chief executives and 75 institutional chief administrators representing 17 states were sought to determine the advantages and disadvantages of centralized and autonomous administrative structures. It was concluded that a system of shared authority, striking a balance between autonomy and centralization, was both prevalent and desirable. The multi-institution district and the variety of forces that have shaped its administrative structure are reviewed in detail, including the influences of the community, the secondary school, the  university (or multiuniversity), and business and industry. Case studies of five multi-institution districts provide a representative sample of organizational patterns and, in view of the findings of the whole study, guidelines common to the organization and development of any multi-institutional district are summarized in terms of appropriate functions of the central office and of individual campuses.

Criteria for &quot;success&quot; were any of the following: (1) transfer to another institution of higher education (regardless of performance there), (2) completion of 85 quarter hours in two years with a GPA of 1.75 or better, or (3) completion of 60 vocational credit hours with a GPA of 1.75 or better. The descriptive characteristics from 21 predictor variables provided a composite profile of a typical YVC student. The most outstanding findings were the percentage values for the &quot;success&quot; criteria: 9.2% transferred, 23.4%  completed 85 quarter hours, and 1.3% completed 60 vocational hours, leaving 66% of the full-time students classified as dropouts. In addition, sex, high school GPA, declared major, proximity to YVC, and father's occupation were found to differentially predict at the .05 level between groups, and father's and mother's education were of borderline significance.

Early prediction of success or dropout, in light of the great need for teachers, is important to avoid waste of time for both faculty and students. Marymount's 2-year elementary education curriculum is described. Its aim is to &quot;provide basic general education of students who plan to continue ... toward a degree in elementary education at a college offering teacher training. Courses have been planned so that those who desire to teach before completing their degree preparation will have the basic requirements.&quot; This study examined the  relation of intellectual ability, achievement in professional courses, avocational interests, and their presence or absence in candidates. The subjects were women registered for an A.A. degree in Education for the years 1958-59 to 1962-63; comparisons were made between 33 who did and 35 who did not continue at a 4-year institution. Using data from the scores of tests and profiles from both high school and Marymount, several correlations were made; their results are shown in tables. The primary conclusion was that the College Entrance Examination Board scores related substantially to the 4-semester scholastic index in junior college. Areas for further study are recommended.

The other model, Integrative Bargaining (or cooperative bargaining), emphasizes the necessity for participants to share in decision-making. The author reminds us that professional negotiations do not produce conflict; in fact, negotiation can function as an instrument for channeling and resolving  conflicts if the concept of shared authority is recognized. The author suggests that we are at a stage in faculty-administrator relationships similar to labor-management relations in the mid-30's.

        "description":"A self-renewing college is sensitive to the changing needs of each learner, its goals meet the learning expectations of students, its teachers translate these expectations into measurable teaching objectives, and it constantly revitalizes education. Present faults of general education include fragmented curricula, teacher orientation to national disciplines and transfer institutions, irrelevance to current society, and concern with abstractions. It should capitalize on the whole social and intellectual growth of adolescents, synthesize life experiences of adults, and allow students to help shape educational goals. Goodlad's concept synthesizes theory and practice, a point from which to examine curriculum and instruction problems. This paper analyzes general education curriculum  formation by tentative, untested hypotheses. The fact that learning opportunities stem from objectives helps to develop rational curricula. These must be judged from the ideological, societal, and institutional levels (related to teacher and learner), thus providing built-in self-renewal. Contrary to Goodlad's model, the selection of learning opportunities (shaped by the institution via the administration) presently precedes determination of learning objectives (formed by subject-matter concerns via the teacher). The important task of translating educational objectives into learning opportunities must be done by teacher and administration alike, so that &quot;continuous innovation, renewal, and rebirth can occur.&quot; (HH)",

In light of the large number of students taking economics in two-year colleges, it was recommended that an evaluation be made to see if two-year economics offerings are comparable to those in four-year institutions.

The purpose of the network was to provide researchers throughout the State with rapid access to major library collections. The program included a network of fifteen libraries or &quot;FACTS stations&quot;, seven of which had sending and receiving facilities and eight of which had receiving equipment. In order to qualify for FACTS service, patrons had to be at least 18 and the request had to be one of a &quot;serious and urgent nature&quot;, not exceeding 12 pages of facsimile copy. This study involved (1) a technical evaluation of facsimile transmission equipment and (2) an evaluation of the service merits of FACTS network. Information on the  operations of the program was gathered on data sheets (copy appended) maintained at the State Library for every request received, and interviews with staff at the FACTS stations. This report recommends that (1) the network be discontinued after March 31, 1968, and (2) State Library continue to give special attention to serious and urgent requests but within context of its NYSILL program. The report emphasizes that although it is recommended that FACTS be discontinued, the results of this experiment do not prove that a facsimile transmission network will never be feasible or desirable in the state.

It is concluded that because the regional offices have no control over local libraries the concept of a larger unit of service does not exist, and it is recommended that local libraries form themselves into systems. A statewide reference network is also recommended, with suggestions made for regional resource centers and subcenters, an information center at the Vermont State Library, and a reference coordinator at the University of Vermont. Proposals for the state level involve reorganization of the state library structure. Authority would be centralized in a commissioner, a librarian to whom  the chief of the proposed Bureau of Libraries and the State Librarian would report. Activities of the Bureau of Libraries would include centralized processing, interlibrary loans, consulting and the regional offices, while the State Library would serve as a legislative reference service, a bibliographic center and reference coordinator, and a college-university library liason. Appended is a proposed library law for Vermont. (Author/JB)",

The study was limited to an analysis of administrative and functional procedures and an investigation of the feasibility of centralized book processing. Sources of data were interviews with a sample of Vermont librarians and contacts with services for the handicapped. Recommendations for interlibrary cooperation include: a state-wide library network, a  streamlined system of interlibrary loan, computerization of the Union Catalog, changing the bookmobile program to a direct service unit, and eventual provision of a centralized book processing service. Suggestions for service to the handicapped emphasize a single local library agency serving both handicapped and non-handicapped readers and long-term plans for the Free Public Library Service to establish its own library for the handicapped. Cooperation among New England library systems is also proposed. Appendixes include survey questionnaires and responses. (Author/JB)",

Basic models for each of several important aspects are presented: (1) user behavior, emphasizing response to quality and delays in services; (2) the scheduling of services and the organization of the machine-readable files; and (3) the distribution of conventional library materials. Many of the variables in the model (e.g., user expectations of service time, delays involved in providing services, etc.) are random. An adaptive element is present in the form of admitting changes in user expectations in response to system changes. The need for frequent model change and the merging of component models into a comprehensive model for the entire system is established as the basis for use of a user-oriented  simulation language. Statistical facility beyond that supplied in the language used (GPSS/360) is required to achieve the goals of this and related investigations. (Author)",

A neural system model is presented in which a complex system is produced by connecting simple hypothetical neurons whose states change under application of a transformation rule at intervals determined by random time functions. Analogies of such a system to a library network are drawn. A word-concept model is described in terms of a master file of linked words and phrases with auxiliary files linked to the master. Applications of such a model for student exercises and for library-related and other research projects are discussed. Also discussed are models for library networks for three different  subsystems: the computer processing center, the role of the human actors, and the distribution of materials. Such models, though principally developed for library systems analysis, are useful for their formal properties as memory system components. (Author)",

The report discusses the nature of the communication which an indexer may require, such as the definition of a word, terms generic to a given term, synonyms of a term, abstracts of a document, etc. The video terminal must have the following capabilities: (1) to permit the user to make the above requests in a rapid, natural manner and send the appropriate code to the main computer; and (2) to receive the main  computer's response to any request and display it on the screen. The indexer should be able to work directly from the screen. Since the screen can display only a very limited number of characters, the video terminal must contain a set of instructions to allow the user to control what is visible on the screen.

The control groups received the usual preschool art and music activities. Tests were administered at the beginning of the program, at the end, and the next spring.

It has been suggested that learning is dependent on assertion and that distortion or inhibition of assertive behavior may restrict or distort the learning process. Fifty Head Start children were tested for the existence of assertive behavior by teacher and observer ratings, and that data was compared with the childrens' scores on the Stanford-Binet. An assertive behavior task, the Beller task, was also administered to the children. Comparison of the teacher and observer ratings resulted in a significantly high correlation. Both kinds of ratings were also correlated with the Beller task data, and the results indicated that the  latter was a valid measure of assertion. Of the 35 items on the Binet, the &quot;assertive&quot; children scored better on 29 items than the less assertive children, with significant differences occurring on eight of the 29.

        "description":"Head Start was conceived not only as an intervention program with children, but as a total effort of intervention in the disadvantaged family. Head Start seeks to influence the child not only directly through the classroom program, but indirectly through the parents. It is, therefore, important to determine if parent participation in Head Start modifies their attitudes and behavior in a way relevant to the positive development of their children. In order to ascertain if such a change takes place, Head Start parents were compared with non-Head Start parents as to educational and child rearing practices. The data was obtained by administering the Merrill-Palmer Head Start questionnaire to 103 Head Start parents and 77 non-Head Start parents. Both samples were Negro and comparable  on income level and family size. Very few behavior and attitudinal differences between the two groups of parents were found. Those few differences were meaningful only individually and did not follow any pattern. These findings fail to support the assumption that Head Start experience will change the parents and thereby influence the child. (WD)",

It was felt that such information would be useful to teachers and curriculum planners who wished to devise experiences for Head Start children based on defined areas of deprivation. Data was obtained from Head Start children and their mothers. These low and middle income mothers were administered the Social-System Interview, based on the open-systems theory. Only the variable of hierarchical order was investigated. Because of the small sample (45 children and 45 mothers) and the large error variances, no definite conclusions were reached  about the relationship between the mothers' attitudes and the performance of the children. It was found that the low income group was quite heterogeneous in attitude. (WD)",

The parents (251 women and 185 men) of Head Start children were asked whether or not they would punish their children for certain behavior; for example, lying, stealing, or hitting a sister. Eighteen situations were hypothesized in the questions. Parents were also asked how severe such punishment would be. The parents of this group of children were primarily Negro and primarily of the lower socioeconomic level. The data indicated that men of lower socioeconomic levels punished antisocial and annoying behavior more severely than middle level men. There was no such difference, however, in the men's punishment of behavior considered morally wrong by middle-class standards. The women were found to punish less severely, but  there were no clear differences in the types of punishment. (WD)",

The American data were obtained from 160 couples who lived in the Detroit area and who had a child under 6 years old. The Greek sample was 133 wives and 117 husbands, none of whom was a spouse of another member of the sample. These 250 adults were from Athens, Greece. The Detroit couples were asked if the husband, the wife, or both were responsible for the making of 14 specific decisions. The Greek subjects were asked whose opinion usually prevailed in eight decisional areas. Of the responses made by the Detroit couples, clear disagreement occurred between spouses in 55 percent; slight disagreement, in 21 percent;  and complete agreement, in only 24 percent. In comparing the responses of the Greek participants, significant differences in perspective were discovered between the men and women. The overall findings demonstrated the unreliability of generalizing the opinions of wives, which comprised a good deal of family survey data, to the husbands. A number of methodological procedures are suggested with a view to refining the study of familial decision-making. (WD)",

AT teaches the child to focus on observable attributes and to discriminate among them.

Pretraining scores on a battery of grouping tasks indicated that the previous year's training had had a lasting effect, at least in facilitating a more flexible approach to classification in the current year.

The children were grouped on the basis of age, 44 to 60 months, 61 to 71 months, and 72 to 78 months. The major hypothesis was that a high positive relationship existed between a young child's accuracy in predicting object locations when (1) the child was moved to various positions and (2) when another (in this case, a doll) was moved to various positions while  the child remained in the same position. This hypothesis was not supported, but the box task was much easier than the Piagetian task. The Piagetian finding that children below 7 years of age usually cannot take the viewpoint of another was corroborated in this study. (WD)",

It was hypothesized that the children's racial attitudes would be indirectly indicated by a finding that the children put negatively evaluated objects in the black box and positive objects in the white box.

From the beginning of the program through formal school, the participants are tested each year. These tests provide longitudinal data. Each group of participants is matched by a control group of children who receive no preschool program. The first experimental group started in 1962. Test results and teacher ratings of this first group over the succeeding years show that (1) no differences in measured intellectual growth between the experimental and control group has  endured by the third grade; (2) the experimental children have demonstrated superior academic achievement and social behavior; and (3) the experimental group can be divided into two groups, achievers and nonachievers.

The program and attention sessions occurred once a week for 25 minutes. The purpose of this study was to discover if kindergarten can facilitate later reading skill development and, specifically, if a perceptual training program increases the likelihood that children will succeed in learning to read. All the children in the study were pretested on a perceptual motor development test and posttested on a reading readiness test.  The study ran from September 1967 to May 1968. Children in group one scored higher than those in group two, who, in turn, scored higher than children in the control group. These differences, however, were not significant. Also, although chronological age was not found to correlate with reading readiness scores, the scores on the perceptual motor development test did correlate with the readiness scores. No performance differences were attributed to variations in teaching style or classroom. (WD)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to explore the ability of children (6 to 12 years of age) to understand certain relatively complex relationships as they are commonly signaled syntactically in our language. It was hypothesized that development in language performance during this age range was, in some measure, a function of a growing ability to comprehend the precise meaning of a variety of structural signals and to produce them in appropriate situations. Four such signals and the ability of 20 boys (ages 7, 9, and 11 years) to understand them were studied: (1) simple active-declarative utterances, (2) utterances involving complex logical relations, (3) special verb-indirect object relation utterances, and (4) utterances involving complex subject-verb-object relations. Little difficulty  was experienced by any age group with simple statements, affirmative conditionals, and embedded sentences. Limiting contingencies with \"although\" and \"but\" and negative conditionals with \"if\" and \"not\" were more difficult, with performance improving with age. \"Ask-tell\" combination utterances and negative conditionals with \"unless\" were very difficult, especially for the 7- and 9-year-olds.

The hypotheses were that the discrimination of recency (DR) improves with age, that broader separations of test items are easier to discriminate than narrower ones, and that length of the stimulus list influences DR. In experiment one, 76 children were given six test lists of pictorial stimuli. After each list was presented, the subject was shown two of the pictures again and asked to state which one he had seen more recently. The lists consisted of seven or 12 items; either two or four items separated the pictures in question. Experiment two was similar to the first but involved  52 children and increased the separation between items on the testing phase to four and seven. Experiment two was conducted because performances on the first were generally poor. The results from the two experiments showed that DR improved with age and that performance improved when shorter lists and wider separations were used. (WD)",

It sought to determine whether the preschoolers could learn to discriminate visually the critical elements of shape through a program of perceptual-motor training, transfer such knowledge to similar but different shapes, and then resist the process of forgetting the critical elements. The children were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group took part in a 14-session program designed to teach the critical elements of shape through perceptual-motor activity. The control group received indirect perceptual training through puzzles and matching games, none of which contained the shapes used in the experimental program. A pretest, a posttest, and a post-posttest, involving geometric line  drawings, were administered to the two groups. It was found that the experimental group did not perform significantly better than the control group on the posttest and post-posttest in copying the geometric figures used in the experimental program; and on the posttest, in copying criterion figures (figures not used in the experimental program). The experimental group, however, did better in copying the criterion figures on the post-posttest. (WD)",

A control group of 23 low scorers received no enrichment program. Parents of the experimental subjects were invited to visit the 2-hour sessions to observe the program and were subsequently given advice on how they could help their children at home. Prior to the summer program, the experimental group's mean score on the Metropolitan Readiness Test (Form R) was 54.2; for the control group, it was 58.8; and for the district kindergarten population, it was 77.5. After the program, in August 1967, the experimental group had raised its score to 73. In September 1967,  the experimental group scored 53.1 on Form A, and the control group scored 45.3. This difference was not significant. In May 1968, all first graders were administered the Stanford Achievement Test of Reading. The experimental children scored 30; the control children, 25; and the overall first grade population, 44. These differences were significant. It seemed that the Metropolitan Readiness Test successfully predicted which children would be low reading achievers, and it appeared that the summer program did aid the experimental children. (WD)",

It was hypothesized that (1) parents of dependent children would be rated higher on both the Type I and Type II variables than parents of competent children, (2) parents of competent children would be rated higher on the Type III variable than parents of dependent children, and (3)  discrepancy between child-rearing practices and child rearing philosophy would be more evident in parents of dependent children. Hypothesis (1) was supported by the data on fathers, but no significant differences were found between the mothers.

Members of the Rural Sociological Society were initially sent a questionnaire specifically developed to elicit the judgment of the members of the Society as to the importance of key sociological concepts for the work of the pastor in a rural community. The 10 most important concepts identified in this manner included: (1) norms and values; (2) community; (3) power structure; (4) community decision-making; (5) communication; (6) role; (7) socialization; (8) culture; (9)  interaction; and (10) status. On the basis of the concepts listed as of major importance by the rural sociologists, a questionnaire was developed to test the sociological sophistication of rural pastors. Sociological sophistication was in turn compared with 7 measures of pastoral performance. Findings of these comparisons supported the assertion that the relationship is positive between scores on the test of sociological sophistication and high pastoral performance. A final chapter of the study discusses the responsibility the theological seminary bears in training the ministry of the town and country church. (EV)",

Political pressure is applied from groups of local citizens and local chapters of national pressure groups. Many argue that the real locus of power affecting schools rests in the power structure of the community. The type of power structure may be related to such factors as size of the community and its past tradition of political involvement. Mass communications, transportation, and the increasing authority of the state have caused a shift in power away from rural domination. The small, rural school is characterized by a limited curriculum, conservative tax picture, conservative faculty and staff, and a student population homogeneous in background and values. Controversial areas in  which conflict would be likely are changes that would demand more money, changes in the curriculum that would deal with value-laden subjects, and consolidation which would involve loss of the local school. The literature suggests that the power structure decides economic issues independent of public debate but lets various community factions decide noneconomic issues. Change however, can come as a result of the will of the small, rural community to improve educational opportunities, a sophisticated understanding of the resources available from outside the community, and a sympathetic understanding of existing community values.

Schools fail to recognize the cultural richness of the student's bilingualism which can be made a positive force helping to retain personal identity and self-esteem. Possible solutions lie in the areas of teacher and administrator training, focusing on in-service curriculum, pre-service curriculum, recruitment and retention of teacher candidates, and scholarships and aid programs. By developing relevant curriculum and materials through redirecting available federal funds and through  the community and school working together, the problems of Mexican American students in an urban environment can be met.

To be poor is to suffer physically and to have high mortality rates. It also means ecological and social segregation from society. In 1960 Texas had a larger proportion of families with incomes under $3,000 annually (28.8%) than the nation as a whole (21.4%). Also, the incidence of poverty among Texas rural families was twice as high as for urban Texas. The groups with higher proportions of poverty in Texas were the aged, the non-whites, and the Spanish-speaking. In addition to differences between these groups and between the rural and urban populations, there were marked differences in poverty from one geographic region to another; such  variations should logically enter into deciding on how to allocate resources in combating poverty. Tables showing poverty figures by county in Texas are included. (RH)",

In the CA group there were slightly more females, age ranged from 12 to 19 with median age at 14, and better than half were in the 7th, 8th or 9th grades. This group showed a strong interest in learning more about their tribal language (mostly Chippewa), history, and culture. Attitudes about school, influences of teachers, relatives, and friends, and vocational and college preferences for both the CA and NCA groups were compared. The  conclusions included that: (1) a substantial number of students had positive orientation towards college and efforts should be made to recruit them; (2) courses at the universities should include Indian studies; and (3) because of the shortage of Indian teachers, more efforts should be made to communicate to Indian students the opportunities and potentialities of teaching as a career.

The instructional process was analyzed by observing and recording classroom behavior. All of the classrooms studied were found to be highly teacher-dominated with little student-initialed discussion. However, differences in teachers' attitudes and classroom approaches  were apparent at all grade levels and in all 3 areas. These included affective relations with students, directness in the classroom, and amount of empathy for Spanish-speaking students. The findings indicated that the 2 factors which profoundly affected teacher-student relationships in classrooms were the professional training of the teacher and the peculiar characteristics of the school's student body.

In addition to university furnished data, questionnaires were submitted to a stratified random sample of approximately 25% of the entire class. The final status of the entering class of 1963 as of mid-June 1968 was 46.9% dropouts from University College, 15.2% from degree colleges, 7.8% currently enrolled, and 30.1% graduated. It was found that high school grade-point average was related to length of stay at the University; that males and females performed substantially the same with reference to staying or dropping out of the University; and  that overall, the Spanish American group initially did not perform as well and had poorer grade-point average in University College. However, no noteworthy difference was found in grade-point between Spanish Americans and others during later semesters and the dropout rate was lower or about the same for Spanish Americans in every semester after the first. All recommendations indicated a greater need for official contact with students, whether enrolled, withdrawing, or under academic suspension. A copy of the questionnaire appears in the appendix.

Simulated words were employed in the text, and use of context clues was checked through multiple choice responses. Sex, age, IQ, and academic ranks and scores were used as premeasures. Results led to the conclusion that verbal reasoning was the best predictor of success in using context clues. In the second study, a two-form data-gathering instrument, using discriminating items from the first, was administered to 52 Madison, Wisconsim, eighth-grade  students. In this phase, ability to use context clues was positively and significantly correlated with IQ and with vocabulary and comprehension scores. General conclusions support those of earlier studies. General intelligence, verbal abilities, reading vocabulary, and comprehension ability appear to be closely related to the ability to use context clues in reading.

A delayed retention test indicated that these learning effects may be relatively stable over time. Even stimuli which are not the targets of search can be influenced by searching if they are encountered repetitively during the search.

        "description":"The relationship between reading ability and recognition of four kinds of perceptual stimuli for purposes of reading disability diagnosis was investigated. The sample consisted of 84 male grade-3 pupils who were matched on intellectual ability but who differed in reading proficiency. Three groups, based on a 6-month discrepancy either above or below grade placement between reading achievement and potential as determined by the Bond-Tinker formula, were formed. Recognition tasks were presented by tachistoscope. The four perceptual categories were (1) geometric or abstract configuration, (2) pictorial design, (3) alphabetic symbol, and (4) word unit. Geometric forms, alphabetic symbols, and word units were found to significantly differentiate (.01) between able and disabled  readers. Alphabetic symbols appeared to be a slightly higher predictor than the other two forms. Implications were that present readiness materials stressing discrimination of pictorial and abstract forms are less effective in predicting reading proficiency than are forms actually involved in the reading act, namely letters and word units.

The subjects were presented a series of slides involving the paired association of 9 three-letter nonsense syllables (Glaze List) with 36 single words or pictures representing three types of concepts. A two-way analysis of variance of mean errors failed to replicate the previous finding of an interaction between learner cognitive style and concept class for either stimulus condition.

Data were obtained by testing 218 first graders from three elementary schools with the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception, the Gates Reading Readiness Test, the Metropolitan Readiness Test, the Olson Reading Readiness Tests, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The product moment method was used to compute the intercorrelations among the 35 variables. After an examination of the loading of the subtest variables, four large common factors, listed in order of increasing correlation with the factor best representing reading achievement, could be ordered as follows: (1) perceptual organization, (2) auditory-visual discrimination,  (3) verbal association, and (4) verbal comprehension. Both a horizontal and a vertical plane were developed in this model. It is suggested that the order of the skills on the vertical plane would also develop horizontally and might or might not contribute to the achievement level of a higher order dependent upon the type of achievement measured. Questions for further investigation are posed, and references are included. (CM)",

A discussion of the construction, format, and revision of these group prototypic assessment exercises measuring word attack, comprehension, and study skills is presented, and it is noted that information from the exercises provides  a basis for appropriate choices of instructional approaches and of materials for each student.

The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) was administered in September, January (when roles changed from student to intern), and May. Analysis of MTAI scores for 52 subjects revealed a significant gain in scores (i.e., in tolerance and child-centeredness) after completion of the academic program and a significant decrease in scores after internship. Tentative support was found for the  hypothesis that there is more variability in the direction and amount of change during internship than during the academic program. When MTAI scores were correlated with intern ratings made by the program director of the amount of difficulty and frustration each intern experienced, the latter were found to be significantly associated with a decrease in MTAI scores. Any hypothesized relationship between internship in an inner-city school and a decrease in score approached significance. Variables and hypotheses suggested by this investigation need to be explored.

Large samples of youths and youth leaders were interviewed. Among the variables studies were recruitment, programming,  resignation, leadership, and attitudes toward national service. Special attention was given to efforts to reach the poor and immigrants. It was found that the overwhelming mood of Israeli youth is not alienation but identification with their country's past, its complex present, and its need for development. The organizations designed to reinforce these attitudes rely more on cooperation than on adult direction. Their peer-group oriented programs, emphasizing individual self-development and national service, provide adolescents with opportunities to acquire status.

        "description":"Although the evaluation of innovations in teacher training is often dependent on observational data, the problem of the reliability of the observations collected by a team of observers has often been treated in a superficial manner, partially because of the difficulties of maintaining an observer team intact over an extended period of time and of being permitted to observe each teacher a number of times. An analysis of variance model has been developed which permits the calculation of an overall reliability coefficient and the partitioning of the sources of variation for the typical observer team situation in which the team visits a number of different teachers only once and where the team does not necessarily contain the same members for all visits. The paradigm is developed for  the situations in which there are &quot;n&quot; observations per item per observer as well as when there is only one observation per item per observer. The model has been tested using data based on the School University Teacher Education Center (SUTEC) observation schedule which is designed to investigate seven aspects of classroom behavior. Since the proposed model permitted the partitioning of the variance associated with the component parts of the schedule, it may provide useful as a test of the homogeneity of the items in an observation schedule as well as for reliability calculations.

Separate  sections on each test type in volume 3 are calculated to train the teacher in diagnosing student achievement. The remaining three volumes develop the teacher's proficiency in planning prescriptions on the basis of his continuing analysis of test results and classroom observations provided in five simulated case studies (one in the form of an audio disc).

Data analyses indicated that the mature women (mean age 40) exhibited more academic ability, better personal adjustment, and greater teaching ability than two groups of younger women teachers (mean age 22). Relative to a random sample of younger women teachers, mature teachers were characterized by higher cumulative and education course grade point averages (GPA), and higher American College Entrance Examination (ACE) scores. Relative to both a random group and a GPA-matched group of younger teachers, mature teachers achieved more  favorable Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores, were rated more favorably by college faculty and teaching supervisors, and were viewed as highly effective teachers by the principals employing them. However, many evaluations by teaching supervisors were negatively correlated with principals' ratings of mature teachers, indicating the need for a more accurate method for the assessment and prediction of teacher effectiveness. Further research should be conducted to determine whether these findings can be generalized. (A 16-item reference list is included.) (Author/SM)",

The teacher trainee can be introduced to the criteria of various skills through videotaped models, which can be followed by microteaching.

A performance curriculum is also helpful for trainee should also be encouraged to become a professional decisionmaker, deciding--while working towards competence in the skills--when to use them in his classroom.

        "description":"Many of the concerns of teacher education programs over the transition of students into teachers may be examined through the perspective of teacher education as a social system. A model of teacher education has been developed which identifies two dimensions of the social system: an institutional dimension, consisting of roles and the expectations associated with them; and an individual dimension, consisting of personality defined by need-dispositions. The model further identifies three roles through which a teacher passes before assuming the fourth role of experienced teacher. These are the roles of student, preservice teacher, and beginning teacher. Each role is placed within a time period, and each time period includes a sequenced transitional period from one role to the next.  The heuristic value of the model may be determined by teacher education programs as they identify and describe role-expectations and need-dispositions in relation to time periods and transition periods. The relationship between dimensions and teacher behavior provides indicators of program success in the form of satisfaction, effectiveness, and efficiency. In these ways the model provides teacher education with a tool that may have significance in the preparation of teachers. (Author)",

The trainees, who served as secondary school principal and administrative assistant to the superintendent, were involved in such duties as selecting instructional staff, budget development, scheduling, planning and conducting a preschool  inservice workshop, conducting meetings with community leaders, and developing job descriptions. Other activities are also part of the cooperative project (1) college staff members conduct inservice workshops for elementary and secondary faculty members and work directly with classroom teachers and pupils, (2) undergraduate students in elementary education serve as parttime aides in elementary classrooms, and (3) students enrolled in graduate courses obtain experience in the school system. (Included is background information on the city of Crawford and the school district; publicity releases; and notes on project development, personnel, budget, and evaluation.

Subjects (teachers in nine elementary schools in Tennessee) audiotaped three 20-minute lessons in either mathematics or social studies each week of the 18-week study. The instructional treatment, a one-hour faculty meeting each week, began in the fourth week: three schools received the self-instructional program, three the program augmented with telelecture presentations by a college instructor, and three served as controls. Audio tapes produced by 90 teachers (randomly selected--five taping mathematics lessons and five taping social studies lessons from each school) were collected and rated by a trained staff. Eight Flanders quantitative  indexes plus scores on an interaction analysis achievement test served as dependent variables. Results indicated that participants had acquired at least an elementary knowledge of interaction analysis, but differences between instructional modes were not observed. No evidence indicated that the instructional treatments promoted greater teacher indirect influence or student involvement. A postinstruction questionnaire measuring teacher reaction to the project revealed diversity of opinion.

Measurements were made in the late spring using 69 teachers and their fifth and sixth grade classes from a four-state area. Teacher awareness was measured by correlating teacher rank-order ratings with pupil sociometric ratings of pupils' popularity, arithmetic ability, and psychomotor ability. Cognitive complexity was measured using the Kelly Reptest, and cognitive differentiation was measured using a form of the Witkin Embedded Figures Test (EFT). A modification of the Halpin Leader  Behavior Description Questionnaire was used to measure pupil esteem of the teacher. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported but hypothesis 1 was not supported. Low correlations between cognitive complexity and cognitive differentiation suggest that research is needed in that area. Data indicated that teacher cognitive complexity is related to pupil esteem but that cognitive differentiation is not.

The teacher can deal with students at differing levels of cognitive maturity by planning classroom activities on a lower level (since a student can function on any level below the highest achieved); however, the student should be exposed to higher forms of cognition to encourage cognitive growth. To determine those  behaviors necessary for planning and assessing imagery in the classroom, a Taxonomy of Image Provoking Teacher Behavior with behaviors appropriate to each cognitive level was created along with a classroom observation instrument (the Taxonomy of Image Provocation Profile) which was formulated from the taxonomy. This instrument provides a qualitative and quantitative measure of a specific area of teacher behavior and suggests many areas of research possibilities. At West Virginia University the TIP Profile has been used as a behavior guide and for self-evaluation by preservice teachers as well as an instrument of objective analysis of teacher behavior. (SM)",

        "description":"This investigation was conducted to determine the construct validity of the Teaching Situation Reaction Test (TSRT), which is used to assess preservice education students' reactions to teaching situations. (The testee responds by ranking four answers or options provided for each question regarding the situation.) Specifically, the study investigated relationships between the TSRT (including separate correlations for subscales and option rankings) and six personality traits (objectivity, sociability, control, confidence, reflectiveness, and empathy) identified with the TSRT and measured by six selected tests. Each student in the sample completed all six tests and the TSRT. Factor analysis and correlation of data revealed that the TSRT is related to objectivity, control,  confidence, and empathy; that some TSRT factors (subscales) are related to all the traits except confidence; that there is a consistent relationship between option rankings of TSRT items and control; and that females have more relationship with empathy and less with control (the reverse is true for males). Implications of the study include the possibility of developing personality profiles of reactions to situations posed in the TSRT and of using the TSRT to assess preservice courses and to determine areas of teacher performance which could be developed in preservice courses. Further research is needed to improve the TSRT as a research tool for preservice education. (LP)",

        "description":"Two experiments were performed to investigate how a stimulus (a film with scenes either in or out of order) in combination with a task (recalling facts or generating hypotheses about the film) affect whether or not a person responds to the stimulus with more than one discrete answer or thought (subjective response uncertainty). Specifically, this stimulus-task interaction was studied as it aroused either relevant uncertainty (thoughts about the stimulus related to the task) or irrelevant uncertainty (thoughts about the stimulus unrelated to the task because of something confusing or distracting in the stimulus). Both experiments, in which subjects (teacher-trainees and college freshmen) were randomly assigned to conditions determined by a factorial design of one or two films and  the two film structures and tasks mentioned above, were used to test the hypothesis that relevant uncertainty (and, consequently, information search) would be maximized when the stimulus suggested many responses of the kind required by the task. Support for the hypothesis was found in that subjects generated significantly more hypotheses for unstructured films than for structured films (because a randomized order of scenes suggests more hypotheses) and recalled significantly more facts for one of the structured films (because the latter offer an associative basis for memory and do not divert attention from the task). The stimulus-task interaction paradigm needs to be expanded to examine problem-solving tasks and related questions, such as how problem solvers learn to generate relevant  uncertainty in situations &quot;designed&quot; to arouse irrelevant uncertainty.

Two teaching abilities, interaction skills and planning or design skills, are necessary for the teacher to manipulate both environments effectively; however, training in interaction toward the development of instructional skills alone is emphasized in most teacher education programs. There has been some training in design skills, such as specifying behavioral objectives for the instructional environment, but teacher education programs should further include training in classifying instructional principles for each specified behavioral objective for both environments, a procedure which can be  systematized into selection, comparison, and modification. Experimental instructional design and interpersonal interaction training programs were implemented at Stanford and Brigham Young universities with favorable results; however, to attain each skill at an adequate level often takes more time than is available. A horizontal plan of staff differentiation utilizing a team of teachers, each trained for and specializing in one teaching ability, would eliminate problems caused by possible inadequacies of an &quot;all-purpose&quot; teacher.

        "description":"To examine the relationship between a teacher's critical thinking ability and his classroom verbal behavior and perception of teaching purposes, 39 teachers first completed the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal. The 10 highest and 10 lowest scorers were then observed and videotaped in their classrooms during three one-half hour periods, and their transcribed verbal behaviors were classified according to amount of student support and type of thought process (routine, cognitive memory, and convergent, evaluative, or divergent thinking). Finally, the 20 participants completed 10 questions about their teaching purposes and learning goals. Analysis of data revealed that teachers who had scored highly in critical thinking made a significantly greater number of comments in the  categories of convergent, evaluative, and divergent thinking, and in support of students than did teachers with low critical ability; their stated purposes and goals were also more manifest in the classroom and were both academically oriented and student-centered. If training students in critical thinking is the central purpose of schools (and research indicates that critical thinking ability can be taught), then teachers need to be trained as models of such thinking during their own preservice or inservice education.

The Survey measures changes the participant foresees in his own classroom, types of favored reading instruction, and reactions to the sensitivity training and experiences (such as working with children) of the program. Although the data was not collected scientifically, it was felt that the experience of the team (who would be available for curriculum assistance during the coming year) in specifying objectives and the data to be collected and in developing measurement instruments would be useful in later program evaluations.

Although this emphasis upon personal interpretation may prevent drama from fitting neatly into the traditional definition of English as \"an intellectual discipline whose end is literacy and the intelligent acquisition of certain appreciative skills,\" dramatic activities can be of great value in helping a child develop his personality and come to terms with reality. Beginning with unscripted improvisation,  students can progress to productions of Brecht, Ibsen, Shakespeare, or Chekhov.

Although statistical tests were not performed on the data to determine significance, an examination of course grades, the supervisory comments, and self-evaluations indicated that video-taping techniques did help students perform slightly better in student teaching. In a second part of the study, three college professors were video-taped presenting a model demonstration  in teaching certain concepts. The use of the tapes for adaptation to secondary school English classrooms and for discussion purposes in the methods class indicated that even though the tape utilizing a professor as a teacher model has been used with some success in methods classes, the general principle of adapting college teaching techniques and approaches for use in secondary classrooms is not advised.

Studies to determine whether or not the special teaching of phonetics would improve students' spelling achievements have shown less agreement, but nine out of 15 studies found improvement in spelling achievement. The researchers who reported their procedural techniques emphasized simplified spelling, derivatives, or activities centered \"round teaching speech sounds in parts of words and discrimination of phonetic elements. To test whether a modified use of such techniques would improve spelling, students were given a phonetics lesson instead of the  regular Wednesday spelling test for one semester. Results indicated that middle-grade pupils in this experimental program made somewhat greater spelling gains than did matched groups in the customary program. (LH)",

        "description":"Individualized reading is important to students in both elementary and secondary grades because it provides opportunities for them to find pleasure in reading, to internalize reading skills, to develop the reading habit, and to mature in book choices. Such programs are not intended to teach reading skills, but, if initiated at the elementary level, they can engender a love of reading that can last a lifetime. To encourage students' reading in elementary grades, teachers can read selections aloud, play records, prepare bulletin boards and displays, and read with the students. A classroom period used exclusively for personal reading should be reserved, and the rights to silence and free choice of reading materials should be respected. Records on reading progress can be kept in a  way that discourages competition. Secondary students at all levels of achievement also need special time blocks for personal reading. Both the quantity and the quality of their reading can be evaluated, and students can be asked to submit book-critique cards and discuss books with the teacher. Student reaction to the individualized reading program at Keokuk High School, Iowa, was favorable. (A list of 952 books read at University High School, Iowa City, Iowa, is appended, with popularity and reading levels indicated for each book.) (See also ED 021 858.) (LH)",

Identified largely by subjective means, the students attended a required special summer orientation program but, once admitted, they became an integral part of the student body, receiving no special treatment as a group. The first-year attrition rate proved high, but the number of dropouts decreased as selection techniques improved and as faculty and students matured in dealing with the special problems of the program. Tasks not yet  completed in the program include (1) incorporating in the reading program material of literary distinction that relates to students with ghetto backgrounds, (2) deciding on the meaning and importance of grades for \"intellectually gifted\" secondary students, and (3) developing techniques for giving needed supplementary help to special students without setting them apart.

In addition to these regular assignments, audiovisual materials--recordings of choral, operatic, spiritual, and popular music; dramatic readings; slides; paintings; and political cartoons--helped relate the Bible to contemporary experience.

Each student in a two-term composition course purchased one tape cartridge which he submitted with each theme. While correcting the theme, the instructor recorded comments on the student's tape. The student could then listen to criticism of his paper as frequently as he wished by using the tape recorders in the library. Most students appreciated the more thorough analysis that this system afforded, although a few objected to the inconvenience of borrowing a library recorder or the inability to refer quickly to a written comment. Most of the composition instructors reacted favorably to the use of the recorder and felt that  speaking directly to the student was more satisfactory, and personal, than writing comments on themes.

Questionnaires were also sent to 135 experienced English teachers selected at random from the membership listing of the Illinois Association of Teachers of English. The questionnaires asked the teachers to indicate their use of various approaches to specific grammar teaching problems. These approaches represented the typical  viewpoints of traditional, structural, and transformational grammars. In another questionnaire, the Roosevelt University graduates were asked to evaluate their own competence as language teachers. Results of the first questionnaire showed that teachers with linguistic training could make informed choices among the various grammars in response to each problem; those with little training were limited to traditional grammar. The second questionnaire indicated that teachers who had taken linguistics felt more competent as language teachers than those who had not. (Author/LH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the personal and academic qualifications essential for successfully teaching high school English to slow learners, and attempted to outline a curriculum that would foster the traits found desirable. Information was gathered from (1) extensive reading by the investigator, (2) questionnaires completed by 475 school administrators, (3) questionnaires completed by 451 successful teachers of slow learners, and (4) two workshops conducted at Olivet Nazarene College (Kankakee, Illinois). The administrators indicated strongly that the individual teacher's personality, professional or religious commitment, and philosophy of life directly affected successful teaching of the slow learner. The teachers surveyed found themselves very poorly prepared in sociology,  anthropology, social welfare, psychology, and the cultural and behavioral patterns of the slow learner; and somewhat deficient in training in language, composition, reading instruction, adolescent literature, and methods of teaching English. The principal value of the study was in revealing the need for teacher-training courses to improve the instruction and understanding of slow learners.

        "description":"This ISCPET study set out to determine the effect that various approaches to teaching literature to prospective high school English teachers might have on their literary knowledge and later teaching competencies. The curricular patterns used to teach literature at three colleges--survey approach (University of Illinois), author and historical period approach (Bradley University), and genre approach (North Central College)--were compared with the teaching competencies of a group of first-year graduates, from each of the schools, who were teaching secondary school literature. No definitive statistical evidence was produced to indicate that any one of the three approaches was superior in conveying literary knowledge. Some significant statistical support was found, however, for the  contention that, for developing teaching competencies as judged by secondary school department chairmen and critic teachers, a genre approach to teaching literature proved more effective in preparing students to teach literature than did the historical period or survey approaches.

        "description":"This study at Northwestern University (Illinois) was concerned with the production and use of video taped materials in teacher training programs. Using a portable, one-half inch video tape unit, the investigators prepared 26 tapes (30 to 40 minutes each) covering many aspects of English teaching (K-12). Thirteen of the tapes were classroom demonstrations and 13 were lectures or lecture-discussions. In video taping the material, several problems--e.g., picture detail, microphone mixing--were encountered, and techniques that seemed useful for increasing the interest level and pedagogical level of &quot;home made&quot; video taped materials were developed. These tapes were shown in a variety of undergraduate and graduate English education courses, in several in-service University courses, in  training courses given by local school personnel, and in parent-teacher meetings. No attempt was made to evaluate the effectiveness of video taped materials as an in-service change agent. (Appended to this report is an annotated bibliography of the 26 video tapes, which will be available through the Northwestern University English Curriculum Study and Dissemination Center.)

        "description":"A project to develop a sequential and cumulative social studies curriculum for able students in grades 9-12 was carried out by Carnegie-Mellon University in partnership with the Pittsburgh Public Schools. The general goal of the curriculum--to help each student develop to the limit of his ability into an independent thinker and an informed, responsible citizen--was divided into four subgroups: attitudes, values, inquiry skills, and knowledge. The courses prepared were \"Comparative Political Systems and Comparative Economic Systems\" (9th grade), \"The Shaping of Western Society and Studies of the non-Western World\" (10th grade), \"The American Experience\" (11th grade), and \"An Introduction to the Behavioral Sciences and the Humanities in Three Cities: Ancient Athens, Renaissance  Florence, and Modern New York\" (12th grade). A book of readings, an audiovisual kit, a teacher's manual, and an examination program were developed for each course. Two books and 12 films were completed to explain, to teachers, the curriculum and methods of using it. The results from testing the curriculum in the Pittsburgh Public Schools indicated that students in experimental-curriculum classes made significantly greater gains than did those in control classes.
