Problems also investigated included transfer of this skill to the student teaching experience, and the relationship of selected personality factors (intelligence, sex, educational set, and personality type) to the development of this questioning skill. The study extended over three quarters and involved 42 preservice secondary teachers randomly assigned to four groups. Lessons observed were audiotaped and videotaped for analysis by three judges and the investigator. Resulting data were subjected to parametric statistical analyses with a .10 level of significance for hypotheses acceptance or rejection.  Questioning appeared to be a skill that could be developed through instruction and practice. The development of questioning skill did not appear to be limited by intelligence, sex, personality type, or educational set. Part 2, included as a separate document, was used by the participants during the instructional procedure of the study. It provides information about questions and questioning techniques for stimulating good class discussions and critical thinking. (PR)",

These factors included student attitudes toward mathematics, student reports of their parents' attitudes toward mathematics, and socio-economic status of the students' families. Each of these factors was correlated with the others and with mathematical achievement. The sample for the study included 150 students selected randomly from the total population of students enrolled in mathematics courses at one junior high school. The questionnaire administered to the students utilized a modified version of the Dutton attitude scale, the Duncan extension of the National Opinion Research Center scales of occupational status, and a  short scale designed to measure student reports of their parents' attitudes toward mathematics. The measure of mathematical achievement was the mean of four grade point averages from six-week grading periods and a mid-year examination score. Responses were analyzed for the total group, for subgroups divided by sex, for the total parent group, and for parent subgroups divided by sex. From the analysis it was concluded that student attitudes toward mathematics are directly related to their reports of their parents' attitudes toward mathematics and that student achievement in mathematics is directly related to student attitudes toward mathematics.

        "description":"The development of a set of social indicators with which to assess interregional differences in the quality of life in the United States is the goal of this report. Prompted by the observation that there are increasing signs of discontent with the continued use of traditional measures of economic, political, and social progress-per capita income and gross national product-Mr. Wilson states the national income and product accounts were not conceptually designed to measure changes in our total socio-economic environment. For these reasons it is imperative the new frontier of social indicators be explored. The concept of social indicators as aggregate or representative welfare measures is presented and the procedure for developing them is reviewed. States are selected as the  geographical unit of analysis and the general areas of social concern for which social indicators were developed follows recommendations of the Commission on National Goals (1960): individual status, individual equality, state and local government, education, economic growth, technological change, agriculture, living conditions, and health and welfare. Problems of weighting the statistics are discussed together with evaluation of the data. Education and equality of racial opportunity are analyzed at length with numerous tables showing relevant statistics. References are included. (BL)",

Designed for fifth grade students and teachers in Northshore School District, Bothell, Washington, it emphasizes learning activities for use in the outdoors. General understandings relevant to the objectives of the program form the frame into which the activities are placed. Most activities are appropriate for use in school or community locales and can serve as preparation for experiences at a campsite. Section I enumerates items to consider in preparing the student for a camping/outdoor education situation. Remaining sections deal with study units in geology, history and social studies, survival and simple outdoor navigation, saltwater ecology, and plants and animals above the tidal  zone. Individual units present several general understandings each with specialized background information and suggested activities. Student worksheets, diagrams, vocabulary lists, reference lists, and teaching aids complete the guide. (BL)",

The elementary school mathematics curriculum is discussed in terms of selection of content, educational objectives and content arrangement. Within the realm of mathematics learning, discovery learning, the use of manipulative materials, student attitudes, the use of practical applications, and the need for real understanding in mathematics are examined. The author discusses the organization of classes and pupils for instruction. In this area he examines grouping practices for gifted and remedial students both within classes and school-wide as well as the usage of mathematics specialists in the classroom. Finally, specific questions regarding  teaching practices are considered including computer-assisted instruction (CAI), programmed learning, and the effects of the \"new mathematics\" programs.

There were significant improvements in students' ability to observe, compare, classify, quantify, measure, experiment and infer during the period of the course, but not in the ability predict. It appeared that there was a relationship between intelligence and process skills such that more intelligent groups at the eighth grade level are further down a continuum of difficulty from observing to experimenting at the onset of instruction. Consequently, classes  with students having lower ability levels showed the most change in process learning during IPS instruction. (Author/AL)",

The most important problems for all groups are deficiencies in verbal and written English, mathematics, general science, and intellectual background. Such students typically lack self confidence, and many expect to fail in college. Obstacles to higher education include college selection procedures, competitive pressures, faculty attitudes, teaching styles, and examinations and grading practices. Suggestions for minimizing these disadvantages include the use of clearly stated behavioral objectives, the use of supportive remedial programs in English and mathematics, and the  use of broader liberal education programs. Descriptions of innovative chemistry instruction for underprepared students in ten colleges are summarized in the report. Five specific recommendations summarizing the conclusions reached are appended. (AL)",

Ease of grading was considered as the discrepancy between students' mean concurrent grades in non-science courses and the science course, averaged across students of each teacher. The teacher was the major source of variance in ease of grading. The teacher's grading index is relatively stable between years female chemistry students were penalized almost half a grade compared to their other subjects. Other groups were penalized less, with almost no discrepancy for male biology students. When teachers were the analysis unit,  there was a positive correlation between ease of biology grading and chemistry nrollment for both sexes, but there were no significant relationships in the chemistry-physics transition. When schools were the analysis unit, ease of grading in chemistry was related to physics enrollments for females. The interpretation that grading practices are causally related to enrollment is favored, although alternate possible explanations are discussed. Some suggestions for refining the model are made.

It is not recommended that the traditional programs be abolished, but that no one program or combination of any two should be allowed to dominate the educational scene. Problem-oriented courses dealing with the physical, biological, and  social environment should be given high priority. (PR)",

Data was obtained from responses to a questionnaire distributed to some 100 teachers and administrators from 20 districts enrolled in two courses, fall 1968. In no school or district did a percentage of black or other minority students constitute an appreciable proportion of the student body. Information was sought on the following topics: 1) representation, inclusion, and characteristics of minority groups in textual materials; 2) written policies of school districts on the use of inter-ethnic materials; 3) procedures for the selection of inter-ethnic materials; 4) availability of films, filmstrips, tapes,  records, magazines, and other kinds of aids with inter-ethnic content; and 5) procedures utilized by school districts to distribute inter-ethnic materials. Some conclusions are: 1) the situation is very uneven; 2) more systematic efforts are needed to make high quality materials available and to help teachers use them effectively; 3) few districts have written policies encouraging use of such materials; 4) few districts have procedures to ensure adequate selection of a quantity of resources. In conclusion six policies are outlined to devise definite practices for encouraging the use of good inter-ethnic materials.

The second meeting was held for purposes of: 1) increasing understanding of the concept of conflict; 2) team discussions with consultants having expertise in  relevant academic fields; and 3) planning necessary steps for producing teachable units by fall, 1970. The final meeting was devoted to: 1) team presentation of work to date and criticism; 2) planning summer work; and, 3) discussion of types of responses a school system might responsibly make to an international crisis situation similar to Cambodia. In each workshop report agenda, participants, content, and critique are included. Appended to the final report are outlines of completed work by team members on the four units: 1) World War I and the Cuban Missile Crisis as Examples of International Conflict Situations; 2) Conflict; 3) The Habit of Violence; and, 4) Dissent and American Society. SO 001 267 is a report of subsequent committee workshops; other related documents are SO 001 260  through SO 001 266. (Author/JSB)",

Seven major concepts of content are defined: 1) Identity, 2) Obligation, 3) Change, 4) Power, 5) Conflict, 6) Institutions, 7) Interdependence, 8) Values and the Value Process. Rationale is that educational institutions in this country can move to institute value education in which problems of war and peace, conflict and change, are honestly investigated and analyzed in terms students can see as their own, reinforcing the intelligent and purposeful formation of individual and social values. Specific objectives of the project are listed and activities carried on in these areas are described: 1) Curriculum Unit Development, presently for  grades 7 through 11; 2) Teacher Training; 3) Resource Development; 4) Community Involvement; 5) Dissemination of Information; and, 6) Evaluation. Also included is a framework of assumptions focusing on the commitment to the democratic process, and a discussion of policy guidelines on problems of educational change in the war/peace field. An outline of the structure of the Project is given as well as information on the consulting functions of the Center. Appendices include membership lists for Executive Board, Community Advisory Panel, and Consultant Panel, and diagrams of the 1971 program and the curriculum development process.

The most fundamental assumptions used in thinking about international law are described, including some assumptions about systemic relationships. Several conceptual models of arrangements for management, settlement, or the outright prevention of conflict are presented to define features of three systems of international law: 1) Law of Reciprocity, 2) Law of Cooperation, and 3) Law of Subordination. Included in this analysis is background discussion of the international political system and the balance of powers. In addition, problems raised by the assumptions  incorporated in each of the three models are indicated. An annotated bibliography of 23 entries is provided.

Twenty-two teachers of English, science, and social studies participated for an introduction to the Project and its goals, and for experience in a conflict simulation game. Other purposes were to: 1) test the application of a new set of criteria for evaluating the value and political assumptions of resource materials and to demonstrate the necessity for such criteria; 2) outline the resources available; 3) present an introductory outline of the technical aspects of curriculum development. The simulation game is described in detail and summary of the discussion on social crisis in the United States is included. Appendices present sample  questions from the resource evaluation, and guidelines for preparing a teaching-learning unit. The second workshop was devoted to developing objectives, techniques, and content of interdisciplinary units on Conflict and Conflict Resolution. Included in the appendices are: 1) diagram of Project 1971; 2) definition of the knowledge, affective, and skills objectives to be developed; 3) an outline of developmental ideas on conflict; and, 4) a model unit outline on Methods of Conflict Resolution. Discussion notes give ideas for relating science education to education about war, peace, conflict, and change. Each workshop report lists participants, consultants, and activities.

The specific objectives were to provide teachers with: 1) a systematic program of study; 2) a substantive background in economics with emphasis on the analytical methods; 3) assistance in using these methods of inquiry in the development of elementary and secondary social science curricula; and, 4) knowledge of the new curriculum materials out of the research and development projects. With the purpose of the study to evaluate this program the focus was on: 1) the priority of the educational needs to which the program objectives were directed; and, 2) the program effectiveness and efficiency in meeting these needs. The procedures  used were based on the model developed by the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation (CIRCE). The program rationale was analyzed first, then the data were organized around three major gestalts including: antecedents, transactions, and program outcomes. Formative evaluation of changes during the operation of program were analyzed within these gestalts. Monitoring occurred on a day-to-day basis with additional data gathered from observations made by a CIRCE evaluator who interviewed participants, faculty, and administrators. The study revealed that the objectives, content, and methods were well-suited for an effective long-term program in economic education. (Author/SBE)",

This volume was not prepared for just literature or Spanish classes; the introductions and the works cover a wide range of economic, social, and historical aspects which should help enliven the textbook materials, and provoke interest and further research. Poems, short stories, songs, legends, and non-fiction were chosen, but not in equal proportions. Some authors are famous, some nearly unknown; some works are from the earliest times, one was written last year. Those included have been carefully selected for youth with something for almost  everyone in the intermediate and secondary grades; many primary school children can also profit from some of the readings when read by the teacher. Availability, permission to publish, ease of translation, and relation to the study of Latin America played a hand in selection. The Library of Congress, Guide to Latin American Literature in Translation, is a source for further acquisitions.

The flexible sequence of  teaching units examines the simpler individual budgets first: 1) wind, one week; 2) atmospheric composition and pollution, one week; 3) energy exchanges in ecologic and economic systems, radiative energy, and heat, two weeks; 4) water exchanges at the earth's surface, two weeks. The interacting, complex combination of these budgets are examined in the last four synthesizing units; 5) organisms, one week; 6) ecosystems or elements of the landscape, two or three weeks; 7) mosaic landscapes, one week, and, 8) regions and their world pattern, two or three weeks. The objectives suggested outline of topics, relation to other units, extensive useful references, and case studies are cited for each unit. (Author/SBE)",

        "description":"This university level course in economic geography emphasizes the need for control of the spatial allocation of our resources, and strives for heightened student awareness of the world as a complex. It may thus be considered an introduction to geocybernetics, the study of man/machine relationships in the control of spatial organization. A systems analytic technique within behavioral and cybernetic contexts is emphasized showing how a geographer can tackle a problem, and presenting a general framework or philosophy. It is a convenient organizing technique because of: 1) the treatment of large complexes as wholes, not as mechanistic parts; 2) the encompassing of concepts of interaction and spacial relationships within socioeconomic systems; and, 3) the inclusion of values,  goal-seeking, decision-making, and symbolic cognitive processes important to human behavior and landscape patterns. 1) The course begins with the pure, abstract notion of a general system, and considers why the system concept is operational; 2) then links it with other concepts using interaction models; 3) examines the economic elements in the global system including: agriculture, resources, manufacturing, service systems, transportation; and, 4) finally produces the concrete concept of the terrestrial spatial system. Interwoven are concepts of order and regularity, the theories to explain order, and the analytical procedures used to test them. An appendix describes the mathematical models. (Author/SBE)",

The bulk of the report consists of descriptions, by chairmen of the departments, of the undergraduate major programs: degree requirements, faculty, facilities, courses, objectives, teaching load, student recruitment, advising. These  descriptions present an idea of the diversity of geography in the United States in the fall of 1967, and set forth guidelines and a variety of suggestions which will be useful to any professional geographer who is concerned with undergraduate program. An effort has been made to report on the present state of the art and to refrain from value judgments on innovation. Some of the salient differences and similarities between these departments are summarized in the introduction to the report and an appendix. (Author/JSB)",

Demographer and sociologist Philip Hauser places the problem in the framework of explosive world population growth, and highlights the fact that though the schools have been gravely overburdened by population increases, their curriculum in no way reflects the population crisis. Educator Sloan R. Wayland gives documented evidence that the problem is world-wide and schools everywhere lag in preparing students to understand this problem. Biologist Irwin Slesnick reports on an experimental high school program integrating instruction in population and family planning which  show that the classroom can successfully handle the material. How a committee of specialists can plan so that models may be multiplied and become generally accepted is the subject of physicist Jerrold Zacharias. To these are added a report by Alan Guttmacher, M.D., President of Planned Parenthood-World Population, showing how initiative on the community level is already enriching teaching programs with population information and materials on family planning. An annotated bibliography lists books, pamphlets, articles, and films that deal with population and related problems. (Author/JLB)",

As the latest of a series dissecting major issues in education, the report details the history and remarkable recent growth of parochiaid, noting that it has been spurred by the widely publicized fiscal crisis of Catholic schools which educate 85 percent of the nation's 6 million nonpublic schoolchildren. The report also cites the widespread notion that two  decisions \"banned\" the Bible from public school classrooms, but notes as a matter of fact that the judges went out of their way to encourage the study of religion and the Bible. Only recently, as a result of urgings from various segments of American society, has religion gained ground in public school curriculums. (Author/AWW)",

        "description":"This report is based on a questionnaire, on the subject of education in moral values, sent to all of the school superintendents of the state. The four open-ended questions included on the questionnaire were designed to elicit from the superintendents statements concerning what their schools are currently doing in regard to education in this crucial area, as well as what they feel the needs are for improving approaches. Of the 552 school districts in the state at the time of mailing, 269 questionnaires were returned, these were submitted to a content analysis, whereby the researcher tabulated numbers of responses in certain areas to roughly estimate the frequency of certain ideas. These patterns and trends were indicated: 1) moral aspects of education belong in all aspects of the  curriculum; 2) educators in small communities tend to feel the problems of morality are more severe in large cities; 3) moral values should be especially stressed in social studies, English, and home economics classes; 4) teacher must set moral examples; and, 5) teacher training programs must stress moral values as an area of educational concern.

The investigation studies the areas of: 1) physical facilities available in the secondary schools; 2) administration and staff; 3) subject enrollments; 4) curriculum and evaluation; and, 5) cost patterns. To gather data in these areas a questionnaire was developed with 108 major questions. These questions were structured under the following twelve headings: 1) general identification; 2) school enrollment; 3) curriculum offerings and time allocations; 4) physical facilities; 5) teaching staff; 6) administrative organization; 7) school finance; 8) examination and evaluation; 9) instructional program; 10) school library; 11) co-curricular activities;  and, 12) pupil's welfare. This questionnaire was administered to a 10% sample drawn on a random stratified basis from the total number of secondary schools in India in 1960-1961 and 1961-1962. The results of the survey are reported in statistical tables by question and are summarized in Chapter 4 through Chapter 12. Generally it was found that a more extensive sampling is needed to permit all the types of generalization desired, and that the present study should be considered as exploratory in nature. Additional statistical tables are included in SO 001 590 through SO 001 592. (Author/AWW)",

        "description":"The central concern of this study, which was briefly reviewed in ED 049 143, was to determine effective teaching strategies and practices in secondary social studies classroom discussions of social issues. Teaching effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the cognitive or critical thinking skills of participating students, and their attitudes toward the teacher and class. Incidently, the affective side effects of social issues instruction are reported separately in ED 039 162. In the initial analysis of two audio-taping sessions for each of sixteen classes it became apparent that distinct discussion styles existed: 1) expository, sharing background information only; 2) inquiry-nonprobing, giving hypotheses, opinions, and taking positions only; and, 3) inquiry-probing, developing  ideas as well as devoting much time to defining, clarifying, evidencing, or testing these ideas. The instruments used for ascertaining the students critical thinking skills were the Michigan Social Issues Cognitive Category System, developed by the project as reported in ED 039 161, and the Harvard Social Issues Analysis Test; to determine student attitudes, the Minnesota Student Attitude Inventory was used. Students in the probing classes rated their classes highest and did very well on the critical thinking test; the expository classes came next, followed by the nonprobing classes with the lowest ratings and test scores.

A survey was conducted to determine impact of the 1968 report on local districts, and to gather information on titles of American History textbooks presently in use. Following the pattern of the first study, twelve very widely used textbooks were identified for evaluation and historians were selected to review them. The over-all results were on the negative side: seven of the reviews are almost totally favorable, two are only partially favorable, and only three could be considered  favorable. The State Board outlines these actions for consideration: 1) continue annual studies of social studies textbooks to determine the degree of progress being made in terms of treatment of minority groups; 2) seek legislative funds to support studies by the Social Studies Textbook Advisory Commission and to issue reviews and evaluations; 3) request amendment of state law to give the Board authority to list adequate and inadequate social studies textbook titles: and, 4) request amendment of state law to provide a policy of state adoption of social studies textbooks. Appended are: 1) guidelines for textbook evaluation; 2) a list of the twelve textbooks evaluated; 3) the Department's 1970 survey on textbooks in use. (Author/JSB)",

        "description":"The study investigates the formulation of British colonial education policy and attempts to evaluate the hypothesis that the policies formulated by the Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies reflected a consistent attempt to orient education policy in the colonies to the local needs for human resource development. The use of historical analysis and open-ended interviews subsequently led to a large collection of personal papers and documents of the Advisory Committee by Dr. J. H. Oldham. The research supports the hypothesis and further discloses that the framers of the original policy statement of colonial education issued in 1925 were aware of the necessary correlation between education and economic policy. The original nucleus of the Advisory Committee used what  influence they could effectively exert to insist that education be considered a social investment and not an expense (service). Unfortunately, their persuasions could not revolutionize the political-administrative indigenous structure of the colonies, or the Colonial Office. The Advisory Committee on Education had no power to compel; only an authority to persuade. The implications to be drawn from the study suggest that the British experience of cross-cultural educational planning is highly significant for the further development of the construct of Sociological-ecology which would use radical humanism as a heuristic axiological premise. A sixteen page primary and secondary source bibliography is appended. (Author/DJB)",

The degree of congruence between the responses of teachers and students within programs was determined by use of zero-order correlation coefficients for each of the three parts of the WAS, and differences between programs were analyzed by comparing the respective indices of relation using Fisher z transformations. In the same  manner congruence was determined for responses between the parts for the students and for the teachers in each program. Generally there was higher congruence between students and teachers in conventional than innovative programs although statistics support neither a strong positive nor negative relation. Implications are that satisfaction is more highly dependent on the nature of the students' role within a program than on the efficiency with which expectations are communicated.

After the treatment, experimental group Ss were matched to control group Ss (on sex, class, cumulative GPA, and hours credit) and all Ss were given the same statement of objectives and unit booklet and randomly assigned five to ten high school pupils. They planned  and taught four half-hour lessons to their pupils who were then administered a two-part test measuring recall of information and ability to reason using the material covered. The mean pupil scores for each S, computed for each part of the test, constituted the criterion measure of teacher effectiveness. The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) and the Sorenson Teacher Role Preference Inventory (TRPI) were administered to the experimental group as pre-posttest along with a course evaluation questionnaire. Results of analysis of variance tests supported the hypotheses. (Brief description of microplanning competencies and procedures plus a sample lesson plan are included.) (JS)",

Subjects were 250 white male and female experienced teachers whose responses were recorded on a semantic differential designed to assess teacher expectancies on two concepts: speaker and speaker's language. The experimental treatment consisted of an audio and audio-visual presentation of the speakers (two white and two black exhibiting lower and middle SES and speech characteristics) to teachers via closed circuit television. Speakers were randomly presented reading a prepared statement on civil disobedience. An analysis of variance factorial design was used to test the hypotheses. The race and the SES and language factors  independently elicited significantly different responses from the teachers, and the following interaction effects were also sognificant: 1) race x SES and language, 2) race x mode of presentation, and 3) race x SES x mode of presentation. The data indicated that black speakers were rated significantly less favorably than the white speakers matched on SES and language levels. Rated most negatively was the middle class black speaker, who seemed to have the most significant impact on the teachers' rating. The race of the speaker did not dominate initial impressions of teachers. However, the SES and language factor appeared to compound and magnify racial bias rather than to relieve it. (JS)",

        "author":["McDonald, F. J."],
        "description":"This paper illustrates how behavioral models which embody a critical language can be used to describe and predict some categories of classroom events. It defines teaching-learning as a set of events which are mediated primarily by a person, the consequence of which is change in behavior of a second person. A language for describing this phenomenon is needed which should denote those events which may properly be called instruction and those which should be labeled in other ways. The use of behavioral models has three advantages: 1) the models are relatively simple; 2) they require the fewest number of assumptions about the phenomena being described; and 3) there is a rich information bank about behavior analyzed in these terms. Three broad categories of theoretical models seem  useful: 1) the Skinnerian-type model of instrumental conditioning; 2) the Miller \"drive-cue-response-reinforcement\" model; and 3) the Bandura social-learning model. The problems in using behavioral models are of two kinds--those which are the consequences of extending a model by analogy to a new set of phenomena, and those which occur when communicating with investigators who do not use these models. The essential phenomenon of education is the acquisition of formal symbolic systems for the analysis and synthesis of experience; therefore the critical language of education must be concerned primarily with describing the methods of acquiring these symbolic systems.

Each student entering the program is expected to know enough of his subject to meet certification subject matter requirements. The program concentrates on professional skills only. During the on-campus phase of the program, the student must choose a topic group, a function group, and an activity group. Topic groups center on urban education, rural education, special education, or other similar areas. Function groups are made up of administrators, teacher trainers, secondary school teachers, or elementary school teachers. Both topic and  function groups (each containing about 20 students) are expected to develop their own curriculum using the resources of the college. In the activity groups, students and faculty combine on the basis of personal interest to further their skills in non-verbal expression. Examples of activity groups are painting, sculpture, photography, dance, and furniture making. The two remaining components of the program--seminars and large groups--focus on discussions of literature and lectures. (RT)",

The major emphasis is on the junior-year block-sequence of courses entitled Basic Preparation for Teaching--a team-taught, individualized, interdisciplinary sequence which includes 45 half-days of field experience. Placements are made in three city schools at various grade levels, where the focus progresses from an initial emphasis upon a one-to-one tutoring role to a small-group teaching experience, to a field experience teaching the full classroom group. All the other required courses  are focused upon the field experience and are scheduled in the junior year with the exception of the student-teaching course. During his senior year the student works on coursework in various disciplines, develops a specialization in one or more elementary school subject areas, and completes additional student-teaching work. Program development is a continuous process involving students and faculty. There are plans to improve the procedures for student selection, to improve the balance between on-campus and field functions, and to establish a senior year salaried internship. (Author/MBM)",

The program was aimed at developing five basic teaching behaviors--planning, motivating, verbalizing, controlling-disciplining, and evaluating. Three major tasks were identified: 1) to redesign the structure of the existing program, 2) to work out arrangements with public schools for joint involvement in teacher education, 3) to organize and develop appropriate learning materials. The methodology was of two kinds: 1) the action research activities involving the teaching-learning activities carried out by a three-member team with two groups of students; and 2) the procedure for evaluating the results of the action research, in which ratings were made by each of the three  investigators for each of the students involved. The statistical analysis of this data with respect to the development of the specified behaviors used the chi square technique. The chi square values for each of the behaviors and for a general rating of teacher behavior were significant at the .001 level. Thus the investigators rejected the null hypothesis that the teaching-learning activities in the particular conceptual-behavioral curriculum structure had no effect on the development of the desired teaching behavior.

        "description":"This study found that data from previous research can be used to validate a new observational category system and that subscripting of the original ten categories of the Flanders Interaction Analysis System is useful in identifying more specific behaviors which correlate with student achievement. The new category system was the Expanded Interaction Analysis System (EIAS), in which each of the 10 Flanders categories is subscripted into two to four smaller categories. The material used for validation was the audiotapes, typescripts, and residual student achievement scores used in the original study by Wright and Nuthall (1970). In this study, 17 teachers presented three 10-minute lessons on the black-billed gull to intact classes of third grade students. Results from the EIAS  coding and analysis showed the major advantage of subscripting to be in categories 3 and 4. In category 3 (teacher accepts students' ideas), the entire category had a correlation of .15 with achievement, whereas the subscript 3a (acknowledges ideas by simple reflection) yielded a correlation of .30. In category 4, although the total frequency of questions yielded a correlation of .18, the asking of factual questions had a correlation of .55 with student achievement. This was considered to be due to the factual nature of the material. This technique of using the same data with different systems is recommended for future use. (RT)",

        "description":"The program focuses on the interaction among roles, aptitudes, and instructional functions of teachers. The goals of the program are to 1) train pre- and inservice teachers to work in instructional teams, 2) improve pupil achievement, 3) involve the local community in all phases of team activity, 4) develop a curriculum to train teachers to work in instructional teams. The project is an integral component of the Stanford University Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP). Three instructional teams are working in local public schools, one with low income Mexican-American students, one with low income Negro and Oriental students, and one with middle income Caucasian students. Each team includes preservice trainees, master teachers who are members of the teacher education program  staff, and experienced teachers. An evaluation model derived from systems analysis is used as a means for reducing the complex interaction of role-function-aptitudes to manageable units which can be evaluated at three levels of decision making: project, institutional, and extra-institutional. A major outcome of the project is reflected in the development of group process problem-solving protocol materials. These materials are designed to serve as a curriculum for teachers who are learning to work in instructional teams differentiated by teaching role and responsibility. (Author/MBM)",

All were college graduates in fields other than education and most of them mothers in the over 30 age bracket. Funded by EPDA, this intensive teacher preparation program incorporated two major features--open education for young children and participatory preparation for novice teachers. Candidates participated in the program for 15 weeks, from 8&30 to 3&30 every day. The first 5 weeks consisted of visiting several different models of early childhood education as a morning activity. Afternoons were spent at Salem State College where students took three telescoped courses--Child Development; Language, Reading, and Literature for Young Children; and Mathematics  in Early Childhood Education. A fourth course in Early Childhood Curriculum was given during the practicum. All students had the opportunity of working for 5 weeks with 3-to-5 year olds, interchanged with another 5 weeks of teaching under supervision in classes of children 5-to-8 years old. The general consensus of a questionnaire prepared and administered by an outside evaluation team was that most participants--candidate teachers, teachers, administrators, and teacher aides--thought the objectives were met and the program was highly successful.

The design enables a school system leadership to provide its component schools with the means for implementing a staff differentiation model designed for the individual school. The staffing sub-model is designed to organize the instructional staff into a logical vertical and horizontal differentiation. The five vertical levels of professional personnel are consulting teacher, directing teacher, staff teacher, instructor, and resident intern, assisted by paraprofessional personnel including instructional assistants, aides, student assistants, lay adjunct teachers, and volunteer assistants. The horizontal differentiation has four broad function areas:  instruction, staff development, administration, and planning-research-evaluation-reporting. The implementation includes 1) a process for the allocation of total staff units to each school, 2) the division of all schools into seven classifications according to size and type, 3) an assignment of unit values to each position in the vertical hierarchy of the staffing sub-model, 4) a procedure for determining the approximate recommended number of each job classification needed at a particular school, 5) a set of charts from which job specifications may be collated for each staff member, and 6) the general criteria by which the staff is held accountable for performance.

A unique concept is the school academic senate, which is the policy-making body within the school directly responsible to the superintendent, and which is neither elected nor appointed but is a selected group of teachers fulfilling an aspect of their differentiated responsibilities. The district senate was officially formed in 1969-70, with voting membership limited to six school principals and  six vice chairmen selected from within the school senates. The instruction council is responsible for curriculum development and is composed of master teachers in the various disciplines, the directors of education, and the superintendent. The roles and responsibilities of the various staff members are described in detail and include the associate teacher, the senior teacher, the master teacher, and the paraprofessional.

The workshops focused on specific teaching skills. Four of the instructional systems have been implemented as courses and will continue to be available to teachers and college faculty as inservice until their place in a continuous teacher education curriculum can be determined. A key element of the self-renewing procedure is the  use of teachers trained in the original inservice workshops as trainers for other teachers.

Each program directs the teacher to an important educational objective--development of skills in critical-analytical thinking, development of language skills, maintenance of pupils' motivation for learning, etc. Each schedule is a carefully written guide enabling the teacher to do his own analysis and interpretation of a recorded sequence of teaching behaviors. The GSA codes may be designed to  fit any teaching situation and provide focused feedback. Coding schedules can be structured to emphasize any particular curricular concern, and since curriculum content and instructional procedure are closely related, properly designed schedules have impact on both areas.

The consequent Structure for Self-Directed Education (STRUSD Education) was operationalized as Treatment A and tested in an educational psychology course. STRUSD Treatment A employed an authoritative structure oriented toward enhancing self-direction. It consisted of 1) two one-half-hour individual counseling sessions, 2) five small group meetings, 3) whole class meetings with discussions and talks by visitors, 4) departmental sessions of special film and guest programs, 5) authoritative structure of attendance and work reports, 6) a work report procedure in which students must choose their own  study experiences and must report their learning experiences regularly. In the research, STRUSD students were compared to control groups and to other concurrently taught, equivalent classes. Results showed that although STRUSD students did not develop a significantly more positive attitude toward educational psychology, they did have significantly greater increase in Assertive Self Assurance and Adaptive Autonomy as measured by the California Psychological Inventory and of Freedom Orientation as measured by Runners' Interview Form III. They also scored significantly higher on the Departmental Evaluation of Achievement. (Appendixes contain materials describing the course, case histories, and evaluations by students.) (Author/RT)",

        "description":"This study, carried out in 1959-60 in the public schools of three counties in southeastern Florida, compares the teaching effectiveness of beginning teachers who are provisionally certified because of lack of all or some of the prescribed professional preparation in education courses with teachers who have met full certification requirements. Seventy-six provisionally certified teachers were paired with 76 fully certified teachers, matched as closely as possible on a number of background variables. Systematic and repeated classroom observations were used to estimate teaching effectiveness, with each teacher observed five times during the year. Each teacher was also rated twice by his principal. The original item ratings from the Classroom Observation Report were converted into  standard scores, which, in turn were averaged to give five subscores which formed the basic data for analysis. The comparisons overwhelmingly favored the teachers who had completed the professional sequence of education courses, and the differences were statistically significant in all but one of the group comparisons made. In view of the conclusion that completion of education courses is reflected in more effective teaching, at least during the first year, the implication is that education courses have a legitimate place in the required program of teacher preparation.

The change from the teacher shortage of the 1960's to the surplus of the 1970's is traced and explained, and the continued shortage in certain fields, such as industrial arts, special education, mathematics, trade and vocational, natural and physical science, women's physical education, remedial reading, speech correction, library science, and elementary education, is noted. It is suggested that the teacher surplus would not exist if all schools were operating fully to meet the educational needs of all children. Data are included on the numbers of elementary and secondary teachers between 1959 and 1970, on projected demand  through 1980, and on school population and teacher qualifications. The chapters on Wisconsin analyze the teacher supply and demand picture on the basis of information obtained from a survey of college placement officers, school district administrators, and education deans and department chairmen of Wisconsin colleges and universities engaged in teacher preparation. Eleven implications are included which summarize the present situation and suggest future directions for teacher education institutions and their students. (MBM)",

        "description":"This review is concerned with self-confrontation counseling, which is defined as facing a subject with inconsistencies in his motivations or evasions. Such counseling involves two elements: the playback to a subject of his videotaped activity to allow him to view himself as others view him, and feedback to the subject in relation to the videotape. This reinforcement process is considered by many to be the single most important concept in understanding the learning process and an important variable in producing change. It is essential for the counselor to highlight important elements of the feedback process by means of supervisory conferences or critiques. Many of the studies examined involve dissonance theory, that is, the psychological tension when the self image and the  recorded behavior are not in agreement. Self-confrontation can lead to behavior change by bringing the subject to a better understanding of his real self, provided that the message received is not seen as too threatening. Individual personality differences affect the self-confrontation experience and the document examines research studies which indicate that subjects with high and low self concepts tend to act in accordance with their self concept and that a low self concept reduces the probability of experiencing dissonance between present behavior and future valued goals. There is a bibliography of 147 items. (MBM)",

Follow-up and feedback were obtained from visits to the participants during the school year, and by a 2-day follow-up conference. Results indicated that participants did have a functional knowledge of newer curricula but did not have strategies or alternatives by which they could work with others. Participants shared a common interest in improving the profession, but their knowledge of the operation of the school district  was relatively superficial. Feedback indicated that following the conference nine participants worked with the school districts. Participants provided many informal cues to indicate that they felt they were part of a total team in developing a teacher education program.

A review of the literature revealed a high demand but limited supply of competent personnel in the following skill areas: conceptualizing issues and processes; designing techniques; setting objectives; measuring and evaluating outcomes; implementing outcomes; and identifying and incorporating attitudes, values, and practices of minority groups. A systems approach utilizing individualized instruction was selected as the best method  of training with modularized packages of material stressing the conceptualization of specific skills and a structured internship experience supervised by the training agencies. The development of this training system would take 4 years. In the first year the modular packages would be designed and tested, in the second year packages would be combined into subsystems and used to train individuals, in the third year the entire system would be tested as a whole unit, and in the fourth year the system would be installed at various agencies throughout the nation.

The training program designed to meet these needs has three areas of objectives: materials development, training, and program development. Forty-eight training modules would be used individually in various agencies for evaluating and training approximately 100 individuals by January 1973 and 350 individuals by July 1974. The full system, which should be operational by January 1974, consists of four subsystems and 48 instructional modules with an additional internship experience lasting from 1 to 6 months. The program is designed to meet the needs both of college students and presently employed personnel in educational agencies. It utilizes six interrelated steps:  1) context analysis, 2) conceptual design, 3) product design, 4) pilot test, 5) field test, and 6) marketing and diffusion. The diagnostic subsystem has been designed to assess both agency and individual needs, accomplished by a number of interview or questionnaire devices. Both placement and management subsystems will be developed in order to provide the necessary monitoring of trainees and their effective placement at the end of the program. Evaluation will provide more exact data on the possibilities of diffusion of the program, and a final report covering all aspects of development, evaluation, cost, and diffusion recommendations will be made at the completion of the operational training system.

In the hypotheses model, each teacher was assigned to one of eight groups with other teachers having similar scores on satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and risk taking propensity. Each of the eight hypotheses predicted either walk-out or non walk-out behavior for teachers in its group. Data was obtained from the responses to a mailed questionnaire of a random sample of 200 Florida  teachers. Multiple discriminant analysis procedures were used to test the conceptual model. A correlation with transgeneration program, specifying a Boolean expression, was utilized to assign participants to the eight groups of the hypotheses model.

Classroom behavior was measured by a posttest only design: during the last week of student teaching, two 20-minute samples of each subject's teaching behavior were obtained using the Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories with  Nonverbal Categories (FIAC/NVC). A repeated measures design assessed manifest state anxiety over time: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered to all subjects prior to, in the middle of, and at the end of student teaching. The Confidential Evaluation Form (CEF) was filled out by cooperating teachers. Results showed no significant differences between groups in percentages of restricting classroom behavior or in decrements of state anxiety over time.

Hypnosis has been defined as a mental state characterised by heightened suggestibility. Anton Mesmer, usually referred to as the &quot;father&quot; of hypnosis, was extremely successful in inducing large numbers of clients into a deep hypnotic state. Since his time, hypnosis has enjoyed extensive use in the medical profession. Several researchers have focused on problems related to speech communication. An application of hypnosis closely related to the field of speech communication is in the reduction of  stuttering. The relationship between hypnosis and speech communication is even more apparent when hypnosis is analyzed as a specialized form of communication. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of methods for measuring speech anxiety. A therapeutic method developed by Wolpe, called &quot;systematic desensitization,&quot; appears to be successful in dealing with a number of problems due to anxiety.

Such crises in formal education are small in comparison with the overriding issues of whether or not man can survive as a species past the turn of the next century and of what the quality of his existence will be if he does manage to perpetuate himself. At the current growth rate, the earth's population will double in 37 years. Coupled to this problem is that of caring for the young. Despite the recent creation of a \"Green Revolution,\" by which production of wheat, rice, and maize has increased phenomenally in India, economic problems persist. The consequences of urbanization are manifold. Aggravating the  financial crises of the major cities is the increase of violence it fosters and an intensified pollution of the environment. If technological man is to survive, he cannot for much longer destroy links in the chain of life upon which he, too, is ultimately dependent. Even if pollutants do not kill man, weaponry may. Currently, two and a half times as much is being spent on military equipment and personnel as is collected in taxes by all units of local government. Behavior must change and priorities be renewed. In the process of reconstructing national goals and of creating a moral society, English departments and their chairmen can play a crucial role. (CK)",

Eight teachers in six different disciplines constituted the humanities committee who, with the project director, sought to integrate disciplines into more direct, coherent relationships. Four major themes were chosen as the central focus for each nine-week period: (1) \"The Public Man,\" (2) \"The Private Man,\" (3) \"Man and  Woman,\" and (4) \"The Relationship of Man and Society.\" For each theme, the students, in consultation with one of the humanities teachers, prepared a project or some form of creative work. The level of involvement the students experienced gave them a greater qualitative understanding of achievement. Results include: (1) students feel they have gained from the program; (2) teachers and school administrators from distant schools have come to see the unique dimensions of the curriculum; (3) teachers consider it an honor to be a member of the humanities team; and (4) college admissions officers welcome the students.

Prediction models, subtest models, and restricted models were tested for predictive efficiency. The most reliable model constructed was composed of seven variables: (1) number of capitalization errors, (2) standard deviation of sentence length, (3) standard deviation of word length, (4) number of connectives, (5) occurrence of &quot;then&quot;, (6) average sentence length, and (7) number of usage errors. When used to predict overall essay grades, using regression weights derived from the mechanics criterion, the  correlation between actual and predicted scores for 24 essays was .60, indicating a strong relationship between mechanical proficiency and overall writing ability at the seventh grade level. It is believed that computer scoring of essays may prove to be an important tool in the individualization of composition teaching. (DB)",

An interview questionnaire was administered to 200 informants, 175 caucasians and 25 other races, of whom 55 were under the age of 30, 75 were between 30 and 49, and 67 were 50 and older. For study purposes, obscenity was operationally defined as \"sex, body, and toilet words, but not words like 'hell' and 'damn'.\" Scaled and open-ended responses were obtained. The data obtained show the following: (1) the Denver area sampled reacted extremely negatively toward the use of obscenity in college demonstrations; (2)  non-caucasians were much less negatively affected than were caucasians; (3) younger persons responded more favorably than did those who were older; (4) attitude toward sex and familiarity with obscenity were found to be affected by the variable of age; and (5) persons under 30, as well as those with a positive sex attitude, were much less likely to give responses of \"disgust\" and \"anger.\" It is suggested that an age-related cluster of attitudes determines reactions, and obscenity is more effective for reaching specific groups.

From the tables obtained, a list of corrected functional vocabulary was prepared by state and types of speaker. There was an overall variation of 19.4 percent of Appalachian English from the standard English, which led to the conclusion that there is a distinct pattern of linguistic structure in the region.

The theoretical framework drew mainly from current ideas about dialect features and the associations with social stereotypes which they appear to prompt in listeners. The practical focus was how this process relates to teachers' expectations of children's academic performances. The results of five experiments led to the following generalizations: (1) Teachers' evaluations of speech samples involved judgments along two relatively independent dimensions of confidence-eagerness and ethnicity-nonstandardness. These had generality across video-only, audio-only, and audio-video conditions of stimulus presentation and generality across samples of Anglo, Black, and  Mexican-American children's speech. (2) The judgmental process appeared to combine stereotyping behaviors with evaluations of the language samples. (3) Teacher ethnicity interacted with child ethnicity in speech evaluations. (4) Speech evaluations could be used to predict teachers' expectations of children's academic performance in language arts classes. These results suggest that speech evaluation and the attitudinal correlates of dialect characteristics be incorporated into teacher training programs. (Author/DB)",

The first step was to introduce film-making to the students. This was accomplished through viewing and analyzing brief &quot;experiential&quot; films. The second step was to define guidelines that are applicable to both visual and verbal composition; during this step, the class learned that poetry depends upon sensations and ordinary observations of experiences. The film-making project of the class was an effort to merge poetry with the visual and the auditory. The third step of the experiment was the actual production of short films and a demonstration of the principles of  composition. The class prepared the script from essays written by the students on poems discussed in class; they then edited the script, chose music and sound effects, and filmed the final product. It is through the process of evaluation and script writing that the relationship of the visual and verbal media is most apparent. (DB)",

Data were collected while beginning, intermediate, or advanced players performed scales in F, D, and B-flat and two etudes in both staccato and legato. The means used to record the data were: audio recording of sound; graphic representation of sound; measurement of air pressure and a graphic representation of these recordings; measurement of air flow and graphic representation of these recordings; and anatomic cine X-rays of the larnyx during sound reproduction. The results are related to pressure control, absolute pressures, sound volume, and the importance of the vocal chord. Recommendations to  teachers are that: (1) particular attention be given to achieving pharyngeal air pressure control in beginning students; (2) less effort needs to be given by the beginning players to achieving high pressure volume; (3) an increase in volume of air pressure will not necessarily lead to an increase of volume in the production of sound, but rather, it is through precise pressure variations and correlations between vocal chord and mouth region; and control movements of the true vocal chord are the most important for the production of sound and sound interruption in trumpet playing.

        "description":"The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to empirically identify and analyze trained and untrained observers' affective responses to a representative collection of paintings for the purpose of constructing art differential instruments, and (2) to use these instruments to objectively identify and evaluate the major affective factors and components associated with selected paintings by trained and untrained observers. The first objective was accomplished by having 120 trained and 120 untrained observers elicit a universe of 12,450 adjective qualifiers to a collection of 209 color slides of paintings. Data analyses yielded subsets of adjective qualifiers most characteristic of trained and untrained observers' affective decoding of the 209 slides. These subsets served as a  basis for constructing separate art differential instruments for trained and untrained observers' use in subsequent analyses. The second objective was achieved by having 48 trained and 48 untrained observers rate 24 color slides of paintings on 50 scale art differential instruments. Trained and untrained observers' art differential ratings of the 24 paintings were factor analyzed in order to identify the major affective factors associated with the paintings. For the trained observers, these were: aesthetic-evaluative, dynamism, emotive, and structural-organization. For the untrained, the factors were: aesthetic-evaluative, potency, and emotive.

It is proposed that evaluation also be applied to things not yet done; that evaluation has a significant and continuous role in planning any educational program. Evaluation is seen as facilitating the fulfillment of the four basic functions of planning by (1) identifying program goals, (2) defining alternative means of attaining these goals, (3) indicating the possible consequences of selecting each alternative, and (4) providing data for the allocation of resources. Methods of operationalizing the preceding concepts, and procedures for determining priorities among goals and means are considered. The inclusion of this data into  educational planning is discussed.

Concerning the first point, the author sees the book as more than passably adequate in terms of meeting its objectives, meeting the criteria for a good evaluation, responding to the five basic problems of evaluation, and meeting the conditions for an adequate theory. Regarding new questions, the areas of decision-making, criteria, methodology of the interface role, methodology of the technical role, data systems, implementation and organization,  training, and therapy, are seen as those most in need of inquiry and development. Finally, in relation to who might deal with these questions, the author includes an eight page quotation from the book manuscript to discuss this topic. It suggests that evaluation practitioners on the local, state and national levels, evaluation consultants, evaluation research and development personnel, users of evaluation reports, consumers of evaluation reports, related professional groups and funding agencies might contribute solutions to new questions.

Although progress has been made, improvement in guidance procedures and individual planning is needed; 3) there has been little improvement in the quality and effectiveness of the instructional programs; 4) students report they are working more, studying less, and reading books to about the same degree as in 1960; 5) there is a decrease in the number of absences over 15  days; and 6) a slight, but consistent trend in poorer health than in 1960 is linked to the increased use of stimulants.

Studies of observer agreement, stability, structure, comparisons over sex, classes, conditions, observers and over time are presented. Results showed high observer agreement, non-significant repeated trail correlations, consistent and expected changes in scale means over time--Head Start to first grade, unstable factor structures over samples and over repeated observation of the same sample. Differences between classes were consistently significant. An application with an experimental program did not show significant differences, which was an expected result. Classroom observational  strategies are compared to educational and psychological testing as ways of getting measures of children in schools. While the latter will, in general, put a premium on stability, as a condition of test reliability, the former will emphasize individual variability. Data from CRB applications is presented to support this contention. The key for the scales of the CRB is appended. (Author)",

A probability sample of 7,417 children was selected to represent the 24 million noninstitutionalized children in this age group. The sample, 96 percent of which was examined, was representative of the child population of the U.S. with respect to age, sex, race, region, size of place of residence, and change in size of place of residence from 1950 to 1960. The findings on school achievement are presented by age, grade, and sex. Grade equivalents, percentile ranks, and standard score equivalents of these raw  scores are included. Comparison is made with the data available for the group on which Jastak standardized the 1963 revised WRAT. National estimates from this survey, on the average, were lower than those for the standardization group for both subtests, significantly so for most ages on the Arithmetic subtest. In general, slightly greater variability in scores was found in the Reading but not the Arithmetic subtest for the U.S. children from the present study than that in Jastak's standardization group.

The initial sample consisted of 242 first graders and 281 second graders; 182 sixth graders constituted a second sample. A breakdown of the sample by sex and ethnic group is given in Tables 2 through 7. Table 1 gives correlations of the PM with the LTIQ and the WISC and its subscales for each grade considered, for all groups combined. Results indicate that the PM is more predictive of verbal abilities for females than for males. For minority children, the scores associated with the PM, the scores  associated with the LITQ, and the Wechsler and its subscales, showed a low and erratic relationship, indicating that the PM measures a dimension of intelligence relatively untapped by the other instruments. However, the PM was found to be a poor predictor of reading or arithmetic achievement for the sixth grade Mexican-American sample, but for all other groups it provided substantial prediction in most cases. The LTIQ was found to be far superior to the PM and WISC as a predictor with all groups. (LR)",

The dispersion of responses to a set of items by a group of subjects has typically been measured by the standard deviation. Here, the interest is in the dispersion of responses from the same subject to a set of items. The Ohio Vocational Interest Survey was used to gather students' responses to 11 items (job-activity statements) in terms of a 5-option scale. The investigation consisted of 3 phases: (1) a scale clarity index (SCI) was devised; (2) all possible response patterns were defined and the clarity of each was rated in terms of degree of consistency; and (3) the extent to which the deviation raw score, the  standard deviation, mean deviation, and a centrality index would predict the scale clarity rating developed in the second phase was investigated. A critical aspect of this study is the judges' ratings of the clarity inherent in each pattern. The SCI provides additional information as to the nature of a subject's responses, is useful in the interpretation of raw scores, especially those based on individual item responses, and has great promise in testing and measurement practice.

Using the framework of the Facet Design Technique (FDT) for problem structuring, eight general research strategies are identified as they relate to measurement fidelity, representativeness of units, and treatment administration. Three forces are seen as having contributed to a system of classifying research methods. They include: development of an instrument for evaluating the methodological adequacy of research in education; a growing reliance on the experimental method; and, the Guttman Facet Design Technique (FDT) which provides a system for the development of a conceptual universe on a specified problem in advance of the generation of empirical data. The  historical, descriptive, experimental, and quasi-experimental methods of research are defined in operational terms and classified into eight categories of research strategies through the use of the FDT. Levels of control, profiles of the different methods, and examples of less familiar inquiry techniques are examined. It is concluded that in some instances, data that have specific inadequacies can yield stronger conclusions through the application of certain statistical techniques, but that the overall evaluation of any completed research cannot be concluded until a contrast is made which holds up the statistic used to the statistic most appropriate for the nature of the generated data.

Half of the students in each school were assigned to a treatment condition where they took a complete 24-item mathematics test on the first day of testing and took item-sampled versions of the same test on the second day of testing. A second random group of students within each of the schools took the item-sampled version of the mathematics test on day 2 but did not take the complete version of the mathematics test on day 1. There was no evidence to indicate that taking the complete 24-item mathematics test influenced the performance on the  item-sampled version on the second day of testing. Reasonably close estimates of mean performance were obtained from the item-sampling situation as compared to the means estimated from the conventional type of testing. The differences between the means estimated from conventional type testing and from item-sampling testing were found to diminish as a function of the number of students tested in the school (square root transformation).

This method achieves a great deal of generality and flexibility, in that it is capable of handling most standard statistical models as well as many nonstandard and complicated ones. This paper describes a computer program for the method. When the variance-covariance matrix of the observed variables is unconstrained, the method may be used to estimate location parameters and to test linear hypotheses about them. For example, the program may be used to handle such standard problems as multivariate regression, ANOVA, and MANOVA. A unique feature of the method is that it can  also be used when the variance-covariance matrix is constrained to be of a certain form. Various other models involving correlated errors or errors of measurement can also be handled. An illustration of how input data is set up, and what the printout looks like for two small sets of data, are included. (Author/CK)",

If these are satisfied, and if the subset of nonlinear parameters may be LS fit to the corresponding LS estimates of the linear model, then one attains the desired LS estimates for the entire submodel. Two illustrative analyses employing this method are given, each involving an Eckart-Young (LS) decomposition of a matrix of linear LS estimates. In each case the factors provide an LS fit of the nonlinear submodel to the original data. The minimum error sum of squares for this fit is the error sum of squares for the corresponding linear model plus a function of the eigenvalues involved in the factorization. An Eckart-Young factorization, however, is only a  special case of an LS decomposition of LS estimates. The present method is more generally applicable (under the three simplifying conditions) whenever any LS procedure may be found for fitting certain parameters of a nonlinear submodel to the corresponding LS estimates of a linear model.

The data tend to support, among others, the following generalizations: (1) a single regression plane cannot be used to predict freshman GPA for both blacks and whites in many of the institutions studied; (2) nevertheless, if prediction of GPA from SAT scores is based upon prediction equations suitable for majority students, then black students, as a group, are predicted to do about as well as (or better than)  they actually do. Analysis demonstrated that a general conclusion applicable to all institutions is not justified.

Since the researcher determines the factor structure of the tests he simulates, sets the nature of the ability distribution of his simulated subjects, and has direct control over the reliability coefficient for the \"population\" from which he \"draws\" his tests, the procedure allows  considerable flexibility. The experimenter can easily simulate discrete or dichotomous scores if he desires. Use of the technique does not require advanced programming skill. The method is explicated and the computer program, along with an illustration of its use, is included. (DG)",

        "description":"This study tests the appropriateness of Torrance's assumptions of trait independence and the combinability of measures (Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) with respect to the scoring of the tests for a younger population and estimates the homogeneity of the scores. The sample consisted of 128 elementary school children. Results indicate that separate scoring for fluency, flexibility, and originality traits is not warranted, because any special dispositions for these traits that may exist are overwhelmed by the task specificity of the scores. It is suggested that the Torrance scores reveal nothing interesting about the individual, and the report contends that use of more than a single score from the Torrance battery makes little sense. The major question still unanswered is  when, if ever, it makes sense to use a score from the Torrance battery. (AE)",

        "description":"The previous theoretical development of the Poisson process as a strong model for the true-score theory of mental tests is discussed, and additional theoretical properties of the model from the standpoint of individual examinees are developed. The paper introduces the Erlang process as a family of test theory models and shows in the context of mental testing, that the Poisson process is a particular case of the Erlang process. Probability density functions mathematically define the parameters and lead to semantic interpretations of parameters in terms of tests and examinee characteristics. Experimental research gives the fit of observations to theoretically predicted functional forms for individual examinees. In particular, experimental measurements determine observed-score  distributions for individuals and give estimates of their true scores. The models apply to homogeneous, itemized tests of pure speed. The models were tested with tenth grade boys who responded to six highly speeded tests from the Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors. Three tests measured speed of clerical or perceptual skill, and three measured speed of computational skill in arithmetic. The Poisson process was applied with varying degrees of success to three of the six highly speeded tests while the Erlang process applied to one test. For two tests (Maze Tracing and Addition) the stochastic models had no application. (Author/CK)",

Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for two factor matrices to admit identical factor structures and/or factor patterns with factors having unit variances. These conditions are expressed in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of certain matrices obtainable from the data. It is also shown that two matrices admitting identical factor structures will admit identical factor patterns and vice versa. After introducing the notion of a pair of transformations to identical structures and/or identical patterns, rules are given as to finding such pairs if they exist. Finally, some immediate consequences of the theorems are noted. They concern, for  example, the suitable choice of a target structure and/or pattern and a hierarchical order of jointly necessary and sufficient conditions for fitting a specified target perfectly.

It is contended that grouping results in a trend toward improved achievement in superior groups and poorer achievement in the average or low groups. In addition, it tends to reinforce favorable self concepts in those assigned to high achievement groups and unfavorable self concepts in those assigned to low achievement groups. There seems to be a negative effect with regards to ethnic and socioeconomic separation. Misuses of standardized  tests in grouping procedures are fully discussed. In view of the apparent inadequacies of present grouping practices, the following six alternative strategies are recommended: individualized instruction, heterogeneous grouping, stratified heterogeneous grouping, team teaching, student tutoring, and early childhood education.

Biological, sociological, psychological and temporal formulations of maturity are discussed and compared. Am interdisciplinary model of maturity is evolved which emphasizes (1) effective individual functioning, (2) effective interpersonal relationships, and (3) system maintenance. Effective individual functioning requires information necessary for the individual to grow and to maintain himself in the \"average expectable environment\" and work-related skills and motives necessary for the same end. Effective interpersonal relationships are a function of predictability and trust, and they contribute  to the survival of society, which is the concern of sociological models of maturity. System maintenance depends on reproduction, socialization of the young, and shared values. Psychological standards of maturity involve the development of favorable attitudes toward self, others, and work; and of a behavior-guiding system of values. These criteria are embedded in the content of the three categories. Maturity is discussed in relation to current developments in schools and applications of a potential maturity scale are suggested.

Investigation produced a preliminary 54-item scale with high reliability and moderate validity, which is appended. A factor analysis of the scale supports the a priori structure by the theoretical model of maturity. The five factors comprising the maturity scale are: self-esteem, openness to change, independence, identity, and social tolerance. Data on random samples of approximately 3,000 fifth grade students and 3,000 11th grade students, and another sample of 1,500 blacks at each grade level, form the basis for various analyses. As predicted, girls, whites, and children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds obtain higher  maturity scores than boys, blacks and children from lower social classes. Differences in psychosocial maturity due to sex increase from grade 5 to grade 11; differences due to race and social class narrow over these years. Psychosocial maturity accounts for about 16% of the variance in academic achievement (standardized test scores) at grade 5, but for only 6% of the variance in achievement at grade 11. The increasing independence of academic achievement from the culturally desirable attitudes and values contained in the maturity scale is a matter of potential interest to educators.

        "description":"The purposes of the project reported in this study were to prepare a brochure showing that the quality of education was still as high as it had been before change in the community had led parents and other citizens to worry whether children were receiving a good education in local schools, and to distribute the brochure on a mass basis and determine if it had any effect on public opinion concerning local schools on the Southeast Side of Kansas City. The brochure described in a clear and candid fashion the educational opportunities available to students in the community's school and data concerning student performance in the classroom. It also acquainted the reader with community organizations which were functioning in the community, and through which citizens could participate in  community affairs. With the help of community organizations, thousands of the brochures were distributed free on a door-to-door basis and thus were placed in the homes of a majority of families on the Southeast Side. Despite complicating problems in interpretation, the results of the study evaluating the effect of the brochures on a pre-post basis offer definite encouragement regarding the potential of such programs.

        "description":"The 33 Negro public colleges enroll about one-fourth of all the black students now attending colleges and universities in this country. Although the total enrollment of these schools increased by more than 12 per cent this year alone, eight of them experienced a decline in enrollment and five others gained fewer than 100 students. Fourteen schools have direct competition from predominately white state institutions located in the same cities and towns, and at least three others are within easy commuting distance of a white college. These provide a vivid illustration of the inequities built into the &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; doctrine. In almost every case, the black school was there first; in at least seven instances, the state has created the &quot;white competition&quot; in the past four or  five years. In every situation, the schools duplicate some courses and draw funds from the same public treasury. They represent a costly perpetuation of the dual system of higher education. Ultimately, the real test of a state's commitment to equality of opportunity in higher education will be measured by the extent to which black students, faculty, administrators, and trustees are represented in the colleges and universities.

Key variables tested include school racial composition (current and cumulative), school social observers, and the interracial friendliness of classmates as evidenced by their sociometric choices. The sample included all children in 36 sixth grade classrooms, two in each of 18 schools randomly drawn from a matrix representing the racial and social class distribution of interracial elementary schools in the city. The classrooms varied from seven to 100 in the percentage of black children enrolled and from lower to middle in mean socioeconomic status; of the total of 956 children, slightly over half were  white. Data to measure achievement, parental occupation, and previous schools attended were copied from school cumulative records. State racial censuses established the racial composition of city schools over a six-year period. After week-long observations in each classroom teachers were rated on Ryans (1960) Characteristics of Teachers Scale. A Sociometric test was the source of information on peer-group friendship patterns. (JM)",

The books are listed under various categories. Of these, fantasy, folklore, and poetry and rhymes may depend largely on an adult for skillful introduction. Folklore has been selected for its relationship to the diverse cultures inherited by some American children. In the category of biography and history are listed books  which can provide a positive image and which may help establish a time concept for children who know only a meager present. Books listed in the categories of intercultural understanding, rural life, and urban life can help relate children of specialized backgrounds to other children. Other categories include arts and hobbies, beginning science, and \"meeting trouble.\" Several books are listed as paperback books for children. Each book is annotated and rated for grade level.

The Foundation was established in 1969 as an expansion of a previously-existing community problems discussion group. TRY's budget for fiscal 1970 was about $90,000; about half of this was used to purchase real estate at the Willowbrook Chapter enclave. TRY's human development objectives include the inculcation of certain values--Protestant Ethic, orthodox religious tenants, and middle-class life style--which are considered preliminary to economic improvement; other programs consider values as a by-product of economic development.

        "description":"The project here reported was conceived as a two-year effort involving analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. Its first year was funded to permit comprehensive, in-depth, comparative study of selected public school Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs in six metropolitan areas. The purpose was to utilize field research methods to construct a dependable normative description of the multifaceted reality of urban ABE. From the study of commonalities, it was proposed to construct an analytical framework of operationally relevant generalizations so that these programs may be better understood and predictions more reliably made about their development. The study was designed to go beyond a pro forma catalog of data about each city's program to analyze qualitative processes over  time, particularly classroom interaction and the perspectives of students and teachers relevant to motivations, and perceptions of students and teachers of the program, each other, and their involvement in ABE. To do this, it was proposed to use interview and participant observation methods in a comparative analytical study designed to produce the beginnings of an inductive theory of practice of urban ABE in the public schools. Beyond description, the study was to be a practical analysis of existing practice. (Author/JM)",

However, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to examine the possibilities of reducing white-nonwhite occupational differences through higher educational levels of minority groups. Findings suggested two policy implications: (1) Attempts to increase educational attainment should be focused at the college level, and (2)  Direct enforcement of anti-discrimination should be focused on middle status jobs which are normally filled with high school graduates.

        "description":"Job tenure is determined by the interaction of such labor demand factors as wages, hours, working conditions, job duties and responsibilities with such labor supply factors as worker preferences and on-the-job performance. At any one point in time these factors vary from one person to the next, and at different points in time different sets of forces are likely to influence the job attachment of the same individual. Nearly all of the evidence examined indicated that a strong correlation between job tenure and age existed among males, females, Negroes, and Caucasians. Other factors which influenced job tenure were military service and compulsory and voluntary retirement. Surveys were made in 1963 and 1968 which estimated the probability of working for the same employer 5 years  later of employees who had 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and 15 or more years of service. In all three length of service classes, retention rates were highest for men in their thirties or forties and lowest for those over 60 years of age. (BC)",

The procedures were similar in each state, with samples being broken into two or three groups and alternately given a live test and a recorded test. The bulk of the data supported the hypothesis that the recorded method produced essentially the same results as the live administration of the same tests. The correlations between the two methods were high enough to consider them equivalent in terms of ranking persons on their ability to take dictation. Some recommendations include: (1) Data on age, education,  and experience should be collected for all subjects, (2) Scores on the new USTES Spelling Test should be available for all subjects, (3) Experimental groups should be similar on demographic variables and Spelling Test scores, and (4) Data should be available on equivalence of test forms used in research studies.

The experimental test battery consisted of three 80-word-per-minute dictation exercises, administered in 50-minute versions by trained examiners during May and June, 1966. Some conclusions were: (1) Either live or recorded dictation test administration is acceptable to examinees, (2) Most examinees prefer taking dictation from a male voice, (3) An analysis of student sample variance verifies that experience rather than test form or method  of instruction exerted the greatest influence on shorthand skill, (4) As measured by Pearson product-moment correlations, there is no consistent relationship between test performance and the personal factors of age, education, amount of shorthand training, and length of shorthand experience, and (5) Although students had less transcription time than job applicants, their mean error scores were considerably lower.

Two types of stability in the employment of Negroes are postulated relating to an industry's responsiveness to community percent Negro, and to the organizational imperatives for a unique racial division of labor. An empirical method for classifying industries according to their stability patterns is also introduced. The results from applying this procedure indicate the presence of a very different industry distribution of Negro labor in small and large proportion Negro communities.

The resulting data were used by educational consultants, who met with the individual physicians to plan educational  programs to meet their needs.

Total nonagricultural employment rose in 28 of 32 months between 1967 and 1969.

Nonsupervisory employment in educational institutions rose by 3 percent between October 1968 and March 1969, while average hours worked per week declined slightly.  Wage adjustments during the period were limited almost entirely to raising the wages of those below the minimum. The average weekly wage bill increase was 0.6 percent, compared to a 1 percent weekly increase required to raise wages to the minimum of $1.45, which became effective on February 1, 1970.

The seven-session pre-retirement program involved 1,329 participants during its 3 years of operation. The program was evaluated through participant evaluation, observation of behavior changes such as having a will drawn or consulting a trust officer, and determination of changes in attitudes and adjustments. The second phase of the project, involving training in program development, was carried out in a 2-day seminar-workshop held during the project's third year of operation. As a result of project activities, a guide book was developed for each of the two phases. The findings show a positive change  in adjustment to retirement among the 50 to 65 age group, as well as an increased involvement in activities to prepare for retirement among those attending the program.

Twelve teachers, with four in each of the three groups, practiced the skill of introducing a lesson during five 5-minute teaching sessions over a period of 3 weeks and were evaluated by a panel of two judges. Variance analysis at the .05 level revealed no significant  difference in performance among the groups over the series of teaching sessions. It was also found that the group receiving face-to-face conference with video feedback increased its performance on teaching session four, while the other two groups decreased their mean performance scores as compared to the mean scores for all groups on teaching session three. It was concluded that all feedback techniques were feasible for field testing, but modifications were recommended in the remote feedback technique. (Author)",

A universal pattern appeared in which higher status children scored better than lower status children in aptitude, achievement, and school grades. Peer reputation largely ran the same way, with mild exceptions. The social differences in aptitude are generally less than the differences in achievement, although some countries appear to be approaching effective equality of educational opportunity. No notable systematic sex differences in performance were observed. Where differences appeared, cultural differences seem to be responsible. To the extent that school achievement is itself an important aspect of coping behavior, the socioeconomic bias evident to some degree in all  countries constitutes something of a deterrent to the optimal development of working-class youth. However, this prejudice is not so complete a deterrent to equality of learning as it potentially could be. Finally, assumptions about the invariant nature and the comparability of the \"same\" measures in different cultures need to be critically scrutinized. The \"same\" measures either are not functionally the same, often, or their results are significantly altered by other influences which may be peculiar to particular societies. (Author/GS)",

Studies which have investigated aptitude-treatment interactions have adopted the homogeneity of regressions test as standard methodology for assessing the difference in regression slopes across treatments. Additional statistical methodology is suggested by which the homogeneity of group regressions can be tested when two or more predictors are present. Before covariate analysis can be used, the homogeneity of group regression must be tested. To test the hypothesis that the slopes are equal for the homogeneity of group regressions for a single covariate, one can follow the standard linear prediction model. For the case in which there are multiple covariates, a test for  homogeneity of regressions provides an overall estimate of the difference between treatments, taking into account the effect of the multiple covariates upon each treatment, simultaneously. Partial hypotheses for a multiple covariate model are presented in order to isolate the cause of overall interaction when treatment slopes with multiple covariates are not equal. Data from two aptitude-treatment investigations are used to illustrate the equations. (CK)",

It is seen that the uses to which test results are put are the chief determiners of the appropriate measurement model. A distinction is made between cut-off scores, criterion scores, and mastery scores. The value of certain test construction procedures in designing criterion-referenced tests for use in adaptive individualized instructional systems is discussed and cautions in the use of traditional procedures are rated. It is concluded that traditional procedures cannot be avoided in some instances, but must be avoided in others. (Author)",

Four areas of concern were: The effects of Title I funds on (a) student performance, (b) dropout rates; and the most effective programs in terms of (c) measurable pupil gains, and (d) most gain per dollar spent. Teacher evaluations of student performance and attitudes were obtained twice in a 2-year period for students in target schools. Questionnaires were used for the initial inquiry with beginning and end of the year composites taken as evidence of change. Comparisons were made between student groups, grades, sex, student attendance, and test scores. Comprehensive tables, descriptions of nearly thirty programs, costs, program participation, assigned program  priorities (in terms of performance), an analysis of student evaluation data, a report on special studies, a comprehensive summary, and conclusions are highlights of this report. The continued use of the student evaluation forms and of the statistical model are recommended to provide data for a continuous evaluation process, since the model proved sensitive enough to detect small performance changes.

        "description":"At the request of the Senate Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has reviewed the policies and procedures for the granting of Federal funds to school districts for desegregation. GAO selected grants made to 50 school districts for its review of approval procedures. In many cases, GAO believes that school districts did not submit sufficient information, so that it was difficult to determine whether or not the school districts' programs qualified for Federal desegregation funds. The files supporting most of the grants reviewed did not evidence full compliance by the school districts with the regulations concerning the formation of biracial and student advisory committees. Also, contrary to regulations, most of the applications did  not contain adequate descriptions of the methods, procedures, or objective criteria that could be used by an independent organization to evaluate the effectiveness of each project. During the investigation, GAO discovered a number of questionable situations, in which Federal grants should not have been approved. This weakness in the procedures was due to the policy of emphasizing the emergency nature of the program and the desire for expeditious funding, at the expense of a more thorough review and evaluation of applications.

        "description":"The experiments here reported represent attempts to produce &quot;equal status interaction&quot; in four-man groups of junior high school boys, two of whom are white and two black. The theory is that equality is not a consequence of interracial task performance. Rather, it is likely that generally held beliefs about the differential competence of the two races affect the new situation via initial expectations, resulting in a differential activity and influence rate, a case of self-fulfilling prophecy. The three experiments used three treatments, respectively. The first involved giving the black subjects (Ss) superior training on a task unrelated to the criterion task, a game situation. The second involved having the black Ss teach the white Ss the training task prior to the game. Neither  was successful in inducing &quot;equal status interaction.&quot; However, a third treatment, in which the black Ss were specifically instructed on the relevance of the training task to the game situation by a black trainer prior to teaching the white Ss, was successful. The implication of these results for educators is the necessity to treat expectations of both black and white Ss to attain racial balance in these integrated groups. The condition in which only black expectations were treated produced results similar to those of previous studies. (Author/JM)",

However, considerable modification and improvement are needed if the tests and services are to support equitable and efficient access to the system of mass postsecondary education. Tests and  services should serve three functions: (1) \"distributive,\" or providing comprehensive and reciprocal descriptions of both students and college programs; (2) \"credentialing,\" or certifying demonstrable educational attainment regardless of college attendance; and, (3) \"educative,\" or instructing students in both subject-matter areas and decision-making.

The objective of the program was to identify and develop the learning styles of the children through a wide variety of school experiences and exposure to multi-media educational approaches with heavy emphasis on cognitive skills, along with language development and mathematical and social concepts. Auxiliary personnel, special equipment and materials, and trips and other activities for children and parents were to aid in the meeting of these objectives. Funds to support the program were not allocated until March, 1969, leaving only three months of the school year for the program to actually function  as planned. Positive outcomes of the program were noted particularly with respect to the degree of parent participation, but it is recommended that funding of subsequent programs of this type take place prior to the onset of the school year in order that well coordinated, carefully organized educational plans be put into effect.

If education is to devise learning models that will maximize individual potential and aid in matching human abilities to the work required by societies, then (1) we must be able to identify and measure diverse human talents, and (2) we must be able to describe the skills and abilities that are needed to improve the world that man inhabits. There are some promising research findings that make obsolete the old academic requirements. Closely related to the identification of talent is the cultivation of talents. There is research evidence for the existence of differences in learning \"styles\". Once again,  we need more options, and it is recommended that research on how people learn continue to probe the use of new media, the effectiveness of work-study programs, the role of affective learning, etc. Research is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to develop new educational options. It is recommended that government jobs serve as experimental models and that industry be encouraged to experiment further in defining job requirements in terms of behaviors instead of credentials.

The big problem seems to be the rather slipshod way the concept is employed. Sometimes one is speaking of cultural integration, again of socioeconomic integration, more likely biological or racial assimilation. These separate dimensions are, then, not considered. One process (e.g. miscegenation) does not, ipso facto, lead to another (e.g. deculturation). Without qualification, the term &quot;integration&quot; is meaningless in explaining anything about culture contact and the complex processes of change and adaptation. Maoris in New Zealand show some tendency toward achieving a kind of cultural integration at the national level;  and New Zealand is remarkably successful in giving the Maori room for such cultural expression. However, at the micro-cultural (subcultural) level, Maoris seem to prefer a kind of democratic pluralism. Integration at this level is seen as a threat to their cultural integrity and hence, an undermining of their ethnic identification.

Traditional social patterns tend to be used as models as long as they serve the community's purposes. In the community of slave and planter in ante-bellum Tidewater Southern U.S.A., a group of privileged blacks known generally as house servants came to function as links between the planters and the majority of slaves. Having their status and privilege defined only by white whim and favor, and behaving properly lest their demeanor infuriate the planter, these blacks assimilated and internalized white attitudes, behavior, and beliefs. Under post-emancipation Jim Crow, there are two racially segregated communities with the white group dominant both socially and economically. However, given the  large numbers of potentially powerful and influential blacks, and the need for black services in maintaining the economic enterprises of the system, whites had to establish lines of communication with the black community. A group of individual black brokers has mediated between the effectively segregated racial groups. These black brokers may be understood as the product of ante-bellum social structure. Their position also is based on status rather than contract. (Author/JM)",

The subjects, third grade students from an inner city elementary school, were exposed to a series of conditions including baseline, behavior contingencies, performance contingencies, and a mix of behavior and performance contingencies using a reversal design. The students worked 100 randomly selected mathematics problems for 20 minutes each day during each period. Behavioral contingencies improved attending and decreased disruptions but did not improve performance. Performance contingencies increased per cent correct problems but attending declined and disruptions increased. The combined contingencies increased both performance and attending. The experiment  was replicated with another class of children varying the sequence of conditions and the amount of token reinforcement that could be earned. The findings emphasize the importance of designing specific contingencies for specific target behaviors. Behavioral contingencies did not have the positive effect on performance often implied, nor were performance contingencies alone able to maintain acceptable classroom behavior. (Author/JM)",

One experimental and one control group, each comprising approximately 36 students, were designated for the study. Subjects were pretested, posttested, and delayed posttested one month after posttesting using both cognitive and attitudinal measures. Analysis of covariance and correlation were used to determine the effect of treatment between groups and the relationship between cognitive achievement and retention to attitude change. The findings indicate statistically significant cognitive-affective attitudinal change immediately after treatment but delayed posttesting indicated no change. The correlation between attttude change and cognitive achievement  were generally significant at .05. The findings suggest that knowledge and attitudes are in constant interaction and that delayed posttesting should be seriously considered in future research. Finally, it is suggested that the component parts of an attitude should be considered in future research of this kind. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Although the great heterogeneity of Afro-American culture makes the identification of unique culture traits extremely difficult, two cultural extremes may be discerned; most people fall somewhere between. Mainstream culture is best exemplified in the life style of middle class white America. Many Negroes strive to copy this life style in their behavior as much as their economic situations allow and apparently most blacks verbalize such aspirations regardless of how they live. At the other extreme are the members of the folk culture; their life styles, whether they live in the city or the country, are essentially unchanged from those of the black tenant farmer or sharecropper of 50 years age. While women tend to resemble the mainstream more in their behavior patterns, men tend to  preserve the folk culture. The differences between the black and white children's perceptions of school can be explained in part in terms of cultural factors. The trickster mentality and the attitude of contest, as well as language and speech style may have at least as much influence as socioeconomic variables, self concept, and teacher bias. Such traits serve as cultural markers, points of identification by which one can know oneself to be a member of one's own group.

Subjects (Ss) participating were first-grade pupils from two large urban school districts in California and Texas. The student population in one school in each district was almost exclusively Negro; the population of a second was Caucasian; and, the third was Mexican-American. Ten boys and ten girls were randomly selected from the dominant ethnic group in one first-grade class at each of the six schools. Four pairs of 11 by 14 inch black-and-white illustrations were prepared for use as stimulus materials. Each pair depicted an environmental setting frequently appearing in the every-day experiences of children. One illustration depicted an  inner-city scene representing the designated setting, the other a suburban scene. Each subject was shown one pair of illustrations at a time by the experimenter until he had responded to the four pairs. The 120 Ss selected an average of 2.47 suburban settings, or 62 percent, and 1.53 inner-city settings, or 38 percent. Both black children, 74 percent, and Caucasian children, 62 percent, selected suburban settings more often than inner-city settings. Mexican-American children selected the two types of settings approximately an equal number of times. [This document has been reproduced from the best available xerox copy of the paper.] (Author/DM)",

Specific examination of the decentralization bill, the politics of the election, and the election procedures increases understanding of the present makeup of the boards and their capacity for reform of educational policies. The influence of the churches and other organized groups with self-interest motives was overwhelming; the Decentralization Act itself created many obstacles; and the Board of Education and the Board of Elections abdicated their responsibilities in this election. Finally, the election procedure of proportional representation  completed the process which blocked the election of a sufficient percentage of &quot;grass roots&quot; people to these boards.

His outlook is an authentic summary of the intellectual convictions of the vast majority of white Americans today. This \"psychology of whiteness\" is the academic explanation for the concept of racism. Scholars have historically amassed data which supported the concept of racial inequality. The black community has developed a massive disenchantment with integration, and has begun to move toward the \"politics of blackness,\" which is not racist but affirms the right to survive. The racist term \"disadvantaged\" should be replaced by the term \"disequalized\" which more accurately reflects the condition of oppressed minority  groups. There are other educational and psychological concepts which are equally demeaning and inaccurate, including many concepts in intelligence testing. Educational accountability will help to change some of the present educational criteria. Psychological research must also be redirected for improved contributions to human progress. (Author/DM)",

The aims of the research were to determine actual numbers of students leaving school prior to graduation; to analyze factors involved in the decision to leave school; to compare dropouts with a random sample of non-leavers; and to follow up leavers to assess their progress and retrospective attitudes toward school. School leavers tended to belong to the lower class; have an increased absentee rate; have more academic difficulty and failure; be kept back; and be more negatively evaluated by their teachers. While it would appear that the leaver made his own decision in most cases, interviews revealed that leavers and their parents were given the choice of \"orderly withdrawal or  suspension,\" and they selected \"orderly withdrawal.\" Parents also discussed futile efforts to have the child's program altered, resulting in increased disinterest in school. Most were unemployed and retrospectively regretted or questioned their decision to leave school. (Author/DM)",

All the participants, including a control group of 79 teachers, were interviewed in an attempt to find demographic, dual role, and social-psychological variables that differentiated teachers who included wage-earning emphases from those who did not. Results suggested a positive relationship between wage-earning emphases and being married, maintaining socioeconomic status, having taught longer, high professional involvement, high self-rating of teaching  effectiveness, and others. In addition to the interviews, each workshop was evaluated, and pre- and posttests were administered at the conclusion of the workshops. As a result of this pilot study, a followup study is in process. Several study instruments are appended. (SB)",

A questionnaire was sent to 351 vocational-technical schools that offered no transfer programs, and a slightly different version was sent to 689 community or junior colleges offering both college transfer work and vocational-technical programs. Data were requested on counseling, research, data collection, program completion, transfer rates, and graduates' employment experiences. The results showed that vocational schools collected more extensive standardized data for selection purposes, whereas community colleges provided more comprehensive counseling. Research by community colleges was oriented toward demographic studies, unlike the  vocational schools, which mainly conducted studies of student satisfaction and success both in school and after leaving. Vocational school graduates were less likely to transfer or drop out. (Author/BH)",

The purpose of the elementary industrial arts phase is to introduce pupils to the world of work. Grades 7-8 provide students with exploratory experiences and are prevocational in nature, and the high school offers a complete vocational education program. A comprehensive study of modern industry and occupational  orientation is provided for in Grade 9, followed by mechanical drawing in Grade 10. Vocational part-time cooperative education and vocational counseling are integral parts of the program. It is recommended that as much of the program be put into effect each year as qualified staff, facilities, and finances will allow. A detailed course sequence is provided in the appendixes. (GEB)",

To analyze recruitment and retention of personnel in the face of this changing professionalism, this report compares the spring 1965 graduates with a national sample of practicing rehabilitation counselors. A 3-year longitudinal study was used to analyze changes in various social characteristics and attitudes. The retention problem among recent graduates is attributed to a lack of professionalism and challenge in the work without salaries and working conditions good enough to compensate. The report concludes that immediate improvement can be made by changing educational programs to increase commitment and self-esteem,  although a permanent solution will require an overhaul of the entire system.

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to determine the need for pedagogical training as perceived by practicing instructors and academic administrators in two postsecondary technical and vocational institutes. To collect the needed data an instrument was developed to elicit opinions on (1) the importance and need of certain skills and knowledges to an instructor, (2) the helpfulness of suggested inservice and supervisory activities in the improvement of instruction, and (3) the best methods for developing practical teaching skills in the beginning instructor. Statistical analysis revealed that: (1) Competencies important to an instructor include communication skills, school management, and the development and maintenance of discipline, (2) Inservice and supervisory activities  helpful in improving teaching include demonstrations of teaching methods, practice teaching with video-tapes, and observation of fellow instructors, (3) The most effective methods for developing practical teaching skills in a new instructor are a period of internship, student teaching, or practice teaching sessions, and (4) The perceived need for pedagogical training is influenced by such factors as work area, staff position, and technical qualifications. This M.A. thesis was presented to the University of Alberta. (Author/JS)",

        "description":"The problem of this study was to identify the cause of the physical and emotional problems encountered by older women who have returned to work after a prolonged absence. Such information, it was believed, would be valuable to business and educational institutions in retraining or updating prospective secretarial employees. Data for the study were gathered by a mail questionnaire sent to older women currently working for 17 business firms in the Salt Lake-Ogden-Provo market area. Several conclusions were formulated as a result of the findings. Among these conclusions were that (1) Family obligations and age are the causes of most emotional anxiety for older women returning to secretarial employment, (2) Lack of proficiency in the technical skills is an area of major concern to  older women, and (3) A workshop or similar review course in the secretarial skills is desirable to enable older women to return to work in secretarial positions. One recommendation is that schools on the postsecondary level develop and initiate programs for the retraining of older women in the secretarial skills. (Author)",

The data came from the Texas Education Agency, the Texas Employment Commission, and various other public and private agencies. The small enrollment in vocational programs limits the system's success in meeting manpower needs. This problem is aggravated by a lack of relevancy of training for employment. Analysis of current and projected employment shows that the system has failed to adapt to a changing labor market. The report concludes that the Texas vocational system is inflexible, traditional, and behind the times. New and innovative courses will be necessary to make education meaningful  and relevant. Recommendations included hiring a team of labor market consultants to evaluate present labor trends in Texas, removing home economics from the vocational curriculum, and setting up more new and innovative programs.

The project had a positive impact on improving the attitudes of labor members toward the people in Appalachia, it helped bring out the leader qualities in the trainees, and it strengthened many efforts toward  erasing the poverty conditions.

The emphasis was on both the training of local leaders by state leaders and direction of evaluation programs by local leaders. Using the results of two previous projects, this particular project generalizes the findings to other states. The methods used to acquire and disseminate information were workshops, project reporting meetings, final report and project evaluation meetings, and on-site visits. The results of the project indicate that most of the evaluation procedures are applicable to other states, that some additional procedures were developed by individual  states, and that program evaluation competencies were developed in the personnel involved in the project. It was recommended that states meeting the criteria for selection of states used in this study try out the systems. Further study and a nationwide training program were also recommended. (GEB)",

Recommendations covered the six areas of students and student services, curriculums and programs, professional staff, administrative organization, physical facilities, and finance. Three of the 46 specific recommendations were: (1) The state should concentrate on recruiting  individuals who could best profit from vocational and technical education, (2) An overall master plan for all of Iowa education should be developed, and (3) The community colleges should be administered under state guidelines developed specifically for them.

Finally, Illich's own views on public education and the learning process are set forth. He calls for the abolition of compulsory schooling in view of what he considers the idolatrous worship of formal education and certification, and the institutional failures of education, around the world. Illich also urges that the drift of adult education toward institutional status be reversed to help make way for informal educational networks  based on mutual inquiry and on lifelong access to educational opportunities of one's own choosing.

The instrument used to survey attitudes of the New Careerists was based on the marginal man theory and statistical analysis of the data gathered from the questionnaire. It was hypothesized that their marginal status would hinder professionalization in terms of attitudes and skills acquisition. The subjects were 200 New Careerists in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The data indicated that New Careerists did become professionalized but only in specific ways  (professional mandate and universalistic criteria of judgment) and that the marginality hypothesis was not supported. The implication was that while New Careerists were professionalized to a degree, the bridging function was not lost. They took on professional ways of handling their job situations, while maintaining their loyalties and characteristics as members of the low income community. (DM)",

The latter reported lower levels of peer leadership, higher levels of intervening variables pertaining to the organization as a whole, and greater satisfaction with the company. There were no differences between those in stable and those in unstable structure on reported levels of supervisory leadership, general working conditions, intervening variables pertaining to the work  group, and mental health. The findings are interpreted as indicating that work group structure can be more costly to the organization than the lack of stable work group structure. Another possibility is that unstable structure triggers development of coping mechanisms that facilitate interaction across subunit boundaries, increasing linkage. Other interpretations and implications of the findings are discussed. (The questionnaire is included.) (Author/PT)",

The data revealed that the three groups were dissimilar in their exposure to the socializing influences of professionalization. Although analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between groups on any of the attitudinal attributes, multiple regression analysis found few  significant predictors of any of the attitudinal attributes, and none that had impact across organizations. The study concluded that adult educators are not a population, and that professionalization does not necessarily proceed on a uni-dimensional continuum. (Author/PT)",

American agriculture today is now partly a highly commercialized technological business and partly a mass of small-scale commercial farms and rural residential places, with both parts having new relationships with nonfarm economic development, generally urban centered. Farming is valued more as a business than a life style. But just as important are the changes in rural economics due to the tremendous impact of economic and technological change upon local institutions and community living, with the  resultant adjustments that must take place. And the adjustments for meeting the changes involve both economics and human values. (Author/DM)",

The basic premise is that a typical organization fosters two opposing conditions--condition of stability and orderliness in order to protect its functioning and internal relationships; and a condition stimulating creativity and innovation in order to keep up with the myriad of changes that affect it. Furthermore, knowledge and information flow can be on the one hand inhibited by organizational features that preserve the status quo and, on the other hand, facilitated by the methods that encourage innovation. The flow of communication into an organization may be impeded by different status levels and coding schemes between organizations and rigid social relationships,  lack of openness to outsiders, local pride, anticipatory personal threat, poor training strategy, and the organization's economic situation. Knowledge input may be improved by appeal to profit, chief administrator changes, administrative decree, crisis perception, examination of organizations, good training techniques, usage of external agent, invasion from outside, knowledge seeking subunits, and enhanced professionalism. Information transmission out of the organization depends upon its goals. (Author/DM)",

These auxiliary methods generally showed advantages in reaching scattered populations, coping with shortages of trained and skilled teachers, and enabling adults to study at home during leisure time. Used with ETV, CS enabled students to proceed at their own pace. Used with ETV, CS appeared to lose much of its flexibility but produce more effective learning. CS and PI proved conducive to active student participation and effective feedback.  However, certain methods showed disadvantages in cost, feedback, and opportunity for practical work. Detailed guidelines were offered for administering and planning effective multimedia CS programs. The current state of British correspondence study and educational broadcasting was also examined, with particular attention to the newly inaugurated (January 1971) Open University.

General information (age, sex, residence, marital and family status) was sought, along with data on occupation and income, plans to continue one's education, tuition or nontuition status as students, perceived quality of instruction received, attitudes (including most and least valuable required and elective subjects), and suggestions for improving the program. These were some conclusions: (1) age, sex, marital status, occupation, or number of children need not deter adults wishing to complete their secondary education; (2)  half the graduates have received promotions and job changes, and half of these attribute them directly or indirectly to the adult program; (3) graduates approve of the quality of instruction and recommend the program to others; (4) over 40% of the graduates desire postsecondary education and/or more high school subjects; (5) the graduates (largely residing locally) and their communities are realizing many tangible and intangible benefits.

A general design for such a test is suggested, including three classes of items. Class A items are designed to measure the student's knowledge of how to conduct oneself in a variety of everyday situations common to the target culture; Class B items probe the student's understanding of general patterns of social interaction that are common to many specific situations; and Class C items test how successfully the student can adopt temporarily the world-view of the target culture. In general, the student  must first identify the ways in which target-culture norms are being violated in a recorded episode, then describe alternate moves which would correct these violations.

        "description":"Knowledge of results (KOR) is most frequently cited as the reinforcer in self-instructional systems. The printed answer in a programmed text, for example, is supposed to reinforce the response the student emits previous to observing that answer. Some other possible reinforcers are briefly discussed in this paper before the literature on KOR in self-instruction was selectively reviewed. The review was organized as a search for evidence that KOR might appropriately be called a reinforcer. Studies comparing programs with and without feedback were examined; the weight of evidence from these global studies was that feedback did not enhance learning, as measured by immediate post-test scores or by retention tests. In at least one case there seemed to be a decrement in performance  traceable to the presentation of feedback. Studies in which \"schedules of reinforcement\" were varied similarly failed to show effects that would be expected if KOR were acting as a reinforcer. One major study involving delay of KOR did report the effect expected when delivery of a reinforcer is delayed. Other studies on delay do not replicate this finding. Finer grained analyses of student behavior and KOR begin to reveal specific conditions under which KOR seems to be acting as a reinforcer. (Author/AMM)",

The work is based on a study of 36 authors representing 12 Arab geographic areas. One or more works of each author was chosen; their prose was analyzed and categorized \"in precise linguistic terms using a comprehensive description of each sentence with its components as well as its vocabulary.\" The analyzed products were then fed into a computer from which grammatical constructions were studied. The prose writings revealed that modern Arabic prose falls into three style types: modern  simple style, pure middle style, and grandiose style. Illustrations of each style are presented and discussed. (AMM)",

The difference between the codes of the two languages can be measured by one technique and the differences in samples of discourse by another. The samples may be measured as static entities covering a certain space, or as dynamic or kinetic sequences unrolling in time. The distance between two languages may be measured as the sum of their differences or as the amount of work necessary to convert one language into another. Each can be measured either by taking all the characteristics in which two languages can differ and counting the number of differences in each, or by integrating the immediately observable differences  into a single formula of measurement.

Pre-study equivalence was established for the two groups on the basis of personality characteristics, levels of positive mental health, verbal ability, selected background data, and academic motivation. No differences were found between those students who did and did not see their counselors. Further, for those students who did see their counselors, the findings indicated that both groups perceived the interpersonal responses of their counselors  in the same way, and that they brought similar problems to them. The study concludes that the teacher-counselor's role does not limit the number or nature of his counseling contacts. No evidence was produced against having a student counseled by one who also teaches him. (TL)",

Conclusions indicate that: (1) at the time of followup, 75% of the rehabilitants studied were productively engaged in competitive or sheltered employment or as homemakers; (2) 60% of the rehabilitants formerly on Public Assistance were removed from the welfare rolls; and (3) economic benefits in terms  of increased earnings and reduced welfare payments equalled the cost of all rehabilitation services within a period of less than one year.

The program planning process is considered from three prospectives beginning with a brief discussion of the current state of program development in higher education. It is conjectured that the present financial squeeze is likely to continue for the next decade and consequently it will be difficult to obtain financial resources for new programs and there will be pressure for more effective management of resources. Though growth may be slowed, a number of positive incentives may emerge from these conditions. The next section examines the necessary preparation within the admissions and registrar's offices and it is proposed that this  preparation include a critical evaluation of current operations including organizational goals, patterns of staffing, contributions of technology, and adequacy of procedures. The final section discusses yardsticks likely to be applied in the evaluation of program plans. Examples are: (1) Does the past performance of the admissions officer/registrar inspire trust in his ability? (2) Is the program clearly constructed and alternatives provided? and (3) Does the program further the overall goals of the institution? (RSM)",

Another purpose was to determine if various success rate measures were related to the students assessment of the college. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant differences between the various groups in their perception of instruction; student services; and college practices, policies, and facilities; and that there would be no significant relationship between student success and their perception of these factors. One hundred students in each program  completed the Institutional Self Study Survey and their responses were analyzed to determine significant differences. The only significant difference between the groups was in their evaluation of selected student services; in all other cases the null hypotheses were supported.

A model is proposed which involves the development of student interdependence on common tasks, the use of group incentives which may be earned through competition with a standard or with other groups, and the exchange of student resources in teaching and learning. In contrast to the prevailing emphasis on similarity for grouping in schools and classrooms, it is argued that individual differences in age, skills, and socio-cultural experiences should be thought of as resources for exchange in student relationships. Such resources represent a potential basis for a division of labor and student teaching in the student collective. Some issues associated with student heterogeneity and relationships in comprehensive  schools are explored. Student similarity and differences as a basis for groups are evaluated with emphasis on their consequences for intellectual growth, student solidarity, and conflict. In the final portion of the essay conditions which are supportive of an equitable student exchange are described. (RSM/Author)",

Despite federal legislation and state laws banning sex discrimination, the need to improve women's relative position in the economy is still urgent. It is claimed that occupationally women are more disadvantaged today in comparison to men than they were thirty years ago. Consequently there is a strong need to grant women equal opportunity in terms of job training, educational programs, occupational entrance, advancement, and salary.

There is a difference, however, in the level of achievement which tends to fulfill the two groups and communication between adults and youth about these basic needs tends to break down. Young people's desire to improve their interaction with peers and adults often leads them to experiment with sex, alcohol, and drugs (SAD). For many adults and counselors reality about the SAD scene is a personal threat and they tend to impose their values upon young  people without listening or trying to understand. Counselor training must be changed or expanded in an effort to help counselors and young people communicate more effectively on these tension producing subjects and to accept each other as worthwhile individuals.

A major thrust to improve the role of women in academe is developing from diverse sources and one of these efforts is a survey conducted by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) to document aspects of the role of women in higher education. Of AAUW's member institutions, 454 responded to a questionnaire which explored personnel policies affecting women, special programs designed for mature women students, women's participation in decision making, utilization of women's abilities in major offices and committees, and general attitudes of administration regarding women. Results support the growing data that women do not  have equal status with men in academe. At every level - student body, administration, faculty, and trustees - women are under-represented or placed in positions with little power. Institutional and organizational policies which may contribute to discrimination or hinder professional development should be identified and changed. Active recruitment of women for administrative and faculty positions should be encouraged. Only then can women realize their professional potential. (RSM/Author)",

When any of the students behaved inappropriately, the clock was turned off and a buzzer was sounded. The group contingent conditions substantially increased the  percent of task relevant behavior emitted by the subjects.

A review of legislation on the handling of narcotics is given, and several explanations are given for the difficulty in suppressing narcotics traffic. Finally, the controversy over whether drug usage should be considered purely an illness, strictly a crime, or a combination of both is discussed. The methods most widely employed, usually in combination, to combat narcotics use are described. These  include: (1) imprisonment; (2) hospitalization, with medical and psychological services; (3) institutional group counseling; (4) community surveillance and testing; (5) casework programs in the community; and (6) mutual aid organizations of ex-addicts.

It distinguishes between direct and indirect evaluation of the product and the process. Aspects of PPS which make evaluation difficult, but not impossible are noted: (1) the provision of PPS is partially an art and its specification can only be approached; (2) the product is a dynamic developing person and control and observation are properly limited; and (3) goals are difficult to operationalize. An evaluation paradigm which can be followed by PPS professionals is described and applied, by way of illustration, to a dropout prevention program. (TL)",

His impressions, from the vantage point of industry (i.e. the placement end of the vocational counseling sequence), suggest flaws in the educational-counseling system, resulting in inappropriate, inexperienced and unqualified job applicants. The differences between a counseling approach and the industrial personnel approach to job seekers/holders are enumerated. Trends and circumstances which may affect the infusion of counseling into industrial relations systems are discussed.

The development of a staff capable of responding to the particular needs of this population is briefly discussed and the resultimg teamwork informally evaluated. In learning how to assist these students to survive in their new university environment, six hypotheses were stated and used as take-off points for the development of an effective program: (1) traditional instruction had not worked; (2) there were large gaps in skill areas; (3) there would be extremely divergent perceptions of the university; (4) hostility and/or apathy could be anticipated; (5) long term goal orientation would generally be lacking; and (6) the intellectual potential of the students would be equal  to that of regularly enrolled students. Within this set of hypotheses, a wide repertoire of approaches to learning basic skills emerged. One such approach to language as a communication process is explained. No formal evaluation has yet been attempted, but the authors feel that the environment, the personalized teaching \"techniques,\" and their general way of regarding individuals have made a difference.

The census bureau has been collecting data since 1966 on the labor market experience of four groups in our population: men 45-59 years of age, women 30-44, and young men and women 14-24. From this longitudinal study, although its findings are still premature, information indicates that: (1) job changes are not as harmful for young men as heretofore considered; (2) possession both typing and shorthand skills for both young and mature black women puts them in a better position in the labor market than those with neither skill or with typing alone; (3) schools and counselors need to take a much more realistic  approach to girls who face the problem of raising a family with inadequate education and training for work; and (4) there is a need for continuing education and upgrading for mature women to prevent a downward occupational movement when re-entering the labor force. Questions are also raised concerning the need for a more flexible school system, more vocational training, better counseling services to black youth and better labor market information. (Author/TA)",

Few delivery systems have been influenced by the community mental health model. The major reason for this lack of influence appears to be the \"in loco parentis\" stance of colleges and universities. A campus mental health service stemming from a community model would have as its cornerstones community participation and the development, delivery, and evaluation of services, intervention at both community and individual levels and focus upon preventive intervention strategies. Fundamental questions that must be raised when adopting the community model are: what is the counseling services or mental health services role in relation to other systems operating on campus  and its role in relation to its largest constituency--students.

This paper presents a rationale for examining the effects of the T-group on introverts and extroverts. Two T-group styles were examined, a sensory awareness group and a verbal cognitive group. Results indicate that the sensory awareness group is more profitable to both personality types, and that there is a direct relationship between personality type and profit in a T-group. While profit was less for the introvert, there was reason to believe that an extended group experience might have been more profitable. Profit was measured by quantifying emotional reactions to  the on-going group process at timed sampling intervals via Homan's Social Exchange model. Poker chips were used as symbolic representations of positive and negative effect. (Author)",

This experiment was designed to vary in an orthogonal design (1) perceived similarity between a subject and another person, and (2) classically acquired attitudes toward that person. After receiving treatments which conditioned a positive, negative or neutral attitude toward a name, the subjects interacted with another person bearing that name who was made to appear similar or dissimilar to the subject. The subject then expressed acceptance or rejection of the other person. In this way, the effects of similarity-dissimilarity and conditioned affect could be  assessed independently. The results support the view that perceived similarity is a determinant of attraction among people and tend also to support earlier findings (Berkowitz and Knurek) that attitudes conditioned to a name generalize to a person bearing that name, at least when the degree of similarity of that person to the subject is not made salient.

The points of correspondence between AAAS tasks and activities and Piaget's concrete and formal operations are noted for each of the main objectives within each of the 8 basic and 6 integrated processes. Bruner's stages of enactive, ikonic, and symbolic reasoning as well as his work on concept and principle learning are also used to interpret the psychological basis for AAAS objectives and activities. The logical analysis of AAAS objectives and tasks presented shows that: (1) most  objectives and tasks in the basic processes of the curriculum have an empirical basis in psychological research; and (2) many objectives and tasks in the integrated processes have little basis in psychological research.

Poor construction management is considered the major contributor to project time problems. To provide a continuity of project management, the position of construction manager -- a professional level job for a person skilled in all phases of construction who would represent the owners' interests -- is proposed.

Within each of these populations there was a wide range of agreement on the items. Little variation existed in the views of the populations from one community to another, with the exception of superintendents. Likewise, within the same community, the views of the populations were relatively similar, with teachers having slightly more agreement about their own role than did citizens. When teachers were asked to estimate the differences between their  views and those of other populations, they tended to overestimate differences between their views and those of citizens and to underestimate differences between their views and those of their principals.

At the same time, the concept of learning centers in each community is explored, utilizing and training parents as teachers. Teacher education training sessions are described with attention to the demonstration method, preceded and followed by discussion. Also considered are the facilities (usually the home of a teacher), instructional materials, and daily activities. The growth of the early childhood centers is noted to be from none to 135 in two years; planned growth and additional needs are depicted.  (RJ)",

Primary learning-handicaps are defined as aspects of impairment of temperament which are in evidence in the child's general behavior. Failure arising either from the primary handicaps or from cultural disadvantagement is said to cause secondary behavioral handicaps called pseudo-adjustments (avoidances and compensations). How such learning disabilities may amount to a de facto retardation or pseudo-retardation is pointed out. Techniques of assessment and remediation are reviewed. A Guide to the Recording of the Child's Behavior  in the Learning Situation is presented, in which the unproductive learning-strategies are grouped under 14 headings.

The scale is normed on elementary grade subjects; and item reliability and validity estimations are completed on the scale. Stage two consists of a 62 item behavior rating scale which is divided evenly between items to measure acting out behavior and items measuring withdrawn behavior. A behavioral observation form was developed for the purpose of measuring task oriented behavior. The form allows simultaneous observation of 13  behaviors, and contains codes for classroom setting, the social consequences of child behavior, and the social agent supplying the consequence.

The effects of three experimental strategy were investigated to facilitate generalization of treatment effects following 2 months in a token economy classroom. Forty four subjects were assigned to one of three experimental strategies, peer group reprograming, equation of external stimulus conditions, and teacher training in behavior management techniques, which were implemented in the regular classroom for a 2 month period. The amount of deviant behavior produced by the subjects was the dependent variable. The average for all 44 subjects was felt to show behavior maintenance effects from treatment during followup. The token economy was considered to have a powerful  treatment effect.

        "description":"The document is the fifth in a six part research report on the assessment and treatment of deviant behavior in children. In attempting to reprogram a social environment so as to maintain behaviors modified in an experimental setting, researchers felt that it was essential that the reprograming take into account the teacher's role as a controlling agent in the regular classroom. Two studies were designed, one to investigage classroom control as a function of teacher dispensed social reinforcers, and the other to collect data on the relationships between the teacher's consequation effects and production of appropriate and inappropriate behavior and to measure the changes in the teacher's consequating behavior. In the latter experiment, the results from the behavioral observations  of 44 subjects were felt to indicate that the deviant child got more than twice his share of attention and that 40% was due to inappropriate behavior. The first study, conducted over a period of 11 weeks in a fifth grade setting, was noted as indicating a high probability of teacher attention to inappropriate behavior (77% of teacher's attention). Systematic manipulation of the amount of teacher attention produced changes in rates of behavior for non-deviant subjects, making the deviant and non-deviant subjects more similar in behavior. (CD)",

Underachieving students in reading were compared to their achieving classmates; in grade 3 there was a significant difference between the two groups on the level of discouragement. By sixth grade the underachievers exhibited a less desirable social adjustment and participated less in class discussions. Short attention span and sensitivity about weight and speech were recurring characteristics of underachievers. The feeling of having a place  among his peers and being assured of it, and a feeling of personal worth and appreciation were the only variables that continued to correlate consistently with the child's overall academic accomplishment throughout the first nine years of school.

They feel that learning is a multivariant process and that task analysis should also take into consideration an analysis of the learning task, the cognitive processes which affect the acquisition of the learning task, and the learner's personality variables which may interact with the task and/or process of acquisition. Task analysis techniques must go beyond the formal-procedural (training) domain into what is termed a \"thematic-principle\" domain. They propose three procedures for such an analysis: specification of an appropriate cognitive process, an analysis of task structure, and an analysis of the contribution of aptitude measures on task performance. To  demonstrate the feasibility of such an analytical procedure, a developmental research project is described which involved the manipulation of several sequence variables. (JY)",

Examinations of the results from a variety of earlier field studies showed consistently positive relationships between amount of interpersonal discussion and exposure to relevant mass media messages. In a secondary analysis of news exposure data, the number of groups with which individuals discussed news events was associated with the amount of time they spent reading newspapers and magazines. Another secondary analysis yielded strong correlations between frequency of talking about a political campaign and level of exposure to campaign coverage in the electronic and print media. An experiment investigating news information seeking in a sample of high  school students showed that students who expected to participate in an informal discussion with other students about national, local, or school problems tended to select a greater amount of the appropriate type of news (either national or local items) in the course of their normal mass media use, but they did not actively seek out additional media sources.

This proposition was tested during the 1970 Wisconsin gubernatorial campaign by means of a questionnaire mailed to volunteer campaign workers. Workers from both major parties reported that they had paid close attention to advertising for both their own and the opposition candidate. They felt the ads boosted staff morale and made them feel more confident of victory. They discussed among themselves the ads for both candidates and used information from them to sway voters. The need to persuade voters led workers to watch and read the opponents'  ads and think of counter-arguments to rebut them. Strong correlation is reported between the workers' opinion of the ads and their belief that the ads boosted confidence and morale and increased the amount of discussion and information gain. Advertisements were not a significant factor in recruiting new volunteers. (JK)",

To date, data for these studies has come from adults who are members of national mail panels. Information on AOI's, demographics, media usage, media preferences, and product or brand usage is obtained. The data is then analyzed in one of two ways. Correlational analysis indicates the difference in life styles between users and nonusers of  a product or readers of one magazine versus those of another magazine. Cluster analysis divides the sample by life style and relates those life styles to product use or media preference. Examples from previous life style studies illustrate the two techniques.

A telephone survey was conducted to see what effect such commercials had on voters in the 1970 Wisconsin and Colorado gubernatorial elections. The results showed that this approach is the most efficient way of reaching a vast majority of the electorate, although it may not reach voters who are politically uninterested or who are light television viewers. Frequency of presentation has a direct impact on frequency of viewer exposure but has no effect on the viewer's level of attention. Quality of presentation (whether the ads are perceived as informative, interesting, honest, entertaining, and professionally produced) combines with audience characteristics (personal interest, partisan preferences,  and need for knowledge and enjoyment) to determine attention and information gain. These content factors then work indirectly to influence voting decisions or produce shifts in voting intentions. Based on this analysis, the most effective advertising strategy would be one that allocates campaign funds away from a high frequency of exposure into a more modest number of ads which contain substantive information content and are presented in an interesting and entertaining manner.

A computer-assisted test model for assessing an examinee's proficiency in a set of skills for which a hierarchy of prerequisite relationships is known to exist was developed and evaluated. The test model calls for the random construction of items using item generation rules stored in the computer--an item sampling procedure that permits the test constructor to control for classification errors--and a branching strategy that tailors testing to the individual student in accordance with his  competencies. Results with an individualized mathematics program showed the computer test to be highly successful in providing reliable information in substantially less time than was required by conventional methods, even though the sample included students with wide variations in competencies represented by the test unit. The reduction of time required for testing is attributed to the routing strategy rather than the item sampling procedure. (Author/MT)",

It provides a programing structure and a body of debugged and documented routines to programers who write for the LRDC/TSS. Although it is used largely for  computer-assisted instruction and on-line laboratory application, most of the routines are general purpose. IMP has a conditional assembly feature, which permits the programer to identify sections of the code that should be assembled only if a specified condition is met. This guide defines the conventions governing memory allocation, subroutine cells, input/output, and some miscellaneous function routines. This IMP-type solution would seem to be appropriate for laboratory installations with smaller computers and applications for which there are no suitable, higher level languages available.

        "description":"Past studies of media credibility have yielded contradictory results. In some research, television has the most credibility, while in others, radio or newspapers have the most. A probable reason for this is the way survey questions are phrased. In asking for a \"major source of news,\" some questions focus on the \"most likely medium\" for news in general, others on the \"most likely medium\" for a specific news story, and others ask for the responder's \"most frequent choice\" of medium. Because these phrases vary and because questions are offered in a forced-choice format, inconsistent results occur. A multivariate approach to the questions of credibility and usage is, therefore, preferable. The approach should be concerned not only with the characteristics of the individual, but also  with the characteristics of the information presented and the particular characteristics of the specific newspapers, television stations, or radio stations which the individual uses as the basis for his general judgments concerning newspapers, television and radio.

        "description":"A prototype computer-based instructional management system is described which is designed to individualize instruction in an on-going school situation. The prototype consists of three basic components: a set of instruments and techniques for assessing student needs, a bank of curriculum packets related to assessed needs, and a computer-based system for relating individual needs to available curriculum options. The student evaluation system consists of terminal measures, diagnostic tests, measures of learner characteristics, and progress tests. Curriculum packets are coded in nine ways to provide a practical basis for structuring the learning experiences of students and still allow considerable flexibility for changes and the addition of new material. A computer matching system  prescribes an individualized learning path for each student by matching the student's assessment file to the curriculum catalog. In addition to instructional management, the system can also assist in research and evaluation and in administrative management. The prototype has been used at the Center for Individually Prescribed Learning Activities at Conwell Middle Magnet School in Philadelphia. A discussion of their experience in using the system demonstrates its potential for solving educational problems. (JY)",

        "description":"Certain definitions and theoretical structures, accompanied by Venn diagrams, are used to distinguish several dimensions of international and interracial communication. International communication occurs on a political level between representatives of nations. Intercultural communication is communication between individuals of different cultures with no previous colonial relationship. Contracultural communication occurs between individuals of different cultures where one culture has superimposed its values upon the other and created a dominant/submissive relationship. Interracial communication (for example, between whites and non-whites in the United States) has non-whites occupying a marginal position in the society and thereby introducing resentment and strain into the  interaction. Interethnic communication occurs between members of various non-white groups who have shared the experience of being a racial minority in a white-dominated structure. Other dimensions considered in the model include economic class stratification and the multi-ethnic composition of the white power structure, both of which complicate the possibilities for interracial communication. The purpose of the model is to describe communication as it exists which may allow a diagnosis of the causes of communication breakdown among groups. (Author/JK)",

The system attempts to simulate the psychoneurological processes which enable man to communicate verbally. It uses a modified stratificational grammar model and is being programed in PL/1 (a programing language) for an IBM 360/67 computer. In its present state of development, ARIS uses a crude simulator of verbal communication similar to Weizenbaum's ELIZA program. From this base an attempt will be made to develop a concept network having human-like characteristics. The stratification model will be extended to the concept strata, using Piaget's developmental theories regarding the dynamic nature of knowledge. The two necessary characteristics for the structure of  knowledge--hierarchical and dynamic relations-- will then be the natural consequences of the resulting network. (Author/JY)",

This type of data can be a valuable source of feedback in such situations as a teachers' inservice training program. In this approach, observed behaviors are classified into one or more of 10 different categories, and a digit is assigned to describe each category. An observer uses a touch telephone data set to transmit the appropriate number code for each behavior directly to the computer. The computer analyzes this data and provides feedback to the observer in the following forms: a sequential tally of each code used, an interaction analysis frequency matrix, an interaction analysis relative-frequency matrix, a redefinition of categories, and a value for several variables  derived from the frequency matrix. Examples of coding systems which have been used in &quot;live&quot; classroom situations are considered. Several possible applications of the data collection method to answer questions about classroom behavior are suggested. For example, a teacher might want to know whether or not he uses student ideas immediately after a student has commented or the extent to which he involves each student in discussion. Examples of a consultant's interaction with the system and cost estimates are included. (JY/MT)",

        "description":"Since television programs portray a wide variety of masculine styles, this aspect of a program may become the most important feature for adolescent boys seeking information about ideal prototypes. The program preferences of a sample of 14-year-old boys, evenly divided between white and black and between aggressive and non-aggressive subjects, were studied. Non-aggressive blacks watched shows featuring vulnerable males, who are weak and dependent on others for help. Aggressive black viewers preferred programs starring tactical males, who are adept problem solvers but whose underdog positions require them to use strategy and surprise instead of force and coercion. Non-aggressive whites liked programs about protective males and their capacity to fill a woman's place in the family.  Aggressive whites like forceful male heroes, men whose position allows them to compel others to comply with them or whose characters are so strong that they determine their own lives. These programs, then, both reflect and perpetuate mass culture stereotypes of masculine roles. A boy's choice of programs helps reinforce the viability of one of these styles as a model for his own manhood. (JK)",

        "description":"In man-computer communication, the computer responds only as it is programed to respond. A human's response is more complicated because it depends on the \"pre-programed\" ways that humans process information. The three functions a man performs on received information are conservation (in which messages are retained whole), reduction (in which messages are condensed), and creation. Each of these functions subsumes several more specific functions labeled transforms. These transforms or sub-functions are described and quantitative measures assigned to them where possible. The area of information conservation includes discussions of short-term memory, veridical memory span, chunking, and proactive inhibition. Transforms relating to reduction are filtering, condensation, and  contingent. Information creation involves a one to many mapping of stimuli resulting in output being greater than input. The purpose of the taxonomy and of further research in human information processing is to provide a framework for predicting the speed and efficiency of the performance of various tasks. Such a framework could benefit both the designer of computer software by making possible the generalization of task requirements and the researcher in defining and delineating domains to which his data is applicable.

A user who knows exactly which items he wants may retrieve them by providing a list of the appropriate item identification numbers. If a user knows only the characteristics of the items he wants, he must submit a coded profile outlining the search restrictions that should and/or should not be met by the retrieved items. A thesaurus lists the coded variables and values which describe each item: medical subspecialty, type of  question (single or multiple answer), taxonomic level (factual, comprehension, or problem solving), difficulty level, last year question was used, etc. The profiling or structuring procedure for search requests is detailed.

Feedback theory was conceptualized through a work-emotionality framework. Theoretical constructs were operationalized through the use of Boyd's three-channel mode of communication. Experimental intervention resulted in increased perception of openness in the expression of feelings, increased interest in problem solving, improved decision-making procedures, and increased cooperation during experimentation. Groups that received feedback, both computer and experimenter-assisted, showed significant improvements in creativity and utilization of group resources. Computer-assisted feedback groups had a  better short-term perception of improved cooperation and interest among group members and a greater short-term improvement in perception of decision-making procedures. In feedback groups work-emotionality activity changed in directions opposite to feedback instructions, that is, toward increased incongruency. Among the long-term effects observed in computer-assisted feedback groups were a decrease in perceived cooperation and a decrease in perceived interest in problem solving during post-experimental sessions.

Disadvantaged teenage boys who were attending two experimental summer work camps participated in studies of two aspects of movie making. The first study evaluated three different techniques for introducing movie making to the boys. The techniques ranged from simply making equipment and films available, to cursory instruction in movie making, to a maximum involvement situation with ongoing instruction, planning sessions, contests, and the immediate viewing of completed films. No significant differences in quantity or quality of the films were found among the presentations. The second study attempted to find a correlation between  the content of the movies and the attitudes, personality traits, and behavior of the movie maker. Although the number of movies taken and their content were not found to be related to the personality of the individual movie maker, ratings of the quality of the movies showed a tendency toward such a relationship. This data would suggest the need for caution in viewing claims for the therapeutic value of movie making, however, the success of movie making must be considered in context as a possibly relevant and important social situation.

        "description":"While the traditional role of television has been to transmit messages to mass audiences, more recent uses of television which allow face-to-face interaction may lead to new kinds of behavior by the parties involved. In an interactive situation, an individual's two types of tasks are presentational (presenting his own &quot;line&quot; or image) and responsive (providing feedback on the other individual's presentation). Based on a face-to-face interaction model of Irving Goffman, two experiments used television to manipulate the interaction. In the first, subjects watched themselves perform actions on television. The experimental group saw themselves after a delay of several seconds, the control group performed and watched simultaneously. The experimental subjects were surprised and  discomforted, while the control group thought they looked as they had expected they would. This result supported the hypothesis that being presented with a &quot;truer&quot; self-image (one seen by others) was likely to be unpleasant. A second experiment examined whether believing a televisionally mediated situation to be responsive affects the way people feel about it and whether rules of face-to-face interaction carry over to the television medium. This experiment yielded thought-provoking but not significant results. (JK/MT)",

In the speaker's opinion, effective media programs depend on several factors: choice of appropriate materials, scientific organization to allow immediate retrieval of materials, a \"memory bank\" of successful media usage patterns, and the \"humanizing\" of the information retrieval process. This can be accomplished by the development of a quality school library program which develops a library media center and provides a good librarian who is the key to successful media usage patterns and the humanizing of information retrieval.

The students were assigned 4 prescribed experiments that they performed in pairs. They each wrote reports on these experiments according to criteria in a \"laboratory manual.\" The reports were graded either acceptable or unacceptable, with the latter returned to the student for revision. All students' grades were based on overall performance, but 13 students (Group 2) were told that they would receive an incomplete if all 4 experiments were not completed. The other 18 students (Group 1) were given a grade not contingent on completion of  all experiments. Results showed that only one student from Group 2 failed to complete the course because of incomplete lab reports, while 9 students from Group I failed to complete the work. In addition, after the first paper, Group 2 had: a smaller percentage of papers requiring revision; a higher percentage of papers meeting criteria; and completed more optional experiments than Group 1.

The services provided include: tutoring, counseling, academic assistance, developmental courses, special programs, and financial aid. This report describes the participants, the different programs and activities offered, and the results. Eighty-five percent of the entering freshmen in the Transitional Year 1969-70 who completed both semesters were eligible to continue at the University in the fall semester 1970  without any change or adjustment of academic policy concerning eligibility.

From a feeling that the university could do no wrong, there is now a sense of public disenchantment. The growth of university revenues has slowed, students are disinterested and even alienated, and there is a sense of crisis. Financial problems are increasing as enrollments continue to increase, and it appears that universities have lost their sense of mission. Reforms are needed and it is the responsibility of the Federal government and higher education jointly to resolve some of the problems. Foremost are the financial problems facing the universities. In coping with these problems the Federal government will be guided by at least 4 basic  principles: (1) the responsibility to equalize opportunity for all Americans to receive a higher education; (2) Federal support for diversity in higher education; (3) Federal support for an enhancement of the independence of colleges and universities; and (4) the need to determine Federal support of higher education in the light of national needs for the skills that higher education produces.

It examines whether these protests were a result of educational grievances, a criticism of society, or constructive opposition; it also attempts to explain the reasons for the protests. Chapter II deals with the response of European universities to the new situation, specifically of institutions in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. This chapter also discusses a report on policy and planning for post-secondary education in  Europe, the theme of the 7th Conference of European Ministers of Education to be held in Brussels in May 1971. The report covers policy objectives and constraints, system objectives and social goals, structural and institutional changes, financial and economic aspects, organization for learning, and the government of post-secondary education. Chapter III deals with &quot;permanent education&quot; and discusses 3 essays: &quot;Permanent Education - An Agent of Change,&quot; by H. Janne; &quot;A Model for Recurrent Education,&quot; by O.

This study is based on a 1965 Census Bureau survey of a national sample of high school seniors. Information was obtained on post-high school plans, as well as personal and background data. The purpose of this study was to correlate eight variables with post-high school behavior, especially the dropout rate, and to make policy recommendations based on the findings. The variables were: (1) the student's high school curriculum, (2) student's estimate of his own brightness, (3)  average high school grade, (4) the college entrant's estimate of his brightness relative to his college classmates, (5) the average college grade, (6) family income, (7) occupation of head of household, and (8) years of schooling completed by father. The findings indicated that the student's high school curriculum was the overriding factor not only for determining whether the student entered college or not, but also for the type of college entered, and for continuing or dropping out. The other academic and socioeconomic variables also had strong relationships to college entrance and, with the exception of family income, to choice of college and continuation in 4-year colleges.

Until that time, the experience of the Black man was defined in Euro-American terms, or in most cases was completely ignored. In the last few years, \"Operation Culturally Deprived,\" a series of interrelated activities grouped around the concept of the disadvantaged, cultural deprivation, social fragmentation, and psychological shipwreck, has become a mammoth industry and a classic boondoggle. There is danger that \"Black Studies\" may follow the same course if they follow certain trends. The first trend is \"imperialism\", the involvement of institutions  without expertise in Black Culture that, until recently, didn't even admit Blacks. The second is \"paternalism\" on the part of foundations who decide in which direction Black Studies should go. The third is \"nihilism,\" caused by the demand for Black Studies, often lacking in content, to be taught by Blacks and only for Blacks. The fourth is \"materialism,\" whereby Black Studies become a major source of profit for the software industry. Another basic danger is that Black Studies will make analogies to white studies that have no relation to Black people, e.g., Black Freudianism, etc. The hope is for Black Studies to address the life and history of Blacks in America by avoiding the inherent dangers spoken of.

The purpose of the questionnaire was to determine how the prediction of academic success was related to students' expectations and experiences as college freshmen. Eight expectations and experience clusters were derived by factor analysis and served as predictors of first semester GPA and credits earned, and first year GPA and credit earned in stepwise multiple regression analyses. Demographic characteristics such as high school average and diploma track, college attended, ethnicity, sex, and student population served as control variables. Realistic  expectations of academic demands, insight into personal abilities, and readiness to work hard were positively related to performance.

        "description":"Interviews with high school students have found the cause of much of the present apathy and rebellion to be the students' exclusion from decisionmaking in the daily operation of the school and classroom. Objections were also raised to the failure to enforce rules in a fair and consistent manner. Many of the \"problems\" such as racial conflict and drug misuse in the schools are often the students' last desperate response to an institution that forces them to do boring and meaningless things and in which they have no say. If future teachers are to be prevented from perpetuating today's disastrous teaching practices, college instructors of educational psychology must find new ways of including their students - who will be the future teachers - in decisions which govern their own  preparation. This paper discusses two new ways of offering the educational psychology course; one at Teacher's College, Columbia University and one at San Francisco State. One format provided at least three choices: self-selected problem interest groups with an advanced graduate student; study groups working on the traditional subject matter; and independent study. The other format provided students choices of school and teachers with whom to work for one semester. Students made their own arrangements for this. (AF)",

The discussion is in 4 parts. First, the concept of \"ambition\" is separated into theoretically and operationally distinct components. Second, educational aspiration and college attainments are regarded as outcomes of a complex social process involving both the family and the school, in which the ambition resources interact and develop. Third, the normative, social, and competitive structures of the high school are considered in accounting for major differences in the realization of student goals. Fourth, the multiple regression-based technique (known as path analysis) is used to assess the net, direct, simultaneous effect of  each ambition resource on both aspiration and attainment. The sample was comprised of all 297 senior boys in two small-town, West Coast high schools, 77 percent of whom filled out a questionnaire in 1963. A follow-up questionnaire in 1967 was completed by 73 percent, and information was obtained about the others. The variables selected for the analysis were: GPA, family socioeconomic status, IQ, parents' aspirations, achievement motivation, achievement values, and extracurricular activities. The findings indicated that formal academic achievement was the most powerful resource in the ambition process. (AF)",

Some of the plan's positive benefits are: (1) it would provide considerable monies to higher education very quickly; (2) it would improve the competitive stance between private and public higher education; (3) it will largely obviate the need for  institutions to take one side or the other in the church-state issue; and (4) it places emphasis on the notion that the individual receives the primary benefit from his education.

They provide the student with a sense of how good his general performance has been and can help him decide whether or not to continue in certain subject areas or, in the larger context, whether to continue with his education. Where grading is required, the instructor is under some pressure to develop reasonable criteria, and the reporting requirement restrains the instructor from making evaluations that merely reflect his ideological or punitive inclinations - he could be called upon to justify his grades. Since grades are important, the student is forced to take the evaluation of his work seriously. In this respect grades can be  motivators to achievement. Some of the criticism of grades is unwarranted: i.e., that they rely on extrinsic rewards, that they do not predict later success, that they foster competitive attitudes, and that low grades discourage students from further study in the subject. The excessive anxiety that grades may arouse can be countered by limitations on the uses made of the grade record. The issue over whether grades are valid measures of academic performance can be dealt with by giving faculty members training in making educational evaluations. (AF)",

        "description":"In learning experiments, individual trial performances are typically represented as a composite of two independent components. The first is associated with systematic variation, and the second is a residual component interpreted as error. From the systematic variation, mean trial performance is typically computed across trials to obtain a simple learning curve or function. Tucker has proposed representing systematic variations as two or more curves or components representing generalized learning functions. In an illustration of this method, Tucker reanalyzed data from a probability learning experiment performed by Gardner, finding in one condition that performances of individuals were best represented by three generalized learning functions. This study attempted to replicate  Tucker's findings and to assess the relationship between cognitive and personality traits and individual scores associated with generalized learning functions. Specifically the study was concerned with (1) determining the number of learning functions required to determine individual variations in performance on a probability learning task, and (2) determining, through multiple regression analysis, a composite of cognitive and personality variables that are significant predictors of individual scores on each of the learning functions.

        "description":"The launching of Russia's sputnik in 1957 caused a reassessment of scientific manpower needs in the U.S. and drastic shortages of all types of highly trained specialists was predicted by 1970. This myth continued until the late 1960's when proposals were still being made to double federal aid for graduate students. Federal aid induced state colleges to embark upon advanced graduate work, and national production of doctorates almost tripled from 1958 to 1969--from 8,942 to 25,734. It is now obvious that in the foreseeable future the excess of doctorates over established needs will be substantial. Five closely interrelated problems are now facing public and private institutions and the states: (1) underwriting the costs; (2) reducing anticipated surplus production; (3) maintaining  the quality of the degree; (4) changing the character of some doctoral degree training; and (5) absorbing surplus doctorate holders. There is a need for a careful assessment of basic needs, and a careful allocation of resources to meet them. (AF)",

        "description":"The 1960's saw a great deal of talk about changing the pattern or structure of graduate education, but very little if any action. The 1970's will be radically different, not only because of budgetary constraints, but also because of the oversupply of PhDs and excess capacity. There are three basic factors that contribute to the demand for new faculty: replacement, expansion of higher education, and improvement of the quality of faculty. Only the second factor is crucial to the demand for PhDs, since the other two factors remain relatively constant. The expansion factor depends on the size of the college age group, and this group is growing at a smaller rate, and will shrink by more than 2.75 million in the 1980 to 1988 period. Another factor affecting the expansion of enrollment  is the college enrollment and retention rate. Though this has been steadily increasing, this increase will also slow down as it reaches its potential maximum of about 70 percent of the college age population. All this will mean that the demand for college teachers will steadily decline. Graduate schools will have to cope with this situation by cutting back on graduate programs, and exercising stricter controls over graduate enrollments. In addition, it might be advisable to limit federal support for graduate education to 75 selected universities. (AF)",

An identity crisis affects virtually all Americans in one way or another, but especially the college student. This crisis reflects not only an increasing awareness of the social ills affecting society, but also a growing concern about the quality of life in an affluent society. A parallel crisis exists among the educational institutions themselves, as they are faced with a transformation from mass education to universal education and with demands for knowledge more relevant to human needs. To face these problems, colleges and universities must return to their basic responsibility: the education of individuals who in turn can educate those close to them. In effect it means giving students a liberal education  and preparing them to educate others. It does not mean a classical or other single curriculum, but curricula that have coherence and purpose and that reflect some conviction about what is worth knowing, doing, and being. (AF)",

The Project provides a program of learning experiences for developing the learning skills essential for college work. It is a transitional year program during which the students can earn some college credits. The purpose of this study was to determine which variables were crucial to predicting the success of CEAP enrollees at Albany State College, Albany, Georgia, and to develop criteria for the selection of those students who could profit most from the program in terms of their success in college. In the fall of 1969 students enrolled in the program were administered a battery of tests.  Another form of these tests which included the STEP, CPI, and SAT, was administered in the spring of 1970. Discriminant Analysis and Chi-square Contingency Analyses were employed in the investigation. There were 13 predictor variables and 5 criterion variables, and two prediction equations were obtained for each of the 5 criterion scores. The results indicated that the five best predictors were: SAT Verbal pretests, CPI pretests, STEP-Reading, Mathematics, and Listening gain scores and SAT Verbal gain scores. (AF)",

Mastery grading is accomplished through evaluation devices which require the student to exhibit behavior that demonstrates he possesses the competencies. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which courses taught and graded according to the mastery concept would be accepted by other universities where Stout students might transfer credits or pursue further work. Sixty-two questionnaires were sent to individuals in charge of programs  in audio-visual education, guidance, school psychology, industrial education, home economics, vocational education, clothing and textiles, and food service and nutrition at 40 institutions, of whom 47 responded. Questions were asked regarding (1) the probable institution policy with regard to transfer of graduate credit where a grade of &quot;M&quot; (mastery) was awarded; (2) the institution's likely policy with regard to allowing students with a master's degree, obtained in a program which was graded &quot;M&quot;, to pursue a specialist or doctoral degree program; and (3) the individual's professional opinion about the concept of mastery grading in graduate courses. The results indicated that there would be relatively little difficulty for students graded with &quot;M's&quot; in transfering to other institutions.  (AF)",

Through use of these data, it is possible to identify areas of agreement or disagreement about certain components of community service and to note trends in the changing perceptions of the field. Activities that typify community service are listed as: extension centers, non-credit short courses and conferences, advisory committees, community use of college facilities, and public information programs.

Although initial employment positions require no more than a high school diploma, teacher aides are getting additional training through local certificate programs and/or through the college's general education programs. San Bernardino City Schools created three non-certified positions: classroom aide, tutorial assistant, and community aide. It is felt that emphasis in student recruitment and program planning should be on minority and disadvantaged groups. Community colleges might also offer teacher preparation courses for those students who plan to teach after receiving their B.A., but who wish to work  in the field in the meantime. Three possible courses are: introduction to education, practicum in school procedures and resources, and field experience in education. (CA)",

It was hypothesized that a smaller unit, with access to the facilities of a larger unit, would have a basis for establishing an interdependence and sense of community. This pilot program had three objectives: (1) establishment of an interdisciplinary program; (2) intensification of student-to-student relationships and establishment of a climate for more open and frequent contacts between students and faculty; and (3) the discovery of whether students in such programs continue their education and learn more than students who do not have such privileged and integrated instruction. Follow-up statistics showed that an  educational experience that fosters a sense of community contributes to the lowering of drop-out rates.

The most common research reported from California researchers is on student characteristics. Examples of questions asked and their responses are presented. Other surveys report on: performance on standardized tests; grading patterns; transfer follow-ups; grade-point differential; follow-ups of employed graduates; drop-outs; nature of  instruction; process of evaluation for the Extended Opportunities Programs and Services provided for under Senate Bill 164; and surveys of community opinion regarding colleges, programs, and services.

The objectives are to describe the present status of human service occupational education, to anticipate the direction human service education will take in relation to emerging human needs, and to propose curricular patterns to meet these evolving priorities. One hundred ninety-four colleges in 36 states and Canada have a total of 1006 human service programs in the following 12 general fields: child day-care center and homemaking services; communication and transportation; education; environmental services; fire prevention and safety; government service; hotel, motel, and food service;  institutional services; law enforcement and corrections; medicine; recreation and parks; and social work. Human service curricula within the colleges surveyed reflected four curricular emphasis patterns: laboratory-practicum; general education; general-specialized; and specialized education.

The study, conducted at San Diego City and San Diego Mesa Colleges during 1967-68, included 2,279 students. The subjects were divided into groups based on enrollment program, sex, and ethnic group. Step-wise regression was applied to 12 predictor variables including: American College Test (ACT) scores, high school grades, educational and economic level of parents, age of students, units of enrollment, and hours of outside employment. The study indicates that: (1) ACT scores do not significantly improve the validity of predictive expressions based exclusively on non-test variables;  and (2) expressions developed from the 12 predictor variables have no greater accuracy than the simple prediction that all students will receive a grade point average of 2.00 or better.

This review stresses the shaping of curricula to the student rather than the student to the curricula. Remedial English and individualized instruction are specifically discussed. The most serious consequence of misunderstanding in remedial English is the attempted remediation of the symptom (poor performance) rather than the disease (inadequate motivation). A solution is the abolishment of homogeneous remedial classes, with their problem of reinforcing failure, and the establishment of heterogeneous classes whose cooperative learning situation enables remedial and better qualified students to share equally in the costs and profits of learning. There is a need for further reorganization of  the physical environment to guarantee individualized instruction to each student. Based on a conviction that students learn best when exposed to a wide range of learning situations, rather than to a large-group, single-teacher approach, a suggestion is offered to recruit teaching assistants and reorganize a schedule for teaching and learning.

The study has shown that: (1) high school students have a lower level of awareness and approval of H.A.C.C. than do adults; (2) the function of the college seems to be widely accepted by the community; (3) a particular need for educational services is revealed, which, while  valid, has been difficult to fulfill; (4) the majority found the cost of tuition and fees acceptable but financial aid for low-income students is needed; (5) the commuting distance to H.A.C.C. is generally acceptable; and (6) proportionately four times as many white students as black planned to attend H.A.C.C.

There is evidence that books and libraries are the chief bastion against the pressures toward conformity which are in large part overwhelming the motion picture, radio and television, and the press. Only in libraries can the interested citizens hope to find  all the relevant facts concerning current controversial issues. It is appropriate that librarians should deem their freedom, and that of their libraries, of the utmost importance to the continued existence of democracy. (Author).",

The study showed a demand for information on material and their properties that the basic requirements for a data bank can be satisfied. The advantages of the data bank are better and easier  selection of material, better and a more complete survey of the materials supply, and better fundamentals for obtaining information on trends of development, for research and development planning and for standardization in the field of materials.

In minimizing these costs, they are considered in relation to the time required to provide service. The data used in the study include land and construction costs, library space usage and transportation data. These data analyzed on an annual cost-per-volume basis enabled a comparison of all of the alternative models on a common denominator. Two versions of the final model are presented. The first presents a solution to the delivery problem at the current rate of transaction between the five member libraries. Of the alternatives studied, United Parcel Service provides the optimum  time-cost trade-off in this case. The second version proposes that a high density storage library be built, incorporating a computer-controlled Randtriever system. This configuration solves not only the storage space problem but also enables the utilization of FAUL-operated vehicles, offering the cheapest and fastest delivery service when the loads are high enough. The centralization of these materials-handling services can also support other services which the libraries may wish to consider, e.t., computerized coordinated acquisitions, serials control, status file interrogation and microform services.

This document, research report no. 2, focuses upon the information needs of social scientists in government departments. All the main government agencies in London believed to employ a significant number of social scientists were contacted. Interviews were then conducted which revealed that government social scientists are generally well served by information systems. Library and information facilities are excellent and well used. Informal communication within departments is good. Two problems face government social scientists: (1) information they need is often not available in the form they require, and (2) the  non-comparability of statistical information. Improved bibliographic services and more up-to-data abstracting and indexing services would help answer some of the information needs of social scientists in the government. (Data obtained from the interviews is appended in tabular form.) (SG)",

Information requirements for lecturers involved in research means the retrieval and use of large numbers of facts or references. Lecturers engaged in teaching only, however, need to know where to find specific pieces of information. The problem for college of education lecturers is that they require a relatively small amount of information from a large body of information. The amount must be small enough to be assimilated in a restricted time, but comprehensive enough to avoid distortion. Lecturers reflect the following attributes in seeking information: (1) restricted time for gathering and use; (2) lack of motivation for information seeking; and (3) limited informal contacts  with colleagues. School teachers were also interviewed in groups, using an exploratory approach so that rather subjective impressions resulted. Because only a small number were interviewed, the results are presented here more to provoke further study than to give a representative sample of information needs. For school teachers, information gathering must require minimal effort and low motivation, and it must be relevant and show little distortion. (SG)",

Results reported in this document are little more than impressionistic and indicative because of the small number of social workers interviewed and the type of information gathered. The major problem of social workers involves research information--what has been done, what results have been reported, and what research is in progress on any particular topic. In attempting to formulate a solution, three factors about social workers as regards information must be kept in mind: (1) lack of motivation for searching; (2) shortage of time for reading; and (3) overwhelming preference for informal communication. To reach solutions to the  information problems of social workers, it is suggested that new trial services be developed and then evaluated in terms of their effect. (SG)",

Several means of delivery were considered--the U.S. mails, commercial trucking (Greyhound, United Parcel Service), and use of the public library system's delivery services. A combined use of the public library system's service and United Parcel Service was accepted and became operational at the end of January 1970. This method, with a subcommittee established to work out details regarding acceleration of delivery times, was considered the most satisfactory. The advantages are that it reduces some costs, allows for personal interchange between the libraries, and fosters shared resources of both the public and  academic libraries of the region. (SG)",

The main objectives are to control rising technical processing costs and at the same time to provide improved levels of service. Phase I produced a prototype system that operated in the library using typewriter terminals. Data preparation and data control units were established; regular library staff were trained in on-line input and searching. After a nine month period of operation, the entire system was evaluated. The requirements of a production library automation system  were then defined. Findings are presented on shared facilities, economy and file integrity, the performance of on-line searching, terminal performance, staff and resource commitments, transferability, and the human aspects of system development. Recommendations are presented with respect to feasibility, economic factors, management, staffing, documentation, terminal equipment, and national planning. (Author)",

The purpose of these trials was to study the interaction of the users with this system and the equipment associated with it and to compare, insofar as was possible, these operations with those of a batch processor retrieval system, using essentially the same data base, operated by the North Carolina Science and Technology Research Center. Approximately 60 searches were conducted in the trials and demonstrations with the  cooperation of about 45 representatives of industry and the universities. These trials indicated that TIRP responded more favorably to the simultaneous efforts of information specialists and scientists assisted by expert typists.

Organized programs at a level intermediate between the master's degree and the doctorate now exist at eleven of the American library schools which are accredited by the American Library Association. The literature on the subject is sparse and a questionnaire submitted to the eleven schools elicited a variety in requirements for admission, curriculum and rationale for the program and in the objectives of the program. Three schools see the program as a first step toward the doctorate and foresee it as an alternative to the doctorate. More research is required to determine subsequent careers of students in the programs, the effects of government funding, whether more programs  should be established and to evaluate ongoing programs.

It has become increasingly evident that the average library will never be able to &quot;go it alone&quot; in some aspects of the new technology--automation, for example. The level of investment required to reap the benefits of the emerging national machine-readable data bases exemplified by MARC is far beyond the individual budgeting capacity of any but the very largest libraries. Agreement is growing that the only possible solution to the dilemma - especially for the medium-sized and small libraries - is for them to band together in local, state or regional consortia and thus pool their assets and efforts. This  type of consortia is so expensive and complex as to preclude its development everywhere at once. The Council and other funding agencies should select the most promising of each of several types of development for a concentration of support. In this way uneconomical dispersion of limited available resources will be avoided. (Author/MF)",

It illustrates how each is but one part of a wide spectrum of interdependent library provision. The study brings out the common ground there is not only in the standards for different countries for the same kind of library but also in the standards for all types of library. This is primarily because standards everywhere represent principles of good librarianship which cannot vary greatly from country to country. Largely because of this, in drawing up a model set of standards for the principal types of library for use by the  developing countries, it has been possible to produce a framework which states many standards in general terms thought to have universal application. But quantitative standards have not been stated since these must vary according to local circumstances and must be worked out on the spot, in individual countries or regions. (Author/NH)",

There seems to be two polar types of patrons: those who will not talk, and those who will not stop talking. Without training, librarians tend to rush patrons to the books rather than take the time to encourage the patron to discuss his purposes and interests. The following subjects are discussed: (1) orientation to the interview, (2) patron-librarian interface, (3) counseling in librarianship, (4) interpersonal aspects of librarian counseling, (5) psychological dimensions of librarian counseling and (6) interview question analysis.

The proposed system depends upon a much more active role of the states and upon the input of research, interaction of advisory groups, inservice training, and relatively small amounts of money at strategic points along the way. An important factor of the system is the formation of an advisory group on library statistics within the U.S. Office of Education which would aid in the implementation of the proposed system, and aid in the ultimate formation of a data bank system. In the long range, the statistical needs of all users of library data can best be satisfied by an electronic National Data Bank System. This data bank is absolutely dependent  upon the standardization of terminology; the systematic collecting and editing of data; the interlocking, coordinated efforts of many advisory groups; the design of an electronic system by highly skilled professionals; and possibly a consortium of Federal, State and private agencies.

A sequential flow of activities for both teachers and pupils is outlined and five implications arise. (1) Teachers must provide opportunities for the kinds of pupil behavior that can be reinforced. (2) Priority must be given to processes which permit the child to transfer these processes from one learning situation to another. (3) The teacher should approach teaching with an experimental attitude. (4) Teaching includes both  active and passive processes. (5) Early childhood education must continue to be acutely sensitive to the social and personal consequences of the progressive achievement decrement in disadvantaged children. If this Learning System becomes successful in guiding program development, there should be less need for specialized programs such as those designed for children with learning disabilities. (WY)",

This survey related the preprimary enrollment to several socioeconomic factors: family income, occupation of head of household, residence (metropolitan, rural, etc.), full-day or part-day attendance, and geographical region. The data revealed that over 40% of 3- and 4-year-olds enrolled were from families with income above $10,000; yet, regardless of income, significantly more Negro 3- and 4-year-olds were enrolled. Children from farm families had the lowest enrollment rates, while those from white-collar families rated  highest. Relatively high enrollment rates are shown for children from families who reported no household head. Highest rates were computed for children living in metropolitan areas outside the central cities.

Categories such as achievement motivation; aggression; anger and frustration; character and moral development; creativity; games; and social behavior are included. One of the 27 sections lists general references in the field of education and child development and includes books, anthologies, and papers. (References and material relevant to the cognitive domain will appear in a separate report.) The bibliography was prepared for use by both the practitioner and the researcher and includes nontechnical treatments of subjects as well as major research articles. Articles published within the past ten years  (1960-1969), and especially within the past five years (1965-1969), are emphasized. Four different types of articles are entered for each topic: theoretical treatments; specific research findings; teacher practices; and curricular material. A code identifies listings of particular use to persons involved in teaching or curriculum design, and listings which contain a review of the literature. Availability information is also given.

        "description":"This conference paper highlights one infant education project as a successful example of a general, pervasive approach to stimulation in a group setting. The Ontario Institute and the Canadian Mothercraft Society have completed the first year of their 3-year day care demonstration project for advantaged and disadvantaged infants from 3 to 30 months of age. The program had been designed to facilitate infants' cognitive, personality, and social development through personalized adult-child interaction, guided learning situations, free play and specialized care. Infants in the program made significant gains over the first year in mental, social, and language development, especially for younger versus older infants compared with exclusively home-reared controls. Measures of caretaker  and parent functioning also showed generally positive results. It is suggested that involvement, enthusiasm, and coordination of parent care and teaching activities were especially influential in the project's success. The importance of warm, sensitive relations with babies in both teaching and nonteaching situations is emphasized. The magnitude of gains for both advantaged and disadvantaged children suggests a range of potential greater than usually realized. See also PS 004 517 and ED 041 632. (WY)",

The indigenous members of the team provide a sensitivity to nuances of meaning and interpretations of intent of behavior that cannot easily be recognized by an outsider. The outsider team members will contribute objectivity to the research. Working under this principle, the Child Development Research Unit provides an apprentice program to train indigenous behavioral scientists for research in Kenya. Students at the University of East Africa are hired as apprentices during their summer vacations. Each field team establishes a panel community, a set of households among which the mothers participate together in activities and form a social  network including at least 100 preadolescent children. Since each field team designs its own research, many varied factors influencing the way in which children learn have been explored, including: salience of the father, composition of the household, sibling order, kinship network, nature of task assignment, schooling, mother's teaching style, and the experience of initiation. Other studies have dealt with physical growth, health, motivation, social behavior, and social institutions. Brief summary statements of these studies are included in this document. (Author/AJ)",

Subjects were 40-low-to-middle socioeconomic level children divided into treatment and control groups. A specially developed test of numerousness (arithmetic readiness) served as a pre- and posttest. The lessons were designed to give experience with one-to-one correspondence and comparisons by counting, relative size and/or relative density. No significant differences were observed between the mean gain scores of the experimental and control groups. However, significant differences were observed between the mean gain scores of children in the  treatment groups who attended the half-day session and those attending a special full-day program. A similar result was observed within the control groups. Results indicate that the lessons used in this experiment did not alone sufficiently enhance the subjects' ability to conserve numerousness, but that they should provide an effective supplement to formal activity with number concepts.

Dialogues obtained were coded in nine categories of utterances, and their frequency and patterning were related to the verbal ability of the 12 7 1/2- to 8 1/2-year-old male subjects. These children were part of a longitudinal study of the pre and post natal period as it relates to learning abilities and disabilities, and had been tested on verbal ability at age 4 and at age 7. A complete medical, social, and psychological history was also available for each child. Data from the present research included seven hours of tape from each family, representing 21 20-minute sessions; the  family's commentary on each of the sessions; the researcher's notes from home visits; and the mothers' attitude responses to a questionnaire. Apparent within-group differences produced very large standard deviations and hence findings of non-significance. It was concluded that further naturalistic study would be productive, but that tighter experimental controls should be established. (NH)",

The infant states discussed are: regular sleep, irregular sleep, drowsiness, alert inactivity, waking activity, and crying. Also included are hunger periods and indeterminate states, those instances in which an infant's state does not clearly meet the criteria of any of the other states. A brief summary of neonatal studies which explore both innate and experiential factors affecting behavior and development of newborns is given. Without controlling for state, infant studies may yield both false positive and false negative results. State can be considered a variable, the primary focus of research rather than an intervening factor. Research in the area of  state proposed included those dealing with distinctness, predictability, range, and flexibility of state. State may also be a mediator of stimulation. In studies assessing the effects of early stimulation, it is important to determine which types of stimulation are most effective at various developmental stages and the optimal state of the infant during which such stimulation can take effect.

Teacher training, parent education, and classroom management, as well as complex learning sequences, can be improved by the use of principles emerging from the experimental analysis of behavior. Teachers especially need to pay attention to all the variables which mediate their effectiveness with children. It is time to interrelate learning and developmental principles from differing points of view which have met the empirical test of effectiveness. On the whole, the approach to instruction required by the systematic use of external reinforcement can strengthen systems derived from other  theories. (WY)",

The purpose of the unit-based program is to supply preschoolers with the necessary educational and social skills to adapt readily to a kindergarten curriculum.

The weekly reports view the program from five angles to provide different perspectives on the curriculum as it is brought to life in the classroom. The program is reviewed in terms of the goals the teachers have set, the units around which the activities revolve, the problems and small triumphs of  particular children, the cognitive themes emphasized during the relatively structured Circle Time, and the teacher's observations of the children during Discovery Time (free play).

Much of its theory is based on the work of Piaget and is concerned with the development of logical thinking and representation. A central tenet is that the child learns through active involvement with his environment and that the child undergoes stages of development. Four cognitive skill areas: classification and seriation, spatial and temporal relations, predictability, and transformation are objectives suitable for the preschool child. The structured classroom environment is not intended to be a substitute for good teaching nor does it replace the need for action and interaction among children. It simply provides the child with support and the opportunity to achieve academic  successes in the program.

Therefore, the categories of children's play discussed are transformations of each of these types. Play is a reversal of the usual adaptive behavior sequences and permits the subject more variation and control over the instrumental behavior within these sequences. Play, while not always self-evident, usually occurs in a space set aside for toys and play activity at established times after adult-required activities, and is accompanied by signs of pleasure, relaxation, and excitement. Play is voluntary and often includes role playing. The  observer of play must note who is being portrayed, what acts are being expressed, and what the setting and time are within the play activity. The categories included in this paper deal only with self-play as distinguished from social play. Extensive descriptions of play at specific ages make up most of the document. (AJ)",

Observed infant behavior included move, vocalize, fret/cry, play, noise, and smile. Findings indicate that lower SES infants vocalize and smile more and fret/cry less than upper middle SES infants. Maternal behaviors of touch, hold, smile, look, and play were more frequent among lower SES than middle SES mothers, and lower SES mothers spend more time watching TV than the middle SES mothers. There is a relatively strong relationship between infant and  maternal behavior. Middle SES mothers vocalize when their infants vocalize, touch and hold them when they fret and watch them play. Lower SES mothers tend to touch their infants when they vocalize, when they cry and when they are at play. There were no class differences on the two infant mental tests. Performance on a measure of attention indicated that two-thirds of the middle class infants failed to show response decrement while all the lower class infants demonstrated response decrement.

Long-term data are not yet available. (2) From four types of curricula (Programmed, Open Framework, Child-Centered, and Custodial) two points can be  made. First, children profit from any curriculum that is based on a wide range of experiences and second, the successful curriculum guides the teacher in adapting theory to the actual behaviors of children and (3) A successful program requires an effective staff model which in turn relies on planning and supervision.

        "description":"A 2-year-project with 48 disadvantaged (D) and 48 middle class (P) Israeli 2-year-olds was set up to study how heterogeneous or homogeneous grouping influences social interaction. Twenty-four D's were the homogeneous group, 48 P's and 24 D's were equally divided into three heterogeneous groups with a ratio of 2:1. This report is based on an analysis of narrative records of subjects during 1-hour free play observations. The records were first divided into Social Interaction Units (SIU's). SIU's were then classified into seven categories, and the percentage of SIU's of each child in any one of the categories and with any type of possible interactee (adult, D child, P child) computed. The overall amount of social interactions increased more for the heterogeneous D's than for the  homogeneous D's. However, both heterogeneous D's as well as P's interacted more within their own group than with each other, despite the 2:1 ratio of P's to D's in each group which should have favored interaction with P's by the heterogeneous D's. Moreover, the homogeneous D's (like the P's) developed a better ability to cooperate with peers while the heterogeneous D's remained very dependent on adults. (Author)",

Data were obtained from interviews with 104 mother-sitter pairs, 39 of whom were friends when the arrangement began, and 65 of whom were strangers. The dynamics of mother-sitter relations prove to be dramatically different for the two groups. Between women who already know each other, friendship is apparently the bond that holds the day care arrangement together. Dissatisfactions may involve strains centering around status, dominance, and interpersonal issues, but may be tolerated because of friendship. By contrast, those who start out as strangers tend to develop a system of mutual satisfactions not associated with degree of friendship although  friendship may later develop. Motivation for caregivers who sit for strangers was found to be personal role satisfaction, as well as economic. The goals and methods of the Day Care Neighbor Service, a 2-year demonstration project, are described. Through a creative use of consultation, social workers reach \"day care neighbors\" who, in turn, help potential users and givers of day care to find each other and to make satisfactory arrangements. The social impact of the service is discussed. Tables are included. (NH)",

The report also notes that, because of the language barrier and the lack of suitable instruments to test the intelligence and the learning potential of Mexican American children, they are labeled as \"mentally retarded\" (e.g., in California, Mexican American students account for more than 40% of the so-called mentally handicapped).

Needs identified by tribal leaders included new services and facilities for delinquent reservation youth, training programs, and legal change for more effective handling of juveniles. Progress was reported in the areas of foster care, local involvement, alternatives to incarceration, and recreational programs. Inter-tribal cooperation, youth involvement, and leadership exercised in the form of concrete action were seen as essential to reducing delinquency among  reservation youth.

This plan centers around 5 master concepts: interaction (isolation), change (stability), conflict (cooperation), power (weakness), and valuing (ignoring). The plan broadly sketches the process for developing units of the Project NECESSITIES curriculum. Dimensions for each unit are the master concept;  environmental concepts which \"set the stage\"; key concepts; appropriate subconcepts suggested by, or critical to the use of, the master and key concepts; catalytic questions which frame the concepts used in any particular activity or unit; content and comparative content; methods; media and materials; and skills related to the child's developmental stage. A teacher training program has been used to acquaint teachers with the objectives of Project NECESSITIES and has provided a period during which teachers could criticize, question, and discuss the objectives.

Once tribal approval was gained, visits were made by the liaison staff to various schools and Indian nations in efforts to gain acceptance of Project NECESSITIES  materials for field-testing. Also, in order to understand better the curriculum needs of Indian people, liaison network personnel attended various Indian education conferences. In the document are progress reports on field-testing, recommendations and resolutions from Indian education conferences, and the current status and projections for the Project NECESSITIES liaison network.

If no more than 1 period a day can be utilized, then the class should meet during the last period, when activities can extend beyond a set segment of time; also, if possible, the class should be held in a room that is not perceived as regular classroom.

Reported are findings from a survey of Negro and white high school seniors and their dropout age peers residing in economically depressed areas of rural East Texas. Although the youth evinced a general desire to marry in their early twenties, Negro and white girls desired to marry earlier than their male counterparts. Regardless of sex or race, the overwhelming majority of youth desired and expected from 2 to 4 children. The white boys evidenced slightly lower desires for children than the white girls. Except for the Negro girls, the boys and  girls preferred their spouses or themselves, respectively, not to work outside the home after children. However, regardless of race, girls were considerably more inclined towards working outside the home, at least until children, than the boys were towards their wife working. The central tendency in every sex-race grouping, except the Negro males, was to rank \"desire to marry and raise a family\" moderately relative to other goals. The Negro boys tended to rank these goals low. (Author)",

The survey indicated a great need for improvement in reading and mathematical skills, along with nutritional and health services. In the program planning, 5 age groups were used in classifying the children before instruction was initiated: pre-kindergarten, ages 4 and 5; kindergarten, ages 5 and 6; primary, ages 7 and 8; elementary, ages 9 and 10; and upper elementary, ages 11 through 15. Average student attendance was 142 for the program, with 4 teachers, 2 aides, and 1 librarian as the nucleus of the instructional staff. The program presented many varied \"interest-activities\" in addition to the main  thrust of improving skills in reading and mathematics. Pre- and post-program achievement testing revealed significantly higher scores at the end of the program.

Convergent validities ranged from .53 to .28, while divergent validities ranged from .10 to .38. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the 7 motivational traits and achievement (as measured by the Cooperative Preschool Inventory). Separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls, and results of the study support this procedure of performing separate analyses for each sex.

Another county was added in 1967. Initial state responsibility of the Office of Planning Coordination centered on formulation of a comprehensive development plan for the 11,858-square-mile region. The plan required far more information about existing social and economic conditions than was readily available: What are the human, economic, social, and physical resources of the region? What are its potentials and deficiencies? Most importantly, what investments are needed to stimulate economic growth? To answer such questions, a comprehensive study of the region's resources was initiated which covered agriculture, climate,  community facilities, forestry, manpower and industry, minerals, recreational and cultural facilities, soils, transportation, and water. The present document comprises the Phase I detailed inventories in each of the foregoing categories; in addition to 6 maps and 6 tables of data, the document contains a summary of the existing recreational and cultural resources of the New York State Appalachian Region and includes an inventory of local, county, state, and Federal facilities as well as a preliminary analysis of such resources.

Using as principal sources of information the Migrant Programs Branch of the U.S. Office of Education, state education agencies, local project questionnaires, and site visits, the following specific areas of migrant education were monitored and reported upon: (1) national program planning, (2) allocation of Federal migrant education funds to the states, (3) expenditures of Federal migrant education funds within  the states, (4) participation of migrant children, (5) staffing, (6) educational planning and implementation, (7) educationally related services, and (8) participation of migrant parents.

As noted, a synthesis of previous research done on related factors points to language aptitude as being a combination of many skills. Strong personal motivation appears to be required for any individual to acquire a second language. Verbal IQ and motivation seem  to be the most important factors in predicting success in learning a foreign language. While the new methods of teaching languages do not show the advantages often claimed, they are no worse than the old methods; however, some research supports the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking pupils are better able to learn when they use their native language and have systematic instruction in English as a second language.

Questionnaire data were analyzed by means of the Chi Square Test, the Median Test, and the Binomial Test. The Mexican American college graduate had a strong sense of identity with people of his cultural heritage, was more influenced by individuals outside the home, participated in more group activities, received more support from parents and siblings for his educational goals, was influenced most by the mother, could rely on greater economic resources, was less likely to be Catholic than the high school graduate, was more  critical of responses of society and the school system, and felt that home conditions and discrimination were the main reasons for the Mexican American's failure to improve his position in the larger society. Four major recommendations were derived: (1) programs should be developed to restore a strong sense of identity; (2) parental and sibling support for educational goals should be encouraged; (3) sound educational practices should be applied; and (4) programs which recruit Mexican Americans for college and then provide support should be expanded and publicized. An appendix of analysis results is included. (MJB)",

There were 5 experimental and 5 control communities in the sample. The investigation was longitudinal in design and examined 2 groups of subjects from their first year in school until 5 years after their high school graduation. The longitudinal nature of the investigation made possible the pursuit of 2 related objectives. The first dealt with a determination of the effectiveness of the 4-H Club program in the 10 study communities and the second examined the effectiveness of different means of disseminating the research results to the rural public. Findings include: (1) Reorganized school districts  provided more learning opportunities, the students had consistently higher achievement test scores, and they completed high school with a 6- and a 13-month advantage in mental maturity for boys and girls respectively; (2) The reorganized district leads to a higher matriculation in college after high school; (3) Boys from nonreorganized districts scored higher on measures of social adjustment than those in reorganized districts; (4) 4-H members showed no personal and social adjustment advantages; and (5) The most effective medium for presenting research findings was the lecture given by the researcher.

Dimensions included type of phonological context, consonant-vowel or vowel-consonant (CV or VC); units to be blended, syllables or phonemes (S or P); and size of units, single or double. Six ordered 96-word training blends were administered to six groups of 20 preschool children each over a 4-day period. Two days after completion of training the children were given a 32-word random-ordered test consisting of four test words for each of the eight kinds of blends. Results of analysis of variance showed the following: (1) syllables were easier to blend than phonemes, (2) CV breaks were more difficult than VC breaks for phoneme blending, (3) length increased blending ease only in  phonemes, (4) VC training was better than CV training, and (5) syllable blending training did not transfer to phoneme blending performance. It was concluded that phoneme and syllable blending involve separate concepts and that easy to hard training within one concept area should produce optimal results on both tasks.

Models of language acquisition, hypotheses derived from the models, and comparisons of synthesized models are discussed. Among them are behaviorist (Skinner), cognitive (Chomsky), and concept acquisition (Brown) models, and relationships are drawn both among the models and between them and the work of Piaget in developing an organismic-developmental model. The work of Lenneburg and Carrol is also discussed at some length. Implications of each of these models for reading instruction are discussed. The behaviorist models suggest programed instruction beginning with simple units and proceeding to  larger ones; the cognitive models suggest development of verbal abilities prior to reading instruction; and the developmental models suggest that learning during early school years might better employ methods other than those requiring abstract symbols. All of the models suggest the importance of classification abilities and acquaintance with the dialect of reading materials before instruction begins. References are included. (MS)",

Remedial programs were most apparent in the 1940's, and attention to developmental reading, content-area reading, rate increase, and study skills came in the 1950's. The 1960's brought an extension of activities of the 1950's and added several important surveys on the status of reading instruction in secondary schools. Eight critical factors evidenced both in past decades and in the outlook for the future include: (1) the need for greater planned provision for reading improvement in secondary schools; (2) a reduction of discrepancies between existing programs and attempts to define ideal programs; (3) the  accomplishment of greater staff sophistication as manifested in better instructional content; (4) the establishment of reputations of educational viability; (5) closer attention to factors demonstrated to be associated with successful programs; (6) a need for continued administrative and faculty support of programs coupled with continued federal and local funding; (7) more realistic assessment of the role of content teachers and greater encouragement for them to participate; and (8) careful, rigorous, and innovative research of programs and related activities.

        "description":"An integral dimension in the concept of flexible efficient reading is the process of skimming, which is defined as the reading behavior in which information is processed without looking at all or most of the words in continuous printed discourse. Measurement of flexible reading efficiency presents problems which revolve around four major issues. The first issue is concerned with the difficulty of measuring the faster rates of reading or those strategies involving the use of visual contextual restraint, i.e. skimming. Measuring comprehension poses the second major difficulty, since careful reading is implied in the usual survey or diagnostic test. The small number of comprehension questions used and the variation of the reader's background of information contribute to the problem.  The third issue arises over the controversy as to which should be the independent variable--variations in purpose for reading or variations in difficulty and type of material. The fourth important issue is concerned with the need for valid and reliable flexibility scales whereby the rate and comprehension scores on the activities of the instrument are integrated.

Reliability estimates of the DRTE using the  Kuder-Richardson Formulas 20 and 21 were found to be satisfactory and did not differ from those published by the test authors.

Thus, his ability to read depends upon his facility with his language. An important implication for schools is that, given this theory, all children should be able to learn to read fairly quickly provided either that they have language facility equal to that of the materials they are asked to read or that the materials are made representative of the dialect they speak. It is suggested, then, that reading materials be written for individual children, perhaps with the aid of computers, and that oral reading, because it allows children to hear what they read, should have a  prominent place in the early reading of children.

The hypothesis was based on a 1927 study which found that 18 verbs, either alone or in combination, could be used to represent the meanings of all verbs used by average adults and by the considerable evidence available that differences in verb use exist between standard and nonstandard dialects. Two groups of inner-city blacks and one of suburban whites, all ninth graders, were given two sets of cloze materials, one using simplified verbs and one using regular verbs. The group from Black School 1 (N=57)  showed a significant difference (p<.0005) in ability to supply simplified regular forms, the group from Black School 2 (N=51) showed similar significance, and the group from the white school (N=64) showed a significant difference but at a lower level (p<.02).

        "description":"Because vocabulary control in children's reading materials is largely based on vocabulary lists and studies which are now obsolete, new areas of learning are being considered for developing beginning reading materials. Instead of basing vocabulary lists on frequency counts and adult reading materials, the three approaches examined here are concerned with paired-associate learning which begins with the child. According to the concept of learnability, there are individual characteristics within printed words which make them easier or harder to learn than other words. A second approach to learning demonstrates that children's associations are predominantly syntagmatic in contrast to the paradigmatic associations of adults. Another area of learning related to children's vocabulary is  the division of words into two categories: those which convey the message information and those which convey information about the structure, i.e., function words. Results of a recent pilot study with 24 6-year-old prereaders indicated that there is no difference in learnability between the two word classes, although previous research had reported a dichotomy existed.

        "description":"The necessity to provide instruction in reading is widespread in community colleges, due primarily to the liberal enrollment policies these colleges generally have. The program at San Jose City College uses the Davis Reading Test and the Iowa Silent Reading Test as part of its entrance battery and assigns students to either regular or one of two noncredit, pass-fail, remedial English classes on the basis of scores on the speed section of the Davis test. Regular English instructors, reading teachers, and graduate students in English acting as paraprofessionals teach the remedial reading and writing sections. Emphasis is on skill development, beginning with isolated skill areas and working toward integration of skills in successful critical reading. Machines such as tachistoscopes  and language masters supplement class instruction, and the use of clozure activities to strengthen vocabulary and comprehension has been particularly successful. Evaluation of 310 students in remedial sections in the spring of 1970 showed an average gain of nearly 2 years as measured by the Iowa test. Future plans for the program include extending instruction into various departments of the college. References are included. (MS)",

Suggested time allotments are common skills, 6 weeks; social studies, 3 weeks; science, 3 weeks; literature, 4 weeks; and mathematics, 1 week. In the guide, each of the above five sections is divided into the skill  areas of vocabulary, basic thought relationships (comprehension), mechanics, locating and using materials, and study skills and is further subdivided within skill areas. The guide provides the general tract for most students and alternate activities and materials for those students either deficient or proficient in reading skills.

As a part of a larger study, groups of infants were provided varying amounts of systematic intellectual stimulation. An attempt was made during all of the stimulation materials to increase the adult's use of language in the presence of the child. When the children reached 3 years of age, they were administered the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test. Factor analysis revealed the following three relatively clear and independent factors: language, memory, and perceptual-motor variables.  Significant differences in scores were noted as a function of time and continuity in the stimulation program for the language and memory factors but not for the perceptual-motor variables. It was concluded (1) that intervention with systematic intellectual stimulation curriculum materials does make a difference in performance scores of children and (2) that the time to begin instruction in beginning reading skills is on the baby's day of birth.

The brain has at least five input systems: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. The first of these senses is employed more than the others in reading; however, it is believed that the more input centers used to learn and consequently to story in the memory, the more efficient will be the retrieval of learning for future use. Three other important factors in learning and consequent retrieval are repetition, speed, and quantity of input. A method which makes use of two senses and can supply repetition, speed, and quantity without further burdening the teacher is the use of the tape recorder. By careful manipulation  and measurement of the process, the child can rapidly increase his vocabulary without pressure and with pleasure as he listens to and reads from good trade books. This is, of course, to be considered a supplemental teaching device. The teacher must still teach many of the basic skills, such as comprehension and word attack. (DH)",

As the educational level of the people and the demands of industry increase, the rate of functional illiteracy also rises, provoking criticism of school programs and creating a need to find new ways of dealing with the problems. A search of the literature related to early and beginning reading reveals that children vary in their degrees of readiness for reading and that readiness experiences now provided do not provide for the needs of many children. That some children, at least, are ready to read before age 6 can be seen in the success of Head Start and Sesame Street and in the results of research on early reading. If the needs of children are to be met, it  will be necessary to provide instructional opportunities for younger children and to find ways of determining individual children's readiness levels and of using these levels to design instruction for them.

Two groups of elementary-grade subjects (63 in all) solved all of the problems. Analysis of variance performed on the data indicated that problem form, sequence of information, and their interaction were significant (p<.001) but that the problem verb was not. Reverse sequence problems were most difficult to solve and became more difficult as the problem form became more  difficult.

Biographical inventories consisting of 90 or 97 true-false statements were constructed to assess mathematical attitude. The inventories were administered to eighth grade, college freshmen, and graduate student groups. Other measures of ability and achievement were used with the analysis of the eighth grade students. Results of chi square analyses of independence between the measure of mathematics attitude and each of the inventory items are reported separately by sex for each student group. General scholastic ability is shown to be an important correlate of interest and ability in mathematics, and it is suggested that parental  interests are also significant. The findings also indicate great complexity of factors governing ability and interest in mathematics. (RS)",

In order to obtain a hierarchy of the learning stages, both a written test and an individual interview were used. All 201 subjects received the written test and 20 subjects were selected for individual testing on a set of sixteen function tasks. From the written test, five stages were identified: (1) ability to find images of a function, (2) ability to consistently identify instances of mappings in several different representations, (3) operational ability in finding images and domain is exhibited, (4) ability to  consistently identify non-instances of mappings in several different representations, (5) ability to find images under the composition of two functions and solve related problems using functions in several different representations. The individual interview test results altered the previous findings to yield the final analysis of stages. These were: (1) concept identification (ability to discriminate instances and non-instances of function), (2) process (ability to work with various representations and names of function in finding images, preimages, domain, range, and sets of images), (3) operations (ability to carry out operations on functions with an indication that the result of the operation is understood again to be a function.

The basic concepts of the remedial programs were: motivational activities to provide curriculum relevance, intensive involvements to improve teacher-student rapport, reading and arithmetic tailored to individual needs, and parental involvement in their children's school activities. Effectiveness and cost are separately analyzed. During a period of four  months the average reading gain of students was five months; arithmetic, three months. Students with the lowest entering scores gained eight months in both subjects. Absences increased, but referrals and suspensions decreased. Costs are summarized by major program components including management, dissemination, inservice-training, mathematics, reading, humanities, field trips, and parental involvement.

Four control sections participated in other non-structured and less sequential science activities. Investigated were: 1) appropriateness of unit for kindergarten; 2) children's interest; and 3) achievement in reading readiness, reading, arithmetic, mental ability and Piaget conservation task scores. Conservation and ability tests were administered before and after treatments. Reading readiness and arithmetic and reading achievement tests were administered as posttests. Investigator developed evaluation booklets and an interest  instrument was used during the science unit. It was concluded that: 1) the SCIS Material Objects unit was appropriate for and of interest to kindergarten children; 2) teacher differences were apparent; 3) enhancement of readiness and first grade achievement was not clearly demonstrated; and 4) ability to perform Piaget Conservation tasks was significantly increased.

A questionnaire was mailed to each teacher. Data and conclusions were reported with regard to installation variables; AAAS curriculum characteristics; consultant functions and utilization; and student achievement. Results indicate older, experienced teachers and those with graduate work were most familiar with Science-A Process Approach and were most favorably impressed by the program. Mean values indicated New York teachers spent more time teaching science and subgrouped pupils for individualized instruction than did Pennsylvania  teachers. Teachers with one to three years experience utilized manipulative equipment more regularly than other groups. Approximately 80 percent of the teachers from both states felt that skipping exercises was a disadvantage to students. Teachers from ages 31 to 40 tended to be the most concerned about student achievement. (JM)",

Science - A Process Approach was selected for installation in pilot schools beginning with the 1967-68 school year. School selection criteria included diversity in socio-economic and public-parochial factors. Reciprocal working relationships were established with 21 pilot schools and included information services and inservice training for teachers and administrators; provision of teacher and student instructional materials; and  regular consultative visitation. Instruments for student competency and demographic data were administered. Pilot schools varied in instructional time and completed AAAS science activities. The adoption phase was considered incomplete. Installation process side effects included: extended use of Science - A Process Approach in non-pilot schools, extended ERIE dissemination involvement; expanded teacher education and consultation services and cooperation with state departments of education; and further implementation of ERIE's &quot;Regional Action Network&quot; and &quot;Process Leader&quot; programs.

Particularly pertinent to the study was the close relationship with social studies for slow learners. Some 400 projects were identified through inquiries, published reports, and bibliographies. Of these, 120 projects were reviewed, 65 projects findings were abstracted and interpreted, and 15 were visited. Some of the major findings of the 65 were: 1) subject matter is appropriate when it is specific in nature and dealt  with through the real-people approach; 2) successful content includes elements of law, political science, culture, and social issues; 3) recurrent ethnic study in several grades is effective; 4) either inductive or deductive methods can be used successfully; 5) multimedia approaches facilitate more learning; 6) some decision-making simulation games have been successful; 7) racially mixed classes promote greater knowledge and higher self concept; 8) there is some indication that teacher attitudes influence their success; and, 9) participation of teachers in curriculum development is favorably regarded.

        "description":"The aim of this paper is to give some insight into what academic simulation games are, what their goals are, how they accomplish these goals, and how they differ from other ways of teaching and learning. A game is a way of partitioning off a portion of action from the complex stream of life activities. It partitions off a set of players and allowable actions, a segment of time, and establishes a framework within which the action takes place. The game can even be described as a minute social system, and is therefore an important part of the socialization of children. The kind of learning that can go on in a game, is complimentary to, and prior to, the kind of learning that occurs in the standard information transmission model of school learning. Learning in a game is the  development of affect toward a new goal; and the transmission of knowledge that occurs in an ordinary classroom is a way of facilitating action toward that goal. The game provides the structure which Jerome Bruner argues is so important to retention and usability of information. In the social studies, a game provides such a structure for action with the most direct impact upon children described as unmotivated. One of the games developed by the Johns Hopkins Games Project gives some idea of what such games are and do. (Author/SBE)",

The units focused on major concepts drawn from the social sciences, expanding horizontal organization of content, shifting from a basal textbook to a series of supplementary materials, and using an inquiry-oriented approach to knowledge. It was assumed that teacher-developed materials would prove more meaningful for pupils than commercial materials. The major purpose of the project was to see if these units could be effectively used by a sample of North Carolina teachers. They hoped to use the systematic feedback from forty teachers in ten schools and three kindergartens to increase the effectiveness of the units, and to assess  the support the teachers might expect to find in most schools with regard to supplementary materials. Two-day conferences served the teacher orientation information gathering functions; three questionnaires were administered on teacher attitudes, current school status, and the effectiveness of conference-type inservice training. After the conference series, the sample units were taught for seven weeks. Next, a final questionnaire was administered to measure school personnel attitudes and teacher assessment of the units, and a summative conference was called. The success of the units, the training, and the project as a whole was borne out. (Author/SBE)",

Afro-American studies could be a valuable extension of anthropology offerings by: 1) helping to avoid the bias against studying societies which are culturally close to home; 2) encouraging the recently developed interest in urban anthropology; 3) affording an opportunity for meaningful field work experience in nearby ethnic communities; and, 4) providing an opportunity to study a culturally similar community so that we learn more about ourselves as anthropologists. Anthropology could contribute significantly to the students'  understanding of Afro-American studies as well. Perhaps the most valuable contribution is its cross-cultural perspective. Another would be a more sophisticated understanding of the concept of culture, so that a better definition of \"black culture\" could emerge. An Afro-American anthropology course which doesn't pander to emotional political needs can result in giving black students a sense of pride in their race, and also enable white students to recognize the prevalence of institutionalized racism in this country. Both blacks and whites have a role in teaching Afro-American anthropology. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"The central focus of this study was an analysis of social science research that had been supported by the U. S. Office of Education's Small Grant Research Program (SGRP). Background information was provided on the objectives and procedures of the SGRP. Information was provided on some 25 social science projects that had received support through the regional Offices of Education. In addition to summary accounts of the individual projects, a matrix was provided to identify the level (elementary, secondary, higher education, all-general), the focus (research, training, curriculum, all-general), and the research area (anthropology, archaeology, economics, American history, world history, humanities, political science, social studies, sociology, psychology). The status, trends, and  needs in social studies research were noted in the activities of specialized projects and through interviews with eminent scholars in the field. It was suggested that research efforts be expanded, a greater effort be made for effective dissemination in the social studies area, and that all agencies and professionals develop a new spirit of cooperation to better delineate the problems and avenues for solution in the complex arena of social sciences. A continuing need will be that of keeping the practitioner adequately informed as to the developments in the field. (Author)",

Questions for discussion and study include, among others: 1) How much difference will voting by 18-year-olds make? What changes will they want in government; 2) What does a vote mean in our elective process; and, 3) When the Supreme Court ruled on the right of 18-year-olds to vote, they also ruled that persons who did not know how to read and write could vote -- if any, what limits  should be set for the right to vote? Also outlined are key concepts and terms, major understandings, and further questions for inquiry and discovery. Reading selections on the subject of political parties, and copies of recent newspaper articles concerning the 18-year-old vote are included for discussion. The list of suggested references consists of books, articles, films, filmstrips, and tapes. A list of local institutional sources of information and their addresses concludes the document. (JLB)",

The following functional definition, developed by the staff of the Marin Social Studies Project, is offered: The social studies is that portion of the general education curriculum the purpose of which is to make students more rational with regard to human behavior and social interaction. In dissecting the individual parts of this statement, the author interprets the criterion of rationality and its value as a guide for content selection; explains the inclusion of the terms &quot;social interaction&quot; and &quot;general education&quot;, and points up the utility of this  definition for teachers and curriculum designers in making decisions about what they do. A rationale for this definition, based on the needs of students, is presented, and the implications of the definition for the development of an improved K-12 curriculum are briefly dealt with.

This guide is designed to be useful to teachers as they outline courses and daily lesson plans. No attempt has been made to plan in detail for a teacher, however, content outlines are thorough. An effort has been made to acquaint the teacher with the use of generalizations as an aid to teaching pupils to think illustrating how he can formulate them. Reflective questions, like the generalizations, are offered only as suggestions for student evaluation. Any textbook can be used with the units: 1) The Soviet Realm: USSR; 2) South Asia: India; 3) East Asia: China and Japan; 4)  Southeast Asia: Indonesia; 5) The Middle East: Egypt (United Arab Republic); and, 6) Sub-Saharan Africa: The Congo (Leopoldville). Introductory sections of the guide discuss its use, an orientation for the social studies, use of generalizations, academic freedom, goals and learning theory. (Author/DJB)",

The city has many problems and although logistics require that we conduct most education in the school building, the author argues for putting out best brains to the task of bringing the city to the classroom and to exploiting the city as a classroom when appropriate. Teaching can no longer be done only by professionals. Others such as para-professionals, businessmen, government officials, doctors, artists, parents, neighbors, cab drivers, policemen, etc. can and should be involved in the teaching process because they can often do the job better than the teacher due to their unique and special talents. By learning from these people the student is preparing himself for a life which is closer to the real  situations represented, not by the classroom teacher, but by the man on the street. (CWB)",

Random structured samples of 82 project and 82 control students were selected. The research strategy employed was derived from Gagne's theoretical model of learning in which the attainment of any complex intellectual task depends upon the prior learning of a number of simpler tasks, and involved the following steps: 1) the terminal objective of the sequence was analyzed to identify an hypothesized hierarchy of simpler underlying tasks; 2) the Status Identification Test was constructed which contained one test item  for each of the seven most complex underlying tasks, and two items representing the terminal objective of the sequence; 3) post-performance for each task was compared separately for a sample of project and control students; 4) the mean number of social positions identified was compared between samples; and, 5) performance configurations between samples were compared. The absence of significant performance differences on the two measures of the terminal objective indicated that the lesson sequence was unsuccessful. Differences were detected, however, on several of the underlying tasks and recommendations were made from analyses of these differences. (JLB)",

        "description":"This nongraded resource unit was prepared to give the teacher examples of social studies activities that emphasize economic concepts. It presupposes some knowledge of economics, therefore it is not designed primarily for younger children. The major themes are: producing, distributing, and consuming food, clothing, shelter, and services. Canada, United States, Mexico, Honduras, and Brazil are specifically considered. On the question of world trade, it is assumed that people are interdependent and must help each other in obtaining and providing goods and services. The major question is followed by four subproblems: 1) what evidence of world trade do we find in our homes; 2) what are the productive resouces necessary to provide goods for world trade; 3) how does market determine  what products are imported and exported; and, 4) how do governmental policies influence trade among nations? Within each of these problem areas, the format includes: specific questions, related concepts, behavioral objectives, techniques for assessment, and resource materials. For the teachers convenience, alternative or supplementary materials, and two charts are included. (Author/SBE)",

Five basic concepts are utilized throughout: leadership, role of the individual, decision making, philosophy, and institutions. These give structure to the program and promote student understanding of human relationships, and the relationship between man and his environments.

Seventh and eighth grade social studies instruction is the focal point of the effort, and career orientation is the theme by which adaptation will be approached whether a pupil is interested in pursuing a liberal arts, vocational, or technical program. This project was started in the summer of 1969 as an interdisciplinary effort including art, English, home economics, industrial education, mathematics, science, and social studies. This approach contributes to the following specific goals: 1) provide meaningful career information in the context of specific subject  matter instruction; 2) strengthen pupil interest in all subject areas; 3) provide a classroom atmosphere which would foster pupil motivation and encourage learning by discovery; 4) encourage pupil investigations which would lead to greater self understanding; and, 5) provide activities for pupil participation which simulate many roles in careers. This activity manual includes more than 100 career activities related to American history, urban living, Ohio history, and the social sciences. (Author/SLD)",

Descriptions of teaching acts occurring in inner city schools were obtained and independent judgments were made about the frequency and appropriateness of the acts by each of two selected sets of \"competent\" teachers, one group from inner city schools and the other from schools in other socio-economic environments. The analysis constituted a comparison of their judgments on verbal representations of teaching situations and teaching acts derived from inner city classrooms. The procedures and methodological rationale are presented in three separate parts: 1) method  of observing and describing teacher behavior; 2) method of documenting (obtaining judgments on) the described teacher behaviors; and 3) method of identifying behaviors peculiar to a given group. Some of the findings are briefly reported as illustrations in the procedural discussion. The major presentation of results and discussion of implications is in the analysis section which concludes the report. (Author/MBM)",

Videotapes of 50 teacher interns were shown to 100 high school students of three different ethnic backgrounds--white, black and oriental. Teachers were rated on ability to relate to students. Subsequent interaction analysis of the videotapes identified 51 potential teacher behavior correlates, 15 of which were found to correlate significantly with teacher ability to relate to students. In general students tended to rate higher those teachers who 1) lecture in response to student talk, 2) allow students freedom to initiate discussion, and 3) use praise extensively in rewarding students. Students tended to rate less favorably those  teachers who 1) permit silence in the classroom to continue for prolonged periods of time, 2) give directions for extended periods of time, 3) prolong an activity, and 4) ask questions for prolonged periods of time. No significant differences were found among mean teacher relatability scores by main effects of race and sex of student raters. (Author/RT)",

Four students from each of 24 first grade classes were separated into groups on the basis of frequency of teacher and peer reinforcement. Verbal characteristics of these students were scored using six scales of imitative behavior developed from the OScAR protocols. The data were analyzed using a 2 X 2 factorial design (teacher reward X pupil reward). Students observing high rewarding teachers imitated significantly more than those observing low rewarding teachers on 4 of 6 verbal categories. In three of the analyses differences between frequently and infrequently peer-reinforced students were located,  and for three of the analyses there were also reliable teacher reward X pupil reward interactions. The potential of the OScAR for measuring student behavior and constructs such as limitation was demonstrated. (Author/RT)",

Two hundred sixty-three education students at Queens College of the City University of New York were identified as electing pass-fail option courses. Analysis of these choices revealed that only 14 students elected courses in scientific or mathematical areas, thus leading to the conclusion that the institution of pass-fail options holds little promise for developing greater scientific or mathematical sophistication among prospective teachers.

Individualization is not limited to independent learning or learning in a tutor-student dyad. Depending on learning goal and learner characteristics, individualized education also can occur in group contexts. Individualization is fostered through emphasizing student involvement in choosing and conducting learning activities. Managing individualized instructional programs in schools depends greatly on student self-direction accomplished either through using programmed materials or through students' developing competencies in selecting, planning, and conducting learning tasks.

        "description":"From a prepared script, teacher behavior indicating positive and negative attitudes toward students and toward the course material was role played before 16 introductory psychology classroom groups. The treatments were crossed in a 2x2 design. Each class session consisted of the experimental treatment embedded in a 15-minute lecture, an achievement test on the lecture material, and an attitude questionnaire to check on the manipulations. Results indicated that task attitudes exhibited by the instructor influenced student achievement, while interpersonal attitudes did not. It was also noted that while the group with the highest achievement scores had an instructor with positive attitudes toward students and toward course material, the group with the lowest scores had an instructor  with positive attitudes toward students and negative attitudes toward the course material. This suggests that the attitude exhibited by the teacher toward the material he is teaching exerts more influence on student achievement as it is typically measured than his attitude toward students as individuals.

The model (which considers all phases of teacher education from the initial preservice training of prospective teachers through the inservice training of those presently in elementary education, as well as all groups of educational personnel actively involved in the education, induction, and support of new teachers) is described through outlining its various developmental phases: 1) Phase 1--including development of general goals for teacher education,  behavioral objectives, and educational specifications, and 2) Phase 2--the feasibility study in which the model was found to be feasible in all respects. The section of implementation of the model includes explanation of a multi-unit organization (which utilizes the concept of a differentiated staff) and description of the role of the principal, and three components of general organization (system-wide policy council, steering committee, and the unit), inservice education, planning time, student teaching, and teacher supervision.

The Stanford model included three stages: general orientation, viewing of skill films, and the teach-supervision-reteach microteaching cycle itself. Often there had been no significant improvement between teach and reteach. After re-analysis and the decision that the basic weakness stemmed from the lessons used by the teachers not being sufficiently thought out, five stages were added between the initial orientation phase and the culminating experience of actual microteaching: 1) The Practicum--designed to show how a good  lesson established expectations for student response and that the teacher could expect specific types of response if the questions were clear, the decision logically consistent, and the task generally applicable to something in the child's own experience; 2) Peer Group Microteaching--opportunity to test one of several lessons against peers and under peer supervision; 3) Seminar in Supervision of Microteaching--to train students to supervise their fellow teaching candidates; 4) Skills Session in Microteaching--a seminar on the nature of skills as dynamics of the lesson; 5) Pre-Teach Supervisor-Supervisee Conference--about the lesson to be taught.

Entire populations are now transformed into a single industrial economy, even though they may live in low density situations. A distinction must be made between the growth of cities and societal urbanization. Even in advanced industrial societies, however, large numbers of people are only one or two generations removed from the soil. Even though living in the city, they are not part of it as social reality. Education is the crucible which prepared rural man to perform the special and diverse rules of urban living, but the extent to  which schools should be merely instruments of diffusion or the directors of the processes is not clear. Urbanization entails complex changes at the levels of social relations, personality, and culture, and the transition must be a gradual one. Many of our deep and unconscious attitudes toward space, time, resources, and institutions were shaped under circumstances so different that these attitudes are detrimental today; the question is whether they can be modified by education. Other questions are what new images and expectations are to be inculcated, and whether the individual can handle the overloaded repertory of roles inherent in urban society today. (MBM)",

Regardless of whether the statistical, design, and treatment assumptions required for the valid use of inferential statistics in education are met, inferential statistical analysis is still functionally inappropriate. Descriptive statistical analysis, often recommended as an alternative, is also insufficient for evaluating teaching effectiveness. Interpretations or predictions based on descriptive or inferential statistical findings are based on presumed relationships between phenomenal variables which the statistical findings apparently--but only apparently--reflect. It is suggested that a  viable replacement consists of functional analysis of behavior strategy based on operant conditioning. This method is precisely tailored for the moment-to-moment manipulation required by educational practice. (RT)",

All five focus on developing a research base for teacher education standards, in particular for the \"Recommended Standards for Teacher Education\" by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. John Herbert advocates accreditation criteria based on teacher behaviors and different standards for different types of programs. To build the required knowledge base, he would research, in part, the cut-off points and standards applied in practice by accrediting teams. S. C. T. Clarke summarizes curriculum standards and notes that the emphasis placed on certain standards rather  than the standards themselves will cause change. In the third paper, Donald M. Medley offers ways of closing the research-practice gap, among them a centralized information exchange and a one-shot questionnaire which would solicit information on teacher education program characteristics and on the success of beginning teachers. John R. Dettre focuses on the current state of literature and research in the areas of admission, selective retention, and student involvement in program development and evaluation. The final paper, by R. L. R. Overing, is a review of studies which evaluate teacher education graduates according to behavioral objectives and pupil change. Bibliographic items total 211. (LP)",

Individualized instruction is being strengthened and opportunities provided for developing awareness, group interaction, diagnosis of individual needs, and self-development. Human relations skills are also being stressed, together with professional decision-making competencies. The elementary teacher education program  is being changed to meet 1) increased emphasis on vocational education, 2) increased tension between education and the general public, 3) increased attention to the individual, 4) increased autonomy at each major level of education, movement toward a more interdisciplinary curriculum, 5) increased involvement with the total environment, and 6) greater emphasis on relevance in learning.

        "description":"This paper reviews literature on problems encountered by beginning teachers in the inner city and points out some steps that have been taken in both preservice and inservice teacher education alleviate these problems. While books such as \"Death at an Early Age\" and \"Up the Down Staircase,\" are briefly reviewed, greater attention is given to research reports, program descriptions, program proposals, and comments by beginning teachers themselves. The section on current programs gives details of 24 programs which have been implemented and briefly describes 24 additional programs for which only limited material was available. The author concludes, from documents examined, that the most important ingredients for successful urban teaching are the attitude of the prospective teacher and  early, extensive preservice experience with the realities of the inner city.

Relationships were found between teachers experiencing high role conflict and deviant modes of adaptation and the goal-attaining process. Teachers in schools experiencing less success in goal attainment were found to have more role conflict and were less likely to resolve the conflict than teachers in schools demonstrating higher success in the goal-attaining process. The results of the research indicated that an understanding of the nature of teacher role-personality conflict, and the resolution of that conflict, is essential to both researchers and to practicing school administrators.

In comparing data obtained from using the two observation systems simultaneously, significant differences were found between systems in the percentage of activity assigned to five of seven common categories.

It describes a study in which a group of elementary school children were asked to find solutions to problematic situations and to indicate on a five-point scale how certain they were that their answer was correct. Despite a wide variation in answers, each child asserted that he was completely certain that he was correct. A method is outlined whereby teachers can show children how to identify situations in which it is appropriate to be uncertain of the correct answer. This method involves identifying simple situations in which it can be demonstrated that the correct answer is not known but that educated guesses can be  made, and rewarding the generation of various response alternatives to given problem situations. Students should then be helped to decide which alternative seems most likely to be correct on the basis of the information they have, and how much certainty is warranted for that alternative. (RT)",

The competencies (dealing with teacher classroom behavior) used as content during the group sessions were relevant to the experimental population of beginning primary teachers. The individual feedback consisted of classroom observation and conferences with the teachers as they implemented behaviors associated with each competency. This program was conducted during school hours; the teachers who participated were released from their teaching responsibilities for the group sessions. The study followed a pretest--posttest design with two experimental groups and a control group. The students' evaluation  indicated their belief that the model was most useful in assisting them in developing and refining teaching competencies. They believed that the program would have been more useful if it had extended for an entire school year or longer, instead of for only one-half a semester. (Author)",

Members of the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory have observed that preschool teachers offer rewards for learning that are extrinsic to the learning process (e.g., rewarding a reading lesson with playtime), that they suffer from \"right answer syndrome,\" and that they offer global praises such as \"good boy\" rather than specific praise. The teacher training program at the Laboratory stresses positive attitudes toward learning: Children should be motivated to learn for the joy of learning, teachers should praise children's learning efforts in specific terms, and \"wrong\" answers should be interpreted as providing a direction for  remediation. The training program uses filmed models of teaching, simulation, and microteaching. (LP)",

On the basis of the descriptions, each listener was to select six out of 24 pictures. Analysis showed that teachers, teacher aides, and third-grade pupils did not differ significantly in correct picture selection, but that the latter three groups scored significantly higher than first-grade listeners.  Also, all listeners scored significantly higher when listening to the experimenter rather than to pupils and when listening to third-grade speakers rather than first-grade speakers.

Fifty-five vocational teachers were divided into three groups, each taught during a semester by one of the following methods: telelecture each week, alternate weeks of telelecture and traditional face-to-face lecture-discussion, or face-to-face lecture-discussion each week. Telelecture enables an instructor to communicate verbally and graphically with inservice teachers at a remote location through two-way telephones and a Victor Electrowriter Remote Blackboard. Analysis of pre- and posttests showed no significant  differences among the three groups in achievement, performance, or attitude. However, the telelecture is more economical in instructor costs and travel time and is recommended as a means of teaching professional extension courses.

These schools served for practice, as models of the desired teaching methods and provided opportunities for student teaching. Even before 1900 the function of the schools was being debated, and the need was recognized to use them as experimental schools to test and demonstrate new techniques and materials. The student body in campus schools tended to be highly selected and inadequate in number to serve expanding programs of teacher education. In the late 1960's much student teaching was transferred to public schools and the concept of teacher education was changed to increase the collaboration between schools  and colleges, with a resultant demand for more responsibility for the classroom teachers in student teaching and accreditation. The new emphasis is on a joint enterprise by public schools, universities and colleges, the community, and related public agencies. The means of disseminating the results of experimentation and research must be improved if campus schools are to have a useful future, and there must be opportunities for curriculum development and professional leadership. There is a need for flexible facilities which can be adapted to a variety of uses, and laboratory facilities devoted primarily to inservice education. The activities should be defined and limited to those which can make a unique contribution to the program of the sponsoring agencies. (MBM)",

The objective of the study is to set the stage for a theory of social behavior in the large which, when verified, may be employed to guide computer simulations of detailed social situations. A model of a goal-seeking and learning individual (a P-model) is constructed, at which point the interconnection of several such P-models (an n-group) is formalized. The notion of an n-group may represent teacher-class interaction. Analogously to other system-theoretic developments, the dynamic behavior of n-groups is investigated. In particular, the stability and controllability of mutually rewarding behavior in such groups are the objects of discussion.  Further, the notion of \"status\" within an n-group is formalized and change in status is related to the learning capabilities of group members. Illustrative examples are given for each of these investigations in order to provide intuitive appeal to the formalism. The results of the investigation include theorems which state necessary and/or sufficient conditions for stability and controllability of n-groups. Though the conditions are somewhat restrictive, the framework for relating them to the aspects of dynamic behavior is established. Within this framework, the investigation may be extended in several directions and these recommendations for further action are included in the report. (Author)",

        "description":"After experimenting extensively with a large assortment of classroom aids, e.g., blocks and rhythm instruments to stimulate the oral expression of preschool children, it was found that far less language expression resulted than had been anticipated. When those experiments which had been mildly successful were evaluated, it was decided that young children needed to learn how to look at pictures, what to look for, and what the whole and the parts of objects were called. Since learning began with perceiving, preschool children seemed to require large numbers of guided perceptual experiences in which they could see, hear, and feel the materials while their attention was being called simultaneously to the differentiating characteristics of each object. Relative success was then  achieved in stimulating oral expression with such classroom materials as blocks, photographs, magnets and shapes, and a terrarium because the children's perceptions had been carefully guided toward the uniqueness of each aid as the peculiarities were labeled and discussed. These experiences seemed to indicate that all classroom materials should be introduced to young children on the perceptual level primarily as language materials in which the clues are used and reused to reinforce their context.

Two control and two S.D. groups of college students were tested. Pre and Posttest analyses of variance of their anxiety  level were performed.

        "description":"Applications of research in psycholinguistics, particularly Noam Chomsky's research, have suggested some drastic innovations in the practices of both the classroom teacher and the child development researcher. For example, more emphasis is needed upon asking what a speaker knows about the grammar of the language with less concern about how information is learned, and more emphasis should be on what a child knows intuitively about grammatical structures at a given time with less emphasis upon his articulation and vocabulary. In such a process, teachers would use activities to increase children's linguistic competence and performance, and assist them in learning, acquiring, and using their grammar. These practical changes in emphasis would support the concept of linguistic  competence as well as encompass the notion of developing the child's competence in the rules of social speech usage. Information from research also suggests that grammar should be taught as a tool for accomplishing relevant goals, thus changing instructional techniques from learning by rote to learning how language functions. This information provides an increased understanding of the child's patterns of development and also emphasizes the rules of usage. It therefore produces a more realistic framework for elementary programs in speech and oral language. (JM)",

Subjects, in groups of five or six, participated in five 1-hour sessions which featured relaxation exercises designed to reduce anxiety in certain communication situations.

One hundred fourth graders ranked the familiarity of multiple definitions of 60 words given in a semantic survey. Those 34 words found to have common meanings or obscure meanings were used to construct a Words in Context Test. A second version of the test was developed using a low-association value trigram instead of the target real word. The two versions were administered to 64 subjects from three fourth-grade classes randomly assigned to experimental groups. There were consistently more errors on obscure meanings than on common meanings. The mean difference was greater with real words (-4.81) than with trigrams (-.75). Fewer errors  were made with real words on common meanings, but more errors were made with real words on obscure meanings. Children's problems with obscure meanings represented by the frequent use of multiple-meaning words in sentences seem to be due to interference by better-known meanings of familiar words diverting them from the semantic syntax.

        "description":"To assess behavioral change in the speech of students, a test was developed which used the prior subjective experiences of teachers as a foundation for comparing student behaviors, and objectivized these experiences by developing a rating system upon which teacher observations could be scaled. Twenty raters--10 experienced and 10 inexperienced--were selected, trained, and divided into two groups. Sets of four raters then observed randomly-selected classrooms at the elementary and secondary levels for two rating periods. Results of data indicated that no statistical differences existed between judges' measurements in any of the class levels and that judges' measurements were reliable indices of communicative behavior. It was concluded that this method (1) can provide educators  with a reliable means of assessing the attainment of behavioral change, (2) may function more reliably on the secondary level than on the elementary level, (3) prepares outside observers for measuring changes, and (4) is not limited to measuring change in oral communication, but may be applied to any classroom, industry, or organizational structure where behavior is the object of measurement.

Using this technique, students reassembled the parts of a speech or essay that had been divided into its constituent elements and presented to the students in random order. Before and after the two-and-a-half-week unit, students were tested on basic organizational ability, grasp of the concepts, and application of these concepts to the preparation and delivery of a short expository speech. While neither mode of instruction produced significant gains in basic organizational ability, both  produced significant gains in comprehension of the concepts taught in the unit. Both modes also produced smaller, but still significant, gains in speech performance. (Materials include course outlines, a sample diagnostic test, and the selections used in the RJSP technique.)

All students were pretested on one piece of writing, tested mid-term on writing and rewriting, and post-tested on three pieces of writing.

Nonetheless, the findings can be useful to linguists, can provide a base against which further assessments of writing can be compared and suggest the need for a number of carefully controlled studies about how persons develop competency in various kinds of writing.

Variance in desirability beyond that attributable to level of academic performance was found. Desirability was also a matter of faculty-perceived intellectual ability and values; although these are related to academic performance, there is further substantial variance that is part  of the formulation of the desirable student.

The results show an absorption in the faculty perception of performance of much of the variance previously associated with dependability, intellectual ability and values, motivation, self-sufficiency/creativity, and maturity in defining desirability apart from academic performance. The analysis tends, however, to accentuate the contribution of other traits, notably ethicality, likableness, open-mindedness, and altruism. It appears that desirability is highly related to perception of academic  performance, and that other areas, normally expected to make an honest contribution to performance (dependability and motivation, for example) are perceived by the faculty to do so. There is a remaining reliable variance in Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and actual grades which is related neither to perception of performance nor desirability.

A variety of personality and attitude measures, high school rank, freshman grade point average, cumulative grade point average, and rank-in-class, were tested for relationship against criteria drawn from frequency of being known to members of the faculty and nomination by faculty to several laudatory categories (these latter recorded on Student Nomination Form, see TM 000 181 below). The major component of general acclaim was revealed to be academic performance, although technical difficulties (size of sample, limited reliability of other criterion measures) may have dampened other potential findings. Inter-rater  reliability and the effect of omitted items on the Student Rating Form are analyzed. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the problems encountered in the study and speculations regarding the implications for further research. See also TM 000 174 and TM 000 176-179. (DG)",

Findings and conclusions of the project in which the Common Status Measures of the U.S. Office of Education were administered to 12,000 pupils in 31 school districts concurrently with objectives-referenced items developed by the Colorado Department of Education are reported. Educational needs were concluded to exist in Colorado on the basis of assessment results. Objectives related to general goals, developing test items, sampling items and students by multi-matrix techniques, and analysis of resultant data are fully described. Substantive findings indicate the degree to which certain curricular objectives are being achieved in Colorado schools. Appendices present the  rationale and procedures of assessment along with some 300 objectives stated in six common curricular areas: health, language, arts, mathematics, music, physical education, and science. More extensive reports of the results may be found in a set of &quot;Working Papers&quot; developed at each grade level in the various curricular areas. (Author/PR)",

The objectives were: to investigate the validity of the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) for predicting end-of-training Foreign Service Institute (FSI) language proficiency; to discover the relative difficulty of various target languages; to develop tentative expectancy tables to enable prediction of a trainee's likely proficiency at end of training; and, to outline the need for and nature of an ongoing program of Peace Corps language research. Target language, total instructional hours, MLAT scores, initial and final FSI proficiency ratings were the variables considered. Findings indicated that MLAT has modest, though statistically reliable, predictive power for all languages; greater validity for  common than for exotic languages; greater predictive power for shorter instructional periods (less than 280 hours) if language is disregarded; and taking language type and training time into consideration, greatest predictive power in common language projects involving 280 or more hours of training. Systematic proficiency differences were observed among languages, implying differences in relative difficulty for American students. More vigorous and innovative research is recommended to identify factors of importance in language training. Some thirty languages are grouped and listed in order of difficulty, and expectancy tables indicate the likelihood of attaining various levels of end-of-training proficiency. (Author/LR)",

Four types of evaluation referred to in the PDK report are discussed: context, input, process, and product. Support is given to the report's emphasis on context evaluation and its division into contingency and congruence modes. The distinction made between context and product evaluations is endorsed, but the proposed development of specifications and  procedures for data collection is considered inadequate. The suggestion to use individual students in evaluation studies is regarded as relevant and valuable but new data collection techniques are recommended. A case is made for greater involvement of students in determining individual educational objectives, particularly in their later educational years. (LR)",

Therefore, a good discriminating item for criterion-referenced tests is the one which has a larger proportion of correct responses in the mastery group and a smaller proportion of correct responses in the non-mastery group. Based on these considerations, the difference in proportions of correct responses in mastery and non-mastery groups and the phi coefficient are proposed as discrimination indices for criterion-referenced test items. These two indices were compared empirically with the point biserial correlation of items and test scores in three different  situations: heterogeneous sample with a symmetrical distribution of scores, a homogeneous sample with a skewed distribution, and varying item difficulties. Results indicate the indices are highly correlated in most cases. Implications of these comparisons are noted. A possible approach for criterion-referenced test reliability is also discussed.

The ultimate intention is to develop an effective and efficient physics course which can be readily modified by the various course instructors. Seven alternative teaching/learning approaches were developed, based on objectives derived from four widely used physics textbooks. These approaches included two forms of lectures, a study guide, videotapes, and other audiovisual aids. Results demonstrated that the method of instruction was not the critical  element in student performance, that students could achieve good results on their own if provided with the necessary instruction and materials, and that if data is collected systematically and used to revise course components, considerable improvements can be made at each iteration.

The statistical model used by Loevinger is introduced to establish the &quot;attenuation paradox&quot;, and, in intuitive terms, attempt to explain why the &quot;attenuation paradox&quot; holds in this particular model. This is accomplished by showing that high (internal) consistency or reliability of test scores is an asset in increasing test validity under the classical single-factor statistical model for mental tests, but can be a liability when item scores are modelled as in the statistical model discussed by Loevinger. It  is hoped that by this exposition, mental test specialists will be led to more critical appraisal of commonly used techniques and concepts (including the &quot;corrections for attenuation&quot;), and will check that their methods of test construction and comparison are consistent with their statistical models.

Positive transfer was predicted between sequentially arranged tasks, and a programed or nonprogramed treatment was predicted to interact with aptitude and with tasks. Eighteen four and five year-old urban disadvantaged boys and girls from a Head Start class in Honolulu, randomly assigned to one of three groups, were administered multiple discrimination and concept tasks under sequences which would reveal predicted transfer and interaction effects. The CHE model successfully identified transfer on the curriculum hierarchy from the multiple discrimination to the concept task, and appeared to serve as an empirical check upon a task  analysis of the concept task. A programed sequence was superior to a non-programed sequence irrespective of aptitude or task. The most severe restriction of the model is that it is limited in application to only two tasks in a linear hierarchy. It is suggested that the model be extended to include different tasks and aptitudes. (Author/LR)",

Student input to the IBM 1500 Instructional System, used for the administration of the computer-based SIT (CB-SIT), consisted of typewritten responses which were automatically recorded and evaluated. Anxiety scales were administered by the computer system before and after the CB-SIT, and attitude scales were presented in the  conventional paper-and-pencil form. Validation of the CB-SIT was conducted by a comparative evaluation in which the SIT and WAIS were traditionally administered. A Latin square design was used to counterbalance potential order and sequence effects of the three test administrations. Data analysis involved evaluation of the test administration procedure and determination of concurrent validity. Results indicated high correlation between the CB-SIT and the original form and confirmed that an automated administrative system is both feasible and valid for SIT. (LR)",

Each of the 90 four-choice items in a natural science test was rewritten into a pair of true-false items, one true, one false. The resulting 180 items were divided to make two 90-item forms A and B which were administered to chance halves of a class of college students. Following item analysis, the most highly discriminating member of each pair of items was chosen for further comparison with the multiple choice forms. Using these selected T-F items, two additional experimental forms, half true-false and half original multiple choice items, were then constructed and administered. Analysis of  the resulting data indicates that true-false test items, item for item, are less discriminating than multiple-choice items. This gives partial support to the belief that minute for minute a true-false test can be as reliable as a multiple choice test. It also indicates some support to the hypothesis that there is no important difference in what the two item forms measure. Overall results, despite their limitations, tend to strengthen rather than weaken faith in the usefulness and value of true-false test items. (LR)",

Thus, the test employs logic similar to that used in the original RAT which was developed for high school and college level students. Words for the Mini Rat items were selected from word lists and books suitable for grades 1-3. Two studies of the validity of the measure for children in grades 1 and 3 are described. The measure discriminated in expected  ways between a priori categorized groups of high and low creative children. The hypothesis that it takes a creative person to recognize a creative child was not supported. Grade and sex differences were evident on one test form but not on another.

On the other hand, there is little question that this most critical component of planning and decision-making has over the years largely been left to the somewhat capricious whims of intuition and educational &quot;guessmanship.&quot; This paper is a report on one effort to place need assessment on a more substantive and responsible basis. The study concentrated on producing five different but complementary types of information: (1) a description of the status of learners in seven broad behavioral areas, (2) a statement of critical needs in these areas, (3) a description of the population characteristics most highly correlated with each identified need, (4) an evaluation of the effect which  certain selected system inputs have on each need, and (5) an analysis of the opinions which certain&quot;educationally-relevant&quot; subpopulations hold regarding education. Three strategies are utilized to this end: (1) a secondary analysis of state and district socioeconomic, ethnic and educational data, (2) a survey of the educational practices and learner characteristics of Florida school districts, and (3) a sampling of the opinions of selected subpopulations. While the study is not seen as the final word in assessment models, it is felt to be a significant step in the right direction.

        "description":"Besides the ubiquitous Pearson product-moment r, there are a number of other measures of relationship that are attenuated by errors of measurement and for which the relationship between true measures can be estimated. Among these are the correlation ratio (eta squared), Kelley's unbiased correlation ratio (epsilon squared), Hays' omega squared, and the intraclass coefficient of correlation, expressed as a ratio of variance components by Ronald Fisher. This paper shows how to correct each of these for attenuation. Such corrections permit estimates of relationships between true scores to be made when estimates of relevant reliability coefficients are available. (Author)",

Split-halves reliability estimates for eleven teachers was 0.93 and reliability of the total score means of three raters for eleven students was 0.84. Four areas related to self concept as learner were identified from a factor analysis and were labelled: 1) Relating 2) Asserting 3) Investing 4) Accomplishing. Advantages of the instrument are: ease of scoring, non-reactivity with the pupil, measurement of self concept of early elementary pupils, as well as older pupils, and measurement of public behavior. Preliminary and revised versions of the instrument are included in the appendix. (Author/CK)",

Generally, these terms should apply to scores and not to tests since either type of score may be obtained for any test. Various terms such as absolute scores, fixed-standard scores and mastery-test scores may be more appropriate substitutes for criterion-referenced scores. Mastery-test scores grow out of the historical development of instructional tests allowing the student to demonstrate that certain prescribed skills and practices had been learned. With the advent of individualized instruction in the 1920's, diagnostic tests were developed to determine the already established level of accomplishment. Because instructional materials and accompanying diagnostic and mastery tests were not  made generally available, individualized instruction was abandoned in the schools till the 1950's. Today, modern test theory can provide many guidelines to the content validity, length, item format, and scoring of mastery tests. In conclusion, mastery and diagnostic tests should supplement standardized survey tests in educational evaluation; there need be no problem of choosing between them. (CK)",

An attempt is made to outline and use such second order curricula justification. Recent works which have presented the basis for a more explicitly differentiated and coherent second order characterization of curricular justification are discussed and the logic of justification is considered with an analysis of four stages of justification: verification, validation, vindication, and  rational choice. This analysis provides seven possible moves in attempting to justify something. One of these, the transcendental argument, is discussed in detail. The \"grammar\" of curriculum and some perspectives from which curricula can be evaluated are considered in conjunction with this type of justification.

Two types of data-information conversion procedures were field-tested: similarity scores based on discriminant analysis, and success estimates based on regression analysis. Scores from 36 aptitude, interest, and personality measures were accumulated for approximately 1600 prospective area vocational school students. A progress record was kept for each of these students after vocational school enrollment. Multivariate analyses conducted on antecedent and criterion data formed the bases for data-information conversion procedures used in the field tests. It is concluded that:  (1) Successful and satisfied students enrolled in diverse vocational programs can be differentiated by aptitude, interest, or personality measures obtained prior to or shortly after entry into the programs; (2) Similarity scores and profiles represent effective tehcniques for translating data on these differences into useful counseling information; (3) useful estimates of vocational program success can be conveyed to students in the form of experience tables based on the best predictors in a comprehensive battery of aptitude measures; and (4) The development of a generalized system of computer-based procedures for data-information conversion is both feasible and desirable.

It is suggested that an alternative approach can be formulated in terms of an information processing analysis of both the test and the task. Two experiments, undertaken to examine the use of intellectual process constructs in considering this relationship, are fully described. According to the proposed model, the first stage would be an information processing analysis of known tests of mental ability. The results of Experiment I indicate that commonly-used tests of mental abilities may be composed in part of several specifiable intellectual processes  which may be similar across a diverse range of mental abilities. Experiment II revealed that instructing a group of subjects to use hypotheses relevant to attaining solutions in a series of concept problems contributed significantly to their mean performance. In addition, hypothesis generation, evaluation, and memory are proposed as three intellectual processes important in concept learning problems. (Author/PR)",

Limitations of the simulation  approach are seen in terms of 1) indiscriminate use of large-scale system simulation which results in the construction of models that become goals rather than means to a goal, 2) the relatively high cost of digital simulation, and 3) the need for careful selection of input conditions and specific output required.

Simulated medical problems, amplified by concurrent thinking aloud, episodic retrospection during the work-up, and videotape-stimulated retrospection, are used to obtain records of the behavior and reasoning physicians use to solve diagnostic problems. The fundamental units of analysis are questions, critical findings, and hypotheses. Eight categories of questions relate the information seeking behavior of the inquiring physician to a widely accepted outline for medical history taking. Critical findings in a case are elicited by questions and are assigned weights depending upon their relation to any conceivable diagnostic hypothesis. Hypotheses tested by an inquirer are identified from his thinking aloud  and retrospection. Findings elicited are evaluated in relation to inquirer's hypotheses or to those he might have considered but did not. Medical diagnosis is thus analyzed as a special case of hypothesis testing. The method is illustrated by application to two work-ups of the same problem; one globally rated substantially better than the other. The method effectively distinguishes between the two in psychologically relevant ways. Discussion relates the findings to current work in problem solving. (Author)",

The course was divided into units, with grading based on units completed rather than percentage of materials  learned within each unit.

Current tests for creativity generally emphasize only unusualness and--to a very limited extent--appropriateness as criteria for creativity. The present study reanalyzes creativity test results for transformations using aesthetic reactions of judges to creativity test responses, a technique intended to operationalize Jackson and Messick's observation that creative products engender specific aesthetic reactions in the viewer in relation to each response property. Results are compared  with standard creativity test scores. The Torrance tests are found to generate low-order creative responses as judged within the Jackson/Messick framework.

The existence of systematic response tendencies independent of the meaning of the adjectives was demonstrated. Although the substantive results agreed generally with the Evaluation, Activity and Potency dimensions of earlier research, notable differences were found; specifically, that a clear separation between a hedonic response and a judgment of values seems to exist.

Elementary and secondary school teachers from a Wisconsin middle-class school district completed both instruments. Analysis of the data revealed six significant canonical correlations relating the two scales. Four of these variates proved to be interpretable: supportive relations, pay and benefits, work load, and facilities and equipment. Each variate is discussed and the elements are presented in individual tables. The study indicates that teacher morale can be predicted from a number of factors common to both instruments. (LR)",

Fifty-seven percent of the children in a suburban school district used traditional readiness workbooks and of the remaining 43%, some used non-series readiness workbooks that taught sounds but not words. A stratified random sampling procedure assigned one readiness class and one reading class to each of three schools. Teacher volunteers were correspondingly classified. Those in the readiness programs were told that they must use the readiness workbooks for six weeks during which there was to be no formal reading instruction, and those who were reading class teachers were told to begin  formal reading instruction using pre-primers with all children. Both formal and informal reading ability pre-tests showed that there were no statistical differences between the groups. The results showed that the use of traditional reading readiness materials in first grade is not only valueless, but may even retard reading progress. On the other hand, regular reading instruction is valuable and should not be denied any child. (TA)",

At least one detrimental effect is shown to exist for each type of analysis. When a researcher's interest is with infallible variables, he runs the risk of biased results from all of the procedures except ANOVA. The estimates of parameters in all four procedures suffer from inflated error variance. Some partial solutions are indicated, but clearly more work is needed on several of the problems. Most statistical procedures have been developed for models where variables are assumed to be free from errors of measurement. Since almost all educational research involves use of fallible variables, it is important that the effects of errors  of measurement for the various models be understood and that the understanding be reflected in current research practice.

The CAM Academy requested the assistance of the University of Illinois in undertaking a comprehensive curriculum evaluation to provide the data necessary to the development of a new program. Objectives of the evaluation were to determine the effects of the educational program on the students, to explicate the instructional and curriculum designs in operation and changes which had occurred in them, to identify the constructs in these designs which made them viable alternatives for the students, and, finally, to test areas of cooperative endeavor which would be  beneficial to both the University and its neighboring community. A modification of Stufflebeam's model which employs four evaluative areas - context, input, process, and product - was employed as a guide for data collection. A number of data sources were tapped and the resulting information was analyzed against contrast data on public school curricula and students.

Although the model is explained in terms of this specific application, the approach proposed could also be used to structure similar decision problems at the district or state levels, or in secondary and pre-school educational systems. The calculation of the index number for a particular area depends on: (1) the relative importance of that area in terms of the overall educational goals; (2) the \"utility\" or \"value\" to the decision  maker of making an improvement in that area, given the current level of performance; (3) the probability distribution of the results of implementing a particular type of improvement program for that area, given the current level of performance; and (4) the cost of the program.

Three publications predated this book and they serve as a compendium of available information on the College Board Admissions Testing Program up to 1957 stressing proper test use and test interpretation for admissions and guidance. Recent manuals tend to be more interpretive than explicative.

In order to indicate the setting within which the program functions, a brief historical sketch, as well as administrative and psychometric considerations are briefly outlined.

Such participation includes membership of parents on advisory committees, opportunities for parents to serve as volunteers and employees, and a family-centered focus and maximum coordination of services in health, education, and welfare programs designed to serve children and youth.  Particular emphasis should be placed on programs for poor families and those of minority-group status. It is necessary to develop programs that strengthen the family unit, which is under many diverse stresses and pressures, including the competition of government agencies in providing services which it formerly provided exclusively. Concommitant with the new approaches required to give all families a significant and secure place in the community, evaluation components should be built into programs. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In this study, several examples of the relationship between environmental structure and the functional characteristics of objects interacting in an elementary educational environment are presented. These examples are interpreted within a frame of reference derived from a synthesis of concepts and principles from behavioral science and general systems theories. Part I provides evidence which indicates that: (1) in a relatively desegregated setting, homogeneous ability grouping tends to separate children ethnically and socio-economically, and (2) when either a heterogeneous or homogeneous environment is compounded by a self-contained classroom, the pattern of instruction across settings tends to be uniform. Part II presents a theoretical discussion which attempts to explain the  process underlying the relationship between structure and function in an educational environment. An alternative model of elementary school and classroom organization is presented. (Author/DM)",

        "description":"The child entering nursery or elementary school is aware of his own race and of racial differences among other children and adults, is likely to have evaluated different races, has probably questioned his own skin color or that of others, and has possibly behaved prejudicially. Until very recently the question of race was ignored in children's literature; blacks have been virtually nonexistent as far as the publishing industry was concerned. Although publishers and editors contend that large numbers of books involving black people are available today, they do admit that the sales problem largely determines how many get published. Few people seem to question how many so-called integrated books actually exist: yet a search for fiction picture books involving black people located  only 56 published between 1939 and 1971. Almost half portray black people only. Of those showing both black and white people, the illustrations in at least half of them make skin color indeterminable. With one or two exceptions, no book mentions race. Of the 56 as listed in the annotated bibliography included in this report, just four were published before 1950, only seven during the fifties, almost all the remainder during the sixties, together with seven 1970 books.

Subjects for the study were elementary school and special counselors from a large Southwestern public school system; all were females. After reading identical, hypothetical clinical descriptions and differentiated accounts of the alleged family situation of a boy with behavior problems, the subjects were asked to respond to a list of possible courses of action. The results of this investigation lend support to the previous findings that social class is a significant factor in influencing expectancies and behavior of those in the helping professions. Examination of the responses of the two groups  suggests that when the child is identified as having upper-class status, there is a greater willingness on the part of the counselor to become ego-involved in the management of the child who seemed \"more important,\" and worthier of attention, than when the youngster is of lower-class status.

        "description":"If the major educational objective of classifying children into restricted range classroom environments is greater provision for individual differences--and given that there is no clear-cut evidence indicating that this object has been realized--then one is compelled to entertain the conclusion that ability grouping, as presently implemented, has failed to establish its merit as a sound instructional policy. Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of empirical evidence to support the use of ability grouping as an instrumental arrangement in public schools. Data from a close examination of studies ranging from those done in the Plainfield, New Jersey school system, the court findings in the Hobson vs. Hanson case in Washington, D.C., plus data drawn from  numerous earlier studies by eminent social scientists further reveal ability grouping as a questionable practice. Taken as a whole the data indicate that grouping on the basis of standardized measures of achievement or aptitude tends to systematically separate children along ethnic and socio-economic composition of classes that are formed on the basis of the ability grouping rule of organization.

The purpose of the school is to define and identify possible causes and remedies of underachievement. Analysis of the data obtained on fourth- and fifth-grade boys who attended the school during the summer of 1969 indicates that significant changes resulted in several areas. One year after returning to their home school, both groups of students evidenced a greater ability to assume responsibility for their own learning, less alienation from school, and improved academic performance. Fourth-graders showed more improvement in behavior, while those in grade 5 made greater improvement in grades. On the basis of these  results, there are indications that younger students benefit more from a program designed to remedy underachievement.

The tragedy lies in the fact that a program with a fair modicum of success will not be continued because the decision-makers in the state government concerned with this area decided with insufficient justification to end this program after the summer of 1968. Six hundred boys, nine to 14 years of age, from the poverty ghettos of Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and Stamford, Connecticut, were served during that summer in a sleep-away camp in the heart of the Connecticut Valley resort area. Camp PAART (Poverty Area Adolescent Recreation and Training Program) was staffed by 15 senior counselors and 60 junior counselors, 16 to 19 years old, from the same ghetto areas. The financial support came from an insurance  company, a national foundation, a business and commerce council, a local trade association, and the State of Connecticut. The camp program served two groups: the junior counselors who, in addition to the opportunities involved in providing a service, earned a good weekly salary; and, the 600 campers. The dramatic changes that occurred in the junior counselors when they had the opportunity to help others opened new visions of the future for themselves. The program also demonstrated the viability of people with personal problems helping others with similar problems. Camp PAART was deemed a success. (Author)",

Even so, participation is hampered by the \"natural\" apathy of people. But the fact of apathy has too little research as to its causes to be well understood; perhaps, apathy is a rational response to a society which discourages participation. Democracy is a theory which identifies itself with opposition to and protest against social justice. As to the question of educational expertise, the limits of expert authority are the limits of expert competence. Feed back from the community lets the experts know how expertise is serving the community. Too, there is a clear distinction between expertise, and the values which a community wishes its experts to follow.  Finally, community control is an issue transcending any urban function, and is intimately involved with the demands of democratic theory. (Author/DM)",

The Commission's investigation of the current personnel practices of the New York City school system yields one inescapable conclusion--that change is urgently demanded. The essential issue raised by the hearings was whether the system that now prevails can be further modified to meet the divergent needs of all the individual schools and districts in the city, or whether more drastic change is required. A few of the many who testified, principally the representatives of the Board of Examiners, consider the current system fundamentally sound. The view of the vast proponderance of witnesses, however, was that the  current selection system has certain fundamental flaws which cannot be completely corrected except by wholesale reform. At the heart of the problem, as they see it, is a complex and rigid examination process presided over by the Board of Examiners. But problems relating to recruiting, establishment of eligibility requirements and the use of the probationary period, all of which are the responsibility of the Board of Education and the Chancellor, were seen as having considerable impact.

        "description":"This publication, the fifth annual report of the Division of Federal Assistance of the Ohio Department of Education, summarizes the work of the Division during fiscal 1970. In addition to presenting statistical, fiscal, and graphic data, the report is designed to help educators and other interested persons understand Titles I, II, and V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and various other Federal programs administered by the Division of Federal Assistance; it is also hoped that the reader will come to understand the complexity of problems facing educators. In particular, the programs in Ohio are briefly described. They include basic programs for disadvantaged youth, and special programs for migrant children, orphans, delinquents, and the handicapped. Also, grants for  library resources and instructional materials and adult basic education programs are reviewed. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"In this essay, possible mechanisms which may lead to discrimination in the allocation of inputs to public education are discussed. A model of market discrimination in the supply curve for public school teachers is explained and tested using data from the Boston Metropolitan Area. The consequences for the distribution of teacher inputs in the Boston area of the measured discrimination are then explored. School systems with more non-white students, other things being equal, in the Boston area appear to have greater expenditures per pupil. Although these same systems receive more of some of the measures of teacher quality, relative expenditures per student, for these communities, is much greater than relative measured input per student. State and Federal aid appear to go more to  school systems with more non-whites, especially Federal aid. There is little evidence that aid programs are generally redistributive towards low-income groups. The results of the study raise the possibility that decentralized ghetto school systems may have to pay a very high price for teachers in a free market. (Author/JW)",

The 12 task force members represent diverse backgrounds and educational interests. Although their demands seem quite diverse, a pattern emerged. Most of the topics appeared to fall into three major areas of concern: the need for equal educational opportunity, relevant educational systems, and student participation in educational governance. Three other topics appeared to require special attention: the problems facing exceptional students, the problems facing the dropout and potential dropout, and the need to provide teachers with better preparation. The task force requested six nationally known educators to write  position papers concerning the topics. Task force members also attempted to study the attitudes of young people toward education to obtain the views of as many people as possible. They relied on two youth attitude surveys conducted by the White House Conference as well as recent reports by students on education and reports from youth conferences being held across the country.

Each school had an enrollment that was approximately 52 percent white, 22 percent black, 22 percent Mexican American, and the remainder Oriental. During the early weeks of school, the integration plan worked smoothly. After a short time, racial tensions began to develop in the junior and senior high schools. Caused in most instances by what appeared to be trivial matters, school authorities feared these tensions would develop into more serious problems. Abraham Lincoln, a school of 2,200, was typical of the senior high schools in the district. Since the beginning of the semester, one small incident had followed another until serious racial tension existed on the campus. In  an effort to &quot;cool off&quot; the campus and help locate the specific sources of trouble, the principal called together a representative group of parents, teachers, administrators, and students for a series of meetings. It is this series of meetings that constitute the roles and stage for the simulation. Participants are assigned roles, including those of black student, teacher, parent, administrator, etc. (Author/JM)",

The total student population of the four school systems is approximately 48,900 and the teaching and administrative staff is approximately 2,150. The 120 participants were selected at the parish and/or system level. Problems around which the Consortium activities would focus were identified through a series of meetings with personnel from Northeast Louisiana University, representatives from the Educational Resource Center in New Orleans, the U.S. Office of Education's Regional Office in  Dallas, and representatives from the four school systems. The program was designed to facilitate changes in the attitudes and behavior of the participants. It was hoped these changes would be reflected in greater understanding of problems at the school or system level and would promote a heightening of educational quality. (Author/JM)",

During the winter session, the Institute staff visited with the participants in the classroom, providing an opportunity for staff  and participants to cooperate in testing and developing reading programs. Experiences of a workshop nature were offered the second summer to provide participants an opportunity to individualize their programs. Workshop experiences included: a materials-method area; an interpersonal experiences area; a media area which used video-taped equipment as a means of examining classroom interactions; and, materials and methods evaluation.

        "description":"To evaluate the use of radio as a means of recruiting minority students into the health fields, 11 schools in the San Francisco Bay Area were selected to participate in a program of weekly radio broadcasts studying 11 health professions with manpower shortages. A combination panel and question and answer format was used for the broadcasts. Meetings were held with school representatives before the program began to discuss topics, objectives, and other technical matters as well as after the fourth broadcast to assess reactions and difficulties encountered. A followup survey was conducted after the series ended. Although attendance figures and other statistical data were incomplete, the project staff reported that the programs were effective in producing interest and enthusiasm,  particularly in schools in which faculty and administrators took a personal interest in helping disadvantaged students examine their interests and capabilities. Results demonstrate that two-way radio broadcasts are a promising means of recruiting disadvantaged students into the health professions. Recommendations are provided for planning, staff, physical arrangements, criteria for panelists, student participation, publicity, followup coordination, and reporting procedures. (SB)",

This study investigated the possibility that these inputs are sometimes deficient in quantity or timing. In addition, the effect upon design of different personnel quality and quantity requirements was analyzed. Equipment and HRD inputs which were produced during actual missile development were presented to eight design engineers, who were required to develop a conceptual design of the equipment. By varying personnel constraints and timing of inputs, the study found that the type of manpower requirement and the amount and timing of HRD inputs influence design, although somewhat unpredictably. The estimates of personnel required to operate and maintain systems does not always relate to design concepts.  The study concluded that personnel requirements should be included in proposal requests and work statements and recommended that further research be undertaken to describe the design implications of HRD inputs.

This is a report on one such study, involving 40 male University of Oregon students divided into two groups of 10 pairs of subjects. The task learning (TL) group and the interpersonal learning (IPL) group were trained for 60 trials to predict a numerical criterion on the basis of two numerical cues (X1 and X2). For the TL group, pairs of subjects were trained to use the same cue according to the same rule. For half the pairs, X1 was linearly related to the criterion, while for the rest, X1 was a nonlinear cue. In the IPL group, each pair was differentially  trained, with one using X1 as a linear cue, and the other using X2 as a nonlinear cue. When the pairs were combined for a task involving two equally valid linear and nonlinear cues, the IPL group adapted significantly better to the task due to the linear subjects' inability to learn to use the nonlinear cue on the basis of task learning alone.

Based on expressed career intent, the most favorable sources of retention were the commissioning programs for enlisted men. The yearly responses to the career intent statement indicated a decline in career intent at least through the first few years of service. Job characteristic factors found to be most important centered  around job satisfaction, such as working under competent supervisors, having a sense of accomplishment, and having an opportunity for advancement. Least important values were represented by such factors as early retirement, travel, and having a definite work schedule.

Objectives were: (1) to organize and develop occupational information in agriculture for guidance counselors and teachers to use in acquainting students with occupations in the agricultural world of work, and (2) to test experimentally different methods of preparing and making available this information. Findings on Phase One of the study revealed positive relationships of agricultural interest, father's occupation, and student I.Q. with student-expressed intentions to elect agriculture in the next school year, to  obtain post-high school education, and to enter an agricultural occupation. Findings of Phases Two and Three revealed that students living on farms had higher scores on the \"Vocational Agriculture Interest Inventory.\" The test instrument and a listing of cooperating schools are appended.

Utilizing the description method with the group-interview technique, the study obtained data from 266 experienced teachers. Several recommendations are presented which focus on visual aids, revision of materials, format changes, and teacher guides related to the subject matter references. Results of the study show that current activities are not meeting teacher  needs. Consequently the SMS must be geared to keep abreast of the growing needs of teachers by expanding facilities and personnel. (GB)",

Findings revealed that individual instruction on the secondary level is sufficient to meet the needs of students and that student needs at the postsecondary level were insufficient for a 2-year program. Recommendations were that individual students at the secondary level should be offered supervised experience programs in agricultural resources.

These are: (1) How important are personal characteristics of black workers in explaining the variance in their relative occupational standing among the private sectors of these cities? (2) How important are general characteristics of the cities and industries in which they work? and (3) What policies are most likely to improve the relative occupational standing of blacks employed in the private sector? The strategy for answering these questions was to develop measures of personal characteristics of black workers and of general characteristics of the labor markets and industries where they work. Answers derived through the use of this strategy include the following: (1) Personal  characteristics of blacks such as their education and age are important, but less so, then general characteristics of the cities in which they work, in predicting their relative occupational standing; (2) Black women have greater chances of achieving occupational parity in cities where in-migration is not great; (3) Occupational parity for black men depends on greater access to manufacturing and unionized industries, where the demand for white collar workers is weak.

However, research has indicated that many secondary-school-age girls have unrealistic educational and vocational plans and incomplete knowledge of relevant facts about the world of work. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to develop a package of curriculum materials designed to aid girls in considering future alternatives in terms of labor force participation and adult female roles. Curriculum materials and a questionnaire consisting of attitude, objective, and demographic items were developed and pilot tested at the seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade  levels. It was found that students at all grade levels gained information about the world of work and women's roles in employment through the use of these materials. A major recommendation was that, with slight revisions, the materials would be appropriate to use with classes of boys and girls. (Author)",

A 6-month study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the HELP campaign and the nature of those who responded. The procedure involved in analysis of the letters sent to HELP, interviews, questionnaires, and an analysis of case file data from the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. Of the 1,100 individuals represented by 1,000 responses to HELP letters, seven out of twelve were disabled persons in the 16-59 age group. It was concluded that 5/12ths were suitable candidates for vocational rehabilitation and that 4/12th could be helped by no known agency. Specific recommendations for future programs  of this nature are that they promise no more than can be delivered, and that they be immediately responsive. (GEB)",

Two major tools for achieving the agency's goals are the Job Bank System and improved job development coordination. The Job Bank System is a clearinghouse for jobseekers and employers seeking workers, which produces a daily computerized listing of available jobs and training opportunities in the area. By using this listing in neighborhoods of high unemployment and coordinating job development activity, DCMA is moving toward a more comprehensive use of the total Washington Metropolitan Area manpower resources.

Over half the farms with sales under $2,500 used only family labor, yet only 6 percent of the large-scale farms operated with just family labor. Farmers hiring labor used more family labor than farmers not hiring labor. When hiring, operators of small farms mostly used seasonal labor. Seasonal hired help were used more in the Pacific and Southern Regions, with their most significant contribution on large vegetable and fruit and nut farms. Regular hired workers were the major source of hired manpower for large-scale farms and for most of the dairy and livestock  operations in the Northern Regions. Total hours of labor used and proportion that was hired also varied by farm type. A tobacco farmer used 3,625 hours of labor, with only 18 percent of it hired, while a vegetable farmer used 7,600 hours, with 63 percent of it hired. (Author)",

A general conclusion from statewide reports was that both adults and youth were positive in their response to vocational education. Respondents were in favor of vocational education, vocational guidance, and the educational programs which related to future employment and education beyond high school. The two extremes in this survey dramatically identified job placement as a less positive item contrasted to the overwhelming acceptance of experience as a prerequisite for the teacher in vocational education. Fifty-nine percent of  the parents compared to 44 percent of the youth responded that they were satisfied with the school program in their school district. Both groups indicated a positive response that vocational instructors should assist vocational students with job placement in their first opportunity upon graduation. (GB)",

        "description":"The career education concept should replace vocational education so that more of the American people can receive the benefits that are being provided students in vocational education. It is necessary to begin to construct a sound, systematized relationship between education and work, a system which will make it standard practice to teach every student about occupations and the economic enterprise and which will increase career options for each individual. The National Center for Educational Research and Development is concentrating on the development of three model career education programs. The first model, oriented directly toward the school setting, would affect kindergarten through junior college by reshaping the curriculum to focus directly on the concept of career  development. The second model would be created, developed, operated, and supported primarily by business in companionship with the schools. This program would concentrate on the 13 to 20 age group who have left school without needed competencies. The final model is a plan to use the home and community institutions to reach and teach persons with limited formal school and skills needed in successful employment. Such programs will give vocational education the national prestige that it needs. (GB)",

Cast in the form of an exemplary program and representing a total approach to the problem of occupational education for elementary and secondary school children, the program will provide an integrated educational experience in which each component of the educational system is carefully matched with every other component to produce the greatest possible efficiency. The Apex program is designed to provide for four phases: (1) increased attention to counseling and placement, (2) introduction of occupational education into the lower grades, (3) expansion of occupational education in the middle grades, and (4) provision for  additional occupational education and guidance services in upper grades. The all-inclusive goal of this exemplary program is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a comprehensive occupational education program in a rural school system.

Thus, this report presents the findings of a study of the characteristics of vocational education teachers and students. Information on the professional qualifications and teaching experiences of teachers is examined in relation to other characteristics and to the types of vocational education programs being taught. Information on students includes individual and family characteristics, program and labor force activity, and plans for the future. Among the findings of this report are: (1) The typical vocational education teacher is a male in his early 40's, (2) Median earnings of vocational education teachers are approximately $8,700 for a  contract year, and (3) There are slightly more female vocational students than male students. However, males outnumber females at the postsecondary level. (Author/JS)",

In addition to assembling comprehensive information about these products, the mission was to evolve a set of criteria for use in selecting from among them those to be recommended for National Center for Educational Communication (NCEC) &quot;focused&quot; dissemination attention, to execute a two-step selection procedure, to identify products for extended review and analysis and to recommend products upon which NCEC might focus its dissemination and installation efforts. A nationally representative appraisal panel was convened and met three times over two months to execute this mission. Principal staff support was provided by Educational Testing Service (ETS). Supplementary support was supplied  by consultants and staff from the Educational Products Information Exchange (EPIE). ETS staff assembled information principally from developers and also from other conventional sources on all the products in the pool. Criteria were formulated by the panel and on the basis of these criteria, 20 out of 51 products were selected for further study. A review was made of each products's development, and in most cases visits were made to the sites where the developments had occurred. On the basis of further study, nine of the products were recommended for dissemination. For related document, see ED 050 309. (Author/CK)",

The work of the Centre is organized into programs. Three programs have been completed: (1) the moral and social aspects of democracy, (2) constitutional proposals made by the Constitutional Commission with particular emphasis on human rights, and (3) problems of local government. All programs are directed to both the literate and the illiterate, the urban and the rural citizen, the young and the old. Teaching techniques used are lectures, discussion groups, debates, symposia, puppet  shows, and plays. Audiovisual aids are used extensively, with the material presented in both English and the major vernaculars. The Centre aims to become completely self-supporting in the near future.

The influences of adult education on social change include: improvement in living and health standards; creative use of leisure time; family budgeting instruction; procedures in  family planning; and opportunities for young dropouts to receive further education, and thus reduce their frustration and hostility.

Results of these experiments and related earlier research are summarized. Major findings indicate that high and low aptitude men may learn certain materials as well by listening as by reading; some poorer readers prefer to learn by listening rather than by reading. Characteristics of the recorded message that were found to affect listening comprehension include difficulty level of message, linguistic features of speech, and rate of speech. Extensive studies of the use of time-compressed and expanded recordings are described. (Author)",

Results presented in this report are based upon a questionnaire survey conducted in 1966 among U.S. Army advisor personnel assigned to the Korea Military Advisory Group (KMAG) and their counterparts in the Republic of Korea Army. A rationale for conceiving of proficient advisor counterpart transactions in terms of their stated willingness to continue working together in the future is presented.

The study aimed at the assessment of the results of this program currently conducted by the University of Maryland. The object of the program is to influence homemakers to change and improve family nutritional practices. This study focused on the educational tasks of non-professional aides in effecting this change. The general research strategy employed was twofold. First, the direct service recipient, the homemaker (usually of low-income status), and the direct service provider, the aide (often of similar background), were made the primary sources of data. Secondly, this evaluation sought to measure change over time. Visits were made by supervisors to selected sites (three) for study.  Three interviewers in each county selected were recruited and hired by the supervising agents. Using a table of random numbers, a 50% random sample was drawn from the population of homemakers being served by the program during December 1969. All data gathering interviews with homemakers took place during January 1970. A coding system was developed, and the data was coded and put on punched cards for sorting purposes. Data obtained directly from homemakers indicates that the program was seen as helpful. The contributions of the aides are what has made the program successful. It is concluded that the program should be continued and expanded. (CK)",

The flows of pilots within the Air Force are caused by policies that require the career-development rotation of pilots from cockpit jobs to desk jobs, the maintenance of a supplement of pilots in excess of cockpit-related needs, the cross-training of pilots from one aircraft system to another, and by factors such as retirement, resignation, promotion, and age limitations on flying status. The model has inputs of pilot requirements by year, aircraft system, and type of pilot, plus appropriate descriptions of the various personnel flows. The outputs are the numbers of graduates required each year from the various formal training schools to meet the need for  pilots. Problems concerning future training programs, pilot loss rates, and policy variables controlling pilot flows may be examined with the PILOT model. The model may also be used in conjunction with resource and cost models to obtain pilot requirements and statements of personnel flow policy which are translated directly into annual training costs.

Section V contains a description of two forms of output and an illustration of one of these forms. The UPT cost model program is written in FORTRAN IV. During execution, the program requires approximately 145K bytes of core storage on an IBM 360/65 computer, if the OVERLAY feature is used. All input data are read from cards and the output is printed. A listing of the program input data elements is presented in Appendix A.

The unimaginative and cavalier response of the establishment and public during the era of peaceful demonstrations is seen as having left the way open for more violent tactics. At higher educational institutions, the focus of student attacks will be the faculty and their tenure system and outmoded pedagogical technology. Lastly, the university is viewed as a meeting place for the revolution where hope for change is nurtured and from where it spreads into the larger world.

        "description":"A single theme for each of the three convention years forms the nucleus around which the presented papers revolve. The 1968 theme, The Christian's Quest for Maturity, focuses on normalcy and the ways and means whereby Christians can become more healthfully mature. In 1969, the convention examined the unique role of the Christian therapist who is viewed as having an added dimension to his counseling. The Christian using psychology to help others considers himself different and strives to meaningfully share this difference. Dynamic Christian Growth, the 1970 theme, sees the Christian professional as, above all else, a Christian and, therefore, a witness. The papers are geared to providing Christians better ways to witness - in the office, in groups, in the community, and in the  church. All three series of papers ultimately explore ways of feeling with man and his problems within the context of the evangelical Christian faith. (TL)",

The program is experimental and is designed to prepare youth to make a positive transition from high school to suitable employment or post high school training. Objectives include: (1) exposing students to national and local labor market information and manpower trends; (2) helping students learn and implement techniques for employment and career planning; and (3) facilitating job-seeking techniques. Complete program activities are described for both years. First year results indicate that participants were more aggressive in the labor force, were better equipped to enter the labor  force and earned higher wages. A second year evaluative summary points to success in respect to knowledge and motivational effects on participants, staff adequacy, program-school relationships, and program relevance to the target population. Plans for the third year are discussed. (TL)",

The applied behavioral scientist would be employed in situations similar to those now employing counselors; his job will be to apply theory and research derived from the various behavioral sciences in order to help individuals and institutions achieve their purposes. For example, the behavioral scientist in the school would work with students, their parents, teachers, and administrators to provide students with experiences that most efficiently facilitate their development. Essentially, much of what is presently included in graduate programs would be eliminated and the proposed preparation would be considered as extending over a life time. The  graduate school would only start the preparation, then universities, professional associations and employing institutions would cooperate to provide the professional worker with opportunities for continuing education. Some of the questions and problems one must face to consider this proposal are raised. (TA)",

Only with this degree of understanding of the Indian can the counselor attempt to counsel the Indian justly and benefit both Indian and counseling  interests.

In short, U. S. and Japanese students both agreed most that participatory democracy should be the basis of a new society and disagreed most that educational institutions should espouse political doctrines. Also, Japanese students combine trust in &quot;most people&quot; with distrust of government and political opposition, reflecting perhaps the greater political activism of the group; whereas, U. S. students agreed more with statements which indicated a liberal or even non-political trust. Finally, Japanese  students agreed that extensive reforms perpetuate social evils and that militant confrontation is required, whereas the U. S. sample put great faith in legal social authority as a vehicle for change. In both countries, different factors are apparent suggesting that New Left ideology may be nation specific, i.e. take on different forms depending on national tradition. (Author/TA)",

As a result of theoretical model building, it was hypothesized that there may be a resurgency of playfulness, assumed to be a personality trait of the player, in adolescents. The most significant finding is the emergence of a much more differentiated behavior within playfulness in adolescents as against the unitary trait found in kindergartners. Also, when teachers' conceptualizations of playfulness in the adolescent were analyzed for positive and negative connotations, one-third of the teacher-mentioned attributes were negative for behavior in the classroom as against one-fourth for playfulness at large in the adolescent. Finally, from the information  on situational determinants of playfulness at the adolescent level, it would appear that young people and adults are aware that specific behavioral dimensions of playfulness can be shown more freely in an unstructured setting.

Findings reported include the following: (1) the referrals were some of the most chronic patients at the hospital; (2) no statistically significant differences among treatment teams regarding knowledge, behavior, and attitudes toward the Lodge were found to be related to referrals, the number of men who were rejected, the number who refused to enter or those who joined the Lodge; and (3) with the exception of the vocational rehabilitation counselors, the attitude on the part of treatment  personnel was only slightly favorable. In general, leadership among the Lodge membership was found necessary for the group to respond more effectively to the social and work tasks it faced, and the vitality of the Lodge community seemed largely contingent upon positively influencing the variables that influence leadership.

Specifically, it is concerned with determining: (1) whether there are differences between troubled and untroubled families in the level of understanding of connotative meanings; and (2) whether the establishment of communication through tape recorded messages leads to an increase in understanding of connotative meanings. The results of this investigation suggest: (1) there is greater understanding of connotative meanings in \"normal\" families than in families with delinquent children; (2) the misunderstanding in troubled families is primarily a function of parental misunderstanding of sons; and (3) the use of taped  communication results in increased accuracy for such families. The finding that \"delinquent\" parents are less accurate than their sons supports the view that communication in such families tends to be unidirectional. The parents do not listen to nor learn about the feelings and concerns of their sons. It is obvious that improvement of the total family situation requires two-way communication. (Author/TA)",

In addition, there were significant differences between the no-threat group, the other groups, and the total group. In various comparisons on test performance, there were marked differences between racial and enlistment region subgroups, but only moderate differences within draft-threat groups.

The model provides a potentially useful scheme for classifying environmental contingencies operating on a member of an organization and for predicting their varied effects on behavior. (Author)",

Twenty-second base line estimates and 20-second response levels to four drops of lemon juice were measured, with the former value being removed from the latter to form the salivary score for a given subject. The first study obtained a test-retest correlation over 24 hours for the net salivation score of 0.78 (N = 25; p&lt;.001). The second study involved the measurement of the threshold of fusion of paired light flashes [two-flash threshold (TFT)], a previously validated index of arousal, as well as salivation. The correlation between net salivation and TFT on 25 subjects was -.57 (p&lt;.01). It was  concluded that the salivary measure has demonstrated promising psychometric properties for use in ID research. (Author)",

The relationship between the two techniques used in measuring this social environment was also of interest. Fourth and fifth grade students' affective reactions to the following stimuli on both techniques formed the data base: home, friends, mother, self, father, school, teacher, principal. Of primary interest in this study was the attempt to predict or explain the students' reactions to the above stimuli on the basis of the following effects: grade level, teacher sex, student sex, student behavior, and student reading achievement. Results indicated that the combined techniques were most valid in measuring the students' affective reactions to the  following stimuli: mother, father, school, teacher, and principal. Based on the eight dependent variables for each technique the overall multivariate hypotheses were significant for these main effects: (1) grade level; (2) teacher sex; and (3) student sex. Of primary interest was the finding that the students' affective reactions to the concepts of school, teacher, and principal varied significantly depending on reading performance. (Author)",

It attempted to determine the extent to which children of varying ages utilize semantic (denotative or connotative) and acoustical encoding categories in a short-term memory task. It appears to be a reasonable assumption that as associational hierarchies become more complex and category distinctions become more precisely defined, encoding processes will also manifest definite modifications. The assumption underlying the present research is that when a person hears a word he encodes it into a number of different psychological categories. When a number of words are encoded into the same category within a short period of time, inter-item interference occurs and depresses recall. If a  subsequent group of words are coded into a different category, inter-item interference is minimized and recall is facilitated. (Author)",

The results of the statistical testing of the hypotheses indicated that interpersonal compatibility did not have a significant effect, and suggested that the theory may be inadequate for determining outcomes in  initial counseling relationships.

        "description":"In investigating emotional phenomena in humans, overt-behavioral, self-report, and physiological responses all often seem to be appropriate measures. However, experience has shown that these different kinds of response often do not vary together. It may be that these measures disagree because they are related to different underlying variables. To illustrate how overt-behavioral and physiological responses appear to be influenced by different kinds of variables, several studies of sex differences in emotional responding are reviewed. These indicate that, in certain emotional situations, females appear to respond more than males on overt-behavioral measures, while males show larger physiological responding. In situations involving aggression, in contrast, males show more overt  responding while females show greater physiological reactions. The data suggest that the overt-behavioral responses are in fact affected directly by social expectations, while the physiological measures are not. It is concluded that different sets of variables must underlie overt-behavioral and physiological responses, and that the relationships between different kinds of emotional responding deserve further study.

Two suggestions are proposed: (1) there is a need to police manuscripts submitted to professional research journals for relevance and practicality; and (2) there is a need to involve school personnel, the practitioners in the field, in the planning, design, and conduct of viable research studies. Several impediments to this goal are noted, e.g., little internal and external pressure to change the status quo; the paucity of theories of organizations and of guidance mitigates against the building of a sound base for generating research; and organizational psychologists have not been much more successful in solving similar problems in their own field. Yet, the author is hopeful that a systems approach to  research will serve to alter present priorities by: (1) mandating the necessity for a team effort; (2) maximizing the likelihood of producing usable results; (3) creating order among present diverse functions; (4) seeking ways to maximize benefits and minimize costs; and (5) by compelling guidance workers to operationalize their thinking and actions. Difficulties include prohibitive initial costs and systematizing the process and outcomes, a de-humanizing procedure in itself. (Author/TA)",

Past research indicates that compliance with a small, relatively innocuous \"foot-in-the-door\" request serves to increase, relative to a control group, subsequent compliance with a larger request directed toward the same goal. The present study suggests such commitment (increasing) effects may be limited to active \"feet-in-the-door,\" predicting substitution (decreasing) effects for passive (less effortful) \"foot-in-the-door\" compliance. Results support only the substitution predictions and show none of the commitment effects previously demonstrated in the literature for active \"foot-in-the-door\" compliance. Attempts to resolve these discrepant  findings generate a two-factor model, specifying both the degree of initial commitment and the active versus passive nature of the \"foot-in-the-door\" requests. Specifically, active \"foot-in-the-door\" compliance and low degrees of initial commitment seem to produce commitment effects; passive compliance and high initial commitment tend toward substitution effects.

The experiential-Gestalt growth group is a relatively unstructured group experience which emphasizes the exploration and expression of here-and-now feelings concerning self and other group members. Focus is put on what \"is,\" on awareness of one's experiencing and interpersonal interactions, and on awareness of ways in which one prevents himself from feeling, moving, and living more fully and honestly. Marathon growth groups, a time extended growth group experience, are a group practicum in intimate,  authentic, human interaction to facilitate a transition from self defensive alienation to transparency and psychological intimacy through genuine encounter. The studies support the proposition that the experiential-Gestalt growth group may be an effective method for fostering the process of personal growth and experiential learning in relatively healthy, growth seeking individuals. The growth center model is currently being implemented at Bowling Green State University. (Author/TA)",

It deals with the extent to which there is too much standardization in the mix of programs, with the cause of standardization, and with what can be done about it. The author proposes: (1) that the solution to over standardization of manpower services lies in eliminating the role of guidelines by altering the organizational structure to one which is not based on over arching centralized rule making; (2) that programs are over standardized intrinsically because they are run by agencies organized around a model which requires standardized tasks and work processes; and (3) that manpower agencies must change the basis of their organizational structure to one not requiring a uniform definition of tasks.  To make the mix of services more responsive to the state of the local economy and to the range of the universe of need, a conversion of the manpower system to an alternative organizational type with greater local operational autonomy and control, as well as resources, is needed.

The philosophy underlying this approach is that teaching front line personnel better methods and techniques of handling mental health problems will ultimately lead to true prevention by way of curricular change, changes in teaching techniques, and clearer definition of role responsibility. It appears that a reality oriented, behavior modification approach in group psychotherapy has usefulness not only in dealing with more disturbing behaviors, but also has a tremendous potential for assisting counselors to better utilize their experience in dealing with normal adolescents. The Hill Interaction Matrix was deemed a very useful technique in determining what is therapeutic in a group. Also, it appears that  the concept of volunteer group psychotherapy has a definite place as both a clinical and consultative model for secondary schools. (Author/TA)",

Yet Wagner (1949) was able to conclude that the reliability of an employment interview is situation and interviewer specific. In this study, the author investigated the interviewer's scoring system, the way he weighs and combines the information he gathers as he attempts to make a personnel decision. This information processing includes: (1) assessing the interrelations of the cues; (2) assessing the validity of the cues for his given purpose; and (3) combining the individual validities while partialling out the common variance among the cues. Results show that: (1) interviewers make adjustments when they perceive redundant information; (2) they process negative  information more accurately than positive information; and (3) they differ widely in terms of how valid and interdependent they perceive information units to be. The decisions or hiring recommendations were based almost exclusively on the overall evaluations of the information which the interviewers received and processed. If the final evaluation exceeded the base rate of success, the recommendation was to hire; if not, the recommendation was to reject. (TA)",

The failure to explicitly place the criterion problem within an appropriate conceptual model is perhaps a major reason for the failure to confront directly this problem on the empirical level. Notable, too, is that the focus on the criterion problem and indeed creativity research in general has ignored interpersonal considerations. The present study was undertaken to test the general hypothesis that the personal value orientation of the rater and category of behavior being rated would interact in determining judged creativity. Results indicate a significant interaction between value  orientation and behavior category, clearly indicating that these two factors interact to determine judged creativity. In addition, the significant Newman-Keuls Analyses indicate the exact nature of this basic interaction: behaviors within the field of one's own value orientation are judged more creative than behaviors outside the field of one's value orientation.

Each contact with a student by personnel officers should be viewed as an opportunity for facilitating learning and growth. As such, a responsibility for being conversant with and open to discussion of matters integral to the (local) student culture rests squarely on student affairs personnel. Essential interaction can hardly be a mutually profitable occurrence without acceptance of such a duty. In addition to such day-to-day interaction whereby developmental opportunities are inherent in the interchange with students, planned activities should be offered to complement the classroom situation. Such co-curricular  offerings should center about vital issues and contemporary topics not dealt with in traditional academic courses. Examples of several such program approaches are presented and a schema for assigning responsibility for the organization and sponsorship of such programs is outlined. (Author)",

In a persuasive communication situation, where effectiveness depends on the receiver feelings controlled and subject to influence from outside sources, externals ought to show more attitude change than internals. On the other hand, counter-attitudinal behavior, i.e., role playing, should be effective to the extent that one doesn't feel externally constrained and views himself as a causal agent of his rewards and behavior. Results indicated that: (1) with role playing behavior, low externals showed significantly more change; (2) with persuasive messages, high and low externals didn't differ significantly; and (3) high and low external  controls didn't differ in change scores.

        "description":"Thirty students were formed into ten triads, each of which participated in a series of 48 games generated by the combination of eight power structures with six payoff levels. The game paradigm presented each player with the option of attacking or not attacking one of the other two players in this triad. The game procedure, apparatus and design are fully described. It was found that the power structure of the triad, the position in certain of these structures, and the type of local norm that develops all affect the propensity to engage in conflict in which at most one person can achieve his goal, and in which it is possible for all to fail. The study of more complex conflict is encouraged. (TL)",

The author discusses five basic reasons why draft counseling should be offered and then considers a number of examples which indicate the kinds of problems which young draft-age men face: anxiety, moral dilemma, family pressures, self image, etc. The professional counselor's crucial role in the area of draft counseling is viewed as threefold: (1) establishing its legitimacy; (2) receiving training and then training others; and (3) working with the exceptionally difficult referrals. The question of values is briefly considered. The author's recommendations concerning the professional counselor and draft counseling conclude the paper. (TL)",

Low arousal learning results in better immediate recall with poor retention. The hypothesis that high arousal during learning results in increased long term retention, but poor immediate recall, was found tenable. Similarly, it was confirmed that low arousal facilitates improved short term retention with a typical forgetting curve. The implication of this study for the educator centers on a re-examination of the arousal state of the learner during the learning process. (Author)",

A control group of 321 students received no mailed materials. Both groups subsequently participated in a standard orientation program, in which the same topics were discussed. Results indicate that students who received the mailed materials more frequently reported that they might change their major than did the controls; however, no actual differences between groups were noted in the number of major changes, the time major changes occurred, or fall term GPA. It is concluded that materials mailed to students to heighten the effects of orientation programs may be of questionable  value if the same content is adequately covered at the orientation program itself.

The attempt to operationalize the goal resulted in a set of capabilities prerequisite to the ultimate goal attainment.

Such a task is viewed as overwhelming, necessary, but not susceptible to immediate solution. The remainder of the paper elaborates some possible interim assessment procedures.

Extrapolating from conceptual systems theory, it was expected that the &quot;person-oriented&quot; (conceptually abstract) individuals would deal with different referents, time focuses and affect levels in their verbalizations than would the &quot;non-person-oriented&quot; individuals (conceptually concrete). Within the framework of a verbal classification system developed for the study, the verbal usage patterns of the two groups were examined. These verbal usage patterns generally supported the theoretically derived expectations, showing an overall usage superiority by the &quot;person-oriented&quot; sub-group in the areas of: (1) &quot;here-and-now&quot;  statements; (2) affective statements; and (3) affective self-disclosure statements. A quarter-by-quarter examination of these usage patterns revealed a tendency for the &quot;person-oriented&quot; sub-group's superiority in these areas to become more marked during the last half of the total group's life. Implications of these findings for laboratory group composition and design are discussed. (Author)",

The two basic areas where these changes will have to occur are: (1) in consideration and treatment of the student as a dues paying consumer, along with all the other members of society; and (2) in far bolder plans for consumer participation, comprehensiveness, and planning mechanisms than are now the case in most college communities. In addition, the concept of consumer participation is explored to reveal that there are gaps between practice and promise not only on college campuses but in the whole health care system. In addition,  the nature of health planning and evaluation is explored to reveal that the most effective planning process is not always harmonious, that negotiation is the language, and that planning and evaluation necessarily presume medical, social, and political dimensions.

Small group discussion was utilized, and the seminars dealt with human dynamics, communication breakdowns, crime and delinquency, leadership and fellowship, and urban problems. Results from a questionnaire administered during the last session of each seminar showed a great deal of acceptance by the officers for the small group interaction approach, as well as for the topics presented and discussed. A particularly significant result was the feeling by most participants that someone was concerned with their needs and feelings and would be in a  position, perhaps, to communicate their frustrations and suggestions to the top command. One tentative conclusion drawn was that the officers gained a better understanding of urban problems and the ticklish position in which they are placed as enforcers of the law in twentieth century, urban society.

        "description":"Recent theories of verbal memory have hypothesized that memory for a stimulus is not represented by a unitary memory trace, but rather by a coding on several attributes of the event. The present experiment tested the differential forgetting hypothesis in a unique way. Words were presented either visually (V) or auditorally (A) in a continuous recognition memory task. Each word occurred twice, with equal numbers of item pairs in each of the four possible modality combinations (A-A, V-V, A-V, and V-A). The first and second occurrence of a word were separated by 12, 24, 48, and 96 intervening items. Two lists, common and rare nouns, were used. Averaging data from the two lists, a greater number of misses occurred on mixed-modality than same-modality pairs at the first three  intervals. At the 96-item interval mixed-modality was superior to same-modality presentation for the rare list only. The results are discussed in terms of Underwood's multi-attribute theory of memory.

As in previous research with subject-produced labels: (1) addition of the label facilitated performance only for the recency portion of the list; (2) this effect did not vary systematically with age; (3) memory for the first serial position improved markedly between the ages of 5 1/2 and 6 1/2; (4) labels alone were superior to pictures at the  end of the list, but pictures were superior to labels at the beginning; and (5) combined picture and label presentation appeared to follow the curve for pictures at the beginning of the list and that for labels at the end.

The formulation draws on concepts used in game theory, labor negotiations, and theories of conflict resolution; and a number of vaiables are examined in an effort to make sense out of collective negotiations. A changing utility model is developed that can be used to plot changes in disposition and record payoffs that accrue as a result of bargaining over numerically based pure bargaining issues.

The findings of the study may be used to expand bargaining theory for education and provide insights into the collective negotiations process. (Author)",

One of the weaknesses of the Lawrence and Lorsch approach is that it fails to provide urban educators with data concerning which external organizations threaten their survival as an organization, which groups have the resources to help or hurt them, and what major forces in the environment could change the present direction of the city school system. Furthermore, the Lawrence and Lorsch approach speaks indirectly to major policy questions  such as decentralization.

Teachers and other school personnel were allowed one day following each session to prepare for the next cycle of students. The calendar also observed the same holidays and vacations, September-May, that were observed by all other schools in the district.

One type emphasizes humanities instruction, while the other three conceive of man as (1) a social creature, (2) a unique individual, and (3) an introspective analyst. (Author/RA)",

During five months of daily interaction with the students, the researcher participated in three groups that reflected these similar characteristics: (1) all were active social units with the members spending most of the day in one another's company; (2) distinct group activities took place when opportunities arose to interact; (3) group activities had little to do with the academic sector of the school; (4) group membership did not interfere with a particular member's academic achievement; (5) little  cross-communication occurred between groups; and (6) all groups showed concern for and complied at least minimally with school regulations. These findings are explained as a pattern of behavior in response to the school environment. (Author/MLF)",

The plan provides a universal 30-day summer vacation in addition to the elected split-trimester vacation term. The choice of the plan over others is justified by staff readiness, curricular flexibility, and instructional individualization.

The future implementation of program budgeting may offer an attractive vehicle for accountability. Currently, many California school districts use the California Educational Information System (CEIS) as a primary vehicle for information storage, processing, and retrieval. Although adequate for present needs, CEIS is ill-suited to effective support of accountability and program budgeting. The legislature should create an advisory commission on information systems to define the structure and services of a CEIS II, a statewide information system designed to support accountability and program budgeting. A CEIS II would require system  definition to determine information needs, transitional mechanisms, legislative and economic frameworks, security and privacy issues, and a functional system design to translate needs into specifications for subsequent programing and testing.

Post test scores were felt to show considerable increases in nearly all cases. It was noted that the reading classes had improved the students' ability to recognize Protective Vocabulary words which were taught in the regular classroom. Improvement in the childrens' self confidence was also noted. It was felt that assessment of children should be primarily in terms of  learning attitudes rather than IQ, that children in schools for the retarded should be exposed to reading readiness programs, that the reading program should aim to introduce fundamental skills involving phonics, and that the teaching approach should be of a concrete nature and carefully programed so that the child can move with confidence from step to step.

The basic data consisted of cross citings related to the special education literature. A total of 118 journals were chosen for inclusion in the analysis. It was found that there was a much stronger tie from special education to psychology than from special education to general education. General and special education were both felt to be dependent upon psychology and relatively independent of one another. It was concluded that in fields where there was a relatively high degree of organization of knowledge, the journals tended to  be concentrated in their referencing, with a large fraction of references in a given journal to a relatively small number of journals. In fields which drew upon many different areas of knowledge, and which themselves had small bases of accepted knowledge, it was felt that the referencing structure tended to be quite dispersed.

In order to identify the responsibilities and problems of leadership personnel, site visits, consultations, and personal interviews were conducted. The problems identified concerned medical staff, personnel management, department heads, business management, physical plant, patients, community relations, policies and regulations, and nursing staff. A simulated institution was designed from reality based incidents gathered from interviews in state schools and hospitals for the mentally handicapped. The development of preservice  and inservice training exercises to implement the simulator was still in the planning stage at the time the report was written. An assessment of the reliability of the simulator through pilot investigations was also planned. A review of literature and a feasibility study conducted at the beginning of the project led the researchers to believe such a simulated program can provide a vehicle for experimentation and research to produce meaningful changes in the management of real institutions for the mentally handicapped.

Fifty seven learning problem students were selected from four types of learning disabilities classes: opportunity (educable, slow learner), perceptual, behavioral (including multiply handicapped), and special reading. Questionnaires distributed to the class teacher and interviews with the children were used to collect data. According to the teachers' evaluations, all groups but the opportunity class group achieved according to expectation. Overall personal and social adjustment, as perceived by the teachers, was considered similar for  all groups. The special students were shown to give favorable responses to questions related to their feelings about the regular class. It was revealed by comparison that the opportunity class students were the most positive of the groups.

The effects of learning potential status (gainers, nongainers, high scorers) and motivational style (success strivers, failure avoiders) on discrimination learning when reinforcement was varied was examined. In the first experiment 24 educable mentally handicapped black adolescents from a low income housing area were tested using trials-to-criterion as the dependent variable in a two choice simultaneous discrimination problem. Only the learning potential, motivation interaction combination was felt to approach significance. Experiment II was modified only in certain test procedures. Twenty four white boys from lower class families  were tested with modifications in motivational assessment, incentive, and cue set procedures. Contrary to prediction, it was concluded that the negative motivational feedback did not yield greater efficiency for the success-strivers. Results were felt to confirm the prediction that gainers and high scorers would be superior to nongainers on the discrimination task. The validity of the construct of failure-avoidance versus success-striving as it has been applied to the mentally handicapped group was questioned by the researchers. (CD)",

Results were felt to show that both integrated and segregated educable mentally handicapped were rejected significantly more often than normal children, that younger children are more accepting of others than older children, that boys express more overt rejection than girls, and that integrated educables are rejected more than segregated ones by boys but not by girls. The conclusion was advanced that regardless of intellectual level, the  labelling of certain children as retarded may affect the expectations that normal children maintain for them; and that the same behaviors that lead to rejection when exhibited by normals may not result in social rejection when exhibited by children classified as mentally handicapped.

No consistent patterns of a relationship between physiological measures and the relatively more static paper and pencil tests was found.

Members of the district power structure (as related to special education) were identified by questionnaires administered to the district superintendent, principals, and persons named by them as influential in the decision of whether to innovate. Subject and district demographic variables were compared and analyzed. Subjects and districts were found to be very similar, and indications were that there were no significant differences in perceptions of the new state plan for special education. These perceptions were  apparently not the crucial variables in the decision to adopt or not adopt the plan. Most significant differences were related to the increased number of supportive personnel and services to be derived from adoption, suggesting that funding is such a strong incentive that decision-makers fail to see the necessity of extensive testing of the innovation.

The theory postulates that the disorder reflects a lag in maturation of the central nervous system, particularly the left cerebral hemisphere. The hypotheses in question predicted that skills developing ontogenetically earlier (visual-motor and auditory-visual integration) will be more delayed in younger dyslexic children (ages 7-8 years), and that skills developing later (language and formal operations) will be more delayed in older dyslexic children (ages 11-12 years). Subjects were 20 disabled male readers and 20 control males, all of average or above average intelligence. Each group was subdivided by age: younger (ages 7-8) and older (ages 11-12). Three tests classified as  nonlanguage or perceptual and three classified as language tests were administered. The nonlanguage tests were postulated to represent skills developing ontogenetically earlier. The nonlanguage tests partially discriminated between younger dyslexics and controls, while none of the nonlanguage tasks discriminated between the older groups. By contrast, the language tasks revealed significant differences between older dyslexics and controls, while only one language measure discriminated between the younger groups, thus substantially supporting the hypotheses under evaluation.

Of the 789 students enrolled in 11 kinds of special classes, 102 randomly selected students from Behavioral, Opportunity, and Perceptual classes and the 46 students enrolled in Multiply Handicapped and Special Primary Opportunity Classes constituted the sample. School marks were obtained, teachers filled out a personal and social adjustment inventory and questionnaire for each student (the latter indicated the extent to which special class students were included in regular school activities),  and parents filled out the personal and social adjustment inventory and answered questions concerning their feelings toward and evaluation of special classes. Academic achievement (teachers' evaluation) by subject for students in each class was compared to normal grade level achievement, and it was concluded that the great majority of children were making better progress than would be achieved in regular classes. This was true for social aspects of learning as well as academic learning. Most parents were strong supporters of special classes. (KW)",

Following a general report of the 1969-70 activities, evidence from evaluation research in three areas is presented. Studied were the effects of group therapy on the parents of infants, the effects of the program on the emotional adjustment of the parents and their attitudes toward raising children, and effects of the program on the physical, social-emotional, and intellectual development of the 23 children, ages 9-44 months, who participated in the intervention program two mornings per week. Evidence suggested that in general the parents became less apprehensive and more self-assured in their reactions.  Adjustment to the crippled child appeared to be more difficult for the mother than the father, and mothers had more need of counseling services. The program was more successful in affecting the adjustment and attitudes of mothers than fathers. Positive shifts were recorded in mothers' attitudes toward the child's disability and toward themselves. Pre- and posttesting with the Children's Developmental schedule, an experimental rating scale, showed significant growth in the areas of physical, social and emotional, and intellectual growth in one of the two groups of children.

Findings reveal that six different terms are used to classify  emotionally disturbed children. Prevalence estimates varied from .05% to 15%; most states used an estimate of 2% for educational planning. Most often mentioned educational procedures were special classes, resource rooms, and homebound instruction, in that order. Model class size was 10 students, with the age range in the special class often limited to 3-5 years. Standards for case loads varied considerably.

In this system the computer plays the role of real-time diagnostician and prescriber for the student and serves as a master record-keeper for the entire student population. To test this model of CMI, systems concepts were used in developing a programed course to teach graduate education students the techniques of programed instruction. In a field trial of the course, four instructional presentations were used: students followed a fixed sequence of tasks and had a graduate student evaluate their progress, students selected their own  sequence of tasks and had a graduate student evaluate their progress, students followed a fixed sequence and evaluated their progress with the aid of a computer, and students selected their own sequence and evaluated their progress with the aid of a computer. No significant differences were found among the experimental treatment groups. Student performance on the cognitive portion of the course was excellent, and it was estimated that the cost of conducting the course via CMI was one-half to one-third the cost of conventional graduate instruction.

A cybernetic (self correcting) procedure is proposed for manipulating instructional displays so that after a period of time the instructional procedure used is optimal for a given individual. This is accomplished by changing the parameter values of those parameters that define a given psychological condition or by changing the values and/or the parameters which define the content-specific conditions of a particular display. The instructional paradigm for each kind of behavior may have many parameters associated with it. A sample of these parameters may be modified, and if the learner response is correct, those modified values are  returned to the system, and another set of parameters is selected for modification. If the learner response is incorrect, the same parameters are remodified in accordance with the rules. In this way, the model provides a method to maximize correct responses by the learner. It also monitors performance, and its dynamic property makes it always try to do better. (JY)",

The initial step in the procedural model is to identify the enabling objectives which allow performance of the terminal objective. After these objectives are identified and hierarchically charted, the sequence is validated by a task analysis. An evaluation by individuals for whom the program is designed should eliminate ambiguous directions. The next step in the model is an empirical validation of the entire program to determine if the student reaches the terminal objective  successfully and if the sequencing is effective and efficient.

Since neither of the instructional modes led to posttest performance indicating lesson mastery, the data was further examined in an attempt to identify program weakness. Possible sequence-related difficulties were considered in the light of evidence pertaining to positive transfer. A hierarchy of &quot;conceptual levels&quot; was predicted for the lesson and used as a basis for an analysis of transfer effects. Although inconclusive, the evidence seemed to  indicate positive transfer in the predicted manner and suggested resequencing the lesson as an initial step toward making learning optimal.

The game was designed to allow the player an opportunity to relate his knowledge of science to elementary classroom situations. A role-playing design was used to give the students practice in expressing scientific concepts using their own words. The results of analysis of variance comparisons indicated that the experimental gaming group had significantly superior posttest results in achievement in science, attitude toward science, confidence in science, and in the learning of the specific  concepts that were taught in the game. It was found that individual personality and background characteristics could differentially predict the posttest measures and that low achievers in science benefited most from the gaming strategy. Their achievement posttest scores nearly matched those of the high achievement group. Thus, the learning game reduced differences in achievement that were detected on the pretest while raising the achievement mean for the entire group. (JY)",

        "description":"A review of the literature on automated psychological testing shows that most research and development in this area is based on a one-test, one-psychologist model. In this model, the functions of test administration, scoring, and interpretation are thought out in terms of specific tests presented on an individualized basis. However, more complete and sophisticated psychological assessment can take place with a multi-test, multi-team model. This model makes extensive use of time-sharing, interactive, terminal-oriented computer systems. Methodological investigations and research and development work on automated testing in the last decade are reviewed in terms of the three dimensions of testing: administration, scoring, and interpretation. A computerized information management  system for the storage and retrieval of student evaluation files appears to be necessary. Such a system would allow varying and appropriate reports to be generated for psychologists, teachers, counselors, etc. The capability of computers to analyze and accept natural language input must be further developed before testing can become fully automated.

This new approach is compared and contrasted with Gagne's hierarchical task analysis model. Two conceptual levels of a behavioral objective are identified. One level, referred to as the &quot;task level,&quot; is concerned with the determination of the subskills that are required to learn and perform the terminal objective of a task. The second level, the &quot;rule level,&quot; is concerned with the discovery of order relationships between subskills. Neither hierarchical nor information processing analysis would be sufficient for all types of tasks. A hierarchical analysis would be appropriate where lower ordered skills generate  positive transfer to higher level skills, while an information processing analysis would be utilized where the output of one task subskill or operation is required as input for a succeeding operation (behavior chaining).

The program was developed to improve the basic mathematics skills of high school students from a ghetto area who are unable to begin secondary-level math courses because of deficiencies in computational skills. The multilevel team consisted of a teacher, a teaching assistant (a college junior or senior), and a student assistant. The only teaching done by the teachers or teaching assistants was done individually in response to a student question. On a standardized math test, the experimental group was  found to improve an average of 2.16 points more (about two-fifths of a semester in grade level) than control group students with the same starting scores, a statistically significant improvement. The major accomplishment of the course was to halt the further retardation of the students; however, a system still needs to be developed which will reduce the gap between the students' grade level and their mathematics achievement level.

In the oral group, oral evaluation by the supervisor was not available to the subjects (student teachers). In the video group, video recording or playback was not available. In the peer group, ninth-grade students, rather than fellow student teachers, were used as the \"micro-class.\" Three regular microteaching groups served as controls for each treatment condition. Two evaluation forms, the Verbal Interaction Categories System and the Video Teaching Evaluation Form, were used to evaluate the performance of each student teacher in subsequent microteaching sessions. Results showed that only one variable, use of ninth-grade subjects rather than  peers, significantly affected performance in subsequent sessions. In this condition, subjects were fairly uncomfortable with the task of teaching younger students and did not allow for student interaction during the microteaching sessions. Lack of oral or video feedback did not affect subsequent microteaching attempts. (JK)",

On the basis of these experiments it was concluded: that trainee feedback can be of value in increasing training effectiveness, that &quot;imagery&quot; can play an important role in promoting procedural skills, and that training effectiveness can be achieved through the use of low-cost paper and pencil simulation of the operational task.

This belief is based on two assumptions: that the mass media are large-scale operations which enjoy massive circulations or audiences and that they are primarily controlled by forward-looking, progressive governments and by people who share the governments' commitment to economic and political development. In the case of India, at least, these assumptions are false. Although broadcasting is controlled by the government, the popular press is composed of more than 10,000 newspapers and periodicals, and the major proportion of these publications consists of small publications with small circulations, stemming from small towns, written in one  of the local vernacular dialects, and concerned with local more than national issues and themes. The vernacular press has also shown a general tendency to make steady gains over the English language press which is metropolitan based and may be said to be most concerned with national issues and events. As a result of these provincial loyalties and interests, it will be harder to use the mass media as instruments of progressivism and modernization than many western communications scholars suggest.

The educational problems of each of these three groups were assessed and differentiated from the problems of educationally disadvantaged children in general. After a survey of the use of ITV systems to meet similar needs in other countries, the ITV systems used in Australia, Israel, Japan, and New Zealand were chosen for in-depth study. The ways in which these systems deal with such problems as introducing the core television approach, overcoming resistance to ITV, the effect of the student-to-system relationship  on the learning process, reducing the consequences of sporadic school attendance, upgrading the skills of teachers, and teaching basic skills in language and mathematics were studied in detail. When the experiences of these ITV systems were used to evaluate ITV in terms of the particular needs of each of the three target groups, it was found that the use of ITV to present a core curriculum would be an effective means of accomplishing significant reforms only in the education of American Indian children. A special analysis was also made of the potential role of ITV in junior and community colleges. (JY)",

The amount and kind of programming addressed to age-differentiated audiences was the primary focus of the survey. Some of the significant trends noted were an increase in the number of ETV stations on the air, an increase in the number of days per week these stations broadcast, and an increase in \"public\" programming (in contrast to instructional programming). Some of this shift to public programming was caused by the great impact of the \"Sesame Street\" series,  which was so-classified. The rest of the shift was probably caused by the increased use of programs produced by such national organizations as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Educational Television (NET) network. The material gathered in the survey is presented in both expository and tabular form. Information is included about production patterns, program sources, audience levels, program subjects, and station ownership. A statistical profile of each ETV station is given. (JY)",

However, analysis of listener mail and some survey research have provided a fairly clear profile of the audience: young (ages 15-34), well educated, urban, male (but with a fair proportion of female students), fairly affluent, often in &quot;decision-making&quot; or high-prestige positions or occupations. Significant deviations from this profile may appear when a given international station has been clearly audible over the predominant domestic broadcast band (whether short wave or medium wave). Far less is known about how often, to what, and why people listen to international services, and even less about how much  they comprehend or accept of what they hear. The research methods used to gather data on these audiences have included solicitation of mail by means of contests and &quot;give-aways,&quot; requests for comments on programs, and questionnaires. Listener panels are also used. More research is needed to get clear pictures of these audiences and the effects of the broadcasts on them. (JK)",

TUTOR is designed to transcend the difficulties of FORTRAN for a computer-based educational system utilizing graphical screen displays. The language consists of about seventy words or &quot;commands&quot; which can be used in various combinations to produce the desired effect. It was designed specifically for use by lesson authors lacking prior knowledge of and experience with computers. Although authors are able to write parts of useful lessons after approximately one hour of introduction to TUTOR, the ultimate complexity and flexibility of TUTOR lessons is limited largely by the ingenuity and experience of lesson authors. A sample TUTOR  program which allows the student to construct geometric shapes on his television screen demonstrates how a TUTOR lesson appears to the student. A complete description of the structure and elements of the language is presented, as well as a description of methods for inputting lessons and obtaining output. The manual is intended to be used as a textbook by the beginning lesson author and as a reference tool by the experienced TUTOR user. (JY)",

The project attacked two widespread practices: non-employment or under-employment of blacks, and failures of stations to give blacks access to the air to provide programs which satisfy their needs and tastes. Community action, through monitoring of stations by citizen groups and threats of legal action in license renewal requests before the FCC, influenced the programming and employment practices of stations to an extent that amounted to significant social change. Cases in Texarkana, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana;  Atlanta, Georgia; and Charlotte, North Carolina, are discussed. The Office of Communication expects much greater citizen participation in broadcasting in the immediate future. Of particular concern are the charges that educational stations (again, especially in the south) also fail to give attention to minority programming and employment needs. (JK)",

A total of 38 activities were devised to meet the 16 objectives of the course, which were subsumed under six categories: perception, knowledge, creativity, skills, production techniques, and attitudes. The major portion of this report consists of tables which relate the results of various evaluations of the course including the value students placed on each of the course goals and the extent to which students felt the course met these goals. Student responses are also broken down by variables of sex, race, religion, academic success, and rank in family. The course evaluation was based on only selected aspects of the program for which  data could be gathered readily in a short time period. Among the major findings were that students in the program were better able to define terms from the field of communication and media and could use those terms with greater sophistication. Also there was a substantial correlation between the activities students liked most and those from which they thought they learned the most. Students had positive attitudes towards the course. It was concluded that the course was generally successful and could be implemented in other schools. (JK)",

Drawing on a variety of sources, he lists criteria for examining a language in relation to a given user or goal. He discusses some general effects a language may have on instructional strategies and notes that a computer's record-keeping ability is a great asset in assessing instructional strategies. He feels serious  consideration must be given to a means for translating instructional materials and strategies from one institution and system to another. He delineates the limitations placed on a language by its hardware, software, and communication system and warns that time-sharing systems may need larger development resources than instructional researchers can afford.

The microform use patterns and classroom performance of these students was determined and compared with the information acquisition patterns and performance of a control group. Motivation for microform use was derived solely from the convenience aspect of a home microform reader and from the students' perceived value of complete information availability through microforms; hardcopy materials were always available on the same basis as utilized by the control class. The overall student response to the microform system was positive;  microforms were used continuously by students over the entire period of the experiment. A conclusive majority said that the home reader and the microfiche materials fulfilled their home study needs. Tests of student performance showed that microform presentation did not interfere with the acquisition of basic factual information. Students criticized the upright screen position which made note-taking difficult, the lack of a consistently clear focus, and inadequate indexing within the microform materials. (Author/JY)",

The motivation for sustained use of microforms in preference to hardcopy was the perceived value of the complete information. Microform use patterns were compared with hardcopy use patterns over the 10-week period of the course. The major result was the determination that microforms can be used to support a course which requires that information must be abstracted and retained by the student in order to pass the course, although  the additional demands made on some students by the machine presentation were observed to offset the value of the complete information unit, and use of the microform readers by these students terminated. The vertical formatting used to arrange material on the fiche proved to be quite successful. Physical fatigue and eye fatigue were the most common student complaints about the microform readers. It was also determined that a user should have as much control as possible over the environment in which the microform reader is used. (JY)",

These factors were tested both in isolated words and on contextual material intended to approximate the conditions of free speech. Comprehension was evaluated by means of an objective, multiple-choice listening test. The results of the investigation indicate a strong relationship between discriminatory musical abilities in pitch, intensity, rhythm, timbre, and tonal memory and in achievement of a Spanish accent.

This paper: (1) sketches several approaches to admittance - including the guild approach of Oxford and Cambridge, admittance based on manpower requirements - as in the U.S.S.R., the selective access approach, universal access, and universal attendance; (2) discusses why the universal access approach is currently chosen in the United States; (3) reviews some of the implications of universal access, such as vast numbers of new students, rising costs, and the need for coordination by public agencies; and (4) examines the positive and undesirable consequences of universal access. Some advantages are: expansion of educational opportunity and a  contribution to the quality of the economy and to peoples' lives. Some negative aspects are: (1) a continuing battle over money; (2) loss of autonomy for the individual campus; (3) the probable movement toward meritocracy; (4) an increasing danger of collision between higher education and the surrounding community; (5) increasing pressure for universal attendance; (6) a surplus of highly educated people; (7) an increase in the number of people who are in \"the period of youth,\" a time when they are no longer part of their original family, and yet without a family of their own; and (8) the tendencies of campuses to grow disproportionately larger.

Seven hundred and sixty-two graduate students at a Midwestern University were administered a questionnaire; 589 usable responses were returned. On the basis of a pilot study and item analyses, Likert scales were constructed for the measurement of the major variables of this inquiry. Each item was scored on a 5-point scale, the high score indicating a high level of  satisfaction. The findings indicated that the collegiality of faculty-student relationships is a highly effective predictor of both academic and nonacademic satisfaction for all categories of students, whether grouped by sex, department size, school within the university, or degree objective. Competitiveness of student-student relationships is a consistently negative predictor of both types of satisfaction. Expectation-reality discrepancy is also negatively associated with both types of satisfaction. (AF)",

The practical justification stems from the realization by industry that it must provide specialized manpower training to meet its own need for effective employees. Industry entrance into the training field dates from the latter part of the past century when no secondary schools offered industrial training. By the late sixties higher education activities of business and industry reportedly totaled almost $20 billion annually, with about 85 percent of the major industries involved. Industrial participation in education and training programs outside industry is a more recent phenomenon. This  development grew out of the application of technology to educational problems, and was made possible to a great extent by federal and state programs dating from the mid-sixties. An even newer type of activity is that referred to as performance contracting, another approach to solving some of the problems in education. (Author/AF)",

The views of nearly 1,400 British scientists were assessed and results presented that show the level of usefulness of various subjects and techniques to these scientists, and the extent to which they received instruction in these topics during their undergraduate training. Opinions concerning the desirable attitudes of an industrial scientist and the particular attributes that scientists occupying various specific positions should possess are also recorded.  The results of the enquiry show that the practicing industrial scientist believes that much can be done to improve course design, not only to enhance the technical competence of the student, but also to make a career in industry a more attractive and worthwhile proposition.

The first of these approaches is a secondary reinforcement interpretation and in general assumes a positive linear relationship between social reinforcement and social attraction. The second approach is a \"cognitive consistency\" interpretation and generally is not so explicit about functional relationships between consistency factors and interpersonal attraction. The hypotheses tested in this study were: (1) that the function relating reinforcement frequency to interpersonal attraction will be nonlinear for each of the two levels of  expectancy; and (2) that the point of maximum attraction for the group with the higher reinforcement expectancy value will be reliably greater than for the group expecting the lower level of reinforcement. The subjects for this study were 210 male volunteers from campus ROTC units, who principally met in groups of four and were assigned to treatment groups at random. The activities were divided in three phases: (1) preexperimental interaction, (2) the experimental activity, and (3) postexperimental debriefing. The findings supported the first, but not the second hypothesis. (AF)",

This has meant that the greatest rate of increase in college attendance during the last 10 years has been by members of the lower socioeconomic groups and those with lower academic standing. The 60's emphasized gaining access to higher education for these students; the 1970's must concentrate on accommodation, i.e., changing the system to fit the student. The access system, which is a unidimensional model, attempts to move the marginal student closer to the core through remediation of academic or motivational deficiencies; the system is  designed for orderly progression through a funnel or sorting system, effectively eliminating those who don't fit the system. Though systematic educational activities are now going on outside the regular system, i.e., on the educational periphery, equality of educational opportunity would be enhanced by the creation of new educational models that will permit easy movement between the core and periphery. This paper discusses new models for education: developing new cores of excellence, and developing lifelong learning models. It also makes recommendations for policies and programs to institute new educational models. (AF)",

The directions higher education will take include: (1) extending educational opportunity, regardless of race or income; (2) clearer rules governing the conduct of all members of the academic community; (3) cost effectiveness of operations; (4) more visible presidential leadership; (5) an increasing role of the federal government; (6) lower status jobs for college graduates; and (7) continuing tensions between intellectuals and society.

There are some measures the university can take to alleviate the educational plight of the urban poor, the major one of which is to do what they have traditionally done best: teach. The universities can accept larger numbers of minority group members in their freshmen classes, and give them the necessary supportive, remedial, and counseling services. They should encourage these students to enter the service fields: medicine, law, education, so that these students in turn can help the people in their communities. Universities could create special day-care facilities through high school experimental education units set up to serve a  clientele of poor children; and universities could provide a second chance for those whose education was terminated at the high school level and who are competent and desirous of obtaining a degree. Since the most likely response of the universities will probably be in the direction of urban research, it will behoove them to be aware of two factors: (1) in terms of research that directly involves human beings, such as Moynihan's and Coleman's, they must be aware that the urban poor are tired of being objects of research; (2) in research concerning problems of the ghetto, such as housing, transportation, or pollution, it would be advisable to involve the residents themselves at the outset in any planning effort.

Proposals for modification of governance include: (1) the establishment of a new mechanism within the institution to make possible community-wide participation in governance; (2) making explicit the redistribution of authority that has been taking place; (3) the strengthening of leadership to maintain the college or  university as a viable institution; (4) the establishment of means to enforce accountability with every extension of authority; and (5) the modification of the traditional structure of high school, junior college, 4-year college, professional and graduate schools.

This last responsibility tends to get short shrift in most institutions of higher learning, because an institution's excellence is generally not measured by its responsiveness to social needs. Yet, the time has come when higher education must face its responsibility for the alleviation of social ills or expect broad consequences. Community services can be provided through existing programs by using some imagination. Examples are: (1) extending the college chaplain's services to youth in the community; (2) incorporating after school, youth leadership and community projects in practice teaching assignments; (3) starting an art workshop for the neighborhood; (4) conducting workshops on  social issues on a continuing basis as a problemsolving effort; (5) making community service a prerequisite for graduation; (6) making community studies a part of every student's experience and working on implementing the solutions; and (7) providing a Free University, so that people in the community who still believe in education, but have no opportunity to go to a regular college, can take advantage of the expertise available. The experience of Springfield College in Massachusetts--where professors teach for free, and students who pass a course with a C or better get a certificate--points to the great worth of such an endeavor.

Higher education is in a crisis and in desperate need of continuing financial support from the federal government. The Carnegie Commission can help the public understand some of the problems by pointing out that higher education is not a commodity, and that the chief beneficiary is not only the preson who gets the degree, but society as well. The Commission has recently made proposals for a 3-year baccalaureate, for credit for outside experience, and for other types of extramural education. The case for 4-year residential colleges may be weak and, if so, they may have to disappear, for it is not the particular forms of higher  learning that have to be preserved. Higher learning is a process of human growth and change, and the students of the sixties and seventies became aware, perhaps for the first time, of the humanity of all men and the need to connect education with a wider view of humanity. The Commission can also help in letting the public know what is happening that is good and important on campus today, and help inspire a public confidence without which the funding of higher education becomes progressively impossible.

The definition of the purpose of liberal education is Woodring's: \"It is the education that liberates men from the bondage of ignorance, prejudice, and provincialism. It enables us to see the whole world and to see ourselves in perspective.\" Section II examines what is liberal education and reviews some of the other definitions assigned to it by different authors. Section III deals with the aims, purposes and objectives of liberal education. The paper concludes with the thought that while educators have long espoused that one of the cardinal principles of  education is to encourage and nurture the ability to think, in reality, most independent thinking and creativity is stifled, and that only a true liberal education and not a general education can help a student become a liberated person.

Another variable examined was the University Student Census (USC), which is a questionnaire involving student opinion and certain personal information. Data was also obtained on high school extracurricular activities. The GPA at the end of the freshman year was used as the measure of academic success. Pearson correlations were made  for each of the scales of the Inventories, point biserial correlation coefficients were computed for each of the extracurricular activities, and an eta coefficient was computed for the first 29 items of the USC; Pearson correlations for the last 17 items. The results indicated that significant relationships for the black students were the Social, Infrequency, and Masculinity scales of the HVPI as well as the Socialization, Communality and Achievement via Independence scales of the CPI. For the whites the Social, Artistic, Masculinity, and Status scales of the HVPI, and the Responsibility, Socialization, Self-Control, Tolerance and other scales were significant. (AF)",

In the light of the increasing societal emphasis on higher education, the valid prediction of academic success for all racial groups has become a necessity. This study is concerned with the differential validity for black and white students of academic predictors currently used at the University of Maryland. The University uses a Predictive Index Equation, which is a multiple regression equation involving high school grades, SAT-Verbal and SAT-Math scores. The Maryland grade-point average at the end of the freshman year is used as the criterion. In this study high school grades, SAT-V and SAT-M were examined separately as well as combined in multiple  regression equations. The samples were categorized by race and sex. The results indicated that the Predictive Index worked as well for black students as it did for whites. For the sample studied, SAT scores were correlated with grades about as highly for whites as for blacks, although high school grades were not a valid predictor for black males. In addition to describing the study, the report examines other studies concerned with this topic. (AF)",

Though minority group enrollment has increased 85 percent over the last 5 years, it has only reached 6 percent of the total enrollment. In past years, admission criteria were frequently dictated by factors having little to do with a student's potential success and it has now been demonstrated that traditional admission criteria predict little or nothing about what a given student will do in college or about his potential after graduation. The best way to  determine whether a student is capable of college work is to evaluate his performance in college. The major attack on open admissions is being conducted in the name of an alleged threat to academic standards, but academic excellence has all too often been an exercise of the privileged to assure that they remain privileged by keeping access to the top restricted. Academic standards should be measured by how well the graduate is prepared to find employment which fulfills his needs, and how well he is equipped to progress in society. In addition to open admissions, supportive and remedial services are also essential to provide equal opportunity. (AF)",

The two programs are the College Education Achievement Project (CEAP), which focuses primarily on improving educational practice for marginal college freshmen in developing Black institutions, and the Higher Education Achievement Program (HEAP), which focuses on improving educational practice in developing institutions for marginal students from minority or poverty groups. This paper briefly discusses the development and use of a heuristic model for the development of symbolic competence in marginal college  freshmen. The model (1) asks: what is the relationship between symbolic competence and social learning; (2) is based on the hypothesis that social learning fosters self-actualization which facilitates the development of symbolic competence; and (3) lists a series of consequences to be tested.

        "description":"A recent study of doctoral programs in ten prestigious universities by Ann Heiss found that graduate students tend to be committed to their academic fields, attracted to the world of ideas, independent-minded, and concerned about the relevance of their disciplines to social problems. The study also found that graduate schools tend to be a stress-filled environment where the emphasis was rarely on teaching or learning, where the educational process was often dehumanizing, and where the fixation on grades and credits corrupted the meaning of graduate study. Since real education is self-initiated and continual rather than a system of classification and production based on external compulsion, and since the primary responsibility for learning rests with the individual rather than the  institution, it is imperative that graduate education be changed and become student or client-based. This paper proposes six client-based patterns for graduate student participation in the academic decisionmaking that most affects them. These are: (1) self-determination of program; (2) student course initiation; (3) student involvement in planning course structure; (4) client evaluation of the educational system; (5) a graduate studies committee for the systematic investigation of the program; and (6) the replacement of the department by the academic commune as the learning unit of the school.

But the price charged to students and their families for higher education has been going up even more rapidly than the basic costs. The low-tuition principle and the notion of public support of the operational costs of higher education are being eroded at a time when it is more crucial than ever to develop the nation's available talent to the maximum. Several prominent economists have pointed out the fallacy of the myth that a high proportion of the cost of undergraduate education is paid for by society and have shown that students and their families now pay at least three-fourths of those costs, and often subsidize the graduate and professional programs. It is essential that at  least at the undergraduate level the institutions of higher education move rapidly toward a lowering of instructional charges, and that programs of special aid to the economically disadvantaged be continued and substantially expanded. If society wants its young people to be conscious of the responsibilities to society of those who enjoy advanced education, it must for its part be socially responsible to them by keeping down the price tag on higher education. Higher education is not a commodity. (AF)",

It is also important to recognize that whatever these objectives may be, the existing hierarchical arrangement of higher education institutions may not be the most effective means for achieving these objectives. The paper also raises questions about the relevance of current grading practices, and suggests replacing this system with some other form of assessment that will reveal changes in the students'  performance.

        "description":"The question of who should go to college cannot be answered without the issue of disestablishment. Too many people and students are frustrated and blocked because there is no other place to go but college, and the college or university itself is becoming a less inviting place as time goes on. True, some institutions have instituted a policy of open admissions, only to throw half of those admitted out at the end of the first year; and others have instituted Black Studies programs, which are a direct imitation of the nonsense of the traditional curriculum. In the past, university admission was limited to relatively few, and the institution could maintain its mystique as the citadel of humanistic learning and concern. Now that the institutions of higher learning are admitting about  half the high school graduates, it has become obvious that the university has always functioned as an agent of the state and of special political interest groups within it and that its elitism has less to do with the higher reaches of thought and culture than it does with the bourgeois aspiration of \"making it.\" If there were really open admissions, then every individual would have to be given access to public support for education and opportunity. It would also mean that the university could not be the only avenue of entry, and that society should support also the education of those who didn't get into college. In addition, the academy must turn back to its central function of making culture manageable and inventing forms of discourse, study, and analysis. (AF)",

The first section of the report makes recommendations intended as guidelines for drafting federal legislation related to the support of comprehensive statewide planning for postsecondary education. These include substantial and continuing matching fund commitments to each state engaged in a comprehensive planning effort, to be allocated to the state agency legally responsible for this effort, which in turn would administer the funds and have the right to allot part of these funds to other appropriate agencies engaged in  planning. Section II of the report is concerned with the responsibilities of the states in support of effective statewide planning and makes recommendations to be used by the states in carrying these out. These include: financial commitment, a planning agency, widespread participation in the planning effort, and realistic budgets for planning. Section III discusses the types of planning essential on a statewide level and calls attention to the difference between the strategic and tactical phases of planning. Section IV deals with the need for effective coordination and governance. (AF)",

The mean values of student and faculty responses were correlated, and analyses were made of departmental, as well as individual differences. There appeared to be two \"pure\" types of departments. Type I departments had a high rate of interaction between students and faculty, accurate perceptions between the two groups, high morale on the part of the students, and relatively high  disagreement between students and faculty on substantive and political matters. These departments also had higher student satisfaction with the relevance of their graduate training. Type II departments were the opposite in each case. Type I departments provided an environment that supported differences between faculty and students, while the hierarchical structure, lack of communication and low morale in the Type II departments led to conformity on the part of the students.

The basic principles include: (1) setting basic qualifications for attaining residency status that reflect the basic qualifications of legal age and length of domicile in the state required of voters in that state; (2) providing a procedure whereby students who do meet these qualifications can earn residency status even though they may be currently enrolled;  and (3) authorizing governing boards or other concerned agencies to enter into reciprocal agreements with similar agencies in other states for the exchange of students across state lines. The model legislation includes sections on: legislative intent; definitions; presumptions and rules for determination of status; regulations and appeal; waiver of tuition; quotas, standards, etc.; reciprocal agreements; and repeals.

The chapters are concerned with faculty oligarchies (who rules and how), faculty-administrative and faculty-trustee relationships, external constraints on faculty and institutional decisionmaking, decentralization of decisionmaking, and administrative leadership and style. The final chapter supports the principle of representative government, proposes means of strengthening the viability and accountability of academic senates, recommends that faculty members holding divergent views should be included in organs of faculty government, comes down on the side of shared responsibility and  authority rather than separate faculty and administrative jurisdictions, and concludes that faculty unionism and collective bargaining may prove to be inimical to governance by joint participation and rational debate. However, the normality of contention and even conflict is assumed, and methods are proposed for institutionalizing conflict. A general political model of decisionmaking is set forth. (Author)",

        "description":"This monograph presents the findings of a study of planning and change at 80 colleges and universities, private and public, located in four separate states--California, Florida, Illinois and New York. In Chapter I, different substantive crises now facing higher education are presented and discussed. The next chapter (II), analyzes planning styles as they relate to the crises in higher education. The majority of institutional planning speaks to problems of growth and efficiency of management, but little time is spent in planning on the more substantive problems in direction, structure, and programs. Chapter III concerns the mapping of conditions or correlates of different styles of planning. In essence, the chapter points up why some institutions, for example, small, homogeneous,  liberal arts colleges, are better able to deal with educational matters in their planning. Chapter IV presents six brief institutional vignettes of different styles of planning. The objective of Chapter V is to \"reach beyond planning,\" i.e., to determine what steps and conditions are needed for plans to become a reality. A fundamental problem in education is that far too often planning activities result in \"a plan\" but little implementation of plans. Finally, the last chapter draws together the various impressions and insights gained via the study in order to suggest how institutions can better prepare themselves for continuous self-renewal.

The conference, sponsored by the League for Innovation, proved to be a successful pilot project. The topics of the conference were: (1) emerging role of the division chairman as an educational leader; (2) his relations with faculty, administration, and students; (3) innovation for improved instruction; (4) group experience; (5) effect of administrative problems on teachers; and (6) development of insight and skill in divisional management.  Evaluation of the conference was made by: (1) tabulation and narration, which appear in the conference syllabus (not included in this report); and (2) a survey conducted after one academic year to see if the participants perceived changes in their own leadership ability as a result of attending the conference.

Those 44 states who responded report a variety of approaches to the coordination of community college affairs.

The purpose of this preliminary study is to analyze presently available data in terms of success, failure, and dropping of courses. Data were obtained from the grade records in all math courses taught at El Camino College (California) from the fall 1963 semester through the fall 1970 semester. Results indicate that: (1) success increases and dropouts decrease as students progress through mathematics courses; and (2) the dropout problem is one for the student, counselor, and teacher. It is the author's intention to attack this problem through the use of self-instructional material. He recommends that  all community college instructors examine the success, failure, and dropout rates in their classes and make an effort to increase successes and decrease dropouts. (CA)",

Part I of this monograph discusses the generation gap as it applies particularly to values and goals of American college students. Included are: definitions of belief systems; approaches used to assess them, notably the Rokeach Terminal and Instrumental Value Scales; and pertinent research and rationale for incorporating a study of values into an analysis of the community college. Part II describes the basic rationale and results of this investigation. The student and faculty populations surveyed come from three Los Angeles area junior colleges,  each respectively embodying the characteristics of an urban, suburban, and rural school. Most notably, it was found that: (1) the actual role of student or teacher seems to affect a value system more than the other variables of sex, designated major, and age; and (2) values do indicate one potentially fruitful way of examining people. It is hoped that by examining value differences, ways may be found to better understand people who function in our systems of education. (Author/CA)",

The existing system of bibliographic organization is examined in detail and services provided in the U.S.S.R. are described as an example of a systematic attempt at world coverage. In late 1967, efforts were so diverse that no one service (or group of related services) provided reliable coverage of current information. The existing literature on the attitudes of the user of library science information is reviewed, together with literature on more general aspects concerning the publications covering the field. The second section which deals with steps toward a model scheme is mainly concerned with the needs of the English language  bloc. The establishment of an International Study Group is suggested to study library science information problems with the three main tasks of: 1) a survey of information needs, producing a user profile; 2) a survey of information patterns, producing an information profile and 3) a comparison of the two profiles leading to the construction of a master scheme of information services to cover both primary and secondary services.

The author suggests broadening the coverage of &quot;Library Literature,&quot; publication of an annual review of the literature of American library history, and the preparation of a comprehensive bibliography of American library history, as remedies for this lack of coverage. The author concludes that the  absence of these essential tools has hindered collection building in the field and has led to considerable duplication of research.

Some 340,000 items (annually) would be matched against a set of authors' names, journal titles, and index terms or groups of terms, the latter weighted to eliminate false drops. Preliminary computer output would be manually screened, then matched against an open vocabulary to provide the output  in the form of a monthly printed bulletin arranged by subject, with an author index.

        "description":"Problems in indexing library and information science literature occur because of the speed of introduction of new terms, the nature of class headings, and the uncertain terminology of the field. Vocabulary control requires control over the concepts selected (the depth of indexing), the form of expression of concepts and the syndetic apparatus of the index. The context in which vocabulary terms appear, subject and aspect, subject and class entry, other types of entries (author, title, series, etc.), depth of indexing, citation and keyword indexing, centralized and decentralized indexing, subject lists and thesauri, subject heading and classification are discussed. Indexing research ignores the codified record of past indexing experience including that of library subject heading  work, which is the most carefully codified and tested, because of its use for a relatively shallow form of indexing. Ten general guidelines for planning indexing services for the literature are formulated, and aid to &quot;Library Literature&quot; for exploring new production methods and research, and expansion in staff, depth and scope, to produce a model index is proposed.

Reasons for the desirability of establishing a separate library school library are stated and some of the factors to consider in the initial and continuing development of the library school collection are suggested. It is assumed that: (1) the separate library school collection is readily accessible to the library school, (2) the library school is housed either in the main library or in a building near the main library and (3) a full-time professional librarian is in charge of the library school library. The major responsibilities of the library school librarian are searching the literature for suitable materials,  ordering these materials, working with the faculty, assisting students, and establishing procedures designed to make new materials available as soon as possible to students and faculty.

The awareness and acquisition of current monographic literature pertinent to library science are included but the problems of acquisition of periodical or retrospective monographic literature are not considered. The meaning of library science literature is restricted by avoiding discussion of materials peripheral to the philosophy and techniques of library science. Three major difficulties in noting the existence of new literature in library science are: (1) there is no central source of awareness; (2) very few reviews appear and (3) many items of importance do not qualify for listing in Cumulative Book Index (CBI), etc. because they contain less than 49 pages or  because publication is informal. Four major problems in collecting library literature are: (1) few of the items are available through trade channels, (2) there is often great difficulty in securing a response from the agency addressed, (3) there is difficulty in handling the payment of small sums of money and (4) many items noted and even reviewed are not given adequate citations.

Recommendations of this study are: &quot;Library Literature&quot; should be continued and developed as the inclusive bibliographical control for the library and information field. Its style should change; entries should be more akin to those in the &quot;Readers' Guide,&quot; very desirably in conjunction with research into the most effective style and type of entry for rapid scanning in long lists. Under any heading, entries should be arranged in  inverse chronological order. Attention should be paid to semantics so headings will be used reasonably precisely, and to aid in this development semantic studies should be undertaken. In making &quot;Library Literature&quot; truly comprehensive, consideration should also be given to coverage for the earlier volumes of titles recently incorporated or still to be included. A complementary service should be planned. Undoubtedly this should be a computer record developed and maintained along cooperative lines. (see also LI 002 796 through LI 002 805 and LI 002 807).

Part A of this paper is concerned with the basic detail needs for evaluation of purpose. Eight different kinds of classification systems for the subject, library science, are differentiated. The outline according to purpose shows diversity and, at the same time, it indicates the uniformity and perhaps the ubiquity of classification systems. Part B outlines the basic detail needs for evaluation of design of classification schemes. The evaluation of design must relate to the purpose of the classification dealt with, not to that of some other classification. Part C outlines the basic detail  needed for evaluation of functional operations. Samples of the eight types of classification schemes analyzed for purpose in Part A are shown to exemplify how many ways one subject, namely, classification, can be classified.

Presently existing computer software includes information retrieval programs with important traits: (1) they will combine so as to permit offsetting of otherwise major weaknesses in the several separate programs; (2) they will require minimal modification for adapting to a variety of machines due to their being written in higher level languages; (3) they are precision instruments produced at a combined cost of some half million dollars of research funds; (4) they do not require  use fees, having been produced through federally financed research and development projects; and (5) they are amenable to operation with a unique means of preparing document abstracts to permit computerized indexing as well as filing and retrieval. At present there are both classification schemes and computer information retrieval programs of limited utility to a communications bibliography.

Christian young people are demanding up-to-date answers to up-to-date problems. The church is being squeezed by cultural pressures and bombarded by the knowledge explosion. This book is designed to help the church that has no library but wishes to get one started, as well as to encourage the struggling church library. One of the primary goals of a church library should be that of strengthening the Christian education program of the church and a church library should be more than a depository of books from which church members occasionally check out certain titles. The church library must be an educational resource center to which teachers and other church leaders look  for assistance. Visual aids, audio-visual equipment, and reference sources are an important part of the church library. Just as the quality of a college is measured by its library, so the quality of the educational program of the church may be gauged by its library. (Author)",

These proposals are based on the Canadian experience of their three authors who have given much of the past two years to the problems and performance of a Canadian urban information service. The report shows that Canadians of both languages can be far better served than ever before with urban information, whichever the language in which the experience was first recorded. The authors  indicate why fuller exchange of urban information is essential to the future of urban Canada, and how the modes of that exchange can be made self-adjusting to the changing needs of Canadian users.

        "description":"In terms of examples drawn from clinical and research data files, one of the objectives of this study is to illustrate several factors that have combined to delay the implementation of medical data bases. A primary factor has been inherent in the design of computer software. The languages currently on the market are procedural in nature: they demand the complete definition of a problem before a program can be run on the machine. This is a serious difficulty because medical information -- as opposed to mathematical quantities -- cannot be cast in a definite format, and questions of interest to a potential investigator cannot always be enumerated before the data is acquired. The constraints placed on data retrieval in the environment of a Blood Bank, for example, are such that  on-line interaction with short response time is the basic design objective. In order to clarify the problems of interactive data handling in time-sharing under such constraints, a series of five experiments using the Direct Access Project (DIRAC) language prototype is explained.

        "description":"The technical feasibility of a continental information network for astronomy has been demonstrated in the course of a two-month experiment conducted jointly by Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University and the Stanford University Computation Center. The experiment simulated a scientific information network based on a high-level retrieval language of the non-procedural type named DIRAC. A data-base of astronomical catalogues was maintained in Palo Alto, California, and was queried remotely by a team of astronomers in Illinois. The relevant parameters of approximately one hundred time-sharing sessions were thus recorded. Analysis of the experiments in terms of operating system efficiency, user interface and cost effectiveness supports the idea that the network concept is  basic to meaningful scientific documentation systems; it also indicates that generalized software is the key to cost-effective information retrieval in the environment considered and, by extension, in a variety of scientific areas that rely on a combination of bibliographic and catalogued information with a high degree of internal structure. The article reviews the problems of astronomical data structures in their relevance to language design and to the general problem of scientific information handling, and it discusses the various factors: administrative, computational and psychological, that will affect the implementation of future networks.

Recent Government economy measures demand consideration of increased marketability of these products and services and the institution of service charges as a possible source of funding. The development of national guidelines for service charges, which recognize both the basic objectives of IACs and the operating variables which are unique to the individual IAC, is required. Consideration must also be given to existing service charge policies and the advantages and disadvantages of implementing new or alternative policies. Evaluation of the marketability of existing or new products and services requires  examination of customer and user markets, the scope and content of these products and services, possible channels for their distribution, advertising and sales promotion, and the prices to be charged. Two case studies, reflecting the experience of two centers which have implemented service charges and the comments of managers on proposed methods of information center cost recovery provide a base on which decisions for service charges can be made.

The data base for the SDI consists of the periodic document index records input to the AMIC system. The users are 63 engineers, scientists, and technical administrators at the Air Force Materials Laboratory (AFML) and 16 scientific and technical personnel at the University of Dayton. An informal interview technique elicited responses regarding the user assessment of the program and also indicated problem areas in the returns received by the users from the SDI profiles. Most respondents indicated that too many abstracts were being received and too low a relevance was occurring. Refinement of the profiles based  on more precise statements obtained from the interviews and on rejected abstracts increased the overall relevance from 37.6% to 51.8%. The primary factor in the improvement was the judicious but copious use of NOT terms to eliminate unwanted abstracts. Results showed the validity of the NOT strategy and indicated the effectiveness of direct contact between the information specialist and the SDI user in getting uninhibited feedback and obtaining meaningful expressions of user technical interests.

(3) Knowledge and skills concerned with the newer educational media and their integration with printed materials into a unified instructional materials program. (4) An awareness of the librarians role in assisting teachers in the selection and effective utilization of learning resources in the instructional program. and (5) An ability to solve the problems of organization and administration in an expanded program of library services that reflect the instructional materials or  learning resources concept. Emphasis was placed on the multi-media approach to learning on curriculum content in special subject areas, such as science and mathematics, humanities and social studies, and on the concept of the school library as a learning resources center. The methods used to fulfill these goals are described. The criteria for admission of the participants and short biographical sketches of the staff, and a detailed evaluation of the institute are included. (Author/NH)",

To evaluate the needs of future library education we must note the changes taking place in society as a whole. For example, it is clear that the libraries of the future must serve all groups of a society, in widely different environments. Librarians must sell their services to these communities and possibly should compete with each other for user-customers. Library education should reflect the changing role of the library and should utilize new teaching methods and resources. Curriculum planning should be flexible and should allow such departures from today's formats as at-home computer-assisted instruction, and international floating library school and mobile library education programs.  Tomorrow's education must increase an individual's ability to cope with his environment and the knowledge he has gained. The achievement of this goal in library education requires leadership and planning.

These components define the system's users and data sources; the hardware, software, and personnel performing the actual storage and retrieval activities; and the funder who acts as a filter in the selection of the components comprising the system. The outermost level, the ectosystem, includes the funder, and user groups, and the data sources. All other levels belong to the endosystem. Each level within the endosystem consists functionally of processing components and storage components. It is proposed that a measure of the endosystem performance, as a function of the time to complete a requested service can be obtained by  specifying the characteristics of these functional components for a specific hardware/software configuration and the characteristics of the user groups. Finally, the selection process for all system components is related to the performance of the endosystem, and to the cost for this level of performance as a function of the ectosystem. (Author/MM)",

Narrative descriptions of behavior of 8 low-income urban, 8 low-income rural and 8 middle-income urban children  provide the basic observational data recorded as Environmental Force Units (units of behavior of agents acting with respect to the child). Child behavior is then coded and described according to a set of 26 variables. Similarities and differences across groups on some dimensions of the variables are presented. Results of this analysis feature wide individual differences, some important similarities across the three socioeconomic groups, and some interesting intergroup differences in orientation to child-rearing.

Part I describes the three major mobile preschool instruction programs. The Appalachia Preschool Program and Southeastern Education Laboratory's Readimobile Program are being field tested as possible strategies for the delivery of instructional services to rural children while the Florida Mobile Early Learning Program represents an approach to the preschool education of migrant children. Information presented includes background, physical description of the unit, description of the population, program operation, staffing and curriculum, evaluation, cost analysis, and a line drawing of the unit. Part II of the monograph deals with mobile preschool training programs. Part III  describes selected elementary school mobile programs and one quasi-mobile preschool program. Part IV contains general conclusions and recommendations and attempts to deal with some of the major issues germane to mobile education, to synthesize the programs reviewed and give some idea of the state of the art in mobile preschool instruction, and to formulate some of the unanswered questions pertinent to the future development of similar programs.

Although this Preschool Project has been in operation five years, the study is not yet completed because statements about the effects of various child rearing practices and experiences have not been put to experimental test. Nontheless, preliminary results concerning optimal and restricted development of 48 children in a natural environment can be reported. In general, child rearing interactions during years 1-3 appear to offer the most relevance for intense investigation. The mother's direct and indirect activities appear to be the most powerful formative factors in the  development of the preschool child. Some \"best guesses\" about the most effective child rearing practices can be made. Findings suggest that effective mothers (1) are generally permissive, (2) usually but not always respond to their child's appeals for immediate help (3) act in response to overtures by the child and (4) have a high energy level.

Transformation involves foregoing the usual outcomes of adapted intelligence for the sake of voluntary control of one's own behavior in games, and for the excitement of novel affective, cognitive and behavioral variations which then become possible. Imitative play, exploratory play, testing play, and contesting are discussed in terms of their social and personal meanings. Several contesting games enjoyed by children of varying age levels, such as Hide and Seek, Red Rover and Prisoner's Base, are described and classified according to actors, acts, space, and time. Games reflect society in general in that they embody both rule and reason, chance  and madness, and societies in particular in that specific types of games enjoyed reflect differing modes of life. It is suggested that the primary function of play may be the enjoyment of a commitment to one's own experience. (NH)",

        "description":"As part of a continuing effort to find educationally relevant variables for handicapped children the present investigation focused on the relationship of observable behaviors to first grade achievement. Subjects were 134 first graders who were observed in reading and arithmetic periods (survival skills) for 10 to 14 days. The data collected were correlated with achievement as measured on standardized achievement tests. There was a moderate composite survival skill relationship. A stepwise regression analysis using specific aspects of survival skills behavior as independent variables and achievement scores as dependent variables was performed. In general, a relationship was found between social class, survival skills and first grade achievement. Lower class children were more  variable and more predictable in their survival skills behavior than upper class children. The combined variables of sex of child and SES proved to be the most powerful predictors for achievement from survival skills. A mixture of stability and flux characterized the findings regarding survival skills across academic settings. The evidence gained in this study provides support for the theoretical significance of situational variables in accounting for behavior and points to the implications of the practical significance of searching out educationally relevant variables in the classroom environment.

A nationwide probability sample of 7,119 children was selected to represent the noninstitutionalized children (about 24 million) in this age group. Height was obtained in stocking feet with the head in the Frankfort Plane, subject standing erect but not manually elongated, and recorded by means of a polaroid camera mounted on the measuring rod. Weight was measured in standardized clothing on a self-recording scale. The present findings are compared with other findings, both in the past and in other countries. There has been a steady and very regular increase in both height and weight of children in the United  States over the past 90 years. American children are among the largest in the world. American boys at age 6 are slightly taller and heavier than the girls, but, by age 11, the girls are larger. While heights for white and black boys in this age range are comparable, white boys are slightly heavier than black boys at every age. Black girls are taller and weigh slightly less than white girls until age 11. Height and weight as measures of growth of the developing human and the use of these findings as standards, both clinical and epidemiologic, is discussed.

The center  program for mothers taught them how to stimulate their children intellectually and improved mothers' self-concept and home management. The children's class program emphasized skill development and an ordered environment. Intelligence pretests and posttests were given to mothers and children. Program effects on target children, differential effect of the mothers' involvement, vertical diffusion to siblings, and the effect of the home visitor are discussed. (NH)",

The Center project describes what is required to provide housing, equipment, food, supplies, services, proper ratio of adults to children, daily programs and costs for this one program. Evaluations of child growth were based on data from 15 pairs of matched home and Center children (from middle class families) between the ages of three months and three years. Data analysis revealed few significant differences between groups on mental, motor, or social development. Those differences which were significant favored the  Center children. Illness data were difficult to collect and indicated that Center children appeared to have had more diaper rash and more colds. Outgrowths of the Center project were publication of guidelines for the state legislature, a leaflet for parents, and a descriptive booklet detailing group care of young children. Although this one program demonstrated that babies in group care are not harmed by the experience, the report stresses the pioneering nature and uniqueness of the Center endeavor. (WY)",

Everything that goes into affectionate and satisfying child care, day after day, offers many opportunities for learning by babies, toddlers, and their caregivers. Expensive toys and equipment are for this type of &quot;curriculum.&quot; Some child development theories are briefly presented, and infants and toddlers are shown learning through various aspects of routine daily care, exploration and play, and visits to doctor's office and nursery school. Results are reported of a study of 20 babies under the age of 2 receiving all-day care in a nursery using the old-fashioned &quot;curriculum&quot; presented  in this slide series. Paired with babies brought up in their own homes by interested, involved mothers, they kept pace in mental, motor, and social development. Instructions are included for ordering the slide series.

This procedure, expressly developed for assessing development in children with limited verbal skills, minimizes some of the research problems associated with young children since it requires only that a child respond to simple verbal commands and colored lights by squeezing a rubber bulb. Four groups of children (n=27), varying in age and IQ, were formed to test the sensitivity of the procedure to detect differential development. It was expected that if the procedure was sensitive, superior performance would be shown in the form of an increase in regulatory control with increased levels of  development. Performance scores were submitted to analysis of variance and then multivariate analysis. Results showed that the Ivanov-Smolensky procedure has promise as a research device. (AJ)",

The Sc group was trained to apply rules and basic strategies. All subjects had been pretested on a portion of the Matching Familiar Figures (MFF). As  a posttest, eight unfamiliar MFF items were given individually and the remaining eight items were used 7-9 days later as a delayed posttest. Changes in response latency and number of errors from pretest to posttests were analyzed.

Statistics cited on the number of working mothers with children under the age of 6 and the number of day care licensed homes and centers show that the shortage of licensed day care facilities is much more acute than it was five years ago. Also, there are a great number of mothers who are ineligible for subsidized day care, but whose incomes are too low to buy good private care. Government programs provide day care for only 2% of the migrant children who need it, and for only about 10% of the children at poverty or near poverty levels. Mothers in federally sponsored work training programs are often unable to continue participation because of lack of child care. It is  recommended that over the next five years a goal be set for provision of developmental day care services for at least 2 million additional children, merely to catch up with the current need. Participation of the clothing industry, some hospitals, and some governmental departments in providing day care for children of their employees and the growing emergence of franchised day care systems are discussed.

Children were tested early in the year, at the end of the year, and at the end of kindergarten on a battery of tests and rating scales, including Stanford-Binet, Preschool Inventory, Curiosity Box, Replacement Puzzle, Dog &amp; Bone, Behavior Inventory and Embedded Figures. The kindergarten experience was systematically varied. One replication of the original experiment entered a Follow Through kindergarten, the remainder of the experimental children entered Regular Kindergarten, a non-academic program. A video-tape monitoring  procedure developed previously was used to analyze differences among kindergarten programs. Data were examined from several aspects. (1) Did Follow Through and regular kindergarten classes differ in expected dimensions? (2) Did Follow Through produce greater gains than regular kindergarten? (3) Were there interactions between type of Head Start and type of kindergarten? (4) To what extent were Head Start gains maintained irrespective of type of kindergarten? (5) Were there sex effects or sex interactions? Results are discussed in terms of need for finer analysis of program dimensions as related to specific effects. (Author/AJ)",

This report deals specifically with crying, response to brief everyday separations from the mother and to her return, and behavior relevant to physical contact with her. The subjects, 26 infant-mother pairs from white, middle class families, were visited at home once every three weeks from 3 to 54 weeks, each visit lasting approximately four hours. From the observer's detailed notes, a narrative record was made of infant behavior and mother-infant interaction. The findings reported in quarter-year sets illustrate developmental trends, individual differences in the behavior of both mother and infant, and the relationship between maternal and  infant behavior. The researchers conclude that (1) there are important qualitative differences in infant-mother attachment relationships; (2) no single criterion of attachment can serve as an adequate basis in all cases for determining the presence of infant attachment; (3) there is no present basis for assessing strength of attachment; and (4) mother-infant interaction seems to be linked to attachment behaviors and the quality of the attachment relationship.

Mental elaboration is \"thinking while learning\" which occurs as the learner actively adds context to the material he is asked to process. Supplied elaboration, included in these studies, occurs when the learner is provided with elaborative learning aids such as pictures and sentences. Attempts are made to state the differential effects on learning of the two types of elaboration. A model for research on elaboration was presented, and it was hypothesized that children could learn much more rapidly when supplied with contexts or instructed in how to make up their own contexts. The general approach was to test a range of tasks for which imagery or verbal  elaboration would be effective. Seven of the studies involved the paired-associate recall of nouns, while the other involved the learning of a finger maze. The most striking finding was that instructing children in mental elaboration (imagery and sentence generation) significantly increased the recall of nouns when compared with rote repetition, and it seems that instructing children in \"how to learn\" strategies may be appropriate for several school learning tasks.

Statistically tested hypotheses were: (1) there are significant correlations between the ability to coordinate perspectives and chronological age, intelligence, socio-economic status, and knowledge of left-right relationships; and (2) there is a significant difference in the mean scores of high and low socio-economic groups on the Test of Coordination of Perspectives when the effect of intelligence is removed, and also a difference between  subjects living in urban as opposed to rural environments on the same test. The study involved the administration of an intelligence test, a test of right-left relationships and the Test of Coordination of Perspectives to 140 children from kindergarten to grade six, 5.0 to 12.7 years of age, enrolled in two schools reflecting high and low socio-economic classes, rural and urban environments. Results proved hypothesis 1 acceptable; 2 was not. The finding that there are differences in the developmental stages of children of the same age but with different IQs indicates that Piaget's age-stage relationships may be more closely allied to intelligence than to maturation and experience.

Also studied is the relationship between level of development of causal thinking and variables of age, sex, IQ, and grade placement. Seventy-five boys and 75 girls, ages 6, 8, and 11 years, were administered the Laurendeau and Pinard questionnaires (included in appendixes) to elicit responses about concepts of dream, life, the origin of night, the movement of clouds, and the floating and sinking of objects. Responses were evaluated for instances of precausal thinking, i.e. realism, animism, artificialism, finalism, and  dynamism. Analyses of the data support the Piaget (1927) and the Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) findings with regard to the three age-related stages of development of causal thinking, and the manifestation of precausal forms of thinking. Significant differences appear for the dimensions of age and school grade for the American subjects. Significant differences between Canadian and American children are found in level of development attained in all the concepts; exception was the concept of life. (NH)",

Major linguistic families of the American Indians in New Mexico are discussed, thereby pointing up problematic areas which could relate to academic difficulties for the American Indian. It is believed that the monolingual Indian 6-year-old, entering school for the first time, is at a great disadvantage when compared with an English-speaking 6-year-old entering  the same school and having a listening vocabulary of perhaps 8,000 to 10,000 English words.

Regarding the latter, it is expected that orientations of both groups will become more realistic over time, expectations more so than aspirations. Reported are data from 165 Negro and white girls, residing in economically depressed areas of rural East Texas, who were originally questioned in 1966 (during grade 10) and who were recontacted in 1968 regardless of school status at the time. Results partially substantiate the hypothesized relationship between race and marital-family orientations. In both 1966 and 1968, Negro girls expressed greater desire to  work outside the home after marriage--particularly after children--and accorded desire to marry and raise a family less importance relative to other goals than white girls. Also, both groups desired small families. In 1966, Negro girls expressed desires to marry later than whites; no significant racial differences were found in these aspirations in 1968. In both years, marital-family expectations of the girls were distributed similarly to their aspirations, suggesting that girls perceived few barriers to goal attainment. Contradicting the hypotheses regarding dynamics of orientations, the aggregate distributions of the orientations, even expectations, did not change appreciably over the 2 years with either group. However, evidence of marked individual instability of orientations suggests  a need for further research. (Author/AN)",

        "description":"In the locale of Hanford, California, this 1968 nutritional study was made to explore and evaluate the nutritional beliefs and food practices of Mexican American mothers among low-income agricultural working families. Some 35 mothers whose children attended the Hanford Child Day-Care Center were interviewed at home to determine family characteristics and food-buying and menu-planning practices. Open-ended questions provided information about dietary essentials and the mother's familiarity with the 4 basic daily foods. Results of the study are presented in the document in terms of grocery-buying and menu-planning, home food production and preservation, influence of Child Day-Care Center training, mother's 24-hour recall of her diet, a dietary questionnaire, and daily dietary  essentials (folk beliefs, etc.). In summary, it is noted that (1) advanced planning of meals was not the rule, with the majority of mothers deciding on menus just before starting meal preparation; (2) approximately one-half of the families produced some type of food at home, and one-third preserved some food by canning; and (3) menu evaluation revealed deficiencies in milk, fruits, and vegetables.

        "description":"The approach taken in this program is based on the assumption that children are placed in heterogeneous classes with children of varied abilities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Although migrant children may be given special attention through small group activities specifically designed to meet their needs, these children should be given the opportunity to see that all children are different from others in many respects and that, because migrant youth may be different, they are not inferior. The theoretical foundation purports that effective communication among children is of paramount importance. As children become involved with one another in relevant activities, they will be motivated to learn. The teacher acts as a facilitator/director/resource person in the learning process.  The self-concepts of children will improve as they become (1) aware of their similarities and differences compared to others, (2) confident of their abilities, and (3) knowledgeable of acceptable social interaction. Their self-images will be improved if they are successful in school. In the teachers' guide, a program for effective learning is examined; activities for promoting emotional growth in migrant children (Magic Circle) and for future orientation are described; and activity units, based on Arkansas curriculum guide activities, are presented by grade level (K-6).

Some 120 teachers in 10 local school systems received personal, concerned, and professional assistance for 1 full year. The teacher population was drawn from rural, isolated majority-Negro school systems in Georgia. The most important contributions of this project resulted from efforts (1) to introduce, and guide implementation of, more appropriate instructional methods in classrooms; (2) to review and update individual teachers in their content areas; and (3) to change self attitudes. Five formal evaluative devices were used: Tennessee Self Concept Scale, Organizational Climate  Description Questionnaire, Measures of Attitudes (semantic differential), Objectives of Programs for the Disadvantaged (ranking), and Program Practices for Disadvantaged Children (priority rating of 24 program practices). Results from the first of these devices suggest that the teachers served gained positive attitudes about themselves. The major strength of the project lay in its conduct in the field rather than under laboratory conditions. Approximately 110 pages of appendices provide papers presented at the National Conference for Supervision and Curriculum Development, formal evaluation devices used in the project, and other project-related materials.

The pupils selected had to (1) be of Mexican descent, (2) be currently enrolled in educable mentally retarded (EMR) classes, and (3) have evidenced a problem in using the English language due to their native language being Spanish. The assessment instrument used was the \"Escala de inteligencia Wechsler para ninos,\" which is the Spanish version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.\" Results of the testing showed that the average gain from the previously low test scores (which classified the students as retarded) to the present test scores was 13.15 IQ points. The median score for the prior IQ was 70, while the median score  for present IQ was 83. It was concluded that many Mexican American pupils may have been placed in EMR classes solely on the basis of performance on an invalid IQ test. The previous testing was termed invalid because this particular subpopulation of pupils lacks facility with, and understanding of, the English language. When tested in Spanish, pupil performance in many cases was above the cutoff level of the EMR category (approximate IQ of 75). (LS)",

The subjects were 142 English-speaking and 84 Spanish-speaking children distributed throughout the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th grades. The dependent measure was a test of auditory discrimination ability consisting of taped pairs of nonsense utterances. Members of each pair were either identical or distinguishable from each other by a single sound. Analysis of variance by grade, sex, and language background was applied to the results. On the total test and on Section 1 (neutral items), there was significant variation due to grade, but not to sex or language background  (all significance levels were p<.01). Analysis of Section 2 (English-based items) and Section 3 (Spanish-based items) showed significant variation due to grade and language background. The English-speaking children performed better than Spanish-speaking counterparts on Section 2. The reverse was true on Section 3. Results suggest that any discussion of auditory discrimination ability which does not take into account the native language background of the listener is likely to overlook a highly significant variable and lead to tenuous conclusions.

        "description":"The Appalachian area of Mississippi is inhabited by a great number of adults who have never read a newspaper. Although numerous newspapers are printed within Appalachia, many adults cannot comprehend the local newspapers. The problems of non-communication, low educational level, and isolation of these people are concerns of the Itawamba Junior College (IJC) Adult Education Department, which received a grant from the Appalachian Adult Basic Education Demonstration Center to implement a low-reading-level newspaper to be distributed in the 20 counties of Mississippi Appalachia. Thus, the first edition of 500 copies was printed on February 16, 1970. In March, a training session was held to orient teachers to uses of this type of newspaper. The number of copies was then increased to  2000 so that each Adult Basic Education (ABE) student in Mississippi Appalachia could receive a newspaper to be used as supplemental reading material. In conclusion, the &quot;Appalachia News&quot; has been widely accepted. Numerous requests have been received for the paper from teachers and organizations located outside of Mississippi Appalachia, and 5500 copies of the paper are being mailed to adult educators and students in Mississippi Appalachia and in 34 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.

The Itawamba Junior College (IJC) Vocational and Technical Adult Education Department is presently meeting the needs of a small majority of the adults who need additional education. In an agreement with Town and Country Mobile Homes manufacturers, the Mississippi State Department of Education, and the Appalachian Adult Basic Education Demonstration Center, IJC Adult Education Department created an educational facility through which undereducated adults can upgrade their functional educational level. The mobile home manufacturer built and donated the mobile classroom; the state department of education provided necessary funds to equip the facility with hardware and software and to pay the teacher's salary;  and the IJC Adult Education Department supervised the project. An educational survey of various communities and industrial locations was conducted and a class schedule was established. Initially, 5 locations were selected and 80 people were enrolled. Presently, the mobile classroom is scheduled in 7 locations, with 125 people being enrolled. IJC Adult Education Department believes that the initial objectives set up for the mobile classroom have been met satisfactorily, inasmuch as the Mississippi State Department of Adult Education has agreed to support operations of the mobile classroom for 1970-71.

Thus, interviews were conducted with over 13,000 migrant families (representing almost 80,000 individuals) and with growers or company representatives, crew leaders, and welfare directors. Additionally, data-gathering instruments were developed and used to obtain information for use by migrant-assistance agencies. Results are included in the 1970 annual report in terms of demographic characteristics of migrants, recent work experience, experience with social agencies, the impact of mechanization, the existing food stamp plan, the proposed Family  Assistance Plan, and special studies and action programs. Based upon the 2-year study, the project report also offers conclusions and recommendations about several spheres of activity, including establishment of procedures which will allow public-assistance agencies (1) to meet more equitably the needs of their migrant clientele and (2) to formulate plans to meet the needs of migrant and seasonal workers who will soon be displaced from employment by mechanization. Graphs, tables, and photographs are included. (The 1969 annual report is ED 043 443.) (EL)",

Stated objectives were that each student would (1) demonstrate \"touch\" knowledge of the typing keyboard and skills necessary to type from copy, (2) increase his spelling ability, (3) increase his English usage capability, (4) increase his English reading capability, and (5) demonstrate ability to solve routine practical arithmetic problems. The 17 two-hour evening sessions, held Tuesday/Thursday and Monday/Wednesday, were attended at least once by 29 students (19 students attended 5 or more sessions). Evaluation of the objectives was based on results of  interviews, observations, objective testing, attendance data, and data from the Utah Migrant Council. Using the Wilcoxons' signed ranks test and the u- and F-tests on test scores, it was determined that the first 4 stated objectives were met by most students. The fifth objective had been met before program institution. Typing skills gained were negligible but contributed to large gains in spelling, English usage, and reading skills.

Results were significant. Of the 118 in the population, 97% responded by completing the test instrument. Results indicated that the AAHPER Council was divided into 3 partially overlapping interest groups, each having some individual and some shared attitudes toward the meaning of \"outdoor education.\" The research hypothesis was that agreement existed among members of the AAHPER Council on the meaning of \"outdoor education.\"\"Agreement\" was  operationally defined as at least 70% of the respondents appearing on any one of the attitude factors abstracted by a factor analytic computer program (Q-methodology). Since 70% of the respondents did not appear on any one of the factors, the hypothesis was rejected. Since areas of disagreement appeared, it was within the scope of inquiry to describe the nature of this disagreement. An analysis and interpretation of the extracted factors and an explanation of the concomitant attitude groups described the areas of this disagreement. The 3 prominent attitude groups were the (1) Environment-oriented Group, (2) Conservation-oriented Group, and (3) Outdoor-activity-oriented Group. (Author/LS)",

These investigator-constructed dictionaries contained English definitions of every idiom and vocabulary item in the basal readers that the researcher deemed questionable in terms of understanding by a  bilingual student. Results of the pre- and post-test were statistically compared using the t-ratio. General findings were that grades 5 and 6 of the experimental Indian group showed significant gains in vocabulary skills; grade 4 Indian students in the experimental groups gained higher than grade 4 Indians in the control group; and grade 4 non-Indians in the control group gained significantly higher than Indians in the same group.

Other purposes of the study were to check the availability of various mediums to all students and the usefulness and importance of such as part of the instructional program. The population included 102 students (in grades 7, 8, and 9), of which 34 were American Indians from the Fond du Lac Chippewa Indian Reservation in Minnesota. A 4-page checklist obtained data, which are recorded on  tables. The findings revealed (1) a definite pattern of interest with each medium and (2) a significant interest difference with Indian students as compared to other students, with some exceptions. In the second study, designed to obtain a more complete picture of Indian student interests than was provided by the foregoing cross-cultural study, 36 Indian students attending 4 Minnesota secondary schools responded in terms of mass communication interests. Tabular results indicate, for example, that students in all schools feel that books comprised the medium from which the students learned most. (EL)",

This framework, along with  the accompanying values schemes and allegiance-group patterns, furnishes general guidelines for mounting action programs for urban Mexican Americans. It is recommended that such programs (1) begin by reinforcing basic Mexican American values, (2) be aimed simultaneously at different economic levels, (3) attempt to supply interdisciplinary technical support, (4) be designed to enable Mexican Americans to help their own, and (5) be national in scope and commitment. The greater issue is the mobilization of effort to enable most Mexican Americans to join the mainstream of United States society. Two figures and 13 references are included. (MJB)",

The child is defined as the primary client and the teacher, teacher aide, parent, and administrator are secondary clients who surround and screen the child during the educational process. The entire secondary-client population is considered the key to increasing  the child's probability of success in school. The child's problem in school is seen as falling into 3 broad areas: academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and intercultural ability. Outcomes are specified for each area for the child and for each class of secondary client. One set of curriculum and installation products is specified for the entire Communication Arts Program.

Partial cause of failures at attempts for educational innovation can be found in the lack of appropriate design and implementation studies which could be provided by educational engineers. To remedy these failures, three recommendations are made: (1) In the near future, all participants in the introduction of a social change must become conscious of the need for engineering design information. (2) The profession of educational engineer should be established, along with schools which train professionals to design complex social systems. (3) The educational  engineer should interact with both management and science. He can help the social scientist see more clearly the kinds of problems he must work on and help the administrator see more clearly what is feasible in regard to change. Presently engineering skills are missing in most attempts at educational change. Educational engineers could assist in these processes by designing systems and alternatives, planning implementation, and implementing change. (VJ)",

Upon reviewing the aspects, procedures, and criteria of these tests, the author noted that most of these tests resembled group verbal intelligence tests. Makeup of the tests was discussed to show how they were related to purposes for reading. It was felt that most tests had attempted to measure reading comprehension as a mere thought-getting process unrelated to reading purposes and that these tests limit the purposes for reading to the examinee's ability to achieve the test developer's purpose. A number of problems with regard to these tests were raised. It was concluded that instead of a continuous  process of development, improvement, and increased knowledge in that area over the past 50 years, there had been merely a continuous rediscovery of old ideas and a continuous search for the elusive, definitive theory of reading comprehension which can serve as a basis for all measures of reading comprehension. Standardized reading tests which seem to measure reading comprehension are included in a table. Diagrams of various theories of reading comprehension and references are also included. (AW)",

Four instructors coordinate the program, aided by a counselor. The reading component is the focal point of the program, the reading instructor working closely with the other instructors in selecting materials. The establishment of a team reading program requires first that a broad-based planning committee of faculty, a librarian, and a research director be established to handle preliminary details and specify broad goals for the program. Data then must be collected on the students, including survey tests, analytic/semidiagnostic  tests, and informal reading tests in content areas. After data are interpreted, tentative behavioral objectives and methodologies are established by the instructors. The instructors are vital to the success of the program in that they must be cooperative, flexible, and open to criticism. The instructors, with the help of the research director, also have the responsibility of final total evaluation of the program. Evaluative procedures include measures of academic and attitudinal changes and the reactions of both faculty and students. (VJ)",

        "description":"The author quotes the statement that the primary goal of the Research and Development Program on Reading is to \"produce functional reading competence on the part of all persons reading age 10.\" In evaluating this goal, he considers it to be questionable for several reasons. First, there is no high correlation between reading ability at the age of 10 and ultimate academic success. Second, fourth-grade reading ability is not sufficient for most adult reading tasks, thus the standard is not realistic. Studies of Dale, Gray, and Ojeman demonstrated that adults with less than fifth-grade schooling tended to regress in reading ability, while those with more than 5 years tended to maintain or improve. They also observed a low relationship between the last school grade attended and  reading ability as an adult. Third, there is a conflict between the goal and the proposed research. The goal is the production of functional literacy for all the population, but the research will concern itself with inventing a new way of teaching developmental reading that will function only up to the fourth grade. And finally, the program also faces the problem of inventing an omnipotent method of instruction effective for all the school population. References are included. (AW)",

The survey proceeds in three broad areas: (1) methodological considerations, (2) cloze as a measuring device, and (3) cloze as a teaching technique. It is concluded that cloze based on every -n(th) deletion correlates more highly than based on selective deletions and that scoring of exact replacements is the most useful scoring system. The author reports that the cloze procedure is a valid and reliable measure of comprehension ability. He also feels that the most significant contribution the cloze procedure has made to reading research is in the aspect of readability, and this signals cloze as an important tool in the study of  language. Further research is recommended to examine the construct validity of the cloze procedure and to investigate various uses of the cloze (1) to measure information gain, (2) to measure listening comprehension, and (3) to explore the relationship of factors such as literary style and attitude to comprehension. The author has found little research done on cloze procedure as a teaching technique, and this research evidence does not suggest the cloze as an effective teaching technique. (AW)",

The students too should learn the skill of questioning to be a good reader for the rest of their lives. The teacher's first job is to identify for students the skill of questioning as a way of understanding the writer, pinpointing his purpose, synthesizing what he says, evaluating his ideas, and solving problems. Then he should demonstrate for them how questioning is done. The most important but most problematic step is providing for students the environment to practice the skill of questioning. The ultimate objective is to help students reach the point where they question writers as they read. Since questioning the writer is a somewhat difficult and complex concept, the students  should be led to begin by questioning the present that evolves around themselves, then proceed to questioning peers and other persons known to them, and finally to questioning the writer whose ideas can only be reached through the printed words.

(2) Several different theoretical positions within psychology representing a wide variety of points of view have been used, whereas transformation-generative grammar is the only theory from linguistics that is represented in recent attempts at model building. (3) There seems to be a rapprochement among theorists toward a view of reading as both a complex cognitive skill, the goal of which is obtaining information, and a complex language system. (4) Most models focus on the reading process per se. However, the opinion is evidenced  that in order to understand the acquisition process, we must first study the skill as it appears in final form. (5) Most models of the acquisition phase focus on decoding and its prerequisite abilities. The mechanisms involved in making correspondence between orthography and sound cannot, however, be characterized in terms of simple associative learning. Rather, basic knowledge of language is intimately involved, as well as the utilization of complex active perceptual and cognitive strategies. (Author/AW)",

Currently there are five areas of concern within the field of reading diagnosis: perceptual motor diagnosis, brain damage and reading, curriculum analysis, behavioral objectives and criterion referenced tests, and reading capacity. Research in the first two areas should continue, but they have no place in the current reading curriculum. Also there is no evidence that perceptually handicapped or minimally brain damaged students need special programs. Curriculum  analysis puts emphasis on what is wrong with programs rather than what is wrong with students. Behavioral objectives and criterion referenced tests are positive developments in reading diagnosis in that they provide an analysis of what is taught and how it is taught.

        "description":"The extent to which pictorial presentation would facilitate the comprehension of text-like passages among two populations of fourth-grade students was investigated. Subjects were 64 students each in high-socioeconomic status (SES) white and low-SES black groups. Simple passages amenable to pictorial presentation were read over a programed tape to the subjects. At the same time slides giving a cumulative presentation were projected. In the verbal conditions they were made from photographs of hand drawings. Subjects were tested individually following each passage. Three main effects were significant: population, presentation mode (text versus pictorial), and question type (1 attribute span question versus 2 to 4 attribute span questions). The data also indicated that visual  elaboration was significantly more effective in the low-SES black population. It was the researcher's belief that the question-type effect in the low-SES black population indicated the subjects' attempt to transform the passages by processing them conceptually and that equal performance in the memory and inspection conditions in the pictorial mode confirmed that the pictures aided in this conceptual activity.

The coordinator would act as the leader of the reading program. Teachers from different grade levels should be put on the reading committee to help and advise the coordinator. The school reading center would contain materials  available to all teachers in the school. Its function would be to help the teachers achieve the goals of the reading program by making them aware of what resources are available, improving the center environment, and simplifying check-out procedure.

The public concern for getting their tax money's worth in quality of teaching called for federal aid to help schools hire nonprofessional teacher aides. The work of paraprofessionals in schools can be divided into clerical, housekeeping, instructional, motivational, and integrational. Teachers should have training in management techniques so that they can direct the activities of the paraprofessionals teamed with them to obtain effective results. Present paraprofessional programs are faulty in (1) training teachers' competitors rather than supportive help, (2) training only the most able aides, (3) emphasizing community involvement for its own  sake, (4) overburdening classroom teachers with program responsibilities, and (5) lacking portability. The following are necessary to insure that paraprofessional programs will accomplish valid educational improvement: (1) awareness that moving into a paraprofessional program is not justifiable purely as an economic measure, (2) openmindedness and willingness to explore, (3) training of specialized educational technicians for specific jobs, (4) legislation to permit expanded use of nonprofessionals in the instructional program, and (5) a career ladder for the able paraprofessionals to become professional teachers.

The university students (tutors) became directly involved in teaching reading and in being responsible for children's achievement. However, despite the positive feedback from the students, children, and cooperating teachers, it was evident that the skills acquired from the course were not transferring to student teaching and/or actual teaching. An analysis of the problem suggested that the tutors were not learning how to cope with the reading instructional needs of groups of children. An attempt was made to improve the program by moving it into the public  schools where a larger number of children and additional space were available. The tutors now could work with more than a single child and could become involved in planning \"direct teach\" and \"pupil managed\" tasks.

The opponents fear that too much emphasis on early reading may lead to a less rounded development of the child; they agree on providing the child with richer and more varied experiences to insure reading readiness. The advocates believe that today's children have already had more and varied experiences and thus are more ready for reading activities at an earlier age than used to be the case. Some recent research studies have attempted to prove that (1) early readers do maintain their lead in reading achievement, (2) early readers have better attitudes towards reading, (3) there is no evidence that early reading is harmful to a child's eyesight, and (4) early reading will not result in psychological and social  problems. However, the whole issue of early reading remains unresolved. Little research has been done to substantiate claims of the effects of early reading. Many of the criticisms center on questions regarding kindergarten teachers' background for teaching reading, problems of organizing instruction, and current reading programs. Advocates of early reading should feel a pressing need to provide better guidelines grounded in related research. References are included. (AW)",

Six design teams were established to consider learner characteristics, overview of the program, behavioral objectives,  word study, comprehension, and approaches to instruction.

Various studies are reviewed in which a variety of mechanical devices were used to examine the physiological changes that occur during silent reading. Edfelt's use of a mingograph in 1950 was considered a breakthrough, along with his conclusion that efforts to eliminate implicit speech should be discontinued. Clinical applications of these experimental results are also examined, as well as a more recent area of inquiry, that of causation theories. The accumulated opinions of specialists in this area supported the theory that implicit speech may aid comprehension in the primary grades. Research of the 1960's which has direct bearing on implicit speech as a covert-overt form of linguistic behavior includes  studies by Cleland et. al., (1968), Laffey (1966), and Hardyck (1968).

The selection of 11 studies was based on specific criteria such as a minimal sample size of 40 subjects, an experimental period of at least 18 weeks, and a pretest post-test research design with experimental and control groups. The studies were divided into those which supported the hypothesis that programs of perceptual-motor development enhance reading readiness or achievement of intellectually able students and those which did not. Three of the five studies supporting the hypothesis were with students who were behind in reading or from a low socioeconomic environment. A summarization of the studies refuting the hypothesis revealed that 83  percent of the studies were with kindergarten or primary-grade children who, in general, were not experiencing learning disabilities. On the basis of this review it was concluded that the hypothesis could be neither confirmed nor denied.

Students meet in their language arts classes for two-period time blocks daily, moving from one phase to the next at their own rates. The communication skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing are taught at each phase,  these skills being organized around a six-element framework intended to establish guidelines and provide sequence and continuity in the curriculum: (1) needs of teenagers, (2) goals to be accomplished, (3) skills to be developed, (4) methods of instruction, (5) materials to be used, and (6) assessment and evaluation.

The children were assigned to one of four discrete teaching methods for a period of 7 months. When word recognition tests were administered in January, May, and June, it was found that the total improvement made by each method was similar.

Only one family was present where both parents had a reading disability; both of their children were affected with a reading disability. In the families  where one parent was affected with a reading disability, Weinberg's method of Mendelian Analysis was used, giving a value of 37.7 percent of their children being affected. Chi-square analysis indicated that the value of 37.7 percent is not significantly different from the theoretical 50 percent expected in a single hybrid autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

Study 2 used 24 neonates to test the hypothesis that kinesthetic stimulation (rocking) effects attention to visual patterns. Results showed no significant effects of supplemental stimulation upon visual attention; however, there was a significant effect of target complexity upon attention. Study 3 used 32 3- and 4-year-olds to test the hypothesis that preference for complexity of stimuli increases with age.  Results confirmed the hypothesis, but there was also evidence that children were not responding solely to stimuli complexity. Results of Study 4 with 10 3- and 4-year-olds showed that (1) mirror-image reversal discrimination is difficult, and subjects were sensitive to complexity differences and (2) data were ambiguous in regard to whether children process multivariate stimuli differences simultaneously. Tables and references are included. (VJ)",

The student teachers taught microlessons to elementary school pupils or to their peers in the science methods class. The other variable was presence or absence of feedback from an experienced teacher. Students who taught peers developed competencies and attitudes similar to those of students who taught children, although some pacing skills and  questioning techniques were only developed by those teaching children. Systematic feedback from experienced teachers was necessary for the improvement of lesson pacing and clarity of presentation. There were few differences in attitudes between the groups with or without feedback. (AL)",

Types, functions, and values of organizers are illustrated by examples drawn from elementary, secondary and college level instruction, usually, but not exclusively, in science. The second half of the paper concerns some content issues in current science teaching, and the BSCS courses are used as illustrations of the points made concerning level of sophistication; overemphasis on analytic, quantitative and experimental aspects  of science; the naturalistic approach; and the relative emphasis on basic and applied sciences in the school courses. These aspects of science courses are considered generally, not only in terms of the use of organizers. There are some concluding comments on curriculum planning by diverse teams of specialists, rather than teams of learning theorists, subject matter specialists, or evaluators, and on the disadvantages of single-unit, in contrast to integrated, curriculum development.

Elaborating on life a few centuries hence, using reasonably realistic prospects based on understanding already available, Handler contends that the dreams of a peaceful, future society are indeed feasible. His principal thesis is that, even now, science has provided the basis of understanding necessary to fashion many elements of this society and that it will be fulfilled if mankind can survive the crises of this century. Reviewing the nature of some of the crises and the potential contributions of biological sciences to their solutions, he examines the problems of population, food supply, environmental  quality, resource utilization, and world peace. Summary statements indicate that biological and physical research can permit us to refashion ourselves and our world, and that if the dream fails, it will be because of the limitations of man the social creature, not the elements of science.

It is suggested that it is not simply population growth itself that is the issue, but rather the quality of life that can be influenced so fundamentally by population. Statistics and graphs serve to elaborate the problems of this issue. Chapters are entitled: Population in Perspective, The Prospects for Population Change, Population and the Quality of Life, and Policy Issues. Appended material includes public law 91-213 establishing the Commission, sources of data for the report, and research projects and  papers of the Commission. Findings and recommendations are to be presented in the final report scheduled for publication in 1972. (BL)",

        "description":"This is a preliminary report of a project that is attempting to extend psychological research on stylistic differences in cognition to the study of teaching. This portion of the project measures students' preferences for three modes of mathematical expression; symbolic, verbal, and graphic. One hundred and fifteen junior high school students took a test written to measure preferences for the three modes of mathematical expression. In addition, student scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Form 1, were obtained. An item analysis was made and correlations made between total scores on each of the three scales and the nine scores from the Iowa Test. The results were that students preferred a symbolic mode of representation and that the verbal and graphic scales formed positively  skewed distributions while the symbolic scale formed a relatively symetric though bimodal distribution. Other results are summarized in tabular form. Several suggestions for further experimentation are given. (Author/CT)",

The project entitled &quot;A School-Community Outdoor Education Project&quot; is a year round program for teaching in, for, and about the outdoors. Designed largely to assist teachers to meet educational objectives relating to the out-of-doors and man's environment, the program was also planned to enrich learning in all subject areas. Major attention of the report focuses on the testing of pupils and the reactions of those involved in the program-initiators, assistees, and recipients. Analysis and evaluation is made of the comments by teachers, administrators, pupils, parents and community agents, along with recommendations for future programs. The narrative report suggests the  greatest educational change in the three year project has been in teaching methodology--increased use of the out-of-doors in all subjects. Another gain has been the increased community-relatedness of the schools through cooperation of agencies and individuals with the school programs. Statistical data and sample dissemination materials are also presented. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (BL)",

It was presented to the symposium on \"Psychology and Population: Evolving Trends\" at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, Miami Beach, Florida, September, 1970. He points out that although few psychologists had been interested in psychosocial research on population problems prior to 1960, the impetus of the federal government in establishing population related programs in the late sixties has encouraged more scientists to enter the population field or increase their activities in it. Eleven problem areas to which psychologists can make a contribution are identified.  In addition, opportunities involving research training programs, and conferences in behavioral aspects of population, family planning, and reproduction are described together with the avenues for achieving them. Reference sources are also provided. Dr. Newman concludes that because the study of population problems is multidisciplinary, psychologists are provided unlimited opportunities in the population area. (BL)",

The data are compared on the basis of regions (North East, South East, Central, and Western); sex of respondent and size of community (big cities, urban fringes, medium sized cities, and smaller places). Males of all ages performed better on the science tests, but females scored higher on the writing tests. The North East and Central regions performed at or above the national average for both sets of tests at all ages. The South East scores were lower than the national average for all ages and both tests. The Western region showed a less consistent pattern, with 17 year olds  and adults performing better than the national average on both tests, 13 year olds below on both tests, and 9 year olds at the average for the science tests, but below for the writing. Large cities and &quot;smaller places&quot; respondents were above the national average, with the average for the urban fringe and medium-sized cities above average. The interpretations of a panel of reviewers are summarized, and the limitations of the results indicated. The newsletter also contains announcements about the organization of the project.

In a one-to-one setting with elementary students, teacher behavior and concern level were measured at pre-, post-, and delayed post-test sessions. Pretest scores were used as covariates. Concern levels increased immediately after treatment but decreased to initial levels at the end of the semester, regardless of treatment. Of thirteen teacher behaviors measured by the  interaction analysis instrument the only one to change significantly was the flexibility score of the interaction-analysis trained group, which increased over the long-term, but not in the time of treatment.

The thesis of this study is that an understanding of the debate over how schools should adapt to industrialization will reveal the nature of basic value choices which the American people were forced to face under the pressures of adjusting to technology. Part I examines some of the origins of educational changes related to the industrialization. Next the responses of selected interest groups are considered: business, as represented by the National Association of Manufacturers; the American Federation of Labor; liberal urban reform forces of the progressive era; and, the formation of typical progressive pressure  group--the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education (NSPIE), which worked to promote school reform programs at state and national levels. The reactions of NEA are noted along with resultant innovations --guidance programs and the comprehensive secondary schools. Part II examines the philosophies of education which articulated the value and policy questions at issue including the philosophy of social efficiency. John Dewey's complex analyses of the values of science, technology, and democracy for education in a technological world are examined. (Author/SBE)",

        "description":"Against the background of separate and inferior education for black Americans, the author discusses questions related to the effective teaching of economics to black students today. To the question of differentiated economics education by race, the author qualifies his negative answer by pointing to certain barriers to teaching economics to blacks, such as, basic skill level, exposure to economic institutions, and motivation, all probably due to white racism, however. Suggested solutions are remediation and effective teaching methods, such as the following: multi-media representations of economic realities, programmed instruction, inquiry methods, problem solving field work, and relevant subject matter selection. The latter approach requires that economics be taught from a  cultural context by focusing on the black experience. (Author/DJB)",

Two interrelated areas of interest are explored: 1) The Nature of Contemporary Change in American Society and the World; and, 2) The Educational Needs of Our Students. However, in order to develop relevant curriculum and devise innovative teaching methods, teacher participation and changes in the schools are necessary. Participants felt that academic courses should reflect an interdisciplinary approach and team teaching which require advanced study and basic changes in teacher preparation. Content should help students understand man in society as both creator and product of environment adding three crucial special areas: 1) should  emphasize analytical ability, inquiry approach, and decision making with less attention to factual indoctrination. The restrictive influence of the examination system is also noted. Changes in school structure and innovations for teacher training programs are described. The report concludes that active teacher involvement and leadership is vital to stimulating educational change. A brief appendix outlines a scheme for a K-12 curriculum sequence. (Author/JSB)",

Citing various studies and exploring the &quot;curriculum by textbook&quot; phenomena some conclusions are: 1) methods courses must concentrate on classroom dynamics and be less preoccupied with teacher knowledge, authority, and conformity: 2) it is not the amount of knowledge but new behavior (alternative roles and attitudes) that is most important; 3) teacher education should develop  inquiry, discovery, and critical thinking capacities; 4) training should include different teaching techniques and attention to selection and testing of new materials; 5) schools must offer an educational environment that is a microcosm of modern changing society; and, 6) the educational program will have an appreciable influence on students outlook, including political attitudes, values, and beliefs when controversy is allowed and critical thinking encouraged. Detailed findings of a California survey related to teacher training and contemporary issues connected with the Bill of Rights and our legal system are also included. (Author/JSB)",

        "description":"The goal of this booklet is to identify and present essential concepts and generalizations within the structure of knowledge of the social studies. The basic rationale rests upon the following assumptions: 1) the development of concepts and generalizations should be given primary emphasis over retention of facts in teaching the social sciences; 2) total coverage within a subject is often neither necessary nor desirable; 3) the inquiry or discovery approach can be used to advantage; and, 4) the content of social science courses should be based on interdisciplinary and cross cultural approaches. Classroom experiences should draw on a variety of stimuli thus the multimedia approach seems appropriate. The basic strategy for using this conceptual framework begins with planning for  instruction. Once knowledge is classified, teachers are free to set specific cognitive objectives, and to choose content and teaching methods to implement the objectives. This booklet will be considered successful if the student has gained: 1) knowledge of factors shaping human behavior; 2) awareness and appreciation of past and present civilizations; 3) awareness of alternative solutions to social problems; 4) comprehension of human interdependence; 5) competency in knowledge and information utilization; 6) a commitment to equal rights and opportunity; 7) critical skills to examine his values, and others; 8) a realistic self-concept; and, 9) the skills to function in a world of change.

It is observed that a state of methodological pluralism continues to persist today characterized by a number of overlapping special methodologies that can be subsumed under two more general orientations: empirical emphasis and the rational emphasis in Diagram 2; the former still predominates but is giving ground to the latter.

The 22 projects described grew out of a course on Intergroup Relations with 300 participating teachers from the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Seven projects focus on preparing for the problem of multi-racial classrooms, discussing such topics as student and faculty attitudes, prejudices, surveys of population, inservice programs, and teaching methods for improving intergroup relations. A second group of projects is designed to assist the suburban teacher in dealing with the problems of the multi-racial classroom and also help the suburban student learn about and understand differing minority group  students. These include resource units on human relations, self-concept, and racial understanding. Finally, 4 projects are provided which will assist the teacher in working with other classroom problems (the underachiever, the discipline problem, and the social isolate.) Each project is outlined in the following format: 1) Subject, 2) Background, 3) Objective, 4) Procedure, 5) Limitations, and, 6) Conclusions, Evaluations, or Recommendations. Some of the projects also list sample sources materials for units, survey questions, test questions, or other project activities.

The selection provides contrast and comparison developed in the juxtaposition of 19th and 20th century idealisms. 4) Technology and the culture of machine living includes narratives on automation, essays on transportation and communication, and science fiction stories presenting the role of the machine today and exploring that role within future life styles.

Here, an overview is given of population characteristics and growth patterns, the relationship of population growth to socioeconomic development, and the history of population concerns and policies. Private and governmental efforts to encourage family planning are described. It is shown that population growth has been a subject of concern since the beginning of the century, with this early interest focused primarily on the relationship of population size to food supply. Declines in both birth and death rates began in the 1920's. Though fertility practices have been under voluntary control, they have been influenced by certain  notable governmental actions. With the birth rate continually decreasing, there is concern in some sectors that there will be a shortage in the labor force if present fertility patterns continue. The present rate of natural increase in Japan is 1% per year, and is expected to decline further. (JLB)",

Financial problems and other valid areas for concern are also explored: 1) How valid may repetition be? 2) Who decides what content to repeat? 3) What is the purpose of duplication at college level? 4) Are instructors aware of curriculum content across levels? The general plan was twofold: 1) to enable 665 high school teachers of grades 11 and 12 to examine sample outlines of courses taught during the first two years of college; and, 2) to enable 400 college instructors to review high school level subjects in these four areas as  taught in grades 11 and 12. In response, high school teachers felt that almost one-third of content of all four areas of the college curriculum seems to be nothing more than high school courses rearranged and offered under a new name. The data from the college instructors are somewhat similar relative to the subject matter, both groups ranking in this order: highest duplication in social science, followed by English, science, mathematics. A chi-square of evaluators some two months after they completed initial ratings reveals their judgments can be considered statistically significant. Tables and graphs are included, and various recommendations are made to promote better coordination and articulation. (Author/JSB)",

Drawing on curriculum experiments begun in 1967, a new social studies program of non-graded instructional modules was inaugurated in 1969 concentrating in 3 areas: 1) United States Realities, 2) World Realities, 3) Governmental Realities. Format focuses upon change in two specific areas: relevancy and flexibility. First, characteristics of such a relevant social studies curriculum are that it: 1) considers crucial urgencies of our times; 2) is not an isolated look at events of the past; 3) is an educational strategy that asks the student to consider important questions, develop hypotheses, gather evidence, synthesize data,  and draw conclusions. In addition maximum flexibility is necessary to: 1) maintain relevancy, 2) individualize learning, 3) employ effectively the individual educational team members, and 4) allocate space, content materials, and multi-media facilities efficiently. Under the Kennedy High School design the student is offered 31 six week modules for selected study with no required modules or sequence. Diagrams of the first year sequence and the 31 modules are included, as well as references used in preparing the paper. (Author/JSB)",

It is intended to be a practical handbook for educators who feel their social studies program needs help, from a strengthening of weak spots to a wholesale revision. Curriculum reports made almost a half century ago by the American Historical Association and the National Education Association are briefly surveyed to illustrate the nature of curriculum change, and the impact today of the New Social Studies projects. Evidently, the prerequisites for change are: 1) involvement and commitment of support, both moral and financial, from the administration, the school board, and the community; and, 2) the interest and involvement of the teachers concerned. The  seven step revision blueprint that follows is meant only to be suggestive of a plan a school district could use. Resources are listed throughout with additional reference materials listed in the appendix: 1) standards for quality programs; 2) social studies publications, curriculum requirements, and services of the Department of Education; 3) representative national curriculum projects; 4) a brief suggested bibliography for the teacher; 5) the New York State curriculum continuums; 6) suggested curriculum material evaluation criteria and references; and, 7) professional organizations.

        "description":"This article focuses on open schools or schools without walls, those experiments within the public school system involving a reconceptualization of the role of the school in the educational process. A brief review of the free school movement (those experiments outside public schools) is also included. The stated goal of the open school is to help the child and adolescent move between classroom and community through a series of optimally stimulating settings with access to skills when he needs them, and providing learnings congruent with his own major life experiences. Characteristics of such open systems of learning are described, problems analyzed and two requirements for transforming the public schools given: 1) turning the school into a headquarters and the entire community  into a complex of learning sites; and, 2) reorganization of learning across disciplinary lines. The first will involve a substantial redeployment of personnel and resources in public schools as well as a redefinition of the relationships between school and community, teachers and community persons, adults and children. In addition, scholars and university-based professionals can assist in the development of new curricula and educational materials for flexible and more humanized school systems. Useful references on this new school concept are given as well as an extensive bibliography of resources, periodicals, and books. (Author/JSB)",

        "description":"Given the general recognition that what we do is influenced as much or more by our value commitments as by our factual knowledge, it is ironic that social studies, the area of the curriculum supposedly focused on citizenship education, has paid so little attention to values. There are many reasons for this, but one of them, the author believes, is the teachers' lack of a model for making values an integral part of instruction. This paper is both a theoretical and practical effort to answer this need. The author points out that since most important issues facing society are not factual questions but ethical ones, an adequate model for citizenship education must take into account that rational citizenship behavior includes justifying ethical decisions in terms of one's values.  Because the school has little role in determining what these values are, its role becomes one of helping the student to develop a clearer conception of what his commitments are, and to relate these commitments to the basic social values and facts, personal preferences and basic social values, values and public issues, and gives attention to the more practical aspects of examining values in the classroom. Throughout, there is emphasis on the need for a clear rationale, and classroom behavior based on that rationale. (JLB)",

The report concludes with a memorandum to the Commission setting forth the specific efforts  that increased funding might support. These include: research and development centers; materials development; teacher training programs; and, model programs. The appendix consists of a preliminary list of available instructional materials and childrens' books, as well as a list of institutions concerned with population education.

It draws upon the latest and most pertinent insights distilled from research, theory, and practice associated with reflective thinking; deals with specific whats, whys, how, and whens of problem solving in social studies at the elementary and secondary school levels; and, makes a case for increased use of this inquiry method and type of program organization. Specific suggestions are offered that range from the question-answering stage to full-fledged problem-solving units. Chapter 1 by Maurice P. Hunt and Lawrence E. Metcalf introduces the reader to the theory, philosophy,  and psychology of the problems approach. Fannie R. Shaftel, Charlotte Crabtree, and Vivian S. Sherman discuss problem resolution in the elementary school. The third chapter on the junior high school is provided by William E. Gardner. Robert E. Jewett treats the senior high school. Trends in the use of reflective teaching, the subject of chapter 5, have been identified and analyzed by Emily S. Girault. Chapter 6 on teaching resources has been prepared by Jack W. Miller.

To further refine and evaluate their model information processing system, the staff defined the following unit objectives using the Bloom and Krathwohl taxonomies: 1) Cognitive Performance Objectives: to develop knowledge of programs, comprehension of relationships and implications, application, and evaluation of program information; and, 2) Affective Performance Objectives: to promote use of, and involvement with the unit. 3) The specific unit requirements  were: parallel treatment of programs, accuracy, consistency, objectivity, flexibility, timeliness, relevance, uniqueness, and cost effectiveness. After an initial survey of 100 new programs, nine research based American government programs were selected for review in the multi-level unit including: introductory materials, project comparisons, program selection device, and detailed program reports. Three major field tests were conducted between February 1969 and spring 1970. The first was largely non-quantitative; the main and operational field tests were empirical studies with the populations, methodologies, and results enumerated here. It was concluded that the objectives were met. (SBE)",

        "description":"Intent on alerting curriculum developers to cyclical elements in social studies trends during the last 90 years, this paper reviews the two most pervasive national movements at the secondary level: 1) the source study movement in which students' use of primary source materials was emphasized in history instruction from the 1880's through the 1910's; and, 2) the core curriculum movement in which Social Studies and English were most commonly combined into block time courses for all students from the 1920's through the 1950's. These movements were selected for review because they exhibited some of the most important characteristics of the new social studies of the 1960's and of the social studies emerging in the 1970's. The latter reforms are considered comparable to the core  curriculum just as the reforms of the 1960's are to the scientific historiography of the source study movement. The reviews include discussions of the forces which produced, sustained, and ended them, and conceptual models for classifying and comparing them to their recent and future variations. Historically, curriculum reformers gave little attention to previous movements, whether similar or not. Citing this as a dysfunctional inconsistency for the social scientists and educators who advocate and lead reform movements, the author calls for a variety of studies in Social Studies history. Sources cited are annotated in a six-page bibliography. (Author/DJB)",

The papers show: 1) a shift away from content per se to a focus on process; 2) concern for the self-fulfillment of the individual student and his development in a social context; 3) examples of extending the learning environment into the community; and, 4) a trend toward a variety of theme oriented elective social studies courses. Instructional techniques emphasized are open discussion, independent research, and little use of textbooks. Needs in the social studies detected from these papers are: 1) program coordination K-12; 2) a  clear definition of objectives in social studies and an outline of strategies to accomplish them; and, 3) more stress on the pluralistic, multi-ethnic nature of our society. Programs include: humanities, Afro-American history, American Indian history, political science and government, and Mera and Oak Park projects, a study of mankind, community and outdoor social studies projects, and staff and student involvement in curriculum change.

The author argues that in our pursuit of a society based on environmentally sound principles, we have perhaps misidentified the villains, and have latched into solutions that may be either naive, or narrow. One commonly identified villain, for example, is population growth. While there is no doubt that more people put a greater burden on natural resources and human amenities, and that population growth should be controlled, this factor is not so important as high per capita consumption based on high per capita income. Other more complex examples, such as corporations, technology, and our socioeconomic systems, are similarly  examined in terms of their contribution to the environmental crisis. The author concludes that an intelligent use of regulation and incentive penalty systems which take into account the complex interrelationships in modern industrialized society, will go a long way toward solving the problems, while leaving the most individual freedom intact.

The first 11 students were placed overseas in January 1969, and a total of 70 students from nine institutions have since taken part in the program. English is used in all the participating schools, but the cultural backgrounds vary greatly. The foreign center for the program is the International Schools Association in Geneva, Switzerland, and faculty members from Morehead State College visit Europe each year. The program is regarded as an important first step in the development of an  international program centered around the clinical experience, which promotes international understanding at both the cognitive and affective levels by immersing the student in a unique experience in a foreign country. Included in the document are a table showing the placement of students, a copy of the application form and the recommendation form, the first draft of a handbook, &quot;Student Teaching Abroad,&quot; and a randomly selected example of a report from a program participant on her teaching experience during the winter quarter of 1970.

        "description":"This publication consists of papers presented at w workshop held at Arizona State University in Tempe to discuss problems concerned with both inservice and preservice training of teachers to work with American Indian children. Discussions centered around two major areas: the problems involved in proper training of the teachers and suggested solutions to these problems. The problems discussed include 1) teacher characteristics, school characteristics, cultural differences, the system, and selection and recruitment of teachers. Hopkins Smith outlines several criteria for the selection of teachers for Indians. Joe S. Sando identifies the stages of acculturation and stresses the need to move beyond these: 1) bewilderment and frustration concerning Indian culture; 2) rejection of  Indian society; and 3) semi-acculturation, with the beginning of pride in Indian culture. Lyal Holder provides a conceptualization of what he believes to be effective in training teachers for Indians. Willard Bass lists 20 selected problems, along with the comments on the research and/or development needed in each area, and demonstrates a strong concern about teacher attitudes. Finally, selected excerpts from \"The Education of Indian Children and Youth\" by Robert J. Havighurst discuss the goals of Indian education, the quality of teachers and administrators, and recommendations for curriculum, career development, college and post high school education, Indians in the urban school system, and finance. The introduction by Everett D. Edington and overview by Joel L. Burdin provide summaries  of the workshop and the problems of Indian education respectively. (MBM)",

The career prospects for non-graduate teachers are also extremely poor. The salaries of staff in colleges of education are much lower than those of comparable groups in the public and private sectors, such as civil service or local authority positions, and banking, accountancy, sales, and personnel. Tables showing teachers' salary scales and comparisons with other professions are include. Results show that teaching posssses most of the attributes of a career attractive to both boys and girls, but the poor salary image is an important reason for only 10 percent  of the boys thinking of entering teaching, as opposed to 51 percent of the girls. Case studies of men aged 25-35 indicate that salary considerations and limited career prospects are an important cause of wastage from the profession. Both non-graduate and graduate groups feel that no recognition is given to skill and devotion, in contrast to academic qualifications, and they believe that promotion involves taking administrative posts. Other major causes of dissatisfaction are unsatisfactory conditions within the schools, including narrow or irrelevant curriculum, petty restrictions, excessive power of principals, and lack of support with disciplinary problems.

Chapters 2, 3, and 4 assess student  development (cognitive, affective, and performance) as revealed through a variety of tests and evaluation instruments used throughout the program. The final chapter on student appraisal of the program includes assessment done throughout the program and the followup evaluation conducted one year after each fellow had returned to a leadership position in his respective school system. Included is a listing of the most valuable components and procedures: these included the internship semester, the use of block scheduling for campus courses, and the mixture of ethnic groups (Negro, Mexican American, and Anglo) among the fellows themselves.

The questionnaire and Hunt's Paragraph Completion Test of Conceptual Level were administered to 83 teacher education undergraduates. Data were analyzed by forming a correlation matrix and performing a factor analysis using varimax rotation for the final ten variables. Variables were seven teacher attitude dimensions (subject matter emphasis, personal adjustment ideology, student autonomy, teacher direction, emotional disengagement, consideration of student viewpoint, and integrative learning), plus the Conceptual Level  measure and the two Hunt attitude-toward-teaching stems. Results lent support to the Wehling and Charters hypothesis that teachers high in dimensions that tend to illustrate short-range concerns (Teacher Direction) would be basically concrete in their perceptions. The second objective, to replicate Wehling and Charters' findings and to test the stability of the dimension of Student Autonomy versus Teacher Direction, produced findings consistent with theirs. Further analysis revealed no significant relationships between the dimensions of Student Autonomy versus Teacher Direction and the Hunt Attitude-toward-teaching stems. (JS)",

After each video taping the student teacher viewed the recording and answered four open-ended self evaluation questions.  Answers were coded using an 18-category Data Coding System which classifies all statements under five broad categories: 1) Physical Aspects of the Environment, 2) Personal Characteristics of the Teacher, 3) Teaching Behavior, 4) Pupil Behavior, 5) Content of the Lesson.

Results showed group 1 self evaluation focusing more on the teaching act as opposed to group 2 and 3 focus on themselves as persons.

Samples of their teaching behavior (tape recordings and live observation coded according to the Joyce Conceptual Systems Manual) included four during the \"observation-participation\" period; two early in the second semester when they were with their cooperating teachers; one halfway through the semester; and two later in their experience. Analyses included calculation of eight indices of teaching behavior for each student  teacher and each cooperating teacher and correlations between student teacher behavior and cooperating teacher behavior at the preteaching, early student teaching, and late student teaching levels. The evidence indicates no relationships between the indices of the student teachers and cooperating teachers prior to contact but there were relationships in several indices shortly after student teaching began, and these continued even when adjusted for the early relationships. However, inspection of the difference scores revealed no consistent patterns of influence once the early impact of the cooperating teacher had been felt. (JS)",

Beginning with a survey of the American scene in the 1960's, it considers the role played by the schools in producing a society in which technology has outdistanced humanity. The need to make schools humane institutions was the major goal recommended by NEA's Center for the Study of Instruction in 1969, and barriers to this goal are considered--the system, the instructional program, the teachers, the students, and school finance. The humanistic school calls for greater community involvement and political decentralization in spite of the problems involved. The curriculum should be reformed to develop the full range of human capacities, with evaluation  which is designed to improve instruction rather than compare children. School organization should free the children and teacher to focus on learning, not the clock. Differentiated staffing should free teachers from administrative and housekeeping tasks and enable them to be more fully professional. Teacher education also needs to be reformed. The problems facing students includes cultural and ethnic differences, the wide variations between the states in educational expenditure, and the individual differences in learning styles. The report calls for a nationwide dialogue at all levels of the profession to prepare a set of principles and plans for action. (MBM)",

Taking selected definitions from previously published work, categories were built which classify verbal moves. Using the categories, models of verbal interaction were built which subsumed such verbal interaction concepts as the venture, move, cycle, and module, defined in other research studies. These models served to define clearly interaction terms like lecture, teacher-centered discussion, and student-centered discussion. When coupled with the Classroom Observational Record developed by Reynolds, Abraham, and Nelson, these paradigms become powerful tools for conceptualizing and researching classroom interaction.

The three subsequent chapters contain brief, concise descriptions of 10-12 techniques in each of these categories. Examples are 1) \"real-life\"--paid work experience, family membership, club activities, field trips; 2) \"simulations\"--role playing, games, inquiry training, laboratory experiments, in-basket, discussion; 3) \"abstractions from reality\"--lecture, recitation, programed  instruction, computer assisted instruction, drill, examinations.

The program is concentrated in the ghetto areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. There are six major goals: 1) to provide a variety of supportive services; 2) to develop greater teacher competence; 3) to decrease staff turnover; 4) to help teachers develop a more effective methodology; 5) to provide an improved learning situation; and 6) to develop a more sensitive and high-developed response to urban ghetto classroom situations. Data collected from teachers in the program were compared with data from  non-participants in similar situations. The results showed that on measures reflecting job satisfaction STINT teachers were clearly superior to their non-STINT counterparts. However, this superiority was not found on measures reflecting skill development. It was felt that one year did not give sufficient time to achieve both goals, and consequently further studies of both groups were recommended. The unpublished instruments used in the evaluation are included in the document. (MBM)",

Training methods tested were 1) group inservice training with no feedback, 2) inservice training with feedback from observational data, and 3) inservice training with feedback from videotapes. Twenty female elementary school teachers were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Pre and post measures of pupil \"time-on-task\" behavior were made for two pupils identified by the teacher as \"problem students\" and for the class as a whole, using an author-developed behavior check list. Another author-developed observation instrument was used to make pre and post measures of teachers' classroom management techniques.  Results indicated that each of the three training methods effected significant improvement in problem pupil behavior in comparison with the control group, although there were no differences in effectiveness of the three methods. All three methods were also found to increase the incidence of positive teacher behavior toward the class. It is concluded that improvement in pupil behavior can be effected through more economical teacher training procedures which do not require feedback.

Second, the field of educational research needs improved ways of combating the obsolescence of its workers. The formal, organized training program for senior research workers may fill an important part of this need.

Assessments were made at the end of microteaching by a panel of graduate assistants using the Illinois Teacher Performance Appraisal Scale, and at the end of student teaching by pupils using the Illinois Teacher Evaluation Questionnaire. Significant differences at the completion of microteaching favored peer teaching, but microteaching with high school pupils was associated with superior performance at the end of student teaching.

An important activity in the field experience, which is described in detail, is a one-week camping trip to the Four  Corners area of the Southwest, with daily visits to Bureau of Indian Affairs and community schools, hiking, camping, and discussions. Other field experience activities include a 5-week live-in experience in an inner-city neighborhood, at least one-half of each day for a 5-week period working with inner-city children as a teacher-assistant, active participation in the work of public and private agencies in the community, and seminars coordinated with both types of field experience to provide a basis for the solutions to the sociological, psychological, and educational problems encountered.

American students go to England from June 1 until mid-July, while British students come to the United States from September 1 until mid-October. Features of the program are 1) direct involvement and participation of students in elementary schools in the host countries; 2) opportunities for crosscultural understanding through the &quot;host family&quot; plan and visitation program; 3) participation of graduate students as &quot;overseas assistants&quot;; 4) cooperative fiscal investments of local schools and the university without outside funding. The program began in  1968 with 13 students participating from each college. It has been offered continually since that time with the number of students growing to 30 per year.

The goal of the program is to produce research \"statesmen\" able to ask significant questions and obtain information leading to better learning experiences. In  addition to extensive statistics, research design, measurement, evaluation, computer language, psychological and societal foundations, there are inter-disciplinary programs in urbanology; demographic analysis; social science methodologies; systems approaches in education; management principles; and a cross section of elementary education including reading, early childhood, child guidance, exceptional children, etc. A guided internship of one year is in the urban school systems or other agencies such as Model Cities. The present continuing evaluation will be supplemented by an extensive follow-up in subsequent years. (Author/MBM)",

The project was designed to improve teacher education programs by making research an integral part of the work, assisting the five institutions in recognizing research as a proper function, developing their potential in this area, and strengthening their teacher education programs through research findings. Research activities included inter-institutional, intra-institutional, and individual efforts and were encouraged by providing released time, secretarial assistance, and materials and supplies. Although very little attention had been given to research  prior to this project, the results were extremely gratifying. Thirty-nine research projects (listed in the appendix) were carried out during the 3-year period, with nearly all the faculty members in professional education involved. Special efforts are being made to make research an integral part of the total academic program and to spell out the purposes and goals in teacher education in terms of behavioral objectives. Each institution has a research committee which emphasizes and coordinates research activity. Since Georgia Southern had an established graduate program at the beginning of the project, it probably benefited more than the other institutions. (MBM)",

A survey of the literature was conducted, a nationwide survey made, and data collected from the six institutions currently operating such programs. Responses indicated that little or no private foundation support exists, all programs being federally funded. The techniques employed are questionnaire surveys of program directors, field interviews and observations of programs, and documentary analysis of research proposals and reports, all of which are reported in detail. Results indicate that there is a dire need for governmental support and funding  of undergraduate research training programs, since most programs were terminated when federal funds were depleted. Program directors currently operating such programs were enthusiastic; they had good ideas and plans for present and future programs. The six programs currently in existence cannot possibly supply all the paraprofessional and preprofessional educational researchers who will be needed in the next ten years.

At a time when the concern is for clinical experience in a school setting where teacher excellence is measured in terms of competency, we are faced with the problem of assignment and supervision. The school, with its concern for alternatives to meet individual differences, is seeking a greater role in teacher education. Assignment of student teachers to one class, setting, and teacher often results in prescriptions for teaching rather than decision making. College-school teacher training centers are being formed in many areas to provide a setting where  all personnel are studying teaching. Two levels of administrative models are described--a college-school center and the Center for the Educational Professions which can house a number of college-school centers. The experimental model presented in this paper is a micro center providing an administrative structure which will respond to the concern for realistic laboratory settings and coordinated clinical experiences sessions. It is a presentation in secondary science. The Center for the Educational Professions is an administrative model responding as the cement for college-school ventures. (Author/MBM)",

        "description":"This study tested the hypothesis that preservice elementary education majors given an operational definition of stated performance objectives in the form of assessment items demonstrate higher acquisition rate with respect to the described behaviors than those students not given the operational definition. The study population was two groups of students registered in a mathematics methods course. Eight weeks of instruction followed a pretest. Group A was provided with behavioral objectives before the class began and assessment items after every session. Group B was given only the objectives. A test composed of criterion items was administered to each group at the end of the second 8-week course. The scores were analyzed and significant differences were observed at the .05 level  between the groups. Group A had gained significantly more of the stated behaviors. The study indicates that there is an advantage when the learners are given an operational definition of the objective in the form of assessment items. It would seem that both curriculum developers and instructors should provide the learner with such a definition at the end of every instructional sequence. The assessment should provide a careful matching with the stated objectives. Further questions are whether there is as great an advantage if the assessment items are given only on alternate occasions or on one occasion in three. (Author/MBM)",

The subjects were 150 eighth-grade high school students in Knoxville, Tennessee, and six teachers with several years experience. Three behavioral categories were established: appropriate, relevant, and inappropriate. Six graduate students served as observers and for each class three target and three non-target students were observed daily. The results show that contingent teacher praise and/or attention was effective in controlling  behavior. Teacher praise or attention to relevant behavior in combination with ignoring disruptive behaviors increased relevant behavior and concomitantly reduced inappropriate behaviors. Non-contingent praise increased the percentage of relevant behavior for target subjects but not to the extent of contingent praise. A closer examination of the data reveals that there were individual subject differences, and generalizations about the rapidity or amount of changes in classroom behavior occurring within a specified time period are tenuous. The implication of the study is that a teacher can modify and influence the behavior of his students if he can control his own behavior. (Author/MBM)",

It attempts to express as enthusiastically as possible why schools must change, what changes must be made, and how they might best be accomplished by teachers, administrators, school boards, and parents in every state in America to eliminate obsolete and inferior programs. Although more than 63 innovations are briefly described, no attempt is made to provide a detailed blueprint for change, as the actual procedures vary from school to school and can easily be learned by creative staff members. The main body of the book is organized into chapters built around eight steps which can be followed in changing a school and illustrations are given for  implementing change in each of the six components of a school. Eleven appendixes provide supplementary statements and suggestions about change: 1) summary; 2) outsiders' view of Wilson School, Mankato State College; 3) an example of how to start; 4) using teacher aides; 5) some educators to know; 6) schools to discuss; 7) a list of some of the organized groups supporting change in education; 8) interesting curriculum projects; 9) a bibliography on change; 10) currently needed literature on topics which are constantly requested; and 11) a series of supplementary statements about the Wilson School Program in April 1970.

The staff consists of a coordinator of the semester, five methods professors, and three resource teachers. The feedback obtained strongly supports the program. The interns feel much better prepared to enter the classroom, the methods professors have reacted positively to the school-university cooperation, and the resource teachers have also reacted positively.

One of the key components was the Personal Development Seminar, designed to help students understand themselves and the university and to increase their potential for success. Approximately 900 freshmen participate in the seminars each semester, with 35-40 professors. In earlier research with about 40 students experiencing academic difficulty, the pilot groups greatly improved their academic records. When matched with three other groups  not in the project, they earned twice as many A's and B's and half as many D's and F's as their counterparts during a one-semester period, and their attitudes seemed to become increasingly positive. Utilizing experience gained from the project, the School of Education is experimenting with the seminar for each of the 1800 freshmen enrolled in the Orientation to Public Education course. A university academic success committee has been established, a 2-week, three-credit workshop is held in August for incoming probationary students, and a student cooperative learning center has been established by some of the original project students.

Building from materials in sensitivity training, traditional human relations programs, and behavioral psychology, the program provides a systematic, graduated set of human relations exercises which facilitate personal growth while avoiding invasion of personal privacy. Behavioral objectives have been established and tested in five hierarchical modules. Trainees first demonstrate their ability to engage in the specific behavior, then practice it or use it in their daily life, and finally teach some aspect of  the module they have just learned in the university laboratory school. The model provides teachers with an important bridge between personal experience and public practice. A variety of programed texts, audiotape and videotape instructional programs, and individual and group procedures are utilized to impart the concepts of this program. Teachers who have achieved all the behavioral objectives of the program are ready to serve as peer teachers and work as course assistants during ensuing terms. Evaluation of the program in workshops presented in other parts of the country suggests the feasibility of such a program in teacher education. (Author/MBM)",

Emphasizing integration rather than differentiation, the program merges and interrelates the campus courses, field experiences, and organizing ideas which are usually separated in traditional programs. College faculty, elementary school personnel, college senior teaching fellows, and other professionals work together as instructional teams. The college and the cooperating schools are beginning to function in genuine partnership. All participants, including the students, are involved in a continuous interaction between theoretical and practical learning. Throughout their 4 years of  college, students' active participation in the elementary classroom as aides, consultants, and teachers allows them to increase their understanding of children, develop teaching skills, and test new ideas, and enables them to make better and earlier career decisions. The cooperating schools also benefit because classroom teachers are introduced to new methods and materials and are invited to attend and conduct special workshops. They also have an unusual opportunity to influence the preparation of future teachers. Evaluation of the program indicates that it is viewed as unusually successful by faculty and students at the college and in the schools. (Author/MBM)",

Information in each study includes investigator, date, population, time, tests used, and significant and non-significant results. The studies are divided into four categories according to the type of behavior investigated: 1) affective variables, 2) teacher cognitive behaviors, 3) flexibility and variety, and 4) amount of teacher-student interaction. In the first category, consistent positive trends were noted for use of student ideas, indirectness, and indirect/direct ratios, and a consistent negative trend for criticism. There are too few studies in the second category for any  generalizations, but in the third category, variation in activities was positively related to student achievement. In the fourth category, there were consistently positive but non-significant correlations between teacher talk and student achievement.

        "description":"The traditional educational structure requires the teacher to be part bookkeeper, part clerical assistant, and part psychologist, among other roles, while his salary scale is based on length of service. Differentiated staffing offers ways of changing this pattern. The details of differentiated duties are largely a matter of local option and available resources, and local priorities and criteria must be established. Three interesting questions are 1) What are we now doing within our school program, whether we recognize it or not, that makes use of different kinds of skill, responsibility, and reward? 2) What responsibilities have been established in other fields that could be recognized as worth initiating in education? and 3) What responsibilities or skills might be identified or  generated or created as education seeks new structures, new patterns, new roles, perhaps even new purposes? Many potential models can grow from modifying the present staffing model with help provided by clerks, proctors, and technical, teaching and research assistants. Clerical services could be expanded or elaborated, and the use of team teaching could be increased. Students could be used as a systematic and constructive teaching resource. Other models could group students in platoons, each with its own leader, or use \"village fair,\"\"bread man,\"\"road show,\" or \"assembly line\" techniques. Community resources could also be more widely used. (MBM)",

Work specialization and the way in which it relates to instructional improvement are discussed. Another section deals with personal orientation to teaching, ranging from extreme task orientation to extreme people orientation, and a model is proposed which would provide a balance between these extremes. The relationship between commitment and  performance is also considered, as well as ways of improving team decision making.

        "description":"This study was conducted primarily to provide feedback to the professional staff about the student strike of May 1970 and its implications for the student teaching program. It examined the following questions: 1) What general factors were considered important in making a career decision brought about by social unrest? 2) What was the rationale on which the decisions were based? 3) What was the nature of the conflict experiences in arriving at the decision? The subjects were in the last month of their student teaching field experience at the time of the strike and 101 of the 151 involved responded to the questionnaire. Responses showed little evidence that the subjects acted in accordance with the values of the new culture. All but three continued their teaching and the group  generally was guided by occupational success motives and the punitive nature of their supervisors. The sample was clearly oriented toward job security, much like those who now make up the teaching group in America. The study shows that the \"system\" is not very receptive to the neophyte who wants to take an unpopular position based on his values. Recommendations are 1) the establishment of a student teaching committee to develop programs reflecting the concerns of all participants; 2) the development of an internship program where the student is responsible solely to the school system; 3) the creation of a contractual agreement specifying the student teacher's responsibilities; and 4) the continuation of situations providing role conflict as a learning experience.

Specifically, the purpose was to determine the relationship between 1) teachers' verbal cues to students and teachers' prophecies, 2) teachers' verbal cues to students and student achievement, and 3) teachers' prophecies and student achievement. The reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test was used to obtain pretest scores on students in an Adult Basic Education center. Four groups of experimental and control subjects with equal numbers of high and low scores were used, but the four randomly assigned teachers were led to expect high achievement only from the experimental subjects. The Flanders observation schedule was used to record verbal cue data over a  period of 10 weeks. Results revealed significant relationships between prophecies and verbal cues and between prophecies and achievement, but not between verbal cues and achievement. The outcomes suggested that a teacher may use more indirect influence with students for whom he holds high expectations, thereby encouraging the student to participate and increasing his freedom of action. Suggestions for further research included a study designed to simultaneously examine and assess the relative inputs and effects of the several most probable modes of bias communication. (MBM)",

The second program's objective was to improve the effectiveness of teachers in motivating, engaging, and fostering the achievement of students from  low income areas. The projects were 1) educational community organization; 2) teacher training--standard English as a second dialect; 3) developing problem-solving skills through students teaching students; 4) teacher training programs for disadvantaged schools; and 5) the impact of educational technology. The objective of the third program was to define, analyze, and develop means for promoting heuristic teaching and learning. Its projects were 1) training studies; 2) microteaching and intern data bank; 3) uncertainty studies; 4) personal competencies; and 5) reinforcement or achievement behaviors in disadvantaged children.

The procedure used for the sorting on the major independent variable--cooperating teacher effectiveness--was to interview the student teacher at the beginning, middle, and end of his student teaching experience. The sample consisted of 50 student teachers from the University of Utah, with cooperating teachers from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. Statistical analysis consisted of one-way analysis of variance, a few t tests, several factor analyses, and a correlation analysis. The data did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that careful selection  of cooperating teachers definitely pays dividends. Considering the severe limitations of the sample, the dissonant nature of the literature, and the methodology used in this study, further research is indicated, preferably conducted with random assignment to groups combined with pre- and post-testing.

Twenty-six unified school districts in California with enrollments of from 10,000 to 30,000 were used. A questionnaire mailed to all superintendents and board members contained 50 teacher role statements dealing with personal relations, policy development, salaries and negotiations, personnel processes, and curriculum and instruction, with a second section  requesting biographical data from each respondent. Eighty-five percent of the superintendents and 60 percent of the board members returned the questionnaire. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test and the Mann-Whitney U Test were used in analyzing the data. The findings indicated that 1) Superintendents' and board members' expectations for the role of the teacher are in moderate agreement. 2) Their perceptions of teacher role behavior are in strong agreement. 3) Superintendents' expectations for and perceptions of the teacher role are in strong disagreement. 4) Board members' expectations for and perceptions of the teacher role are in strong disagreement.

The central theme is the role of the organized profession in educational change. In the final analysis it is the students, the teachers, and the parents all working together who will make the difference. It is they who will make education an exciting and alive process, and without whom the theories and proposals, however important, mean nothing. \"On Staying Awake\" stresses the importance of inquiry as the fundamental principle of learning and the need for the teacher to retain a sense of awe at the ability of the human mind. \"Putting First Things Last\" deals with the tendency to  confuse social engineering with education and points to the danger of practice without theory. \"In Search of a New Bird\" asks for a new symbol of American education to replace the parrot and for freedom from the rigidities of the present educational structure. \"How Much Does Gray Matter?\" is a plea for more humanity and imagination, both in the school environment and in the curriculum content. \"Entrances and Exits\" touches in some of the issues and challenges facing the schools in the 70's.

Direct behaviors constituted 56 percent of the behaviors of the second-grade teachers and 46 percent of the fifth-grade teachers. Describing was the most common teacher verbal behavior. Soliciting behaviors accounted for 33 percent of the second-grade behaviors and 26 percent of the fifth-grade behaviors. Results  of analysis of variance showed several significant differences between grade levels. Fifth-grade pupils asked more substantive questions, and fifth-grade teachers reacted to pupils' responses by approval more than did second-grade teachers. Also, second-grade teachers had a higher teacher talk/total talk ratio. A comparison of results with those of a similar study in the eighth and eleventh grades indicated that the proportion of direct teaching behaviors is very stable across grade levels. (RT)",

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether instructional behavior learned during a series of simulated teaching experiences using peers as students would transfer to a setting in which \"real\" pupils were students. Subjects were 44 undergraduate students in the secondary education program at the University of Texas at Austin. Each teacher presented a series of lessons with peers serving as students for the simulated teaching and one lesson with sixth, seventh, and eighth grade pupils as students. Four lessons were rated and coded--the first lesson, the lesson immediately preceding that using \"real\" students, the real pupils lesson, and the lesson immediately following that using \"real\" pupils. Ratings were made of the four teaching dimensions--determining  readiness, clarifying objectives, motivating, and evaluating. Results indicated some behavior change during the period of simulated teaching with peers and provided some evidence that instructional behavior acquired during simulated teaching with peers will transfer to a simulated setting using actual pupils. It cannot be concluded that these results would be obtained in other settings, such as the classrooms in which these teachers will eventually be placed. The results suggest that when peers are used as students in simulated teaching, attempts should be made to occasionally use actual pupils in the simulated teaching experience. (MBM)",

The paper reviews the present state of the art and speculates on the steps necessary to implement personalization on a wide-spread basis in the nation's schools and colleges. The paper closes with a request for continued, if not increased, support of the program, not only at the Texas Center but also wherever research and development activities are conducted that might further its  implementation.

        "description":"This report is the first completed study from a larger project called Teacher Aides in a Secondary School. Pupils in 55 seventh-grade public school classes completed the Pupil Observation Survey Report (POSR) twice--once to describe their student teacher and once to describe the regular (cooperating-supervising) teacher. All teachers involved were female. Analyses of variance of the six factor dimensions of the POSR indicated that the student teachers were seen as more friendly, cheerful, lively, interesting, and directive, but as less poised, knowledgeable, and firmly controlling than their supervisors. The difference in general evaluation of the two groups was not significant. Correlations between the POSR scores of the student teachers and their supervisors were significant  only for the factors called Non-Directive (r=.57) and Firm Control (r-.29). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the regular teachers \"set\" the classroom atmosphere and activity structure before the student teacher arrives on the scene to handle the class by herself. The findings are relevant to any research employing pupil evaluation of teacher behavior and support the validity of the POSR as a specific tool for such measurement. (Author)",

Teachers must be trained to cope with these new directions. A program for the education of science teachers is proposed which would combine formal training with increased interaction between faculty and students. Students selected would have had a variety of experiences, including a degree of personal failure to increase their understanding of their pupils' insecurities. The first 2 years would be a personal and exploration period, beginning with a battery of psychological and cognitive tests. During the first year the student would take three college courses,  work in a tutorial program, and work in three blue collar jobs. The second year would include either three or six additional college courses, three white collar jobs, and work with children of various ages. At the end of this year a decision would be made on the student's future career. The third and fourth years would include science and methods courses and work in a team as teaching assistants. In the fifth year, the student-faculty team would be responsible for the total program for a group of high school students. Every 5 years the team would return to the campus for further studies.

Factors of sex, grade level taught, school district, years of teaching experience, and academic preparation in science were examined for significance. The sample of 110 elementary teachers from six school districts were participants in an inservice teacher education program prior to teaching Science-A Process Approach. Student achievement, which was used as an index of teaching success, was assessed by administering the AAS Competency Measure at the  conclusion of each exercise. A minimum of six exercises was taught by each teacher. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the variables of sex, grade level, school district, years of experience, and hours of science accounted for 45 percent of the variance in the student achievement score. Of these, sex, grade level, and years of teaching experience made significant independent contributions to predicting teacher success. (Author)",

A passage was presented to hundreds of students in grades 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Fifty papers were chosen from each grade; these papers were equally representative of students with low, middle, and high scores on standardized achievement or ability tests. Students were told to study the passage and re-write it in a better way without omitting any information. What every student did to every one of the sentences he was told to re-write was tabulated. The results of this effort are discussed in detail. The writing skills of adults were also  examined; conclusions concerning their level of language maturity are discussed. (CK)",

The evaluation procedure consists of various achievement tests, and extensive attitude questionnaire, student interviews, and a method of classroom observation with which the kind and degree of student participation in the classes are measured. Results of the evaluation show that: (1) the Trenton faculty is more experienced and shows greater involvement in professional activities; (2) the Trenton program is elective, whereas the programs of the controls are essentially standard and required;  (3) the Trenton curriculum document is more extensively developed than are those of the controls; (4) the Trenton students respond to materials and problems on their own initiative more frequently than do the students in the control schools, and they also respond to each other more often; (5) there are no great differences in achievement among the schools on standardized tests, but it appears that the Trenton students learned many things that are not measurable by traditional achievement tests; their attitudes were considerabley more positive than those of the control students.

Concurrent to enrolling in his regular methods course, the communication (speech) education major enrolls for four credit hours of independent study; this study is a &quot;course&quot; for  the intern program. Student evaluation of the program takes place in individual conferences with the departmental faculty and in group discussions during the methods course. The responsibilities of the student intern are established by the supervising teacher and the departmental faculty in terms of the student's perceived competency and needs. The students are required to keep daily diaries of their intern activities, and these are submitted to their advisors at the end of the term. The supervising teachers evaluate intern performance.

The first part reports an experimental study undertaken to determine attitudes of some educators toward Black English. Caucasian and Negro teachers were administered a Language Attitude Scale to determine their attitudes toward the following: (1) the structure of Black English, (2) the consequences of using (or not using) and accepting (or rejecting) Black English, (3) the importance of Black English to the speakers of it, and (4) the cognitive and intellectual abilities of speakers of Black English. Results show that language attitudes vary both racially and on educational levels. Part II of this presentation takes a closer  look at these attitudes. Educators concerned with the problems of the disadvantaged have, in recent years, encountered an increasing amount of failure in trying to carry out what they see as their basic task. This failure is related to a faulty understanding of the use of language and of the attitudes toward language use. Two views toward Black English may be identified: (1) an older view based on a deficit model in which the dialect is considered inferior, (2) a more recent view based on a difference model which accepts the premise that all dialects possess internal validity. It is concluded that the educational establishment must come to view Black English as another dialect of English. (CK)",

In the area of speech-communication, this approach focuses on measurement of linguistic competence, and then training in language acquisition. Since mass education proceeds from an assumed common experiential base, the lexicon of children from the majority culture is not a compilation of words that children from other cultures need to learn so much as they are labels for experiences which these other children have not had and must acquire. A language acquisition approach is based on the  speaker-is-valid model of communication which results in a focus on cognitions and language processes. The described multisensory approach is based on the system-is-valid communication model, and this results in a focus on experiences and communication outcomes. (Author)",

A synthesis of some recent research and theory offers a new perspective from which to analyze the problem and to propose some solutions to it. It suggests that the composing process can be analyzed into its component skills and that these skills can be taught according to known principles of learning. A statement or a communication will result when the composing process is finished. Composition means the act of putting together in coherent relationship. Composing has a perceptual, conceptual and an expressive dimension. These three dimensions tend to be cyclical. A model shows the steps in the process of composing. The first line of steps in the model has a strong perceptual base. Once a focus,  however broad, has been selected, progress is dependent upon the individual's ability to perceive ever finer discriminations and associations. Almost simultaneously with the development of perception, a parallel conceptual development must occur. In view of the model presented above, composing is not being taught. Focus on the completed whole has led to ignoring the prerequisite processes. However, if teachers can be led to create appropriate perceptual and conceptual learning situations, it may become possible for composition to be taught. (CK)",

Students who have acquired the basic skills forge ahead on their own. If they don't know the basic skills, there's no guarantee that they'll be learned if taught. One study shows college students to be antagonistic toward the work they were doing, and this resulted in little or no skill acquirement. Yet, evidence shows that all high school students don't read with proficiency. Students should acquire reading skills through self-paced instruction, working only with those skills lacking. Packaged learning materials are useful for this purpose. A student is pretested until skills needed are identified. He then selects from suggested materials and  activities in a learning package those which fit his unique style of learning. Behavioral objectives guide him as he learns. When he has achieved all the objectives in the package, he may proceed to the next skill. Reading skills necessary for high school students include: decoding, interpreting, and applying. For best possible results, teachers should teach indirectly. Students report liking school better when the teacher accepts student responses, asks questions, and is encouraging. In short, a curriculum change is needed in high school reading programs. (CK)",

There has not, however, been an attempt to relate children's knowledge of vocabulary to their teachers' use of vocabulary. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the vocabulary used by teachers and the proportion of that vocabulary known by the children in their classrooms. Eight kindergarten and eight first grade teachers from seven schools in a north-central Florida community volunteered to participate in the study. Language samples were tape recorded for each of the teachers during their normal working day. The samples were used to construct word lists and children were then tested for their knowledge of words from these lists. Congruence scores were derived  on the basis of words particular teachers used and the percentage of those words their children knew. The high frequency words used by teachers are on the Thorndike-Lorge list. The independent variable contributing most to differences in congruence scores was socio-economic background. The recommendation was made that no efforts towards replication of the study be made because the time required seemed excessive for the results obtained. The word lists resulting from this study appear to be sufficiently reliable that they can serve as a base for subsequent testing of children. (Author)",

After the formulation of statements of competencies to serve as conceptual bases for the formulation of test items, items were constructed for 12 subtests. Four subtests were selected for programming. The test was programmed sequentially for the IBM 1500 Instructional System. The students' score for each subtest was the number of items actually answered correctly plus the number of items for which a correct answer was assumed. The computerized test was administered to 32 undergraduate music education students. A parallel conventional version of the test was given to 28  other students, and a comparative analysis was made. The tests were not shown to be equivalent. Quantitative inadequacies may be explained by the discrepancies between estimated orders of item difficulty and the true orders of item difficulty for the particular students tested. From a qualitative standpoint, the computerized test performs adequately. With refinement, it could provide a convenient, rapid assessment of students in regard to certain expected nonperformance musical competencies. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The effect of a structured program of musical training on the musical abilities of preschool children from disadvantaged environments was investigated. It was hypothesized that, if the musical abilities of such children could be improved sufficiently, they might then be able to enter elementary school on a level commensurate with that of their more fortunate peers. The project was conducted in three phases: pretest, instruction, and posttest. During the pretest phase, each child was given an individual musical concept performance test to determine his initial level of musical ability. The disadvantaged children were also given an individual Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. Four groups of children were employed: two advantaged and two disadvantaged. One of the advantaged and one  of the disadvantaged groups served as control groups, and the other two were exposed to a 20-lesson series of musical concept instruction. After the training phase, the same test as used in the pretesting phase was employed for posttesting. A two factor A x B design was employed for the analysis of the simple, main, and interaction effects. Marching, clapping, and rhythm echo games were effective techniques for teaching rhythm concepts. The results suggest that such a structured program effectively raises the level of musical ability of both disadvantaged and advantaged children. (Author/CK)",

The instrument, consisting of 40 items, asks the testee to repeat a spoken word, then to repeat it again without certain specified phonemic elements--such as a beginning, ending or medially-positioned sound. Seven categories of item difficulty were proposed. Test results varied, both within and between class groups. Performance tended to improve with age and grade placement. Pearson Product Moment Correlations of individual AAT scores with Stanford Achievement Test reading scores yielded significant relationships (p &lt;.01) ranging from .53 (grade 1) to .84 (grade 3). Analysis of errors supported the validity of test item difficulty and provided direction for the  design of a treatment approach to auditory perceptual dysfunction. (Author)",

Two special cases of this general method are discussed separately. One is when there are errors in equations but no errors in variables. The other is when there are errors in variables but no errors in equations. The methods are applied and illustrated using artificial, economic and  psychological data. (Author)",

In practice these inventories are &quot;non-specific&quot; type criterion-referenced measures. This first aspect of the project involved the comparison of three educational programs, the IDS &quot;enrichment&quot; program, a Head Start program, and regular New York City Board of Education programs. Sample populations were randomly drawn from preschool, kindergarten, and first grade classes. Six instruments developed for this purpose by the ECIP staff were employed in the gathering of data. Preliminary analysis of the pretest data appeared to indicate that such enrichment programs produce  significant positive effects in the educational development of young inner-city, low socio-economic status Negro children from New York City. The data showed a general trend for children in the IDS enrichment program to obtain higher scores on these measures than the Head Start group who in turn, obtained higher scores than children in the regular New York City Board of Education program. Appendices include: A list of thirteen sub-tests and the possible range of scores; score sheet; tables of means, standard deviations, and standard errors of the means squared; and a summary table of critical ratio levels of significance for group differences.

The Attitude to School Questionnaire (ASQ) is designed to measure first graders' attitudes toward school. ASQ is a group-administered, paper and pencil, nonverbal, paced test. The child listens to a description of a situation while looking at a series of drawings depicting the situation. He then reacts by selecting an appropriate face--happy, neutral, or unhappy. Separate forms, with appropriate drawings, are available for boys and girls. No special training or equipment is needed to administer the test. Administration is in two sessions, each of about 20-25 minutes. The teacher's script for administering the questionnaire is included as a manual of  instructions. No psychometric data is reported. See ED 043 919 for a survey of the literature concerning the relationship between attitudes and achievement in the elementary school; the conclusions derived therefrom which led to the development of the ASQ; an account of the field testing of earlier forms; a discussion of the factor analysis, which yielded eight first-order factors--attitude toward school, schoolwork, non-threatening authority, authority, show and tell, peers and play, mathematics, and reading; and suggestions for further revision and research on the ASQ.

Initial teacher ratings of pupils in grade 3 and subsequently in grade 6, were contrasted to scores obtained on the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT). It was found that a teacher's rating does not provide the same information about the pupil's level of achievement as do the MAT scores. Although a relationship between the two measures was found, the degree of relationship depended upon what areas the teachers had rated. An examination of the data revealed a consistent pattern in the relationship between various subsections of the Teacher Rating Questionnaire and the MAT, the discrepancy scores, and the I.Q. scores. Teacher ratings of performance were  much more closely related to these measures than were their ratings of pupil adjustment and creativity. Despite differences among teachers and among classes, as well as the development in the pupils' characteristics from grade 3 to grade 6, there was a reasonable level of agreement among teachers' ratings of student performance. The data supports the conclusion that teachers' ratings of academic achievement are an important and dependable adjunct to the use of standardized achievement tests. The development of the instrument is described briefly and copies of two versions are appended. (Author/AG)",

Thirty-three subjects with high State anxiety but average or low Trait anxiety were selected. Each student was counseled from seven to eleven times during a five-week period by advanced graduate students. Each student was randomly assigned to one of four groups, i.e. client-centered, rational-emotive, desensitization, or no-treatment control Counselor training sequences were designed for each of the three therapeutic approaches. Criterion measures were pre and post administrations  of the STAI; psychogalvanic skin response (GSR) measures; and heart rate (HR) response measures. There were no significant differences between the four groups in the STAI; but significant differences at &lt;.05 level were found in the predicted direction between group treatments and controls on criteria of GSR and HR. Post hoc analyses disclosed significance for the desensitization treatment group on GSR, and the rational-emotive treatment group on heart rate.

        "description":"The effectiveness of demonstration centers in education as a means of inducing school personnel to adopt new modes of behavior (methodology) and/or new materials (curriculum) is evaluated. Data was collected through the use of an observation schedule, two questionnaires, and a structured interview. Demonstration varies in effectiveness depending on the criterion of success. Results show: 1) A vast majority (80%) of visitors to a center say they would like to implement activities they have observed, 2) A limited number (30%) actually try something new in their class or school as a result of the visit, 3) 10% of teachers in the target schools attribute substantial help in the development of their programs to demonstration center personnel (and not to the visit itself), 4) 2% of the  districts adopt demonstrated programs in total. The viewers are inclined instead to adopt parts rather than the entire demonstration activity. The implications of this evaluation report are extensive for those educators who intend to use the concept of demonstration as a means of disseminating innovations. (Author/GS)",

Of the four procedures using indices that order the variables with respect to contribution to discrimination, the (forward) stepwise procedure yielded the best results. Of the two schemes involving dimensional analysis, that which uses correlations of scores on variables with high maximum likelihood factor loadings against discriminant scores appeared more attractive.

The intent was not to produce a final or complete solution to the problem, but rather to suggest a procedure which would provide partial closure. Alternative methods, including various types of linkage systems, as well as inductive and deductive approaches, were examined. From this examination, a process was developed which combined theoretical-deduction and empirical-induction with a procedure which had its derivation in symbolic interactionist theory and methodology. The resulting combination, referred to as \"Indigenous, Interactional Research,\" was designed to maximize interaction between the researcher and a practitioner in analyzing  educational experiences. In a field test of this process, groups of adult learners were videotaped in: (a) individualized programmed instruction, (b) group process instruction, and (c) a combination of the two. Inductive and deductive interactional analysis of the taped data resulted in the generation of decision and conclusion oriented hypotheses. Such a methodology can generate indigenous hypotheses and theories relevant to the improvement of both educational research and practice. (Author/DG)",

Based on an item analysis, 153 items were selected to form the first version of the questionnaire. Extensive validity and reliability studies were conducted and three revisions were made on the basis of further item analyses. The questionnaire was administered to eighth, ninth, and eleventh graders to obtain standardization information. The present and final form consists of two 30-item parallel forms, matched for  content and psychometric properties. The items cover a wide range of preferences from social participation to risk taking and change activities, and are grouped into four content categories labeled self, classes, adults, and jobs. Results of different studies confirm the validity and reliability of the instrument. They also indicate that the questionnaire has high discriminating power among individuals in the suburban schools, but less so in urban schools. (LR)",

Phase II was designed to provide patterns of student performance on each of the ten educational goals, reconfirm hypotheses concerning the relationships between pupil achievements and school and community variables, and, based on these relationships, provide regression weights for use in subsequent  phases, and establish the adequacy of the measuring instruments. Phase III is characterized by four analysis and reporting procedures: prediction of expected school means, comparison of school means, comparison of student distributions, and evaluation of student responses to key items.

        "description":"A significant role of the testing specialist can be to assist teachers in becoming better testmakers and users. The first step in improving teachers' assessment instruments and techniques is to try to get them to become articulate about their objectives and to state them in concrete behavioral terms. Then the teacher needs to examine his own test exercises to see if they encompass a realistic range of transfer of learning and reflect the educational goals of the course or program. The specialist must help the teacher find a middle ground where this transferability is tested at several points over a range of generalization and application within the broadly defined boundaries of the subject area. Finally, the specialist can give suggestions on item writing and editing. In the area  of test use, the problem is to bring both the skeptics and the unqualified acceptors into a unity of tempered and qualified acceptance. Perhaps the most important service that could be performed is to get every test user to take a good hard look at the test, the test manual, and the test norms. The specialist should try to develop in teachers an attitude of watchful skepticism toward all assessments of pupils from whatever source. (DG)",

PLAN, which has been in operation in twelve selected school districts in California and in the northeastern U.S. since 1966, focuses on assisting the individual to learn about educational, occupational, avocational, and social roles and activities, and to plan his development to utilize his potentialities in ways maximally satisfying to him. PLAN includes instruction in language arts, social studies, science, and mathematics as well as the student-centered individual development program. PLAN is considered in terms of: (1) specific educational objectives, (2) learning methods and materials, (3)  evaluation, (4) guidance and individual planning, (5) teacher development, and (6) computer services. Use of PLAN in an elementary school in California during the 1967-70 academic year and individual evaluation of the program by the teachers involved in it are noted. It is concluded that the availability of such a comprehensive system for individualized instruction does not ensure its effectiveness in the classroom but remains a function of the interaction between student, teacher, and administrator.

The data is collected and reported at the item level. Each exercise was developed with emphasis on content validity, and is geared to sample a specific objective within a subject area. A striking feature of the first National Assessment report is that there are no scores or norms with which to compare results. Instead the individual exercises with the percent choosing or producing each response (p-values), both correct and incorrect, are given. This technique allows the reader to evaluate results and draw inferences for himself rather than  just review an average or summary. Also, by looking at the P-values of wrong responses, considerable light may be shed on commonly held misconceptions. Generalizations discussed are based on exercises from the subject areas of Science and Citizenship, with only partial National Assessment results available for the latter, and are drawn by looking at the exercises as a total set of exercises, not as a total score. They are not to be construed as representing the National Assessment's viewpoint, as the selection of these generalizations, rather than others that might be drawn from the data, is a personal one.

These strategies for mastery learning and testing can benefit the student who experiences test anxiety. Suggestions for the construction of mastery tests include defining the objectives to be measured, items written to sample the content and  behavior domains of those objectives, average item difficulty ranging from 85% or higher, and absolute performance interpretation.

A preliminary version of an experimental scale, designed to determine the existence and extent of alienation manifested by in-school adolescents, was developed in a pilot study. The experimental instrument consisted of forty-seven forced-choice items written to reflect Seeman's five dimensions of alienation: normlessness, meaninglessness, powerlessness, self-estrangement, and social isolation. Seventy-five lower division college students completed the pilot version, and for validity and reliability purposes, also completed the Rotter I-E Scale. Then, adolescent groups from five ethnic backgrounds were  studied by means of their responses to a demographic questionnaire and the revised experimental instrument. Variables suggested by the literature as relevant were sex, age, number of hours of weekly employment, grade-point-average, socioeconomic status, transiency and stability of family, parental approval of friends, solidarity with peers, and marital status of parents. Hypotheses involved relationships between these demographic variables and scores on the measure. Eleven hypotheses, related to the variables, findings relevant to them, and supporting statistical data are given. Mixed findings indicate the need for further exploration of the differences between groups with regard to such items as: number of hours of work outside of school, socio-economic status, and family stability.

        "description":"A procedure for scoring multiple-choice tests by assigning different weights to every option of a test item is investigated. The weighting method used was based on that proposed by Davis, which involves taking the upper and lower 27% of a sample, according to some criterion measure, and using the percentages of these groups marking an item option to obtain the weight for that option. These percentages were then used to enter a weighting table to derive the appropriate option weight. Weights assigned to one item need not be similar to those of another item; an incorrect response to a difficult question may carry more weight than the correct response to an easier question. Weights for scoring the Iowa Algebra Aptitude Test were determined by computer by the use of achievement tests  and the IAAT itself given to two groups of ninth grade algebra and two groups of ninth grade modern mathematics students. Correlations between the pairs of weights were used as measure of the reliability of the choice weights. The data suggests that more than 1,000 examinees would be required to provide reliable scoring weights for the distracters in this test. The cross-validation of the weights indicates a limited increase in both predictive validity and reliability. It is suggested that the main utility of the technique may be to increase reliability where greater reliability of measurement is needed. (DG)",

One experimental treatment evolved from role-theory and emphasized perceptual awareness and the ability to put oneself in the place of another; the other emphasized training in Piagetian operations such as conservation and spatial perspective. A third control treatment of traditional kindergarten activities was assessed. The major dependent variable was an attitude preference test requiring the children to choose among pictures of black and white people and to apply a positive or negative adjective to the pictures. Subjects were also administered six Piagetian developmental tasks. Results  indicate that kindergarten children possess marked, measurable, racial preferences and the significantly reduced racial attitude scores resulting from both role-playing and Piagetian training suggest the feasibility of educational intervention.

Female self-esteem tends to be higher than that  of males. Blacks have less esteem for and tend to identify less with father, teacher, and friends than do whites. The teacher has relatively low esteem for and lack of identification with all subgroups. Black students show greater individuation and less social interest than whites. An abasement-succorance-aggression need pattern is observed at the 3 higher grade levels for all subgroups. Detailed findings, including means, standard deviations, black/white comparisons, and male/female comparisons on all the scales of all the instruments, are provided.

The concepts identified in this manner fell into three major categories: Geographic Region, Man and Society, and Map and Globe Study. Ten concepts were randomly selected from each category for inclusion in rests of concept attainment. Each of the selected concepts was analyzed to determine its constituent teachable elements. The analysis of a concept formed the basis for writing items to test its attainment. Analyses of all selected concepts and illustrative examples of test items are presented in the paper. (Author)",

This report comes out of such a context. Properties of measures and models of social mobility are analyzed in relation to the conceptualization of mobility. Two main objectives of mobility research are identified. One is the study of determinants of occupational achievement; the other is the study of mobility as a characteristic of social systems. It is shown that the realization of both objectives is hindered by a failure of commonly used models and measures of mobility to separate out the various individual and  structural factors responsible for mobility.

        "description":"This study analyzes data collected in the summer of 1970. Fifty-seven groups, composed of two white and two black junior high school boys, were filmed as they participated in a cooperative task. Observers scored task-related interaction and socio-emotional behavior from video tapes of each group. Attitudes and perceptions of one another and of the task of the subjects (Ss) were obtained from interviews with Ss. The study focused on the assertive member of each group to investigate if the race of the assertive affected group members' reactions toward him and his behavior in the group. The investigator predicted that black assertives would not be as well liked nor as highly evaluated as white assertives; and that white subjects would direct more negative behavior toward black  assertives than toward white assertives. The hypotheses, however, were not confirmed by the results. The study nevertheless suggests that more cooperative tasks should be used in situations where interpersonal relations are important. In integrated classrooms, a curriculum including cooperative tasks might increase the possibility of interracial harmony.

It is suggested that new procedures which would improve the chances for further education of needy and deserving students be explored. Equal access to higher education will move toward a new reality with adequate funds from federal, state, and private resources and with the introduction of responsibility in the high school.

This is not considered a scientific report, but a guide to group discussion. Although the model presented is based on the most advanced findings from interaction in teaching and the systems approach in communication, there is not an attempt here to declare it as the final answer to problems in this area. The human relations model is presented as a flow-chart which indicates the phases through which a bi-racial group passes to reach a tensionless condition conducive to a consideration of delicate race problems. A face-to-face commitment of a few people to work together is a first essential. The  acknowledgement of equal human status and a concession by each component that it is unaware of concepts held by the other are the next two stages. Then, a consideration of displeasing words, an exposure of some beliefs, and a recognition that reception and direction must cross racial lines will complete the approach to a condition of psychological neutrality in which there would be little potential difference between ethnic components of the group. The atmosphere thus generated will permit in-depth consideration of all desegregation problems. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"This booklet describes the program in Harlem (PS 133) which is based upon Dr. Caleb Gattegno's reading and mathematics in color. The program was primarily intended to test the teaching of Gattegno's methods and materials. PS 133 was considered to be a good site for the program because it was stable, pedagogically traditional, and staffed by a large number of experienced teachers and a principal who was known to be a dedicated, competent administrator. In Gattegno's reading program, color is used only for the purpose of introducing words, and once sounds are mastered, color is discarded. The use of color simulates a phonetic language. All groups of letters with the identical sound are represented by the same color. Thus the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;so,&quot;&quot;know,&quot; and &quot;though&quot; belong to the same  group. In the mathematics program, Gattegno used the colored rods of Georges Cuisenaire in order to represent basic mathematical operations as well as fractions. Gattegno claims that students move rapidly from the use of the rods to abstraction and mental computation in order to derive answers to problems. The evaluation of the program used data from the Metropolitan Achievement Test scores; the results tended to indicate general improvement in reading and mathematics among the experimental group.

The combination of malnutrition and the other negative effects of poverty perpetuates a cycle of illness, educational failure, and more poverty. If the aim of compensatory education is to break this cycle, then it is imperative that social scientists and educators become aware of the negative impact of malnutrition on the development of the child. Perhaps most specific to education is the demonstration of delayed neurointegrative development in children who have grown poorly because of malnutrition. Inadequacies of intersensory development can place the child at the risk  of failing to establish an ordinary normal background of conditioning in his pre-school years, and at the risk of failing to profit from educational experience in the school years. Measures to insure the \"equal creation\" of each child are urgently needed. (Author/JM)",

By September 1969, the total number was 46,552, i.e. 30,140 Cuban refugee pupils, and 16,412 from countries in South and Central America, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. From 10.5 percent of total school membership in 1965, the number reported by the schools increased to 13.5 percent in 1967 and 19.1 percent in 1969. An analysis of Attendance Department records reveals that much of the increase in the Spanish-speaking segment of the school population has been the result of improved reporting by the schools from year to year and the use of a more specific definition of \"Spanish-speaking\" pupils in the 1969 survey. Nevertheless, there has been considerable growth. Special instructional programs have  grown in response to their unique educational needs. Almost 20 percent are participating in classes in English as a second language; almost one-third are participating in a program designed to maintain or develop the language skills in their native language. This year some 90 schools are offering one or both of these programs. (Author/JM)",

Regularities in these transformations are conceptualized as follows: groups differ in their definitions of social problems according to self-interest, ideology, and social values. For a social problem to become a public issue, a complex political process develops around the activities of the media, officialdom and private interest groups. Similarly, conflicts arise among official authorities, underdog partisans, privileged partisans, policy planners, etc. as to how to respond to the problem. Various strategies for handling the conflicts are seen as  generating significant political outcomes for the parties concerned and for the policy process.

The author's search uncovers an enormous amount of wasted research effort and a concurrent lack of investigations of significant issues. As a result, he recommends: (l) a shift in emphasis from accumulation to integration in data collection; (2) implementing this shift through an overhaul of our system of higher education ;  (3) new applications of theories and techniques aimed at coping with information overload such as that which exists in psychological gerontology; and (4) a reformulated model of man, based on his dialectic, developmental interdependence with the changing society. In essence, the author feels that higher educational competitiveness has resulted in information overloads which support one or another fragmented models of man and society. (Author/TL)",

Begun in 1960, only the 5 year follow-up data is currently available. As part of the overall project, an exploratory study is in progress to examine factors which might influence the development of ideal or desired family size preferences and, after marriage, the onset of childbearing and the spacing of children. Early findings tend to support generally-held ideas about these factors. Girls who marry early and have more children by 5 years after high school tend to: (1) to be less intelligent; (2) come from lower socioeconomic status homes; (3) date and go steady more often; (4) have parents with lower levels of education; and (5) expect to marry earlier and obtain less  education that those who marry later. Overall, the correlation coefficients are low, suggesting the inadequacy of utilizing psychological and social factors for understanding what determines a girl's age at marriage as well as the size of her family.

The first report discusses the steps involved in empirically determining whether a desirable, cross-cultural problem-solving behavior exists and focuses on the conceptual formulation and some reliability and validity findings from a first-stage study. The second paper traces the refinement of coping theory from an early formulation, which grossly dichotomized coping behavior into active and passive, through the most recent formulation in which 20 factorially distinct dimensions are discriminated. The final paper  points up the problems involved in comparing coping styles across social class.

Thirty-two 4 man task groups composed of military academy cadets were run in the experiment. In accordance with the Contingency Model, leaders were selected and assigned to groups on the basis of a measure of leadership style. Groups were assigned to one of 8 task situations specified by the manipulation of the variables of leader acceptance, task structure, and leader power. Measures were made of group task productivity, group atmosphere, and leader behavior. Results on measures of group productivity give extremely strong support for the validity of the Contingency Model.  Measures of leader behavior help to illuminate the processes which result in the differential effectiveness of varying leadership styles across situations. (Author)",

The 2nd was designed to permit evaluation of the effects of expectations for benefit and diverse observational styles exhibited by observer subjects. Results included: (1) experimentals achieved a substantial and highly significant decrease in reported test anxiety; the control group increased slightly in anxiety; (2) neither vicarious nor direct treatment, group or individual, or  any combination of these treatments produced differential change; and (3) observation of desensitization, using either live or videotaped stimuli, appears to offer an economical and efficient method of treating test anxiety in the school setting.

It was found that there were some readily identifiable friendship groups, and that they were more homogeneous than diverse, there were many isolates who received no choices at all; there were few cross-sex or cross-grade-level friendship choices; and choices within the Home Groups showed great differences from the choices made in the school at large.  There were few cross-race choices. Students in some of the clear-cut friendship groups frequently lacked information about others, had negative feelings towards them, and spoke of groups not identifiable in the sociometric in terms of stereotypic language. Particular efforts were made to minimize differences amongst the individuals within their own groups. (KS)",

Utilization of this innovation has been coined as the \"teacher-advisor concept.\" The central consideration of this proposal is to view student orientation as the primary goal and subject orientation as the secondary goal (i.e., teachers must realize that the student as an individual is more important than \"covering the course\"). If a friendly and concerned (or interested) relationship can be developed between each student and one of his teachers (whom we label a \"teacher-advisor\"), then many of the student's concerns can be handled without directly involving a counsellor. Any situations which the teacher-advisor  feels he cannot comfortably or adequately handle could then be referred to a counsellor. The mechanics of the teacher-advisor model (and some modifications of it) are discussed with particular emphasis on pitfalls to watch for, complications which may arise and the kinds of provisions necessary for flexibility and change.

Data analyses are carried out to determine possible relationships between varying patterns of relative deprivation (as measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Striving Scale) and passive, active or combative types of participation. The findings show that not all patterns of relative deprivation are associated with participation. For example, aspirational deprivation (defined as a gap between achievement and ideal life situation) is associated with participation only when defined in group terms, while progressive deprivation (defined as the perception of substantial past progress but little or no future progress) is not associated with any of the participation indices. The  strongest relationship between participation and the various patterns of relative deprivation occurs with the combative index. It is concluded that, because many factors must be considered in analyzing mass movements (e.g., extent of participation), a typology of activities should be constructed. (Author/TL)",

In addition, most rarely or never report intelligence test results in terms of specific numbers or give to those involved the same amount of information they would give professional colleagues, either in written or verbal form.

During treatment customers entering a grocery store were handed a circular which urged them to buy drinks in returnable bottles (i.e., prompting); after making a purchase, customers were given social approval if they purchased drinks in returnable bottles (i.e., reinforcement). The ABA design indicated that beverage buying behavior at one grocery store was markedly influenced by the treatment procedure; for 2 other markets, treatment effects were not pronounced. An explanation for the differential success of the prompting-reinforcement method is discussed. (Author)",

Explicit definitions of the phenomenon are lacking; implicit definitions are ambiguous and hard to extract. To offer an empirically tested operational definition of \"generation gap\" and analyze its relationship to several independent social variables, a questionnaire was given to the freshman and junior classes of each of 4 high schools in the midwest, and on the west and east coasts. Using as the definition of generation gap \"index of identification with Adult Authority Figures\" (i.e., parents, teachers, administrators, policemen), considerable variation was found. A steady increase in adult identification was found with increase in socioeconomic status. Success in school, as  measured by grades, and identification with certain traditional middle-class ideals, for example gratification deferral, could also be used to predict adult identification. Religion was also a factor--Jews proved most likely to identify with adult authorities, and unchurched and Liberal Protestants, least likely. Age and sex, however, made no appreciable difference in identification with adult authorities. (KS)",

This report represents the first phase of that project, and deals with the demographic and psychological characteristics of drug users, patterns of drug usage, attitudes toward drug issues, perceived effects of usage, and changes in usage over time. As a result of survey responses by 3,010 students at Carnegie-Mellon University (1968), 6 types of users were identified and described: straight students (n=189); drinkers (n=424); heavy up (n=112) and down (n=98) users; marihuana tasters (n=98) and users (n=134). While drug use was clearly not a universal happening among those surveyed, there were strong and consistent relationships  between characteristics of users and the nature and amount of their drug use. Personality data suggests that some people possess a predisposition to drug use. The authors urge society to examine its role in contributing to the creation of problems with which students sometimes cope by using drugs. Appended are copies of survey materials. (Author/CJ)",

Each of the 120 First Grade children in the study had an older sibling in Third Grade; equal samples of 30 sibling pairs were drawn from the population of boys with older sisters, boys with older brothers, girls with older sisters, and girls with older brothers. For half of these children, the older sib served as the teacher of his or her younger sib; the remaining half were re-paired so that the older child taught an unrelated First Grade child. The older child was trained in the concept and taught it to the younger child in a 10-minute session. Male learners scored higher on the trapezoid concept attainment test than female  learners; learners scored higher when taught by a female sib than when taught by a male sib or by a female nonsib. Girls teaching their sibs used a deductive teaching method more than other groups. Learners with higher concept attainment scores also showed greater awareness of relevant attributes of the concept. Results have implications for the selection of older children for use in school tutoring programs. (Author)",

Half of the families had no father in the home. Data were gathered by personal interviews with 846 children from 3 geographic areas, rural West Virginia, rurban towns in Upstate New York, and urban center-city Syracuse. Results from partitioning of variance technique supported a differentiated interactive model. Family factors not only predicted differences in achievement, but modified the self concept and school attitudes which, in turn, were related to differences in achievement between siblings. Support was  found for a theory of countervailing forces. Urban children needed a strong, strict mother and warm teachers. Rural children needed separation from home, and schools which rewarded creativity and enforced less conformity. Rurban children needed a non-hostile home, intellectual challenge and affiliation with social norms. Peer relationships were negative except in the rural area. (Author)",

One hundred and nineteen 6th-grade students were assigned randomly to 6 treatment levels. The Ss in 4 levels read booklets which described principles of creative thinking techniques, and which presented examples and exercises. One group read a control booklet, while another read no booklet. All Ss then completed 3 creativity tests and an attitude inventory. Hypotheses predicted differences among treatment levels as a function of the playfulness or organizational emphasis of the various techniques. The more playful techniques (e.g., Personal Analogy) were expected to produce higher scores on measures of Flexibility, Originality, and Best Ideas. The  more organized techniques (e.g., Part Changing) were expected to produce higher scores on Fluency. No treatment differences were found, however, for any of the dependent measures, nor were there differences in the Treatment x Sex or Treatment x School interactions. Covariate (IQ &amp; Language scores) adjustments increased some treatment effects while decreasing their relatively large standard errors. (Author)",

Using a post-test only design, students in classes which daily used cooperative groups for the entire academic year were compared with comparable students from classes which used the lecture-discussion method. As to student norms, the cooperative groups students experience more peer pressure for involvement, and they assign greater importance to their peers' expectations. The climate in the cooperative groups classes is perceived as being less \"relaxed.\" The cooperative groups students, however, do appear to be less \"alienated\" from the class. The cooperative groups students interact more frequently with their classmates, although this  does not generalize to outside the class. They also view themselves as having lower levels of interpersonal competence. If a student filled a leadership position in the cooperative groups treatment he was much more likely to be affected by the treatment. The implications of the findings are explored for both the theory and practice of cooperative groups in the classroom. (Author)",

The model philosophy rests on the premise that special supportive services in the regular classroom can serve adequately those children with minor learning problems. The model consists of an achievement development class in which the learning disabled child is maintained in the regular classroom  but is taught by a precision teacher, or special education teacher, who has received special training. Two aspects of the model emphasized are that the need to request psychological services for purposes of classifying the child are reduced since the child refers himself through his lack of academic progress, and that the child receives help from a specialist who is part of the school staff and the regular school program. Briefly explained are the model's organizational, training, and educational objectives. (CB)",

        "description":"The experimental program in structured activities in perceptual training was said to have two main objectives: to train children in retention of visual and auditory images and to increase the children's motivation to learn. Eight boys and girls participated in the program for two hours daily for a 10-week period. The age range was 7.0 to 12.10 years, and the IQ range was 63 to 113. All members of the group were functionally unable to read from the Oral Reading Survey Test taken from the \"Reader's Digest.\" The program exposed the children to multiple experiences that allowed them to retain both visual and auditory abstract word forms. Instructional materials and approaches used were various games, filmstrips, story telling, athletics, work sheets, records, perceptual learning  aids, pictures for discussion, tactile and kinesthetic aids, and experience charts. The children were taught as a group, except for two weekly 30-minute sessions with each individual. A significant part of the experiment was thought to be the formulation of a global clue pattern that aided both recognition and recall. The first 52 words taught were those words to which the children had been exposed. An additional 48 words were words of comparison, and the last 50 words were the most common nouns used. A pretest posttest design indicated that the program was successful. (CB)",

It was found in all classroom levels, from early childhood education to junior high school, that the IPPI-AID motivated the children to increase both quality and variety of their vocalizations. Teacher and student response was enthusiastic. Classroom materials derived from pre-planned speech/language lessons were more effective than expressions developed from spontaneous language activities. Spoken expressions using mostly voiced speech sounds, and permitting prolonged  phonations in stressed syllables and words, produced the clearest oscilloscope traces and most discernible rhythm and intonation patterns. Corrective individual instruction during group classroom use was not effective, indicating the need for separate individual instruction for selected children experiencing difficulty learning intensity, rhythm, or intonation aspects of spoken language. Occasional equipment malfunctions indicated the need for a constant availability of engineering assistance for periodic checks, adjustments and redesign of certain parts of the equipment. (Author)",

Public elementary and secondary school expenditures were related to income per capita and enrollment through a log-linear model. An equation was developed to predict expenditures for the years 1975, 1979, and 1985 for various population projections. Several curves were developed to give some indication of money which might be available for media-technology as a function of the pupil-teacher ratio. For 1975, it was predicted, from 3 to 6 billion dollars might be expected to be available for  pupil-teacher ratios of 25 and 30 respectively. For 1985 there was considerably more spread in the various projections. The overall results of the study indicate that sizable funds might be available for media-technology in the time frame under consideration. It was noted however that further study and the effect of some court rulings which question the use of property taxes as the primary base for educational support may alter these predictions. (JY)",

The perfection of inexpensive videotape recorders/players (VTR) and inexpensive tapes and cameras could remedy the problem. A package consisting of 10 mobile VTR's and television sets, a tape library, and several TV cameras per school of 50 rooms and proportionate equipment for schools of other sizes would cost only about $5 per student per year. If an active head-end at each school transmits the ITV programs by cable to the classroom it would cost about $33 per student per year. The cost of school ITV could be lowered by a dedicated school district cable system--a 40 channel cable to each school  and thence to each classroom. The Federal Communications Commission sponsored 4-channel fixed service would provide less flexibility and would be slightly more costly for approximately equal service to classrooms. Although satellite distribution has been proposed for ITV in the United States, a lack of knowledge of the cost of satellites and satellite reception equipment makes it difficult to reliably estimate costs. Satellite distribution, however, should become increasingly possible in the future. (JY)",

Trade-offs between remote time sharing and remote batch process were explored as were trade-offs between on-campus minicomputers and shared centralized facilities. 2) An analysis was made of the various aspects of computer communications including the nature of communication terminals and the facilities for data-communications. 3) The use of communications satellites was examined for providing telecommunications for computer applications, with the emphasis on high-powered satellite systems involving small,  interactive earth-terminals. The report concludes that what is needed to satisfy computing requirements is relatively high-power dedicated educational satellites capable of operation with a large number of small earth terminals.

        "description":"In order to provide high school students with general problem-solving skills, two LOGO computer-assisted instruction units were developed--one on the methods and strategies for solution and a second on the relation between formal and informal representations of problems. In both cases specific problem contexts were used to give definition and articulation to central notions like problem, problem form, solution method, and optimal strategy. The unit on strategies in problem solving illustrates strategy formation in two contexts--extrapolating number sequences and exploring mazes. The unit on story problems in algebra attempts to help students learn to convert a story problem into formal mathematical terms.

The microfiche contained representative slides taken from the class lectures. Subjects, who were 136 college students enrolled in the course, were divided into three groups: Group One was assigned to view the microfiche, Group Two was given the option of viewing the microfiche, and Group Three (the control) was not allowed to view the microfiche. While significant differences between treatment and control groups were not found in the original study, there were significant differences between Groups One and Two (treatment) and Group Three on a one-hour examination during the course. However, differences were only marginally  significant on the final examination. There was no correlation between amount of time spent on microfiche and achievement. The findings were considered biased in two ways: subjects in the experimental group had more practice, and not all of the subjects in the treatment groups used the visuals. (SH)",

The committee report consists of the conclusions reached by 12 behavioral scientists after a review of 40 original research reports and of previously available literature on the effects of televised violence on the tendency of children toward aggressive behavior. The committee considered two major sources of evidence on effects of viewing violence and aggression on TV: evidence from experimental studies, and evidence from surveys. The two sets of findings were found to converge in three respects: \"a preliminary and tentative indication of a  causal relation between viewing violence on TV and aggressive behavior; an indication that any such causal relation operates only on some children (who are predisposed to be aggressive); and an indication that it operates only in some environmental contexts.\" The committee also identified areas for future research.

This paper describes SYSTEM-3 and considers some of its applications: individualized instruction and education, special information and inquiry centers, two-way files generated by the user population, public distribution of materials, interactive entertainment to increase  involvement, creative interaction and experimentation, provision of computer access to the individual citizen, polling, and interactive advertising. Following the discussion of applications, the receiver-terminal and the interconnection of SYSTEM-3 centers to form a network are described in greater detail, and a final section considers the organizational, regulatory, and technological activities which must be undertaken for SYSTEM-3 to be realized.

The one three-hour meeting per week schedule maintained by this program didn't produce the quality of course that resulted from on-campus instruction by the same individuals on a two- or three-meeting per week basis. To remedy this problem a study was made to determine the feasibility of employing standard telephone circuits and telelecture/electrowriter components so that both oral and visual information could be presented at remote classrooms several times a week. A variety of arrangements in terms of meeting times, course types, instructors, etc., were used. The response of the students and instructors  to this type of teaching technique was sampled by both questionnaires and individual contacts. In general, although off-campus students performed as well as on-campus students taking the same course, the students much preferred the face-to-face contact type of course. The material that must be presented visually in a graduate course seemed to be too much for the electrowriter to handle with ease. On the basis of students' comments, several suggestions were made for improving the remote courses. (JY)",

The equipment needed to begin a program in school is fairly expensive--$1400-1600--but worth it in view of the mechanical skills which students learn, the creative development of students, and the communication understanding which results. Aside from the possibilities of using videotape within one school, its use as an  important link to inform and consolidate varied and separated schools of what each is doing could also be valuable.

Two other long term goals were identified: to promote a national concern for educational change and to design a system which would be effective and self-supporting. The first part of this report describes short term goals, such as analyzing existing communications systems, defining various public audiences, ascertaining which communication devices work best with a particular audience, and developing methods for optimum collaboration with other agencies. The next section discusses developmental projects designed to provide empirical evidence. The major communications media are  described in an approach consisting of five steps: identity existing communication systems, evaluate them, identify important target audiences, determine their weaknesses, and identify major communication gaps. As a prelude to the formulation of a plan for the Coalition, existing communication failures are analyzed from the point of view of the community and of the professionals. The last sections present derived theoretical constructs, goals for the Coalition, and an organization of these goals into clusters of discrete activities. (SH)",

The content of such study could include cognitive material, such as the social role of music in various cultures, the history of music, the visual identification of instruments, and perhaps notational skills; performance skills, dealing with unfamiliar metric organizations, scale resources, or notational schemes; and development of aural perceptional ability. Preparation of software materials first requires specifying objectives, writing the program, and testing its effectiveness. Experts must be encouraged to prepare these materials and teachers must be encouraged to use them. Although we cannot expect programed instruction to accomplish more than the instructional  objectives we list, it can supplement the teacher in four important ways: as an outside source of information, as a diagnostic tool, as a remedial aid, and as further stimulation for the precocious student. Through programed instruction, our students will no longer be limited to understanding music of their own culture. Instead, they will be polymusical. (JK)",

        "description":"The hypothesis that first and second graders can improve reading skills by learning to type on electric typewriters was tested in this study. Other purposes of the research were to develop linguistic comprehension in Standard English, to produce introductory reading materials which promote phonic understanding as they fix typing-key strokes, and to use pattern practice and key-stroking exercises to develop finger dexterity and rhythm. Subjects, 15 children identified as having difficulty in learning to read, participated in the eight-week program for two hours daily, five days a week. The mean class gain of .96 of a grade level on the Survey of Primary Reading Development indicates that a significant amount of reading improvement takes place as a child learns touch typing. Other  results suggest that the children showed progress in vocabulary development and linguistic comprehension, a mastery of the alphabet and the correct phonic associations, and development of good finger dexterity. Uncontrolled variables such as low teacher-pupil ratio and Hawthorne effect might have favored reading improvement, although there were a host of uncontrolled negative variables which as easily could have been unfavorable to improvement.

In the experiment, students were found to confuse similar words which had been presented together in instruction (e.g. &quot;memor&quot;--mindful of, and &quot;memini&quot;--to remember), often disregarding grammatical considerations in the process. Consequently, the author proposes that programed learning material not present similar concepts, nor a rule and its exceptions, at the same time, lest they be confounded. Furthermore, he finds presenting examples of a rule before stating the rule preferable to the opposite sequence. Among the advantages of programed instruction that are  discussed are its use as homework (thereby saving class periods for other work,) its saving of time, and its self-motivating nature. The author warns that programed instruction must use material based on modern principles of the psychology of learning and not rely on outdated concepts. This done, however, he claims, presenting evidence from a three-year course, that students will make rapid and thorough progress through the major Latin works. (RS)",

The questions to be considered are: (1) What verbal intelligence, i.e. ability to hear and reproduce sounds, do the students possess? (2) How effective are language laboratories? (3) Should texts be used when beginning instruction? (4) Is grammatical analysis useful? (5) Can the native language help target-language learning? (6) Of what use are word-and mistake-frequency counts? (7) What are typical student problems? (8) What is the mistake tolerance of target-language speakers? (9) What need has the  student for the targer language?, and (10) How worthwhile are Swedish texts on German instruction? The model submits several grammatical structures to the following instructional procedures: language laboratory work, reading selections, grammatical analysis, vocabulary explanation, listening drills, programed material, written exercises, and a combination of methods. Disgnostic tests of grammatical mastery, listening skills, and word knowledge are then given. In addition, students receive a questionnaire asking them to state preference of method.

A team consists of two to seven teachers, the most experienced being leader. He must analyze the strengths of the group and plan the syllabus accordingly, inviting guest instructors to fill gaps in their fund of knowledge. Student grouping may be parallel (all at the same level) or vertical (less and more and enrichment in small groups. A team effort may also be administered in separate classes, each teacher agreeing to organize instruction around a central theme. Whatever the method, the principal advantages of team teaching are saving of time, minimizing of preparation, and unification of student experience.  Individualized instruction is best applied through \"Learning Activity Packets\" (LAPs). Each student has a specific goal, the mastery of which can be demonstrated concretely. Grading is based on the number of packets completed. A set of \"horizontal\" packets, or enrichment material, supplements the linear progression of \"vertical\" packets, lest bright students work too far ahead. Packets are also available for remedial and diagnostic purposes. (RS)",

Consequently, practice precedes analysis for the primary-level native learner. The child learns by demonstration what a sentence is and is then taught five parts of speech according to function: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, and particle. Color-coding of these elements helps him create sentences using substitution drills, while the designation of the second and last word positions as verb slots ensures proper German sentence construction. Complex sentences are formed by joining successive simple sentences with connecting words. Speakers of German dialects learn the written language, including regular and predictable transformations, in the same way; irregular  differences, however, must be taught individually by means of practice drills. Learners of German as a foreign language also follow this program, except that grammatical analysis may be introduced as an instructional aid for older students. References are included. (RS)",

The primary focus is on vowels; consonants are considered when they are involved in relevant phonetic environments. Tense and lax vowels, and diphthongs are discussed in terms of their appearance in a particular environment. A phonological matrix illustrates the diaphonemes used in the dialect. Some generative rules for pronunciation are provided along with examples, and references are included. (VM)",

Based on a daily twenty-minute period, the following routine is used: (1) a 4-5 minute review of old material; (2) a 1-2 minute transposition to: (3) a 4-5 minute presentation of new material; (4) a 4-5 minute application of this material, including student indentification of orally- presented sentences as correct or incorrect and multiple-choice worksheets; and (5) a 3-4 minute reinforcement and enrichment through songs, dialogues, and  enactments. Similar routines are followed in the fourth grade, but reading in a children's text and worksheets requiring noun and verb inflection are introduced. Fifth-grade instruction adds simple writing exercises from dictation or memory, occasional homework exercises, and oral and written tests. Systematic study of grammar is reserved for later grades. Examples of worksheets and a list of twenty topics for teaching units are provided. (RS)",

The ability to learn a second, third, or fourth language depends on what Chomsky calls \"the language acquisition device,\" which is a capacity or a sensitivity formed by a combination of linguistic universals (phonologic, syntactic, and semantic, or the interrelations between these components). This sensitivity to linguistic universals permits a child of up to 12 years of age to learn several languages easily and quickly, provided that language exposure is direct and with regularity. Adults lose this facility after they have internalized the grammar of their own language. To learn a new language, an adult must become  aware of linguistic universals. As the adult becomes more conscious of linguistic universals in learning the new language, language learning becomes easier. The mental state appropriate to learning languages, that is, linguistic sensitivity, becomes more effective as the student learns other languages. (VM)",

The study of these influences is conducted according to recently developed sociolinguistic principles which state that various social dialects in the United States are not differentiated from each other by discrete sets of features but by variations in the frequency with which certain features occur. The author examines two phonological variables in Puerto Rican English and discusses the linguistic processes at work in the variations and the influences of contact with the dialects mentioned above. The author devises rules  accounting for various constraints in the variations. The discussion of the variables helps to isolate several sociolinguistic principles concerning such concepts as vestigal interference, convergent processes, and assimilation variants. A case of grammatical variation is also considered in relation to the influencing dialects. A bibliography is included. (VM)",

The questionnaires solicit information from students in grades five through eight concerning personal data, students' contact with English, amount of English used, parental attitudes, and student attitude toward learning English. The shortcomings of Puerto Rico's standardized English curriculum may result from inappropriate teaching methods rather than from a negative attitude on the part of the students. The students may be receiving too much language material in too little time without reinforcing what is learned in class through  use outside of class. English might be better taught as a foreign language. English and Spanish versions of the questionnaires are provided along with graphs illustrating the results of this survey. (VM)",

        "description":"This carefully prepared document contains seven chapters: Women at Harvard: the Present Situation in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Career Patterns and Academic Commitment, Women on the Faculty, Women in the Graduate School, A Note on Undergraduate Life, University Services, and a Summary of Proposals. Several of the sources for this work include: open hearings, detailed inquiries to department chairmen, interviews with faculty women, questionnaires to past and present graduate students and several University offices. The first chapter details the past and current standing of women faculty and students at Harvard. The absence of women on the faculty, their concentration in off-ladder positions, and their general feelings of isolation are the three most notable areas of  concern. For women graduate students, although the statistics show a pattern of equitable treatment, the questionnaires reveal women students do encounter prejudice. Chapter two explores career patterns in terms of both social roles and institutional structure. Chapters three and four specify explicit recommendations for reforms relating to faculty and graduate students. Chapter five explores the implications the Committee's work should have on undergraduate education. Day care and health care are the major focal points in Chapter six. Chapter seven contains a summary of 24 proposals that evolved from the Committee's work. Supporting data appear in the appendices. (LR)",

        "description":"In answer to the problem of coordinating college and university curricula with a changing society and to meet demands of students, elected officials, and community members, Minnesota Metropolitan State College has been created with features suited to serve as a pilot project for the development of the new careers concept. The 4 broad areas involved in this program are health care, human services, business systems, and environmental control. Major features of the college are: it will be an institution that focuses on the needs of the city; there will be no formal campus; degrees will be competence-based; it will be in continual operation; and it primarily will be an upper-level college, admitting adults with 2 years of college or the equivalent in occupational training. When  proposed to the Minnesota State College System, this plan met with overwhelming enthusiasm. While this program will undoubtedly meet with criticism from outside, it represents an attitude that welcomes change from traditional institutional patterns; that promises a commitment to explore new approaches; and that seeks to meet the needs that have not been generally met by existing college curricula.

Four sets of questions regarding the advantages of dentistry, the disadvantages of dentistry, the characteristics of the dental profession, and the characteristics of a good dentist were issued to the dental students 3 times in a year and once to their professors. By comparing student median response categories with the faculty median, the extent of professionalism of the students was obtained. The results show that student opinion coincided with faculty belief on only one question in the set dealing with the advantages of dentistry. For the set dealing with the  disadvantages, however, student and faculty response were in total agreement as was the result of the set of questions regarding the characteristics of the dental profession. The final set of questions about the characteristics of a good dentist found the students and faculty to be in almost total agreement. From these results, it would appear that the significant factors involved in the acquisition of beliefs about the profession are related to experiences prior to entrance into dental school.

Specifically, a learning model is presented with the intent that principles and procedures derived from it be directly applicable to learning in the college classroom. The model presented is derived from 2 orientation to the phenomena of learning: the theory of operant conditioning, primarily characterized by B. F. Skinner; and social learning theory, based on J. B. Rotter's conceptions. The operant position is summarized first from a laboratory orientation; then suggestions and research on its applicability to the college classroom are reviewed. Difficulties apparent in the application of the operant model to a complex situation are noted; it is suggested that the social  learning model is reviewed with this intention. Finally, suggestions for testing the appropriateness and utility of the proposed integrated model are made. (Author)",
