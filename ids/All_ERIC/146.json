        "description":"This study investigated student points of view in their ratings of specific courses and instructors by analyzing student responses within each of three classes separately, and then sought to generalize the results further by additional analyses, with 300 students randomly selected from 402 classes in five colleges. Different points of view were found for student ratings of course examinations, textbooks and supplementary readings, and class discussions. These various points of view were moderately related to such student characteristics as grades and sex, although not in all three of the classes studied. This last point underscores the importance of the context (i.e., the particular course) in understanding or interpreting the meaning of student ratings. (Author)",

The population chosen for study is the 2- and 4-year colleges in the Southeastern region of the United States. The specific objectives of the survey were to determine the extent and frequency with which management concepts and techniques have been adopted within 2- and 4-year colleges. Universities were excluded because of their larger organizational structure and the difficulties of specifying how the adoption of managerial concepts influences activities and functions at the college level. An effort was made to determine the extent to which managerial concepts were regarded as important in the current administration of the  college, the familiarity of administrators and key faculty members with such concepts, and the kinds of sources of information used in the administration of the college. An effort was also made to identify conditions and factors that shaped or influenced the adoption of new techniques in academic administration. (Author)",

        "author":["Weidman, John C."],
        "description":"This study is a secondary analysis of data from recent surveys of faculty and students in 89 American colleges and universities. It explores undergraduate socialization in academic departments, focusing on the impacts of student and faculty norms concerning the desirability of liberal vs. vocational education as outcomes of college, and primary social interaction among faculty and students. Covariance analysis is used to investigate five values similar to those in the Cornell Values Study. The findings indicate that departmental faculty contact is more consistently influential than peer ties, having similar, positive effects for both sexes on three of the five values--helping others, creativity, career eminence. This suggests lower salience of peer influences in departments  relative to other college settings. Educational norms, while not as important as primary interaction, are more influential for men than for women. When the joint effects of norms and social relationships are examined, faculty contact continues to be the most influential variable, regardless of norms. Only for women's creativity orientations is the strong influence of faculty contact reduced by peer ties, regardless of those peers' norms. Findings are interpreted with respect to differential styles by sex of organizational behavior and their implications for undergraduate socialization. (Author)",

In Federal elections nationwide they have been given the right to vote. In about one-half of the states in the nation they have been enfranchised as legal adults. The full implications of this change of status for this age group have yet to be realized in society or in institutions of higher education. Some of the possible ramifications resulting from this change of status are examined in this paper and some suggestions are offered for adjusting to this change by colleges and universities.

        "author":["Lawrence, Ben"],
        "description":"The growth and optimism that characterized higher education in the 1950's and 1960's have given way abruptly to a projected future of stabilization and uncertainty. This paper addresses the most important of postsecondary education's problems that may be affected by financing arrangements and offers some suggestions for their alleviation. In brief, the author recommends the following financing policies: (1) Low tuition at public institutions should be maintained in recognition of collective societal benefits and of social obligations to individuals and groups. (2) If increased revenue must be obtained from students and their families, tuition at public upper-division and graduate levels should increase slightly. (3) State and local governments should continue to be primarily  responsible for the basic institutional capability to offer a variety of postsecondary educational programs and services to meet the needs of their chtizens. (4) State and local support of institutions should be linked closely, but not exclusively, to student enrollments as a means to encourage institutions to respond rapidly to student need. The author then continues to discuss federal responsibilities in relation to financing, and philanthropic and institutional responsibilities. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"College of pharmacy enrollments in the final 3-years of the curriculum continued to increase as they reached a new high of 20,830 students. These data reflect the fall 1973 pharmacy student population in the 72 continental U.S. member colleges of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, Final 3-year enrollments are reported since all colleges have these years as a common curriculum base and, therefore, data is comparable among the various intitutions. The enrollment increase numbers 2,385, a 12.9% increment over the 1972 figure. This rate of increase is slightly greater than the 12.0% increase reported between 1971 and 1972 enrollments and is the largest proportional student gain since 1964. Table I contains detailed enrollment figures for each college listed  alphabetically by state. Table IA offers a comparison of 1972-73 and 1973-74 enrollments. Table II also carries enrollment statistics on Doctor of Pharmacy (PHARM.D.) students who already hold a B.S. degree in pharmacy. Table III provides some detail on those students enrolled in pharmacy programs piror to the final 3-years.

Eagle University, composed of nine universities from Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida, extends educational opportunities to servicemen and community members of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. FIU offers a student oriented rather than campus-based learning program. Emphasis is placed on a noncampus-based view of education, assessment of past experiences and negotiated, individual learning contracts. Similarly, the University of Alabama offers an external degree program. This program identifies 20 students for a pilot program and then designs 20 different programs around these students. In each of these  programs, the emphasis is placed on the needs of the students. Courses of study are moulded to the student needs. The immediate results of these approaches is the reopening of higher education to those persons long shut out. (Author/MJM)",

        "description":"It has been known for years now that education for Blacks has been substandard. Environmental problems, historical poverty, prejudice and discrimination, coupled with transiency and defeatism among students, teachers, and parents have all conspired to give the black student a dysfunctional predisposition toward learning and authority in general. This causes many black students to consciously resist the academic training necessary for a professional career. The purpose of this monograph is to suggest that without the recognition of a specific set of social and professional responsibilities to the black community, traditional engineering education shall continue to be viewed with suspicion and distrust by minority group members. Additionally, the paper shall attempt to increase  awareness and understanding about the realities of the black American experience, and show how a significant increase in the number of blacks in engineering and related professions is desirable and attainable. The discussion will also highlight the practicalities and importance of minority student recruitment, orientation, and retention at predominantly white institutions of higher education. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"While initially focused on the potential consequences of alternative capital market innovations, this project was initiated in the fall of 1972 as one outgrowth of the introduction at Yale University of the Tuition Postponement Option. A Tuition Postponement is viewed as a means of enabling students to bear an increased share of the cost of education without effectively excluding any student on the basis of parental income or wealth. In effect, the student postpones his tuition payment until after his graduation. The purpose of this initial prospectus is to present the range of issues with which the project will be concerned over the next 2 to 4 years. The first section discusses in greater detail the origins and objectives of the research effort by assessing the consequences of  Tuition Postponement, identifying the possible implications of this type of program, and establishing the feasibility and social desirability of this form of income as one element of public higher education policy. The second section provides more specific descriptions of the research that has been initiated to date. The third section briefly reviews the organization and staffing of the project. (Author/PG)",

The model suggests, for successful scheduling, that actuators identify and define relevant components of local school operation; determine by subject the amount of time to be allotted weekly; determine amount of planning time desired to facilitate a successful instructional system; facilitate flexible scheduling; slot students into the pattern  required to satisfy items; and chart an entire school year in advance to discover patterns and methods of rotation that would allow maximum implementation of the school concept and the instructional system.

        "description":"In the wealth of documentation produced as a result of increasing pressures on local school districts to be accountable, two terms--\"needs assessment\" and \"planning\"--are bandied about most frequently. These terms are often used interchangeably and, even when this is not the case, they often represent varying shades of meaning. Such confusion in the literature makes it difficult to operationalize implicit processes and concepts at the practitioner level in the effort to improve educational practice. This paper attempts to clarify the nature of planning and of needs assessment by providing a concrete illustration of their application in a local school district. Planning has to do with \"determining where we want to be, assessing where we are, and developing a strategy for getting  from here to there.\" Needs assessment is only one phase of the planning cycle, which consists of identifying and prioritizing goals and determining needs according to the discrepancy between goals and the degree to which they are being achieved. The planning cycle also includes the development of program and instructional objectives, program development and implementation, program monitoring and evaluation, and feedback and recycling.

The school district was faced with finding a pattern of organizational structure that would carry a flexible, changing curriculum and allow for the individual goals of students. After an examination of alternative plans, the school district selected the 4-quarter plan as the desired structure. The eight school systems in the metropolitan area worked independently as well as cooperatively to organize and develop an appropriate curriculum that is nongraded, nonsequential, and individualized. The new program requires more counseling with students and permits students to attend either three or four  quarters as they wish. The paper provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Atlanta program and includes a list of new graduation requirements, a copy of the school calendar, and a bibliography on Atlanta's 4-quarter plan.

Under such a plan, a student need not attend school all year, or any longer than the amount of time required by law, but he may if he so desires. When a student enrolls in school, he is expected to remain in attendance during regular school days except at those times he is scheduled to be on vacation. Each student's study-vacation plan is scheduled on a personal basis. Such a flexible time schedule essentially mandates that the instructional program also be individualized. The flexible all-year school plan combines the features of year-round education and individualized instruction. This document focuses on the  research-demonstration model of the flexible all-year school which became operational last fall at the research-learning center of Clarion State College in Pennsylvania.

        "description":"Two plant utilization strategies have been implemented by the Dade County Public Schools: the extended school day and the extended school year. The 10-hour extended day plan increases the capacity of a school facility by approximately 75 percent by dividing the school enrollment into two equal groups and dividing the day into two equal sessions. Each student is assigned five subjects, but could elect to take an additional subject and extend his school day. The quinmester extended school year designed has been developed around a calendar that divides the school year into five 45-day sessions and which provides maximum flexibility in educational programing to the school and the student. A student in a school operating under the quinmester organization must attend any four  quinmesters in the five quinmester school year, and has the option of attending all five quinmesters to accelerate his graduation or to do remedial work. The strategy of the quinmester program provides significant implications for curriculum improvement and a program of 9-week, nongraded, nonsequential courses of instruction for each subject area of the curriculum. The quinmester program is voluntary and, since it does not result in an increase in student capacity anywhere approaching that of the extended school day plan, schools suffering from overcapacity could operate both plans simultaneously. A school calendar and other program development materials are included in the appendixes. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"Concept 6, a new program designed to cope with burgeoning enrollments and a shortage of classroom space in Jefferson County, Colorado, keeps school buildings in use 250 days and divides the school year into six terms of instruction. Individual students attend classes four terms and choose their vacations during the other two. An option for a fifth term is available to those who choose it for enrichment, remediation, or acceleration at no expense. Teachers work the normal 184-day work year, but may choose to teach 225 days when enrollments make it possible. The plan has the effect of producing up to 50 percent more classroom space. A key feature in making Concept 6 desirable to students is the voluntary vacation choice. As many as one-third of the students enrolled may be on  vacation at a time. The program should lead to greater individualization of instruction and to a broader range of curricular activities in individual schools. Throughout the district, 80 percent of the parents of school age children and 79 percent of the staff favor the plan. The participation of parents, students, and school staff members on advisory committees should facilitate a smooth, trouble-free transition to the year-round school calendar. (Author/DN)",

The first and most crucial decision that must be made is the determination that educational programing is the basis on which any school program will operate. Unfortunately too many school districts have attempted to determine what calendar design would be most appropriate for their community as a first priority. No such plan can be undertaken adequately without first determining the impact of the plan on the educational program of the district and the extent to which such a plan facilitates or inhibits the achievement of the community educational goals. It is  important to incorporate educational baseline data--including information about the curriculum as a part of the feasibility study. Related academic information including student test scores, dropout rates, percentage of students in various programs, and other pertinent data should also be a part of the study. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with job satisfaction of men and women who occupy positions of leadership in local school systems. It is concerned with the effects of the ethnic composition of schools, both students and teachers, on the job satisfaction of individuals holding administrative positions. More specifically, it reports the findings of such a study among school administrators. The study was made to obtain evidence about the perceived job satisfaction of school administrators and to assess what relationships exist between job satisfaction and select organizational variables. Five need classes were researched: security, social, esteem, autonomy, and self-actualization. A 13-item Likert-type instrument was mailed to 1,000 public school administrators in California. Job  satisfaction was defined as the difference between how much each need an administrator thinks is being satisfied and how much he thinks that he should be getting from his position. Stratification was applied by job level. Four job levels were controlled for principal, director, assistant principal, and superintendent. The ethnicity component was represented by respondents listing themselves as minority or nonminority and by percent of minority students and minority teachers in the schools. Findings reveal that at the principalship level, principals of schools with a 20 percent or more minority student enrollment enjoyed their positions less than did those with fewer minority students.

The project approach is a way to build in some organizational flexibility without completely losing organizational stability. The smaller, less complicated project provides excellent training for less experienced administrators and can give top management much better control than could any type of committee arrangement. The project approach allows the district to better utilize its scarce resources, produces better educational results in a shorter period of time, and can aid the bureaucratic organization in its response to the changing demands of modern society.

Reactive and nonreactive data-collecting techniques were used to gather information on 343 black administrators. The findings indicate that during the desegregation process, black educators experienced job displacement in the form of dismissal, demotion, or transfer not initiated by the black educator. Study data also show that the number of principalships held by black educators has remained disproportionately low, and that there have been only a few black administrators occupying regularly funded, hardline district level positions.

However, serious rethinking of the entire 7-12 sequence now needs to be undertaken. Studies are currently underway in at least nine Northeastern and Middle Atlantic States, generated in part by the pressure of accountability and cost effectiveness efforts, aimed at some basic questions concerning what it is any high school graduate should know and know how to do, at a very minimum, and the identification of some of the best new and old ways of getting him there--in or out of school. The standard junior high school should be  abolished and, in its stead, three years of planned real work experiences should be established. The three years of work should roughly correspond to the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades and the tasks that would change over that period of time. Entering students, the equivalent of 7th graders, should be divided into work teams of no more than six young people, to work under the direction of and receive direction from a term leader. The conventional 36-week school year should be divided into four 9-week terms, each term to contain six weeks of \"work\" and three weeks of intellectual, aesthetic, and physical education activities.

Historically, lay teachers made up the majority of Catholic school staffs from the 18th through the mid-19th century; they seem certain to reassert this strength today. Governmental authoritarianism in public education has often been paralleled by religious authoritarianism which denies lay participation on any but superficial levels. If it survives as a viable alternative to public schools, the Catholic system will have been revolutionized by growing unionization, far-reaching court decisions, and stringent NLRB intervention.

It has two essential dimensions--access to information about performance and the ability to change those factors thought to be responsible for unsatisfactory performance. While there are necessarily many parties held accountable in the schooling process, the schools themselves and professional educators are expected to bear the major share of responsibility. Schools should communicate to students, parents, and the public the specific objectives they seek and the conditions under which educators must work if these outcomes are to be achieved. To achieve increased accountability in education, educators should follow some logical procedures and develop a list of checkpoints.  Careful, dispassionate efforts to identify learning outcomes, develop performance criteria, organize instructional sequences, perform diagnostic evaluations, provide timely feedback and correction, and manage the resources available are necessary to careful, compassionate, and humane teaching.

All principals involved in the study made use of, to varying degrees, manipulative strategies to influence advisory council members concerning the role of principal as legitimate decisionmaker and/or the degree and nature of council involvement in decisionmaking. Although the principal is an ex-officio, nonvoting member of the advisory council, most principals were found to be heavily involved in the planning of council meeting agendas, and a majority were also found to dominate council meetings. Data suggests that differences in  impression management techniques by different principals may be explained by the presence of such conditions as the level of community and council support for the principal, socioeconomic status of the community, leadership ability of the council chairman, cohesiveness of the council itself, career contingencies, and the personality and the leadership style of the principal.

Planning for computers is also required, and both educational administrators and computer personnel must be aware of the political processes involved in introducing computers into school districts.

The authors provide empirically based data supporting the necessity of equity in the allocation of State educational funds. Effects of the Virginia State aid formula support the contention there is nothing so unequal as the equal treatment of unequals. Assuming continued attempts to validate program equalization vis-a-vis fiscal equalizations, the authors speculate on the research question of whether schools make a difference. Three different interpretations of base-line data (schools make no difference, schools should be supported for  nontraditional reasons, and schools are making positive differences) lead to the conclusion that the latest evolution of finance research has exceeded the possibility of objective, impartial conclusion. Fundamental policy implications affecting the vary structure of schooling have made research a form of advocacy planning. In light of this controversy, the authors call for overt specification of conceptual and methodological biases in future research endeavors. (Author)",

However, existing methods of projecting urban populations fall short of acceptable performance because they fail to adequately take into account residential mobility. As a starting point for improving these methods, this report develops an accounting model of student flows in a large urban school system. The model is used to identify components of change in grade level enrollment for each school and to suggest research designs for investigating processes generating these changes. The model is also intended to be used as a basis for carrying out empirical analyses of student flows in large school systems and for developing improved techniques of projection. (Author/MLF)",

Objectives of the game are to sensitize players to issues and opinions outside their normal frame of reference, portray the complexity of planning issues, and teach that, because of the problems associated with complex and controversial social processes such as educational facilities planning, an acceptable solution can only be reached by cooperation. The game, therefore, emphasizes skills necessary to achieve cooperation, the ability to communicate constructively, and a willingness to compromise one's beliefs for the  common good.

This paper focuses on the financing of urban education using Chicago in the state of Illinois as an illustrative example. By presenting a detailed comparison of Chicago vis-a-vis the metropolitan area with respect to fiscal capacity and educational need, the author argues for financing urban schools on the basis of educational need and analyzes the implications of some recent plans to finance local school districts in Illinois.

As defined in the literature, educational parks are clusterings of educational facilities in campus-like settings--centrally-organized common facilities serving the schools on the campuses are added essential ingredients. The Syracuse Campus Plan originated out of perceived needs for the 31 elementary schools--to renew the school plants; to speed the integration of black and white children; and to reorient the curriculum to take advantage of recent thinking, experience, and technological advance in the field of  elementary education. This case study presents the history in chronological order, identifies the participants and their ideologies, and concludes with an analysis of the decisionmaking process that resulted in the defeat of this innovative measure.

The products and programs possess a wide range of types and degrees of innovational complexity and success. Their diffusion  histories illustrate the diversity of tactics that have been tried. The products discussed have been developed and distributed by various combinations of research and development agencies, other nonprofit agencies, and commercial firms.

It was found that the school district studied lacked an operative MIS. Although a number of important components were present, they were continually breaking down.

This study documents and analyzes Colombia's effort to resolve this problem in its educational institution through the process of organizational and administrative reform. Within the administrative process, the central concept under observation is decisionmaking in the Ministry of Education. An onsite, field research methodology was used to gather data in 1965, 1969, and 1973. Working within the context of organizational theory, the study is reported in three stages: the pre-reform era, in which a condition of administrative &quot;semi-anarchy&quot; in the separate States  prohibited the Ministry from developing a more effective use of human and material resources; a reform plan, designed to bring the States under closer federal control; and a current reform program suggestion -- a transitional device that will probably evolve through planning into a more effective mechanism of educational development.

The hypothesis tested was that stress induced intentionally by a change agent in a target agency, with consequent generation of strain between the actors of the organizational, would result in the development of new goal orientations. The study, conducted in a poor rural southern county, attempted to discover the nature of the dysfunctional forces at work in the county which prevented the target agency directors in rural areas from participating in the federally funded programs, how the change agent manipulated the disruption variable of stress-strain within the target agencies, and the effect of this manipulation on the organization.  Study findings revealed that the reluctance of staff to take on a secondary mission which might end in an unfavorable evaluation, a lack of expectations and directives from the State level regarding such an activity, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of leadership accounted for the failure of agency directors to apply for federal project money. Additionally, the change agent exploited the relationship between the State department parent agency and the local target agency to create an expectation. The result was the generation of strain in the relationship of the two actors which led ultimately to the desired decision in the target agency. (Author/DN)",

Yet, these inadequate infrastructures persist over time, leaving behind unrecoverable losses. Attempts to understand the problems of modernization must not only consider questions of social and economic development, but also questions reflecting on the development of organizational and administrative processes. This study, conducted in part by a field research methodology, examines the bureaucratic character of the modern Ministry of Education in Venezuela. The organizational elements of centralized decisionmaking, hierarchy, standardization of procedure, rule  elaboration, and communication processes are examined in terms of their functional and dysfunctional consequences for the process of modernization. These same organizational elements are also placed in their cultural, political, and historical context which provides understanding about why they exist as well as why such difficulty is associated with attempts to change the administrative procedures.

The first section of the report traces a brief history of accountability, relates the press for accountability to concurrent developments in schools, and summarizes present State legislation regarding accountability. The second part of the booklet contains four guidelines that should undergird any plan for educational accountability. The position represented by these guidelines redefines those popular ideas which promote only a very narrow and restricted definition of  accountability. The third and last section provides a practical organization for implementing accountability through the establishment of a Planning Accountability Team (PACT).

        "description":"This yearbook focuses on the issue of opening the society for all people, particularly for those who have not been properly represented heretofore. Part 1 reviews some of the progress made toward an open society during the past two decades. It delineates the exasperatingly slow but important gains that have been registered since the Supreme Court decision of 1954 initiated progress toward a desegregated education for children and youth in the United States. Part 2 deals with some of the basic problems and concepts with which professional educators have had to cope since the late 1950's and early 1960's. Four chapters suggest methods for dealing with racism, creating better media, improving teacher education, and remaking of faculty education practices. The third section on the  use of power in an open society faces the implications of developments in the 1960's and early 1970's: the problems and paradoxes of &quot;power&quot; and its important emerging components. While readers are led to recognize the dangers of centrifugal forces in the culture, they also are sensitized to the &quot;centripetal potential&quot; for a more solidly and meaningfully united society. The final part is less a concluding statement than a manifesto suggesting desirable alternative routes that lead to more open social living in tomorrow's world. (Author/JF)",

This process is affected by many factors, such as the availability of fiscal and human resources, demands arising from population changes, and the power of individuals and groups who represent private interests. Lack of time and money prevented an indepth study of all these factors and necessitated the focus on the role and impact of the various actors -- official and unofficial -- who became involved at the State level in setting public school policy. Some data resulted from an investigation of the way in which three recent  education decisions were determined. Additional data were derived from studies of the perceptions held by a cross section of participants of the influence relationships characterizing the operation of the State education policy system.

In a relatively short period of time, the art has progressed from primitive routine clerical and accounting systems to elaborate management decisionmaking systems. Growing pains accompanied the rapid development and brought along many problems and critics. The solutions to these problems and answers to the critics have stimulated refinement of management systems. In spite of such refinements, the literature indicates that improvements in these systems are wanted, needed, and sought after; and that they are possible, necessary, and inevitable. Technical development, management science, and operations research should contribute significantly to the improvement of management information systems.

The amount of formal training that the respondents (usually superintendents of schools) have had in the eight techniques was tallied, in addition to the areas in which they desired training or additional training. The conclusion of the study is that there is a need to train more educational administrators in the decision sciences in order that greater use of these techniques can be applied to the administration of the schools.

In 1972, Renewal reached an impasse of sizable dimension -- Congressional opposition enacted into law. In this study, the author interviewed about 40 people, who were actors in the Renewal story, to determine the  reasons for the demise of the endeavor. Interviewees came from three different segments of the education community: (1) the Office of Education and the Office of the Secretary of HEW, (2) Congress menbers and staff, and (3) education associations, and State and local education agencies.

The project's psychoeducational philosophy led to creation of an environmental model that the trainee could later utilize as a teacher. Trainees were selected on bases such as willingness to explore self-learning needs and commitment to children (not their label) in the inner city. Training year phases included definition of group and individual goals (in seminars and discussion), observation of school activities, and creation of an experientially based curriculum with aspects such as  trainee-kept logs of activities, materials used, specific children and outcomes. Trainees interacted with 17 categories of support systems such as resource teachers, probation officers, parents, and agencies; worked with disruptive children excluded (from school), and passive/withdrawn; and implemented open education aspects such as responding to children's feelings of loss of control and inadequacies. Staff members served in roles such as resource leaders and supervisors of feedback. Yearly evaluation was based on trainees' growth, children's growth, and description of the school environment. Program outcomes included recognition of trainees' problems in areas such as mutual trust and self reliance, later employment of graduates in open classrooms, and the impossibility of continuing the  project in public schools after 2 years due to divergent philosophies.

Julian Stein discusses the physical and motor development of the mentally retarded and lists principles of effective programs such as promoting a better self image and developing emotional stability. Considered by Gladys Hillsman is stimulating physical development in children at home, the dangers of labeling, and the possibility of professionals are actually contributing to the problems of the retarded. The role of the school in stimulating the physical development of the mentally retarded child  is discussed by Tom Edson who examines program aspects such as variety of approach, differing attention spans, noncompetitive experiences, the value of routine, and the justification of equipment. In the final paper Judith Curry focuses on the role of the residential institution and suggests innovative programs such as temporary-care programs to relieve parents of the handicapped, the use of volunteers, and of prison inmates to work with the retarded.

Administrator data indicated that personnel classification was independent of educational level and degree status. The Home Trainers' responses showed independence of all cross tabulated base variables except personnel classification and degree status. Responses to the request for a single recommendation for  prospective teachers of the TMR showed teachers usually recommending student teaching and the administrators and home trainers usually recommending appropriate personality. Recommendations of the study for Ohio program development included student teaching of TMR students for all preservice persons and inservice supervision of personnel now teaching, development of a personality checklist to identify needed teacher qualities, and curriculum courses designed specifically for teachers of the TMR.

Listed at the beginning of chapters are instructional objectives; included when appropriate are guidelines, checklists, and flow charts. Given for use of the book are instructions such as reading chapter 1 for an overview, choosing a topic, and checking chapter objectives for essentialness to task accomplishment. Noted in the introduction are the transition in special education that requires teachers to demonstrate competency, the efficacy and validity of special training programs, and the role of the Four-D model. The stage categorized as &quot;define&quot; is described to be  analytical and to involve five steps: front-end analysis (problems facing the teacher trainer), learner analysis, task analysis, concept analysis, and the specifying of instructional objectives. The next stage is seen to involve the design of prototype instructional material and to comprise four steps: construction of criterion referenced tests, media selection, format selection, and initial design for presentation of instruction through media such as tests, textbooks, audiotutorial models, and computer assisted instruction. The developmental stage is said to comprise modification of the prototype material through expert appraisal and developmental testing. Described for the final stage (disseminate) are summative evaluation, final packaging activities such as securing copyright releases,  and diffusion. (MC)",

Material for each level is organized according to behavioral objectives, motivating activities, content (or theoretical base) and appropriate learning aids, and learning activities (or practical application). Teachers are advised to evaluate the children's status, to relate the content to individual needs of the children, to be enthusiastic and versatile, and to expect success. Given for each level are behavioral objectives and activities for vocabulary building, word recognition skills, comprehension associational abilities, oral reading skills, study skills, and library  skills. As an example of the approach used to teach word recognition skills at the upper primary level, the pupils are expected to recognize familiar parts in longer words as measured by teacher observation, to analyze compound words such as \"everyone\", to use learning aids such as word games, and to perform learning activities such as finding two words in a compound word.

During training the experimental Ss were taught to use materials such as readiness books and a flannel board, were shown pictures and studies of retarded children, and were acquainted with the kind of behavior to expect from their students. The Ss made lesson plans according to a summary of each first grade child's need for aid with basic number facts, reading level skills, and art skills, and also developed progress reports. Each Ss tutored three tutees 45 minutes twice weekly. Questionnaire items such as \"should retarded children be in  school?\" and \"Would you invite a retarded child to your birthday party?\" elicited the following attitudes: experimental Ss were more accepting of EMR students in a school situation, and were more willing to accept the ERM child in their homes (but hesitant to have an EMR child eat with the family) than controls; and neither experimental nor control Ss fully understood the concept of retardation although the experimental Ss had a greater understanding. A year after the study the gifted tutors contiued to work with the EMR students. (MC)",

Noted is the need to help teachers develop more effective teacher/pupil interactions. Results of evaluation studies are said to show that use of television and videotape sharpens observational skills of teachers. Micro-teaching is explained to involve taping of brief teaching experiences which are evaluated and then retaught. Research is reported to show that micro-teaching results in more effective teaching than use of conventional methods, that teachers develop increased perception of their teaching strengths and weaknesses, and that teachers rapidly overcome initial fears about being taped. Among possible innovations suggested for videotape  micro-teaching in the special education practicum are use of an intercom to provide the student therapist or teacher with continuous directions, screening for personnel selection, and use of behavior checklists to help the student teacher monitor his own performance.

Cornerstones of learning are seen to include the ability to observe and discover, to compare, to organize, to anticipate results, to solve problems, to make plans, to choose, to adapt, and to create. Prerequisites for optimal learning are given to be good health, previous experiences of success, freedom from anxiety, freedom from distractions, a flexible schedule, and the avoidance of boredom.

The literature on vocational improvement is reviewed, and investigations of mobile units are summarized. Described are the county, school system, special curriculum students, and community services. Service delivery by the mobile unit is seen to have included aspects such as unit design and preparation for arrival at schools. Explained is the evaluation system which involved  sequential exploration of the student's history, level of functioning, and career potential through psychometric tests and work samples on five Tower system tasks (clerical work, electronics assembly, mail clerking, sewing, and workshop assembly). Among findings reported are significantly consistent, uniform, and standardized assessment in the mobile unit; improvement in student self concept due to individual appraisal of potential combined with recommendations; parents' approval of the evaluation; and extension of the evaluation to include all types of students. (Given in appendixes that consist of almost half the document are descriptions of program components, a profile of student characteristics, and representative evaluation forms.) (MC)",

        "description":"Compared longitudinally were effects of biological risk and social influences on the physical, psychomotoric, cognitive-linguistic, disability, adjustment, and academic domains of 1,008 children at eight stages between 3 and 6 1/2 years of age. Over 20 tests such as physical measurements and the Preschool Attainment Record (PAR) were used. Some of the results showed that in the physical domain perinatal risk affected criterion performance then disappeared by 44 months; that in the psychomotor domain no perinatal risk data were present after 36 months, although social class effects were evident from 36 months on; that in the cognitive domain perinatal risk influenced scores of tests such as the PAR communication measure at 36 months then disappeared, whereas social class effects  were significant; that high verbal attainment emerged early, established a trend by 4 years of age, and correlated with maternal permissiveness, high educational level, and favored (white rather than black)status; and that low verbal attainment established more slowly and correlated with opposite findings. The results had implications for intervention before 3 years of age and identification of potential for school success or failure. Results of findings on seven disability states of 810 children, 4 years of age, indicated no or low incidence of hearing and visual impairment for both low and high perinatal risk groups, and higher incidence of speech and behavior disorders, and experiential deprivation in the high risk group than the unexpectedly high incidence in the low risk group.

Some of the results indicated that the deaf young adults were employed in semi-skilled and unskilled occupations; that although the deaf received the same initial salaries as hearing young adults from the same socioeconomic backgrounds and age range, the hearing adults received significantly higher salary increases; and that turnover rates were similar to rates reported in other studies of deaf employment. Of nine criterion measures of vocational behavior which were subjected to multiple  regression analysis, the following four were found capable of being predicted with reasonable success: number of months before the first job, judges' ratings of client's job satisfaction, percent of time employed, and percent of salary increase. The first measure was an index of job seeking behavior, the second an index of job satisfaction, and the remaining two were measures of satisfactory job performance. Of the measures, 61 percent were classified as early (obtained in the earlier studies). The findings had implications for formulating a more precise model of vocational behavior than models available, and applying the model to adolescents in school for appropriate prevocational training.

The children were nominated by teachers and administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Verbal and Figural Form A; and the De Avila Cartoon Conservation Scales. Fifty-four children were rated on the behavior and adjectival scales by parents. Thirty-four children were judged gifted according to results on at least one of the five tests. Parentally rated scales were available for 22 of the 34 gifted  students. Some of the results from interviews revealed that Mexican Americans believe giftedness requires verve and style as well as intelligence; and that the gifted display traits such as using imagination freely, being more active and aware, and associating more with adults. Multivariate discriminate analysis of the 43-item behavioral rating scale indicated significant differentiation between the gifted and nongifted groups. Individual items on the behavior rating and adjectival scales also discriminated between the two groups.

The program is said to stress increasing the amount of stimulation received by sensory receptors of the vestibular, reflex, and haptic systems. It is explained that balance is developed through activities such as vigorous spinning and rolling to stimulate the vestibular system; that reflexes are developed through tugging and jerking movements to stimulate the muscle spindles; and that tactile and kinesthetic sense of hyperactive children are developed through rubbing the skin and applying weights to children's ankles. It is reported that perceptual motor dysfunction is  highest in children with a history of restricted movement during their early years, but that 6 months to 2 years of training with the half hour, 4-day-per-week program usually results in the disappearance of signs of specific receptor malfunction.

Findings indicated that survey test results for lateral phoria provide reliable estimates of the prevalence of significant esophoria and exophoria among the youth population. The trial lens test for myopia found to give a better estimate of best corrected acuity than tests using present glasses compared to strength of correction needed. Incidence estimates for youths requiring simple spherical lenses  were expected to be more accurate than incidence estimates for youths requiring a more complex corrective lens.

        "description":"Presented in the annual report for 1973 by the National Advisory Committee on Handicapped Children are a review of the administration and operation of federally sponsored educational programs for handicapped children and adults, and recommendations for priorities and future programs. Noted is authorization of the advisory committee by Public Law (P.L.) 89-750, and listed are committee members. Reviewed in the introduction are the history of Federal efforts including a 10-fold appropriation increase in 10 years to support education for the handicapped, and priority goals for education of all handicapped children by 1980. Listed are priority recommendations such as clearly identifying and earmarking Federal assistance to States for education of the handicapped. A review of  activities and programs under the Education for the Handicapped Act (P.L. 91-230) focuses on highlights of fiscal year 1973, professional preparation, and telecommunications. Activities of the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped are seen to include giving aid to State education agencies, providing support for 10 regional deaf/blind centers in the U. S., stimulating early childhood education centers, changing procedures to development of more professional preparation, supporting research and demonstration projects on intervention, fostering media services and captioned films, and supporting learning disabilities centers in 40 states. It is recommended that new legislation include factors such as nondiscriminatory testing, and that attention be given to accountability, increased  financing, and continuing problems such as institutional reform (MC)",

        "description":"Presented is the final report of a 3-year (1970-1973) project, funded by Title III, to develop a model instructional and training program with 10 (five each year) 6- to 8-year-old, multiply handicapped, deaf children at the Indiana School for the Deaf. Described are use of a separate building at the school, experimental summer programs 1969-1972 and staffing consisting of an experienced teacher of the deaf and four home supervisors providing 24-hour supervision, protection, and training assistance. Dissemination activities reported include development of four instructional materials, a television program, and visits from organizations. Evaluation of five children who did not read, write, or communicate prior to the program is given to include grade scores 1.5-1.85 on a reading  test, and development of gestural communication. Discussed are 16 project goals such as integrating the students into regular class activities when feasible, use of materials such as Project LIFE, and utilization of community resources. Included are psychological progress reports, plans for continuing the project, and difficulties of program implementation such as finding professionals skilled in testing multiply handicapped students. An appendix contains evaluation materials such as rating scales, dormitory reports, three tests (word recognition, language, and mathematics tests) developed to rate achievement, and student progress records in thinking activities. It also contains a list of recipients of dissemination materials, letters to agencies, and photographs that appeared in  publications. (MC)",

        "description":"Chomsky and Halle claim that an orthography based on their underlying phonological representations (UPR) of lexical items would be optimal for English. This paper challenges two of Chomsky and Halle's basic phonological assumptions: (1) that their Vowel Shift Rule is valid, and (2) that derived words do not appear as wholes in the lexicon. A less abstract phonological representation level based on the conscious perceptions of speakers, the surface phonemic representation (SPR), is proposed. An SPR-based orthography has advantages which a UPR-based orthography would not: it is easy to learn and teach; it can be learned at an early age; and it permits rapid detection of rhyme. It is concluded that an orthography based on SPRs, and not UPRs, would be optimal. (Author)",

Linguistics need to begin contributing to the general understanding of language by developing courses for the non-specialist. A course conducted by the author for non-majors is outlined. The title of the course was &quot;Language and Society,&quot; with two areas of study emphasized: (1) a linguistic analysis of the most general aspects of phonology (e.g., sounds and sound classes) and syntax (e.g., types of transformations); and (2) a sociolinguistic consideration of variation in speech, de-emphasizing the existence of a superior dialect. The tools of instruction for the course were a compiled reading list, as opposed to a linguistics text, films, and the highly  developed use of the computer. The object of instruction was to teach the complexity of language variants, as related by similar underlying principles. The means used to teach this duality was that of examining language variants, such as advertising language, slang, Black English, literary language, systems of names in different languages, and variations in gestures. The result of the course was that the students received an accurate understanding of language, and consequently, linguistics was used as a tool to contribute to the education system and society.

The guide may be used in two different ways. First, it may form the basis for a separate Interdisciplinary Classical Humanities minicourse or minor course on English vocabulary building through Latin, or it may be used to give secondary school Latin pupils practice in reading and writing English derivatives encountered in the test \"Artes Latinae.\" The guide differs substantially from traditional vocabulary development materials in the following ways: (1) Latin roots are taught in the context of Latin quotations and proverbs, thereby  making their learning more meaningful. (2) An audiolingual approach to Latin roots and English derivatives and cognates is used. (3) The learning materials are specifically designed to appeal to urban teenagers. There are 15 units in the guide, including a preliminary one designed to make pupils aware of theories on the origin of languages. Each unit is divided into a statement of objectives and a list of suggested activities. (Author/PM)",

        "description":"The assumptions of sociolinguistics are contrasted with those of its more static predecessors in light of their potential for bearing on educational problems. The focus on variability with regard to sex, age, style, socioeconomic status, race, education is more akin to the dynamics of the linguistic and educational setting in which a child finds himself than structural or generative grammar were. This focus on variability gets to the heart of many school problems involving writing, reading, and talking. It bears on perplexing questions about how to delimit styles, how to effect acceptability in the language of others, how people set themselves off from each other through language, and how subtle variation between spoken and written language forms can cause problems in composition  or reading. In the past, native language teaching has had to deal with these issues, but it has never before had the tools to do so. Sociolinguistic information can be used to rethink the education of teachers and the development of realistic instructional materials and techniques. Yet the effort is likely to be stymied unless careful attention is given to the lack of credibility of linguistics which past crimes have fostered, to the dynamics of educational change, and to developing less hostile attitudes toward education among sociolinguists.

        "description":"The study of language is an interdisciplinary field, since language can be seen to embody characteristics of psychology, linguistics, literature, sociology, anthropology, education, and the sciences. Teachers of language can no longer afford to ignore useful information from any of the underlying disciplines. If language teaching is to be assisted by these disciplines, the following conditions must be met: (1) the various fields involved must admit that they all have something to learn from each other; (2) these several fields must be willing to communicate their knowledge in such a way that it sees life from the learner's viewpoint; (3) they must meet other disciplines halfway; (4) they must be less concerned with internal orthodoxy and more about the long range success of their  clients; and (5) they must realize they are all in a constant state of change. There is now evidence that the various academic fields are opening up to fresh ideas from allied disciplines. Thus, the task of joining linguistics with other fields in the service of foreign language instruction no longer seems farfetched. The advent of sociolinguistics has helped crystalize this interdisciplinary trend. Because of its focus on variability, sociolinguistics makes educators more aware of the importance of the setting and the lifestyle from which a student comes. (Author/PM)",

        "description":"This paper outlines the development of an exciting set of changes going on in the field of linguistics at the present time. From studies of the ethnography of communication, generative semantics, variation theory, and pidgins and creoles has come a convergence of interests which highlights the concept of gradatum (rather than continuum) in language. This concept is considered in the light of three aspects--stigmatization, favoring, and hypercorrection--which have clear bearing on first and second language learning and teaching. It is pointed out that a number of complex issues are involvwd, including context, setting, intention, presupposition, and variability and that decisions concerning bilingual education must be seen in relation to a larger number of questions than have  generally been acknowledged in the past. It is also noted that speakers may deliberately select forms which have not been traditionally valued by the classroom. Lastly, it argued that the unintentional selection of stigmatized features of language is a relatively untapped area for learning about language learning and that the time has come to develop a sophisticated program of language learning which utilizes the predictable stages (including errors) in the acquisition of desired language forms.

        "description":"Sociolinguistics is characterized by a concern for viewing language variation and for seeing language in real social contexts. It has a high potential for relationship and application to other fields such as education, sociology, and psychology. Sociolinguistics try to study the speech of a community, and instead of studying the presence or absence of given features in the community, they feel that much can be learned by seeing such features on a continuum. This continuum does not distinguish between right language and wrong language. Each item of the continuum has the potential for appropriateness and accuracy if the proper context is discovered. The point is also made that a speaker may intentionally select forms which, in some other context, would be considered stigmatized. An  example is cited of a young boy who deliberately chose to read orally in a monotonous, mechanical way, because he felt that reading with expression would label him a \"sissy.\" It is noted that speakers also make unintentional selection of stigmatized language, as in the use of hypercorrections. Sociolinguistics also study the subject reactions of people to language produced by others. The results of these studies should prove to be important for language teaching and planning. (Author/PM)",

In linguistics, the study of social dialectology has resulted in the clear demonstration of the importance of sociolinguistic variation in linguistic theory in contrast to the former preoccupation with linguistic universals. In education, the analysis of social dialects has contributed to the understanding of the dialects of the minorities, particularly in teaching oral usage, reading, and writing. Also, the current concern with the unfairness of standardized testing is partially a result of the study of social dialects. In relation to other fields, dialect study has a great potential. In medicine, for example, doctors would have far better rapport with their patients from  minority groups if they understood their dialects. Because descriptive studies are still lacking for many speech communities in America, the possibility of further investigation in social dialectology is insured for many years to come. (LG)",

The field has been lacking in entrepreneurial tendencies and unimaginative in developing either a potential clientele or a repertoire of uses. Linguistics can be developed within the university by infiltrating other disciplines such as English, education, and speech, where with careful management (e.g., small pilot programs initially) and a cooperative attitude on the part of the linguist, all the disciplines involved linguistics outside the university, the linguist must also overcome his attitude of elitism and discover methods of breaking into such areas as information processing and  retrieval, medicine, psychiatry, lexicography, publishing, the communications industry, and educational consulting.

Discussions have centered around the assessment of experiential learning; evaluation of nontraditional learning experiences; process versus product evaluation; and accreditation. Creditability mechanisms for nontraditional education must be shaped by such factors as learning modes, sponsorship, and supervision of the educational process. The required structures for validating nontraditional learning should develop along 5 basic assumptions: (1) Traditional education will be the touchstone for nontraditional education. (2) Nontraditional education will be socially useful if it is provided an interface with  traditional education. (3) The credit hour will remain the basic unit of educational currency. (4) Degrees and other credentials will be awarded by traditional institutions. (5) Fairness should dictate that higher standards not be required for nontraditional than for traditional education.

        "description":"Many colleges now confront 3 powerful forces - affirmative action, tenure, and unionization - but may not be fully aware of the emerging relationship among them. Federally mandated affirmative action programs have altered traditional college and university personnel practices substantially. Affirmative action has prompted college administrators to revamp recruitment procedures and revise other personnel practices such as promotions, retentions, transfers, and salary scales. To receive tenure, a faculty member must satisfy eligibility requirements, demonstrate performance, and reveal potential for growth and development. All three bases for awarding tenure apparently conflict with affirmative action guidelines. Unionization also threatens the traditional practice of tenure. Unions  challenge tenure by addressing its traditional purpose: employment security and the protection of academic freedom. Unions aim to protect everyone within the bargaining unit; tenure protects only the tenured. In sum, affirmative action and unionization are likely to force an end to current tenure practices.

        "author":["Toft, Robert J."],
        "description":"When talking about different faculties designing a single performance-based module, one is faced immediately with 2 sets of opposing views. The first has to do with the conflict between a strict discipline orientation and interdisciplinary, cross-disciplinary, or non-disciplinary work. The second set of conflicts arises from the differences between preparing materials for teaching and preparing materials for learning. From the standpoint of the curriculum, there are three reasons why faculty need to cooperate to design modules: (1) to eliminate redundancy, (2) to unite two or more discipline areas, and (3) to focus on issues which are essentially adisciplinary. The faculty must decide on the scope of the module, agree on the objectives, select the critical materials for all  disciplines involved, remove disciplinary biases and, if necessary, use special introductory materials to lead in from the various disciplines. Among the major problems encountered are: overprotectiveness of the discipline, inability to describe common objectives, overinclusiveness, and hesitancy in fully accepting the new module in all discipline areas involved. However, the enrichment of the curriculum and the savings in student time warrant the use of modules. (Author/PG)",

The observations suggest that the college environment as a whole is a major determinant of variation in college environmental perception.

(2) Applications from blacks have risen steadily at Southern law schools. (3) Increasing numbers of black students made it easier to recruit and appoint the first black law professors at six southern state university law schools. (4) Larger numbers of young black lawyers are establishing law practices across the South. (5) Young black  lawyers are being drawn into a larger leadership role in their communities. While the report points out that gains have been made, the lack of representation and injustice continues to plague blacks living across the South. This report challenges the Southern institutions to refocus their perceptions sufficiently to accommodate the changing ambitions of black students. Part two focuses on a young black lawyer in Columbus, Georgia- his problems, aspirations, and why he chose Columbus to practice. (Author/PG)",

Indeed, independence from parental support will surely be the subject of litigation and legal settlement in the near future as students and parents test the ramifications of the 18-year-old vote and the age of majority. The author prefers to request financial information of both parents of all students up to the age of 25, whether or not previously self-supporting. There are numerous reasons for requiring full parental information about students who claim to be but may or may not be actually self-supporting. Income, assets, liabilities, and dependents all suggest how much the parents might be expected to lend to the self-supporting student if they are unwilling to contribute directly to  educational costs. The family, for most students still in their formative years, should be considered an actual, not a hidden, resource. A 19-item bibliography on the self-supporting student is included. (Author/PG)",

A review of the literature concerning the impact of faculty bargaining indicates that there is little published research to support or reject hypotheses concerning the impact of faculty bargaining on senates. As a consequence, primary reliance has been placed on preliminary findings from an ongoing study of the 26 public institutions of higher education in New Jersey engaged in faculty bargaining. This examination of the interactions between bargaining agents, senates, and administrations indicates that there are a number of patterns evolving for faculty participation in decisionmaking under collective bargaining that do not necessarily lead to the  demise of traditional procedures. The evidence to date suggests that where traditional systems of governance have been an integral part of the structures and expectations of the participants at an institution, the collective bargaining system that evolves will reflect and reinforce these contextual factors.

A random probability sample of the senior class of 1972 were interviewed during their final semester before graduation. This class received a relatively traditional education and represents the before group in a before-and-after research design. A semistructured questionnaire was designed with undergraduate advice. A random sample of 38% of the senior class was drawn. The senior also completed the Stern Activities Index and College Characteristics Index. Results indicated the major source of dissatisfaction is the desire for coeducation or a better social life. However, being engaged by graduation, or immediate marriage, are rejected as  important goals. The class of 1972 also rejects the pursuit of social standing as such in both the dating and academic sphere. The Stern Indices and the questionnaire results confirm the fact that the majority of the students have important intellectual, achievement, and academic needs and expectations about college. However, the more satisfied seniors do perceive the college environment as providing significantly greater opportunity and encouragement for the satisfaction of intellectual, cultural, academic, and achievement-related needs.

The objective of this study was to employ several types of quantitative assessment of Florida's need for registered architects and then compare the need obtained with the projected number of architects who will be able to meet this need, given the current rate of increase in the number of architects being registered by the Florida Board of Architecture. Three types of assessment were used: assessment of registered architects to population; survey of all architects registered to practice in Florida; and consideration of expert opinion of educators and employers of architects. The conclusion  reached is that the best way to increase the number of architects in Florida is to initiate an architect training program at one of Florida's state universities.

During this time, the project has been principally engaged in continued development of the OASIS (Online Administrative Information System) data base management system and its implementation at Stanford in four major application areas; Student, Alumni/Gift, Employee, and Budget. The major objective of Project INFO is the design and testing of an integrated computer system for university administration. Of major importance during the reporting period was the award of a renewal grant by the Ford Foundation to continue the work of the project through August 1973. The work of the OASIS development team in the period since the  last progress report has focused on completion of a number of system features not present in the prototype version, on adapting OASIS to new application requirements as they have become known, and on preparing for and supporting the installation of OASIS at two sites: The University of Vermont and Sherbrooke University. Appendixes include: Network Programing Techniques, Dissemination Activities, and OASIS Data Element Dictionaries. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"The central problem of colleges and universities today is a serious and widening financial gap from increasing costs outrunning increasing revenues. This policy statement is an attempt to come to grips with this situation. If colleges are to remain strong, there must be: (1) increased income through higher tuition, (2) increased support from government, (3) larger gift income, (4) greater efficiency in the use of resources, (5) reduction in programs, or (6) some combination of these. It is wise to accept slower growth as a premise in planning and to assume that government support of higher education will remain more or less constant. Improved management is the first part of effective financial strategy; the earlier chapters of this policy statement are devoted to it  (accountability, authority, policy, academic freedom, job security, due process). The total private support through tuition and fees can be increased; this second part of financial strategy is discussed in Chapter 6. The appendix contains research papers on the management and financing of colleges. (Author/PG)",

For this purpose, the transcripts of 349 students who had graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the academic year 1970-1971 were examined. The following are among the more important findings: (1) Students who gain proficiency credit tend to graduate with more total credit hours, although with fewer credit hours in enrolled courses than those who graduate with proficiency credit. (2) Students who gain proficiency credit graduate with more credit hours earned by completing upper-division courses than other graduates. (3) Students with proficiency credit  also tended to graduate sooner than others. (4) Students with proficiency credit graduated with higher grade-point averages than those with no proficiency credit. (5) The relationship between proficiency credit and GPA was stronger within 100 level courses than within 200 and 300 level courses. (Author)",

(2) To raise each student's level of reading, writing, and oral presentation ability so that the newly-learned skills will contribute to his success in academic college subjects. (3) To help each student develop the ability to transfer the basic skills learned to college subject matter areas. (4) To develop  positive attitudes regarding learning, self-responsibility, inner motivation, and discipline that will serve as reinforcement for success in academic work in college. (5) To develop the study and research techniques necessary for academic success in college. Ideally, each learning experience would include four stages: introductory; development, analysis, and study; generalization; application, summary, and culmination. Evaluation of student performance would be evaluated by observation of performance and application skills learned, taped responses, anecdotal records, self-evaluation measures, and objective achievement tests.

        "description":"The study was designed to assess the impact of three predominantly black colleges upon Family Independence (FI), Peer Independence (PI), Liberalism (L), Social Conscience (SC), and Cultural Sophistication (CS), as defined and measured according to the College Student Questionnaires (CSQ). The CSQs were administered to students as entering freshmen (T1), end-of-year freshmen (T2), and graduating seniors (T3). Of 1,058 students who completed both administrations as freshmen, 334 also completed the scales as seniors. The College x Sex x Time repeated measures MANOVA analyses revealed overall gains on all five scales. A significant Sex x Time interaction indicated that PI scores for males increased, while females' PI scores decreased, during the freshmen year. There were trends in  the reverse direction during the subsequent years. Significant College x Time interactions were found for FI and CS. The three way interactions were significant for L and CS. The results were interpreted as indicating that students who attended these predominantly black colleges developed greater self-reliance and autonomy and broadened and interests in political, social, and cultural affairs.

In examining the responses, it became apparent that there is a lack of agreement as to whether an unemployment problem truly exists.

(2) The intended and actual uses of administrative structures regulating the flow of resources from a university's external environment, as well as among the subordinate parts of the university. (3) The  uses of project resources as sets of incentives for individual participation in reputedly innovative, problemsolving, activities. (4) The role of organizational leadership in creating, maintaining, and coordinating both resource flow and the variety of incentives for innovative activities that may be derived from that flow.

The purpose of this study is to provide an initial understanding of the dynamics and consequences of collective bargaining at one institution, The State University College at Cortland, New York. The personal interview was selected as the data collection method. The interview schedule was designed to elicit as much information as possible about each respondents's perceptions of the consequences collective bargaining had at Cortland. A discussion of the findings reveals that consequences of collective bargaining were primarily negative: development of adversary relationships, truncated communication, formalized procedures, and changes in the  roles of participants. The picture that emerges is one of a segmented university--internally and externally--in which the opportunity costs of collective bargaining seem very high in terms of personal relations, effective administration, program development, and the role of the participants themselves.

The purpose of the study of scholar incentive award recipients was to gather data with regard to total parental income and assets, the total costs of college attendance, and all resources available to finance these costs. The information has been used to construct a scholar incentive program proposal that has an optimum relationship to family support, costs, and other sources of aid.

In order to play a proper role in the making of sound academic policy, the Board of Trustees must take itself seriously in the choice it makes (if it does) of its members. A judiciously constituted board and an effectively coordinated committee structure is the starting point for sound academic policymaking. Any responsible concern that trustees feel for curriculum must in the end be represented by a responsible concern for the nature and welfare of the faculty body. A trustee may satisfy himself about faculty quality and performance if he is attentive to conditions of employment. For long-range planning, the primary responsibility  lies with the administration because it is sufficiently detached from special interests and informed about general developments in education to be able to give needed leadership.

        "description":"During the 1960s and extending through the present decade, universities have been undergoing a crisis with respect to the role of students in decisionmaking. This crisis has involved a fundamental reconsideration of the nature of university government, and the relationships of faculty to students. Presented in this paper is a case study of one of the first contemporary institutions to adopt departmental wide participatory democracy. The paper is in 3 sections. The first section outlines the formal structure of departmental authority, the nature of the departmental community, and describes the first major political debate of the year in question. The second section reviews 3 sets of implications which followed from participatory democracy in this department: group conflict, role  conflict, and some general effects of the modification of the balance of power. The third section is a discussion of participatory democracy in relation to other forms of departmental government. The paper concludes with two alternative interpretations of the effects of the structure of authority in their form of university government. (Author/PG)",

This literature review indicates that while estimates of the numbers of commuting students swell, real growth seems to be occuring primarily in the number of students who live off campus, not those living with parents. Expected costs saving is the prime reason that most commuters give for commuting; yet, the true difference in costs between commuters and residents for attendance at the same type of institution is not large. Psychological differences between commuters and residents often have been asserted but seldom established, although different background characteristics have been shown statistically. For commuters, the expereince of college differs from that of the resident student. The pressures of time  from commuting and working (typically) encourage less measured change in nonintellectual attributes. (Author/MJM)",

In this booklet, 91 different types of cooperative arrangements have been selected from different disciplinary areas to illustrate the kinds of progress that can be achieved in interdepartmental or interdivisional programs, regardless of the nature of that discipline. For instance, while some description is given of the electronic music laboratory sponsored by Five Colleges, Inc., the interest in maintaining a specialized laboratory facility is not limited only to music faculty, but may encompass physicists, psychologists, and others as well. If cooperation is to be seen as an appropriate vehicle for  strengthening any departments, however, arrangements employed shall have to be planned to meet the real needs of these departments. Joint ventures should be initiated because they are desirable, not solely because they are possible. Originally appeared as Level III document ED 065 023. (Author/HS)",

Each approach contributes to an answer to the issue although each method has limitations. (The historical record is spotty. Socioeconomic status and religious background data are cross-sectional, not longitudinal. The novel selects and distorts reality, as is its right.) Nonetheless, the three methods support and reinforce one another and give confidence to the generalizations. Findings show persons entering the professoriate to continue to come from favored classes. Faculty from Jewish backgrounds hold posts far in excess of the national proportions, those from Catholic upbringing are increasing appreciably, and those from Protestant homes  are steadily declining. Apostasy rates show all groups are alike. In all, the best judgment is that basic professorial values are not changing in significant ways. (Author)",

Volume 3 defines ERIC in terms of its functions and components. The  interfaces between components are identified, and the interactions which occur are documented.

The training of a CIC emphasizes first a grounding in various subject fields, followed by intensive study in the information characteristics and needs of established clientele groups, and the development of expertise in identifying and studying such groups. The typical CIC operates as an independent professional, somewhat as lawyers did in the 1970s. Typically, a client will come to the CIC's office by appointment and describe the particular problem area in which he needs information. Through this interview, the CIC determines the parameters of the client's information needs and prepares a detailed prescription which will be  filled by the CIC's staff of researchers. A variety of data bases will be used, some perhaps custom-made for the client. This method of operation is clearly preferable to the previous thrust of information work, which involved the building of massive data bases with little attention to their social utility or to effective access to their content.

        "description":"Cutbacks in funding and personnel required the Mankato State College Library to gain more effective control over its serials collection. The task was to integrate the various data, some unrecorded, on standing orders and serials holdings and to produce for the library directors specialized lists of many types: all titles ordered from a specific vendor, titles to be dropped, and other lists to satisfy administrative needs. In the interest of speed, it was decided to use a computerized system. The record format for serials was expanded from a two-card-per-unit-record system to one that allowed for multiple-line main entries and titles, locations, holdings, internal notes, subscription details, and other fiscal and cataloging information. Records are constantly revised as new, or  more complete, information comes in. Along with the production of administrative data, the system can quickly generate lists for public and faculty use and to meet special requests. Lack of outside programing support for the project proved to be an asset, rather than a liability, for having the same person doing the programing and bibliographic work reduced manual checking and handling of data. The appendix includes sample materials generated by the system. (SL)",

The Career Information System was used as the framework for obtaining occupational information organized around the concept of the Worker Trait Group (WTG). Four groups of students in each of grades 9 through 12 identified occupations based upon the following four pairs of binary personal preference variables: 1) vocational interest; 2) preference for data, people, or things; 3) interest factors; and 4) temperament. Keysort cards, each representing a WTG, were obtained, randomized, and classified by the students as preferred, acceptable, or unacceptable. Results indicated that only the vocational interest variable led to the selection of preferred  WTG's. It was hypothesized that this was partially due to the fact that the instrument used to obtain scores for this variable, the Ohio Vocational Interest Survey, was superior to those used to obtain the other variable scores, which were open to student misinterpretation. Additional research was recommended to determine if revision of these instruments or the means of administering them would produce variable scores leading to the retrieval of more desirable information.

The system was originally intended to transform NRRCP data into management--oriented information to support decision-making within the agency. After a year's work, however, the NRRCP was pressured by its funding sources for accountability data and thus requested the fast delivery of a completely different MIS stressing project monitoring, cost analysis, and benefit assessment. The resulting MIS generated voluminous reports, but little useful information, and the cost in staff time was high. CReWS's experience has led to the following four conclusions. First, the demand for accountability generally  leads to detailed but incomprehensible reports. Second, a useful MIS cannot be developed until the agency first clearly defines its goals. Third, the expected benefits of new management tools are usually unrealistic. Finally, information and management consultants should be wary of taking the practitioner's word for what he needs. An objective need assessment is more likely to result in the production of a useful, relevant management system. (PB)",

The overall implementation plan assigns the responsibility for courseware development in math and English and for formative evaluation to BYU; summative evaluation will be handled by ETS, system maintenance by MITRE, and operational aspects by the  community colleges. Local management control systems have been designed for TICCIT and computer-assisted instruction (CAI)-oriented faculty roles have been developed.

The simulation game used was based on Kelman's theory of social influence and attitude change in which three processes--compliance, identification, and internalization--produce attitude change. Content was drawn from Roger's \"Freedom to Learn\" and from Postman and Weingartner's \"Teaching as a Subversive Activity\". College students' attitudes after playing the \"School Game\" became significantly more positive toward statements which held that: 1) Games promote positive affect; 2) The class meeting was an exciting instructional session; and 3) Teachers should use learning games. Their attitude toward a fourth statement that games  promote learning was neutral. Control group attitudes did not change significantly. It was concluded that Kelman's theory was applicable to gaming/simulation situations. In addition, in the light of the results on the fourth variable it seemed that it would be helpful to reemphasize that learning includes attitude changes, so that students will internalize their changed attitudes as learning brought about by participation in the game.

Major findings were that: 1) students majoring in applied fields manifested more favorable attitudes toward both organic chemistry and CAI, than did students majoring in natural science; 2) students majoring in natural science received higher grades than those in applied fields; and 3) attitude was negatively correlated with course grade. These results were interpreted with caution, due to the small numbers of students involved, the limited portion of the course which used CAI, and the absence of a control group. Nevertheless, they seemed to imply that there were differential benefits  of CAI for students with different majors and that CAI was more useful to poorer students since it provided a structure for learning science which they previously lacked. Since grades improved in the second semester, it appeared that CAI's contribution accelerated over time. The development of orientation programs to improve the attitudes of students toward CAI was recommended. (PB)",

Some of the  recommendations for accomplishing this were: establishment of a five-member County Library Advisory Board; a central information facility to give in-depth support to branches and bookmobiles, and to provide special services; central county purchasing; centralized technical services; increased personnel, and establishment of county library personnel classifications, salary schedules, and fringe benefits comparable to other county employees.

Posttest results showed that the experimental group experienced growth in positive attitudes toward schooling, as evidenced by marked increases in: classroom participation, interest, conceptualization, enjoyment of class, and cooperative learning with peers. A return to traditional instruction revealed  marked decreases in these variables over time. Teachers' perceptions were positive, and it was concluded that simulations were sound pedagogical tools which fostered self-expression and divergent thinking. (PB)",

Information on the following four dimensions of the two systems at the ninth-grade level was collected: (1) student characteristics, (2) teacher traits, (3) school and community factors, and (4) costs. The dependent variable was student cognitive achievement in language and math. Results obtained by multiple regression analysis indicated that ITV had a significant positive effect on achievement; this effect was sufficiently strong to overcome other disadvantages associated with the TS system, such as larger class size and adverse student background factors.  In addition, the costs of the TS system were 25% lower than those of the ED. It was concluded that it was technically and economically feasible to implement the TS system, and it was recommended that the national policymakers weigh the social costs and benefits of so doing prior to wide-scale implementation.

The questionnaire data suggested that the trustees felt their duties were to determine objectives, goals, and some policies; to define the role of the library in the community; and to consider carefully the financing of the library. They felt less concerned with public relations and membership in library associations. The trustees were not in agreement as to whether they should concern themselves with material selection and personnel policies, and the planning and  execution of library programs. They did tend to recognize the importance of well qualified staff, inter library cooperation, state library services, library standards and trends, and that they would be aware of library laws and pending legislation.

These dependent variables included student learning and retention, state anxiety, state curiosity, time-to-criterion, and student and instructor attitudes. Matched groups of students in an undergraduate pilot training course on weather were randomly assigned to the MAP or TIC treatment. The MAP group completed the course more quickly, averaging a 29% savings in time. Postest and retention test results showed no significant differences between groups. The MAP students showed lower state anxiety and reported more positive attitudes toward their instructional method. Predictions of an inverse relation  between state curiosity and state anxiety were only partially supported. It was concluded that the individualized, self-paced, multimediated MAP treatment was both effective and feasible, since students receiving it learned faster, had lower state anxiety, better motivation and more positive attitudes. Individualization of subsequent courses was recommended so that students who finished early would be able to continue at an accelerated pace. (PB)",

The study also asks whether the dispersion of citations, among periodicals cited by freshmen in bibliographies of required term papers, conforms to a general law of distribution. The method used is citation analysis, with computer assistance to manipulate data. A major finding is that the dispersion of citations among titles is a faithful expression of a general law of distribution described as the Yule curve. It was also found that whereas the very few periodical titles which yield the bulk of the citations are housed in the undergraduate library, the vast majority of titles are housed in the Wilson  Library. The undergraduate library provided access to the great majority of citations through &quot;Reader's Guide,&quot; but students also made heavy use of unindexed materials. (Author)",

For this reason, a system's value has to be measured in terms of its usefulness to the teacher in making instructional decisions. A report should contain only data that the teacher needs and should be produced in an understandable format. User feedback should be solicited to modify the report design. Adequate time should be allowed in the first production run for debugging. Once the system is perfected, arrangements may be made with the data processing operations personnel to institute an automatic procedure which will prepare the input, run the job, and distribute the output. However, it is desirable to have someone familiar with the output to examine it for quirks before distribution.  Some of the current productions of the Office of Research and Evaluation of the School District of Philadelphia provide examples of useful teacher reports. One report, for the diagnosis of pupil performance, lists each pupil's answer to each test item, showing at a glance the student's strengths and weaknesses on a given test or subject. (Author/SL)",

Section I contains an introduction to CALAS and lists the criteria used in developing the system; the following section discusses conceptualizations of natural language interaction. Section III describes the method adopted for the representation of language presented in interaction as a modified form of case grammar.  Section IV treats the mechanics of automated processing of natural language, while section V discusses CALAS as a basis for interpreting natural language.

The amendments provided in H.R. 12471 deal with the inadequacy of agency indexes of pertinent information, difficulties in procedures required for the requisite identification of records, Federal agency delays in responses to requests for information by the public, and the cost burden of litigation in federal courts to persons requesting information. Two additional amendments clarify the authority of the courts to examine the content of records alleged to be exempt from  disclosure. New subsections are added to the Freedom of Information Act which strengthen Congressional oversight in the act's administration by requiring annual reports on information activities by every agency, and which broaden the definition of &quot;agency&quot; for the purposes of the Act.

Five intermediate grade level educable mentally retarded (EMH) students viewed three segments of the &quot;Electrc Company&quot;. Three methods attempted to measure the degree to which the subjects learned what was being taught--a multiple choice posttest, an individually administered posttest presented via flash cards, and direct questions asked during the presentation; observers recorded the viewers' frequency of attention and described their behavior. The achievement results were inconclusive, due  to small sample size and the sophistication of the viewers vis-a-vis the show, although the multiple choice test appeared the least appropriate technique. Both attention measures were useful. A replication of the study using primary level educable mentally retarded subjects and normal primary students would be useful. (Author/PB)",

        "description":"A research project sought to develop means of measuring children's attention to instructional films. Groups of five educable mentally handicapped (EMH) students watched films; observers noted their attention or inattention to the screen at five-second intervals. Data for the groups were then compiled via time series analysis procedures to yield a composite index of viewer attention for the given intervals. The results showed that the younger students exhibited greater variances in attention, that there was a positive correlation between attention and content learned, and that media presentations could be grouped and ranked with respect to their attention-holding power. It was concluded that the observation technique and the time series analysis method were useful means which  would permit researchers to: 1) discriminate among segments of a film with different attention levels; 2) analyze content across and between attention levels; and 3) establish attention files for groups of students, subject matter areas, and media presentations.

Review of the Stanwix House List revealed that plurals were treated as discrete vocabulary items. Using a small sample of EMH subjects, the researchers then tested the hypothesis that if a student knows a singular form, he will recognize the regular plural which adds--s or--es. Procedures for testing knowledge of plurals included: having subjects construct sentences using plurals, having them convert a sentence into a pattern calling for the plural form, and presenting subjects with simplified frames calling for plurals. Aural recognition of plurals was also tested. The results  supported the hypothesis. It was concluded that, in using the Stanwix House List for the assessment of vocabulary level of materials, regularly formed plurals may be categorized at the same level as the singular form, but that irregular plurals should be thought of as separate words subject to their own recognition levels. This research was part of the development of an instrument to analyze the vocabulary level of films and test questions presented to EMH students. (PB)",

The subjects were primary level educable mentally handicapped (EMH) children. Eight verbs were selected from each of groups A, B, and C of level 1 of the Stanwix House List. Results of individually administered recognition procedures indicated that EMH children of primary level use the past tense at or near the level established for the present tense. The data also disclosed significant racial differences with regard to past tense usage, for black subjects tended not to pronounce the final--ed of the past tense, although they were able to conceptualize the meaning of the past tense. Additional research should: 1)  focus on children of lower mental age to see if the present and past are equally recognized; 2) determine if subjects visually associate the present and past tense forms of a verb; and 3) further investigate the racial differences in past tense usage.

The study used the methodology of participant observation, whereby researchers: 1) gained entry to the classes, 2) established rapport, 3) recorded notes, 4) analyzed data and developed hypotheses, 5) made a final analysis, and 6) issued a report. Four major findings resulted. First, teachers exhibited a need for increased insights into and guidelines for media utilization. Second, the study showed that instructional delivery systems must conform to the teaching styles and schedules for individual teachers. Third, observation revealed that resources must be tailored to the teacher's  needs, as these were perceived by the teacher. Fourth, teachers viewed their teacher peers as invaluable resources. The researchers concluded that to be successful, media-based programs must provide the teacher with system support and maintenance, must operate under procedures which conform to teachers' patterns, and must use peer influence and support to widen effective media usage.

The subjects were six deaf children aged eight to 15, whose IQs fell within the normal range.

The results of the study failed to indicate any difference between attention to captioned visuals and attention to non-captioned visuals. No optimal words-per-minute presentation rate appeared. The researcher hypothesized that these negative findings may have been attributable to the small sample size and therefore recommended that the study be replicated with a larger sample. (PB)",

These were that: (1) local  planning is the key to educational change; (2) the SEA's function is to facilitate change, not to dictate it; (3) inservice is basic to diffusion and change; (4) no one strategy fits every situation; (5) broad professional and community involvement is essential to the successful implementation of change; and (6) the SEA's major function in this area is to serve as a link between research and development on the one hand and the educational practitioner on the other.

Comparisons made between results obtained before and after transformations lead to the conclusion that monotonic transformations do not alter the results, while nonmonotonic transformations may. Because the comparisons were made with only a small number of data sets, it is suggested that special choices of data, factor-analytic methods, or  scale transformations may limit the validity of this conclusion.

        "description":"Although the indispensibility of access control mechanisms in data secure systems has been recognized, there is a need for more subtle protection and refined control mechanisms. This report describes context protection mechanisms which enable the same data unit to be protected differently in different contexts, the differences being determined by the manner in which the fields and records are being accessed. The study shows that the method can be enforced by means of certain built-in relations among the data units involved. Three basic and primary relations are proposed as a starting point for more elaborate control systems. These primary relations allow the necessary and sufficient conditions under which violations will occur to be identified. With these conditions and the  security system, it becomes possible to propose a data definition language for specifying data base protection requirements and to develop an access control mechanism for enforcing the requirements.

The discussion first offers a formal working vocabulary and next, using the intuitive idea of a dichotomy between permissible and impermissible accesses, formalizes the idea with an Extended Logical Data Base and with protection specifications and patterns. These specifications and patterns encompass the traditional identification, authentication, and verification procedures by recognizing that these procedures can be compared solely on the basis of their answers to specific access attempts. A limited calculus of protection patterns is offered, suggesting both comparative and generative operators, and a variety of protection specifications is defined and demonstrated. Finally, a demonstration is made of the  fact that it is possible to protect any accessible data in a data base with a proposed protection specification which is independent of the structure and implementation of the data base.

He suggests that committee meetings and conferences be held after hours and on vacations so that the public would be able to have more contact with the best qualified people. Dr. H.

        "description":"Research compared Mexico's television-based Telesecundaria (TS) with its more traditional secondary school counterpart, the Ensenanza Directa (ED). The data collected indicated that the TS schools tended to be located in poorer rural communities and to have larger classes and less adequate facilities; its students were generally older and from poorer less-educated families, and its teachers were not as well trained as those in the ED system. Despite these disadvantages, however, the TS system's output, as measured by student achievement in math, Spanish, and chemistry, was greater than that of the ED. Since the cost of the TS was at least 25% lower than the cost of the ED, it was concluded that the TS more effectively met Mexico's secondary education needs. This was deemed  particularly significant in light of the fact that due to budget limitations, the ED system was able to serve only 65% of the primary graduates wishing to continue their education. It was therefore recommended that Mexico's educational policymakers seriously consider implementing the TS on a national scale. (PB)",

District resources were coordinated and a system was developed which employed the district's inhouse computer facilities to generate information useful at the classroom, school, and district administrative levels. The project was substantially  completed on time. Analysis of the system's output indicated that it produced global information which was useful for management purposes but which was not sufficiently individualized and skill-specific to be useful to the teachers at the classroom instructional level.

It was found that larger academic libraries bear a disproportionate amount of the load. Criteria and goals for evaluating alternative financing methods are set forth. An economically viable system with a more equitable cost distribution was sought. After consideration of alternative financing methods and fee system options, a fee structure is recommended which would recover partial costs for the lending library by utilizing coupons  sold and redeemed at a central clearinghouse. This solution is viewed as a short-term improvement of the current system. The study recommends that State or Federal subsidies eventually replace fees. (JG)",

The module explains the course topics, the requirements, and the learning settings. Requirements call for specific skill levels in reading, writing, and discussion. Students will be learning in conference, in the community, in small groups, and in independent situations. The main feature of the design is that students have almost complete flexibility as to when they attend school. In addition to creating the module, the practicum studies administration, faculty, and student attitudes toward several course features. The features are independent study, continuous progress, active learning, educational technology, and learning in conference. Some of the important findings are that  most of our students do not believe large-group instruction is effective. Our students are basically at ease with modern educational technology; they want to learn with directed independent study, and they find conference learning attractive. On the other hand, our students are somewhat unknowledgeable about the concept of continuous progress. (Author)",

A structured questionnaire was administered to obtain basic demographic data and information about parents' occupations, work histories, and education, as well as information about the student's own career aspirations and plans. The occupational choice of the subject and the actual occupation of the mother were rated on the dimension of non-traditionality. Career commitment was determined by the total score obtained from the subject's responses to questions involving her intention to work after marriage and/or children. Results of  the study showed that no relationship existed between the work history of the mother and the career choice of the subject. The mothers of the group were typically employed in office work or in occupations relating to housekeeping skills and/or child care. The dimension of career commitment yielded significant positive relationships with the length of time the subject's mother had been employed and whether she was presently working. These observations tend to support a modeling influence of mother upon daughter. It is concluded that young women need exposure to a wider variety of role-models, as well as increased information, support, and encouragement from faculty and counselors concerning entrance into non-traditional occupational areas.

The objective of EDS, initially, is to help the students understand that their presence at a community college is not because of inherent limitations but rather the result of class, ethnicity, and the inadequacies of their prior schooling. Once the student understands how he has previously accepted failure, he can then learn to accept success. The dramatic breakthroughs needed to close the large gaps in reading, mathematics, and writing  abilities of the students can occur regularly only when the motivation of the student is strong enough.

All data were collected by means of a Staff Survey that was administered to the three faculty groups.

Using geosystems the college administrator can: (1) improve his overall planning, (2) define college service areas, (3) assist in site selection for new programs and facilities, and (4) develop grant proposals. A geosystem contains a geographic base file and a file containing the information to be mapped. In addition, a program for merging the two files is needed. When the computer is fed the base map, the pertinent information file, and the program, the desired map is automatically produced. Computers may eventually assist in the process of student counseling, i.e., students would receive periodic mailings  of suggested changes in program, vocation, occupation, or even career. Such a counseling service could be extended to nonstudents as well as students, and the college would thus become a clearinghouse for community-wide job placement, provide essential vocational training and retraining, and guide citizens through the complex lattice of job opportunities.

The two basic factors considered in such an analysis are (1) the task environment, including its structure, demands, decisions required, and information given; and (2) the individual as an information processor (his knowledge, limitations, etc.). In order to make transitive inferences a person must make several critical operations. He must know that the scale of comparison is transitive and must code task information. Research concerned with children's coding strategies is discussed to illustrate the importance of this operation. Young children (4-6years) can make the inferences if they are forced to code in  certain ways (if their attention is directed to the comparative relations among key elements of the problem). A second basic operation is memory storage. Two possible models of storage are identified: (1) a coordinate model in which each ordered pair of items is stored, and (2) a spatial integration model in which information is integrated as it accumulates into one representation which is stored for subsequent inferential thought. Experimental work with adult subjects indicating that spatial representations are constructed in transitivity tasks is described. (DP)",

According to the CLD analysis, a single concept is learned in the following successive levels of attainment: concrete, identity, classification, and formal. The four levels are considered applicable to concepts that are defined (or could be defined) in terms of attributes and have actual perceptible examples. CLD breaks down the ways in which concepts can be extended and used at each level, as well as the operations involved in concept learning at each level. Acquisition and remembering of names of concepts may come at any one of the levels and is only essential for formal conceptualization. This overview focuses on developmental aspects of the model, particularly certain predictions  which will be empirically tested. These involve; (1) age influences on level of attainment and ways in which concepts are used, (2) individual differences, (3) invariant sequences through all applicable concepts, and (4) relationships between having labels for the concept and attainment of levels as well as mastery of its uses. The conditions of learning for each level are categorized into internal (discussed in terms of operations and attainment at the preceding level) and external (concerned with task and instructional variables that facilitate learning) factors.

Several ways of increasing interdependence were explored, and the effects of such methods on task performance were determined. Seventy six same-sex triads of fourth and fifth graders were asked to cooperate in making a block-picture on a round board. All conditions included goal-interdependence; they differed systematically in presence of task requirements, task roles, and group roles. Behavior was precoded in various group-oriented and individual-oriented categories. A Productivity Index was constructed. As hypothesized, goal-interdependence alone did not maximize occurrence of cooperative behavior. Performance was poorest when task requirements and role assignments were absent.  Pro-social behavior and performance was significantly greater where task requirements, task roles, and group roles were present together. A strong consistent pattern of sex differences was found, with boys showing greater independence from experimental role-inductions. (Author/DP)",

Although there is little research on mothering and careers, much of the existing research may become increasingly obsolete due to recent changes in sex role expectations. Data collected eary year on incoming freshmen at colleges and universities show that younger women who will pursue careers have values, self-concepts, and expectations quite different from  those pointed out in earlier studies.

TEEPS is based on the position that the quality of psychological services in the public schools can be increased by establishing educational systems in which the functions of psychology in education are embodied in system components rather than in individual practitioners. Activities in TEEPS during the past year have focused on two major areas: (1) the development of a set of evaluation procedures for assessing the overall effectiveness, acceptance, implementation, and efficiency of the program; and (2) a continued effort to refine and broaden the extent of the consultation process. In the consultation process, information is transmitted from the Arizona  center through a staff of field representatives to program assistants, parent coordinators, and school psychologists. Through the same channels, feedback is reported to the center and used to provide guidance for future research and development activities. Also in this report are the TEEPS plans for the coming year, which include the projected development of a Computer-Based Information System for use in early childhood education. (CS)",

These include (1) variation in schedules of intervention (periodic or continuous), (2) same intervention over time or different sequences, (3) comprehensive or specific intervention, (4) latent effects of programs, (5) problems in determining predictors of performance and in identifying the precursors of present performance, and (6) the interpretation of changes over  time after termination of intervention. The second part of this document is a working paper prepared from interviews with agencies belonging to the Interagency Panel. The content of the interviews emphasizes the choice of research strategies and methods of implementing cooperative programs of longitudinal/intervention research.

Study 1 analyzed the frequency and quality of experiences that could be interpreted as interfering in some way with children's natural pursuit of their desires. In a nursery school setting, 97 3- and 4-year-olds were observed over several days for a total of 30 minutes. Anecdotal records were kept by observers, which were later classified into eight categories of frustrating experiences. Analysis of results indicated that such experiences were surprisingly frequent (approximately one per five minutes). Study 2 investigated whether the results were peculiar to the school environment. Thirty-minute consecutive  observations of four-year-olds were conducted on public playgrounds and beaches. The data was unexpectedly consistent with the first study. The third study was designed to analyze the wide range of experiences for different children. The original procedure was repeated with the original subjects during the next school year. The relative frequency of constraining events was stable, indicating that certain children are more prone than others to such occurrences. Discussion focuses on theoretical and practical issues raised by the research, including adequacy of methodology, significance of the events in determining behavior patterns, and whether it is wise for adults to intervene to reduce frequency of frustrating interactions.

Documents are compared for consistency; in some areas they were found to say  conflicting things, but on the whole, a clear model of the program emerges. Part II examines three types of implementation data, including: (1) statistics about families, staff, project characteristics, and costs; (2) narrative descriptions of project organization and activities, using site visit teams; and (3) parent and child entering characteristics, based on standardized tests, questionnaires, and rating scales.

The analysis, which focused on black and white girls from rural East Texas, is sequential to previous studies (RC 007 777 and RC 007 842). The paper specifically examined the integration of girls' occupational and educational aspirations and expectations to their projections regarding marriage and future familial status roles. Comparison of the aggregate distributions suggested the frames of aspirational and anticipated reference of a substantially large proportion of the girls, black and white, were not integrated either at the time of the initial survey contact, when the girls were high school sophomores, or at the time of the second contact 2 years later.  Expectations appeared to be slightly more integrated than aspirations in both years for whites. Generally, the association between marital-family orientations and career or educational aspirations and expectations tended not to increase inversely. The associations which did change were: (1) for whites, the association of desired age of marriage to occupational aspirations and the association of expectation to work outside the home to occupational and educational expectations; and (2) for blacks, the association between fertility expectation and education expectation.

Earlier findings on NM Mexican American youth supported Merton's thesis that all types of youth have high aspirations for upward social mobility. This questioned much of the speculative assertion that Mexican Americans suffered impediments to social mobility due to low achievement aspirations derived from the patterns of values and beliefs linked to their subculture. Data were gathered from 2 separate studies of Texas Mexican American youth completed in the past 6 years: a 1967 study of NM youth in south Texas  (Kuvlesky, Wright, and Juarez, 1971) and a study of El Paso youth (Venegas, 1973). Differences between NM and metropolitan (M) respondents were found to be statistically significant for both boys and girls relative to specific educational and occupational status projections types for both aspirations and expectations. In addition, statistically significant differences existed between the 2 samples of Mexican American youth in reference to intensity of education aspiration and certainty of attainment of expected occupational attainment. Statistical data is presented in 12 tables. (KM)",

Field dependent referred to a strong perceptual influence caused by the context or background while field independent referred to an ability to overcome the influence of a surrounding perceptual field. The sample consisted of 44 Mexican American children, 9 1/2 to 12 years, enrolled in a Southern California public school. The Portable Rod and Frame Test classified subjects as field independent or dependent. The learning component consisted of 3 stages: (1) the response learning stage, which reflected when the subject recalled the response as a unit, (2) the associative one stage, which  reflected the first correct association between stimulus and response, and (3) the associative two stage, which indicated actual mastery of the correct association. The subjects were tested in a distraction free room within the school by Mexican American experimenters. One half of the subjects from each group were randomly assigned to one of 2 learning conditions: personalized and impersonalized rewards. Results demonstrated that Mexican American children, regardless of cognitive style, required fewer trials when personal rewards were employed. The present study failed to reflect field independence/dependence as a major dimension of individual differences. (NQ)",

Such programs would stress ecological concepts, appreciation for the outdoors, knowledge of appropriate outdoor recreation activities, an understanding of the interrelationships between nature and humanity, the development of positive attitudes toward the natural and man-made world, and the ability for citizens to work together democratically to solve environmental problems. The programs should be interdisciplinary and contribute to the goal of understanding, appreciating, and preserving the environment. They would be directed toward all age levels, from pre-school through adult. The outdoor education movement has long served as a valuable means of implementing  the goals of environmental quality. Experiences in school camping, school site development, beautification, ecological studies, outdoor recreation activities, and citizen action have helped to produce environmentally-aware citizens. Outdoor education is shown as an educational innovation, and guidelines are provided for its inclusion in a school curriculum, and for specific aspects of outdoor education programs. Evaluative studies of outdoor education are presented, with 18 recommendations for future directions which environmentally-focused outdoor education may follow. (Author/KM)",

From government at all levels to churches, private agencies, schools, colleges, labor unions, etc., the region has received an unequal share of exploitation, netlect, unfulfilled promises, and misguided assistance. Focusing on higher education, the document pointed out that as many as 65% of Appalachian students drop out of high school before graduation, and only 1 to 10 graduate from college. The young Appalachian left behind by the higher educational system becomes the object of complicated channeling devices -- county programs, the draft, and vocational education. In 1968, however, the West Virginia Commission on  Higher Education reported that only about 18% of the state's students had access to vocational training. Among the colleges and universities in the area, there have been few efforts to develop and design a program which integrates remedial education, guidance and counseling, and financial assistance into an overall educational environment. Therefore, the developmental stages which must be formulated to combat this situation are: (1) the commitment of the educational institutions; (2) recruitment and selection of students, especially &quot;high risk&quot; students; (3) the development of a fully accredited college level curriculum; (4) the development of a supportive services system; and (5) the organization of a staff development program.

        "description":"Initial investigations were made into the feasibility of estimating populations through a multiple regression technique during summer 1972. There was a relationship between population and the 2 independent variables tested--school enrollment and residential electrical hook-ups--when allowance was made for size through the use of dummy variables. The sample was limited to 14 communities. Research continued into fall 1972 with the sample size increased to 35 communities. The expanded sample was tested to see if a relationship still existed between the population and electrical hook-ups and school enrollment. Since satisfactory results could not be obtained using just the variables, dummy variables were added as independents. The problem was then approached from a regional  perspective, using 5 basic regions which were defined on the basis of geographical proximity. An inherent weakness was that 4 regions included 6 or less communities. Thus, the simple approach to calculating people per residential electrical hook-up was used for the following dates: January 1970; January 1972; and January 1973. Thirty-six communities were used in January 1973. This report presents these telephone, electrical, and school data on appendix form. (NQ)",

        "description":"California State Advisory Committee (SAC) of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held hearings in Santa Maria, California (May 20, 1972) to collect information on civil rights problems of Mexican American students in the Lucia Mar School District. Major issues were community complaints about the arrest of 26 Mexican American students and some parents who peacefully demonstrated to express dissatisfaction with the treatment given Chicano students at Arroyo Grande High School. On October 6, 1972, SAC members, along with school officials, community representatives, and the new president of the school board, met privately. The present study, with recommendations, was submitted as the result of the extensive investigations. The recommendations included: (1) the establishment and  public announcement of objectives for the recruitment of Mexican American personnel and students in order to establish a proportionate ethnic balance, thus guaranteeing a conglomerate of employees to establish good relations with the Chicano students; and (2) that an intensive effort be made to make the curriculum and district program, at all levels, more pertinent to the bicultural student, reflecting the historical and cultural role Mexican Americans played in the development of California and the Southwest.

The use and collection of racial and ethnic data; responsibility for racial and ethnic data collection and use; and the legal issues of authority, constitutional protection against the invasion of privacy, and State-Federal conflicts were evaluated. The Commission's findings were based on information gathered from six Federal Agencies which administer many of the largest domestic assistance programs and two Agencies with special statistical responsibilities: the Departments of Agriculture; Health, Education, and Welfare; Housing and Urban Development; Labor; Transportation; and  the Veterans Administration; the Office of Management and Budget; and the Bureau of the Census. Also using additional information supplied by minority organizations, the Commission found that the scant data collected by Federal Agencies were insufficient for determining the degree Federal benefits are reaching minority groups on an equitable basis, thus making it impossible to determine whether program benefit distribution is free from discriminatory practices. This report also described the parameters for creating a data collection system necessary to measure the extent to which minorities receive domestic assistance benefits. (NQ)",

The U.S. recognizes tribal groups as sovereign bodies and conducts business and civil affairs with them accordingly. This paper examines an area in U.S. Law (Codes) that is either unclear or entirely lacking in treating a matter of tribal right to ownership or control of the accumulated literary and intellectual heritage of a tribe and its right to protect its members from exploitation regarding their personal knowledge of tribal cultural heritage. The topic is discussed in light of existing law and custom and several approaches to  solving the problem or clarifying the situation are described. In light of the discussion, it is concluded that morally and ethically elements of cultural heritage of the American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos that lend themselves to ethnographic research methods and electronic or photographic recording are by virtue of \"a priori\" right and possession the intellectually created property of the tribes and their members.

These problems are categorized into four levels: (1) the differences in the key health indexes between Indians and non-Indians and unique health problems which seem to affect Indians more often or severely than other populations; (2) specific health needs such as dental care, family planning, and an adequate diet; (3) making  services accessible and acceptable by removing barriers of distance, culture, and poverty; and (4) basic problems of sanitation and housing.

The program employed a bilingual teacher and aides who worked with 4-8 pupils each school day for 30-40 minutes. The children were given intense auditory training in English and Spanish using music and rhythms, and were given motor skill exercises on speech equipment. Goals were revised as slowly or as rapidly as skill improvement demonstrated. Teachers found that, as a result of the program, high risk pupils increased efforts to participate in class work, that language skills in understanding instructions in  English and Spanish were improved, and that attendance surpasses class averages. Non-English speaking mothers were used to help the children with motor skill equipment. Although success of the program caused several aspects to be continued in the school, the report recommended further research relating language disability and weaknesses of motor skills. Seven factors which possibly contributed to the success of the practicum were also given. (Author/KM)",

Part I gives statistical data by ESEA evaluation form; Part III, Evaluation Data, also uses reporting forms. Copies of the teacher performance rating scales, the teacher evaluation of the open concept, and a parent survey regarding open concept were also included. The technical supplement includes, both in narrative and tabular form, the research design, instrumentation, and results of testing with the four major instruments--the Test of Basic Experiences, the Stanford Achievement Test, the Otis-Lennon Test of Mental Ability, and the Purdue Psycho Motor Survey.

        "description":"The paper demonstrated the need for American Indian involvement in the education policies affecting Indian children in Alaska. It analyzed the method that the State of Alaska used to fund schools for native children and the administration of the Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) Program by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Alaska is in a unique educational situation--other States are held responsible for the education of their citizens; in Alaska, however, as a holdover from territorial status, the State inherited and maintains a dual educational system. It has established a federally funded school district known as the State Operated Schools, which are attended primarily by native Alaskans in isolated rural areas and military dependents. Of the 18,000 students in these schools, 8,000 are  native Alaskans. The paper gives some State Education Statutes that place native children in this unique position; a policy statement for the BIA administration of JOM funds; relevant sections from the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; and taxing sections from the Statehood Act and the Land Claims Act. The report concluded that the State of Alaska has unique problems in supporting public education for its school age children, which will only be compounded by maintaining a dual school system that excludes Alaskan natives from policy making positions within the State's education structure.

        "description":"The paper was a preliminary study of the role of settlement schools in Southern Appalachia. A settlement school was defined as a nonprofit private institution which has a relationship with the community or county in which it is located. The manner in which the school was founded gives some insight into the relationship between the school, the local community, and Southern Appalachia. How, and by whom, the school was governed was also indicative of the attitude of those involved with the school. In addition, the composition of the faculty and student body reflected the objectives of the school. The paper gave the history of many settlement schools, both nondenominational and church-supported. Sources of support came from a variety of areas. Fund-raising efforts seem to have  concentrated in the Northeast. Local support generally came in the form of land, labor, supplies, and produce, although many of the schools were also supported by churches and religious organizations. The goals were reflected in curricular and extracurricular activities--some courses were specifically related to the region; many had vocational and work programs. Since their inception, however, settlement schools have changed--the growth of the public school systems has forced them to reevaluate their situations. Some have closed; others have eliminated their traditional academic programs. To accomodate these changes, it was recommended that the settlement schools of Southern Appalachia reassess their validity for the directions the region is moving. They will have to become more involved  with their communities and the region in general. (KM)",

Development is aimed at the instructional areas of language, reading, mathematics, and social awareness for kindergarten through 12th grade. The bilingual concept is an integral part of the language development area. As a prelude to development of the Pilot V curriculum, a needs assessment study was conducted during the summer and fall of 1972. This assessment was necessary to establish a foundation for curriculum development; thus, a cross section of life styles and educational disciplines was reviewed. This led to the development of behavioral objectives for specific educational needs of  migrants. The data sources used to present a more comprehensive view of the children's needs were: (1) research on the educational needs of migrant children; (2) interviews with the professional staff; (3) recommendations of the Parent Advisory Council; (4) parent interviews; (5) the Archway Study (a research study conducted at the Archway School, Atco, New Jersey dealing with the needs of migrant children between the ages of 5 and 15); (6) research on the educational needs of disadvantaged children; and (7) research on the educational needs of all children.

A subsidiary objective was to make contact with youth-serving agencies within the city to ascertain their knowledge of Native youths in the area. Specific operational objectives were: (1) to examine previous research for methodologies and findings; (2) to determine the population in the city attending educational institutions, including post-secondary; (3) to determine the Native youths not in school, including those who are employed or transient. To obtain this information, school principals, agencies working with Native people, and miscellaneous referrals were interviewed. Local and national listings of  Native citizens were cross-checked. Information on transient youths, which was the most difficult to obtain, was received from agencies working with Native citizens, and from referral persons. The survey concluded that Edmonton has over 1,000 Native youths who may be considered residents, as far as need for services are concerned. Another 900 are temporarily in the city, fewer than 100 as patients and as many as 800 are transients who would probably require a different set of services than the residents. Ten recommendations for the use of this survey were also given. The majority of the information was presented by tables and maps. (KM)",

The first four papers supplied basic information to workshop participants: Rural development was defined in the first paper as increasing the well-being of rural people wherever they eventually resides; the second paper covered channels of communication through rural institutions and organizations: A tool for measuring and monitoring rural economic progress was introduced in the third paper; feasibility studies on the how and why of plant location were the topic of the fourth paper. The next three papers covered the impact of  industrialization on rural areas and communities; papers 8-13 gave specific examples of community services which contribute to the well-being of rural residents. Papers 14-17 introduced the ideas and problems of planning at state and local levels. The last paper is significant in that it tells change agents how to communicate planning ideas, since the research results contained in the first 16 papers are useful only if they can be communicated through the change agent. Perhaps the most important result coming out of this type of workshop, however, was the stimulation of a continuing research of rural development problems. (KM)",

        "description":"The Good Neighbor Commission of Texas, organized under a 1943 Federal grant and later constituted as a State agency, coordinates the work of the Federal, State, and local governments in improving travel and working conditions of migrant farm workers. The basic responsibilities presented in its 1973 annual report are: (1) surveying conditions and determining problem areas for migrants and (2) developing, in coordination with State agencies, specific programs to meet the needs of agricultural workers and their families. An overview of Texas migrant labor describes the emergence and final domination of the seasonal agricultural labor force by Spanish speaking people (primarily Mexican American). The report also discusses Texas agriculture and migrant labor, alien labor and  immigration, and vocational programs for migrants. Current developments in education, housing, health, jobs, and economics are also presented. Brief recommendations which would result in direct and immediate benefit to migrants and their families are given, some of which will require legislative action, while others will require administrative directives to bring about refinement, and in some cases redirection, of agency programs.

        "description":"The study was undertaken at the suggestion of the Commission on Religion in Appalachia, a private development agency in Central Appalachia. Given limited resources and the difficulty of obtaining firsthand knowledge of the circumstances in the area, the commission wanted to measure socioeconomic status in the 60 Central Appalachian counties to facilitate recognition of critical need areas. The primary goal of the study was to scale the 60 counties in relation to each other for individual levels of development. To measure developmental status, a composite index was prepared which included 14 socioeconomic indicators. These were chosen on the basis of subjective analysis of the components which affect the social and economic well-being of a geographic area. Only secondary data  sources were utilized, with emphasis on the &quot;1970 Census of the Population.&quot; The counties were initially scaled for each development indicator. Both observed values and ranked results were reported. The technique of common factor analysis, coupled with oblique rotation, was then employed to detect patterned relationships in the data. Three salient factors were identified: level of development; immobility; and level of industrial activity. A reduced-scale development index utilizing four variables was devised as a working index of developmental change. The report also noted that, in future evaluations of relative changes in status among the 60 counties, the ranking results, rather than factor scores, should be compared. (Author/KM)",

Medical students interact with simulated patients and acquire problem-solving competencies for use in working with patients. Simulation techniques described include a paper and pencil format using latent image or opaque overlay techniques (with feedback systems, a computer format employing unconstrained natural language, a computer-managed robot (SIM I), and live simulations using role playing. The question of validity of performance on a simulation is considered from the perspectives of content or face validity, or construct validity, and of concurrent  validity. Evidence from data suggests that, when simulation techniques are properly exploited, these exercises hold considerable promise of being a powerful tool not only for instruction but also for research into the nature of problem solving.

One course is for preservice teachers only and is taught each fall semester, as it has been since 1964, by a team consisting of a high school biology teacher, a science consultant for the Phoenix school district, and an Arizona state faculty member. As part of the course experiences, students concentrate on inquiry-oriented laboratory investigations using living organisms where possible, class discussions, films, BSCS single topic inquiry filmstrips, and other related activities. One of the major objectives is to permit students to become familiar with methods, techniques, and use of biological materials. In the spring semester, another  course using the inquiry field study approach involves inexperienced but certified biology teachers qualifying for admission to a degree program leading to a Master of Science in Biology. These participants in the Prospective Teacher Fellowship Program plan and conduct a two-week resident field study program for 60 high school biology students (30 high school students per week). Also reported are details of an Environmental Education Teach-In involving the states of Hawaii, California, Nevada and Arizona. (PEB)",

The quality and use of the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported programs were analyzed through a historical discussion of contemporary reform movement in elementary science. Information about use of the Elementary Science Study, Science Curriculum Improvement Study, Science - A Process Approach, and Minnesota Mathematics and Science Teaching curricula was collected from superintendents' responses. Questionnaires, interview results, meetings, and informal conversations were used to determine teachers', principals', and science coordinators' attitudes and  experiences. Fifth- and sixth-grade children's interests were surveyed to explore relationships between teachers' characteristics and their impact on children's attitudes. Adoption of the NSF curricula was found to produce lively and interesting instruction in classrooms, and teacher specialization was described as a problem in practical implementation. Included are 13 recommendations and tables of operational differences among NSF and non-NSF systems, perceived strengths and weaknesses of NSF curricula, numbers of the classrooms and buildings involved, and percentages of use by grade.

The study is mainly concerned with the four National Science Foundation (NSF) programs: Elementary Science Study, Science Curriculum Improvement Study, Science - A Process Approach, and Minnesota Mathematics and Science Teaching. Program contributions to Massachusetts elementary science are analyzed in connection with pupil progress, classroom preparation, community involvement, science specialist help, time for elementary science, and adequacy of teaching guides. Teacher training, science coordinators, principals, financial considerations, and sex-role stereotyping are delineated in detail. The booklet concludes  with teachers' perceptions about the NSF curricula and with two tables, one showing operational differences between systems committed to NSF and non-NSF curricula and the other showing strengths and weaknesses of the NSF programs perceived by science coordinators. Included are 13 recommendations; a list of the numbers of systems, classrooms, and buildings involved in the programs; and the percentage of use by grade. (CC)",

On the international scene environmental program in Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, Malta, the United Kingdom, and Zambia are examined, and the contributions of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and UNESCO are outlined. Within the U.S. environmental education programs have changed significantly over the past decade (1964-74). Results of studies are presented to indicate the environmental  attitudes and knowledge of tenth and twelfth grade students, the extent of environmental courses being offered in undergraduate college programs, and of environmental education courses available in teacher education institutions. Also discussed are exemplary program models, the designation of state environmental education coordinators, and the extensive environmental materials now available. The report concludes that the citizens of Spaceship Earth are becoming aware of their environmental responsibilities and are actively seeking the institutional arrangements, educational programs, and behaviors essential to securing a quality enviornment and life-style.

To provide a &quot;data base,&quot; an inventory of environmental education resources in the State was compiled and distributed. The compendium covered K-12 education, higher education, community groups, governmental agencies, the media, and businesses. Some of the conclusions drawn show: (1) Vermont chooses to remain independent from Federal/State control in the environmental education planning process but encourages extra-governmental coordination of its efforts; (2) the expenditure of large sums of money to compile listings of environmental programs is not necessary, but there is a real need for a communications system which permits the names and skills  of readily available contact people; and (3) there is a strong sentiment against identifying environmental education as a separate subject in the K-12 curriculum.

The instrument was administered as a pretest and a posttest to all students. The treatment consisted of instructing the students in the &quot;Organisms&quot; unit of the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) program. Significant positive change in pupil performance as a result of instruction was found. The gain scores were subjected  to a t-test at the .05 level.

Statements reflecting three kinds of teaching behaviors: (1) teacher oriented, (2) student-teacher cooperation oriented, and (3) student oriented, were developed, submitted to an eight-person SCIS judging panel, and refined. Six statements (two of each orientation) relating to each scene were presented in the response pamphlet. Teachers indicated their degree of agreement, using a five-cell Likert scale. The packet of materials was presented to 254 subjects: 69 preservice,  elementary, science-education-methods students, 69 inservice teachers of elementary schools, 57 inservice teachers completing a Cooperative College-School Science workshop in SCIS, 45 inservice teachers completing workshops and teaching experience with SCIS, and 15 SCIS staff members. The results of the study indicated that teachers view teaching elementary science depending on the particular situation and consistent with a total philosophy (for SCIS, this is teacher as guide, not as an authority).

Children, aged 5, 9 and 13 years, were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Two of the treatment groups individually viewed silently (N=21 per age level) or vocally (N=21 per age level) a projected 35mm slide of a living room. The third group (N-45 per age level) viewed the picture display in groups of three and verbally exchanged enumerations of items. Five minutes were allowed for viewing the slide. The subjects then verbally recalled the viewing experience and their recollections were tape recorded. As the age  of the subjects increased, the numbe of picture item messages and variety or number of different picture items verbalized in the enumeration phase of the experiment also increased. A message processor algorithm for forecasting cognitions of verbal and nonverbal modalities was used with a prediction error of less than two percent. An item dimension algorithm for forecasting cognitions was developed to measure the M unit structure of memory pathways. The finding was that chronological age was related to M units of variations of learning and recall tasks. (Author/PEB)",

This study involved using information theory to investigate the concepts of primacy and recency as they were exhibited by ninth-grade science students while processing a biological sorting problem and an immediate, abstract recall task. Two hundred randomly selected students were given a biologically oriented classification sorting problem which required them to observe, for 15 minutes, a color slide composed of 14 different animals commonly recognized by ninth-grade students. Student scores were divided into low and high primacy (recall of items early in a list) and into low and high recency (recall of those items at the end of a list) groups. There were generally no significant differences between  the low and high groups (primacy and recency) with respect to their set formation scores. When the groups were segregated on the basis of their ability to recall, there were significant differences between high and low groups. Total cognition scores were slightly greater for the recency students when compared to the corresponding ability group for primacy, suggesting that a slight but not significant advantage in recall belonged to the recency group.

The work of Piaget and Inhelder has defined learning information flow and related that to cognition. The contrast criterion of this study's design was to determine the information flow of pre-operational children in doing a repeated concrete task and then to establish the nature of difference in cognition which occurred for immediate reconstruction recall, followed by an immediate memory recall, and later by a delayed memory recall. Thirty six-year-old children were randomly selected from a suburban elementary school  and tested individually. The practice classification sorting and immediate recognition recall tasks were given within a 30-minute period. The delayed memory recall was given the following day. Analyses of the data appeared to confirm the hypothesis of Piaget and others about the schema role for reconstruction and pure memory recall but not, however, their claims of the information theoretic definitions of memory and mental maturation. The findings do, nevertheless, report the first explanation of how the pre-operational human memory processes information in learning and cognition. (Author/PEB)",

The purpose of this study was to establish the possible relationships of personality characteristics with the processing of information by humans in an abstract problem solving task. Thirty senior high school students, each of whom had completed the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS), were asked to take the role of court judge, deciding on divorce proceedings and custody assignments. The subjects were presented with a problem involving the incestuous relationship between nine people who had Greek-letter names. The subjects vocalized the five-minute solution and the monologues were noun, pronoun analyzed. Twenty-eight information theoretic measures and six external measures were calculated  from the Gamma Problem (output was placed in a matrix and treated for information theoretic measures according to the Moser Model). Fifteen personality variables were obtained from the EPPS; nine were used in the analysis. The information theoretic measures, the external measures, and the personality variables were tested for relationships by linear regression analysis. Paradigms, involving data analyses, of the relationships of personality to the information in verbal solutions of the Gamma problem confirmed that personality was embedded in the fashioning of sequences of messages from the memory and for processing a desired state of affairs for a socially sensitive problem.

They then recalled the properties of color, shape and identity numbers of figures in spatial locations, corresponding to the display of figures in the passive learning session. As the age of subjects increased, there were more set elements constructed in the figural sorting task but the increase was not significantly greater until done by the 15-year-old subjects who, incidently, had the lowest average intelligence quotient.  This indicated that the increased cognition level obtained was not specifically a function of intelligence. One general conclusion was one which alludes to a Piagetian interpretation of mental maturation.

The Survey of Personal Values (SPV, by Gordon) provided measures of stylistic values. The student sample consisted of 241 nonscience majors in a physical science course and 16 freshmen chemistry majors in a general chemistry course. All data were collected at the end of the academic year. Statistical analyses  used were analyses of variance, t-tests, correlational analysis, and multiple step-wise regressions.

In both steps, children taught by teachers participating in the in-service program were compared with children who had not studied SCIS materials. In Step Three, pupils in grades four,  five, and six from a wider variety of teacher training and science program backgrounds were compared. Children were asked to complete an attitude test or questionnaire appropriate to their grade and reading levels. Significant differences were searched for by the use of the t test. Additional data analyses involved Scheffe multiple comparisons.

Fifty teachers participated via color/cable television at their schools; 26, through the use of a videotape recorder. Participants varied in teaching experience, science content, and sex (two males). Data were collected via a pre- and post-semantic differential instrument, biographical information, and a post-science competency measure.  Sixty-six teachers scored 29 or better for the 33 tasks on the science competency post-measure. The 26 who used videotape recorders which they could start and stop at will scored higher as a group on this measure than did the 50 teachers who used color/cable television.

The subjects were 286 third year preservice elementary teachers enrolled in the fall term of 1972, at four teacher preparation institutions: a land grant university (N=152); an urban, commuter university (N=68); a teachers college (N=50); and a private, church-related college (N=16). The Instrument of Instructor Credibility, a Likert-type response instrument, was used to determine the preservice teachers' beliefs about the professional credibility of their science methods instructor. A frequency count and percentage on each of the 14 statements of the  instrument were computed for each of the 5 response categories. Responses and their possible implications indicate that a credible science methods instructor should have (1) taught elementary science, (2) drawn from a store of practical experiences, (3) modeled many modes of teaching, (4) competence in science content, and (5) a close liaison with public school teachers.

        "description":"Investigated was the effect of systematically combined high and low level cognitive objectives upon the acquisition of science learning. An instructional unit based on a Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) Inquiry Slide Set (structure and function, control of blood sugar, a homeostatic mechanism) was chosen because it included stimuli for knowledge and for higher than knowledge cognitive functioning. Forty students enrolled in an elementary science methods course were pretested, using the Process of Science Test (POST) and, based on POST scores, were randomly assigned to two treatment groups in a 2x2 design. Prior to the experiment, subjects read a passage which contained either behavioral objectives or a placebo. Those students receiving the placebo (a discussion on a  recently developed science curriculum) had no special learning guidelines and relied entirely on the Inquiry Slide Set experience which was presented by an experienced biology teacher who also led the discussion, following suggested guidelines provided by the BSCS Inquiry Slides kit. Treatment time consisted of one 75-minute class period. Findings would appear to support the assumption that objectives enable learners to retain essential points and to organize complex cognitive processes needed for successful inquiry-oriented learning experiences.

Comparisons were made between performances of students enrolled in Intermediate Science Curriculum Study (ISCS) and Introductory Physical Science (IPS), between male and female students, and between white and non-white students. Scores on the Process of Science Test (POST) were used as the criterion measure. The experimental group consisted of 88 students (67 white, 21 non-white; 47 male, 41 female). The control group was composed of 79 students (65 white, 14 non-white; 41 male, 38 female). All were eighth-grade students who had completed  a life science course in seventh grade. There were no significant differences between groups on verbal, math, and science, or abstract reasoning ability for the first equivalence comparison. When analysis of variance was performed with POST scores as criterion and treatment and race as variates, a significant racial effect was observed. Using analysis of covariance, no significant differences between treatment groups, sex groups, or racial groups were identified when ability, math ability, science ability, and abstract reasoning ability were controlled statistically. The investigators concluded that neither IPS nor ISCS-Level II removed racial differences in acquisition of science processes. (Authors/PEB)",

Observations were made on three treatment groups at both the junior high school and college levels. One hundred eighth-grade students in a school system in New York participated in the study which was replicated at Edinboro State College, Pennsylvania. Investigator-developed instruments were administered six weeks after the treatment to measure retention. An astronomy related semantic differential instrument was designed to measure student perceptions concerning  the unit of instruction and astronomy in society. Results indicated that: (1) the group (Treatment Group I) which experienced the orientation session did significantly better on content learning than the group which did not; (2) the combined treatment group (III) was the only group which significantly benefited from the treatment; (3) all groups showed minimal loss of content achievement on the retention test; (4) no interaction effect between treatment and retention was noticed on posttest data for the college treatment groups; and (5) the planetarium group (I) in both junior high and college studies had the greatest positive perception change.

The students involved were non-science majors (N=138) enrolled in a physical science course. Data were collected at the beginning of the course with respect to awareness, knowledge, and interest in environmental problems so that this information could be used by the instructor to develop background materials for the course. Students were given an instrument consisting of four briefly-stated possible environmental catastrophes and asked to interpret the meaning of each catastrophe, and specify information needed or questions they would like to ask about each predicted  catastrophe. Results of the background survey revealed the students to be very much aware of the current environmental problems. Among the major findings from the catastrophe instrument were: (1) over 65 percent of the students were able to successfully interpret at least one or more of the four catastrophes; (2) eight students' interpretations challenged the validity of the predicted catastrophes and presented reasons for the challenge; and (3) misconceptions generally centered around reactions involved and the properties of such substances as carbon dioxide and mercury.

        "description":"Presented is a discussion of the evaluation of a parity model, competency-based teacher education (CBTE) program in science education. The evaluation design seeks answers to six questions: (1) Does a competent teacher emerge from the program? (2) Is the program valid with respect to the Concerns Model postulated by Fuller's work? (3) Do the individual instructional components meet their stated criteria? (4) Are the program components arranged for optimum learning? (5) Is the preassessment valid for placement of students in the program? and (6) What is the place of parity (consensus of teachers, school administrators, students, public, and college faculty) in a CBTE program? This paper consists of projected research design problems and considerations. Complete case data will not  be available for four to six years after the first students have entered the program because of the time needed for the students to complete the program and gain experience as classroom teachers. The authors are concerned that the data system remain intact for a minimum of 10 years to collect necessary data on several classes of students who complete the CBTE program and teach for two or more years.

        "description":"Presented in this report is a discussion of a model for developing modularized and behaviorized inservice materials that meet the needs of individual teachers for improving their background in science and for relating this knowledge directly to their classroom experiences. The model consists of four stages: (1) needs analysis of curriculum for content areas, (2) definition of performance skills needed to master and teach content, (3) design of activities to facilitate mastery of the performance skills, and (4) development of criterion-referenced measures to evaluate, diagnose, and prescribe. The model was applied to the development of an inservice program designed to help elementary school science teachers master the Newtonian Mechanics involved in SAPA materials in levels A  through E. The Newtonian Mechanics module was field-tested during the summer of 1972, and data were used for further development and refinement of the module. A pretest-posttest control group design was used in the fall of 1973 with a random sample of 14 college juniors enrolled in an elementary science methods course. A control group (N=14) did not use the module. Data analysis showed that module activities caused learning to take place. (Author/PEB)",

Data were collected from 15 teachers, using a Teacher's Log, and from 1,300 students, using the Views and Preferences-C instrument and Class Activities  Questionnaire. In addition, the Comprehensive Final Examination, Explorations Final Examination, Explorations in Biology, and Biology Student Behavior Inventory were used to measure student outcomes. Fourteen of the 15 teachers implemented the IRA program adequately or very adequately. No significant relationship was found between the variables, type of training and degree of implementation.

This paper is focused on the measurement of social skills and attitudinal development of IRA biology students. The IRA program develops social skills by using four-member teams with specific role designations. The four roles are Team Coordinator, Technical Advisor, Data Recorder, and Process Advisor. Responsibilities for each role are identified, and there is a Team Analysis Form to be used for recording social and cognitive problems occurring during teamwork and for recording plans for overcoming these problems. Social skills checklists, to be completed by  the individual students and by the group as a team, were developed to measure social skill development. In earlier work, 12 attitudinal qualities important to success at inquiry (curiosity, openness, risk-taking, etc.) and 48 related observable behaviors were identified. These served as the base for delineating the attitudinal goals for the IRA program. Reliability and validity of the instruments developed for the IRA program are briefly discussed. Data show good criterion referenced reliability (0.84, 0.81) for two of the six instruments and acceptable criterion referenced reliability (0.64, 0.62, 0.62, 0.60) for the remaining four.

In addition, students completed two of the eight instruments (verbal reasoning, numerical ability) from the Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) battery, to provide a measure of general learning ability. The control group was  found to be superior to verbal and numerical ability as measured by the DAT. Nevertheless, the IRA student groups had significantly superior posttest scores in cognitive inquiry and affective qualities of inquiry. The control group demonstrated significantly higher development in the area of biology content knowledge (BSCS Yellow Version) than did the IRA students. Results appeared to indicate that the IRA program was an effective teaching approach for developing cognitive inquiry skills and affective qualities of inquiry, both of which are considered important goals of science teaching.

        "description":"Reported are the results of an eight-item questionnaire survey of 31 educators (high school teachers and others) representing a nationwide sample of individuals believed to be currently involved in a unified science program at the high school level (grades 9-12). This survey was designed to determine the relationship of unified science to traditional physics and the effect of unified science on high school enrollments in science. Additional information was sought concerning how long the unified science programs had been offered and the relationship of the number of physical concepts presented in traditional physics compared to unified science. Data from the 21 usable returns are included in this paper. Along with other findings and conclusions, the authors suggest that unified  science offers a viable solution to declining enrollments in high school physics and that unified science may have extensive application to current trends in secondary school science, providing science for a greater percentage of high school students.

The Misconception Identification Test (MIT), a 30-item multiple choice test, was developed to require the student to predict the effect of changing certain variables on the equilibrium conditions of selected chemical systems. Six major misconceptions were investigated: (1) mass vs. concentration, (2) rate vs. extent, (3) &quot;constancy&quot; of the equilibrium constant, (4) misuse of Le Chatelier's Principle, (5) constant concentration,  and (6) competing equilibria. Ninety-nine grade-12 chemistry students in four classes (three teachers) participated in this study. Upon analysis of the data, the researchers concluded, among other findings, that students operating at the early or late concrete levels may benefit from a greater emphasis on a laboratory approach in which they can predict and then observe the effect of varying certain variables on a chemical system at equilibrium.

        "description":"In this paper progress made in the systematic study of science classrooms is examined. Discussion centers on research studies related to three questions: (1) What is the nature of the environment in science classrooms? (2) What inputs to the classroom influence the environment? and (3) What environmental characteristics are related to student outcomes? The reviewer concludes that methodologically and conceptually sound classroom research is far from commonplace and that much classroom research is done because it can be done, not because it is related to the most important or the most basic issues. An 18-item bibliography is included. (PEB)",

        "description":"The effects of two patterns of teacher behavior on student behavior were investigated, using eight elementary teachers (grades 1-5) and their 250 students. The teacher behavior was conceptualized in terms of the amount of restriction placed on the activities of science students. Fifty students were randomly assigned, with equalizing restrictions on sex and race, to each of the two science classes for each grade level. Both groups at a particular grade level worked with identical materials under very similar physical plant conditions. Prior to the study, the participating teachers were involved in a 6-week workshop designed to train them to exhibit both student-structured learning in science (SSLS) and teacher-structured learning in science (TSLS) behaviors and used the revised  Science Curriculum Assessment System (SCAS) Classroom Interaction Categories-Teacher Behaviors, developed and modified by Matthews, Phillips, and Good. Collected data were analyzed using Shymansky's modification of Campbell's macroanalysis technique (chains and codes) to produce 5-tally sequences of behavior. Results indicated that teachers could control their behaviors and that, in a non-directive classroom, students' behaviors were more predictable, less erratic, and more task oriented than in a more directive classroom.

Success measures were the number of units a student completed during the semester and the student's end of course attitude toward both the course and the method of instruction. Nine variables were selected for use in the study and included factors related to academic achievement, critical thinking ability, previous science and mathematics courses completed in high school and college. An equation was formulated to predict the number of units a student will complete in a semester (.05 level of confidence). Five variables were found to contribute significantly to the prediction equation for units  completed: cumulative grade point average, number of science and/or mathematics courses completed, score on pretest achievement assessment, class membership (freshman, sophomore, etc.), and grade contracted for. The three variables most influential in predicting student attitude were the pretest form of the Laboratory Attitude Inventory score, number of science and/or mathematics courses completed, and grade point average. The student's attitude at the start of the semester contributed 18.67 percent of the observed variance, indicating that attitudes are developed early, persist, and have a strong influence.

A Teacher Opinion Scale and a Teaching Practices Questionnaire were administered to a random sample of 68 teachers, 73 students undertaking the post-graduate diploma in education, and 16 ASEP members. Classroom interaction was analyzed using an instrument developed by the investigators, a Scheme for Analysing Behaviour in Individualised Classrooms (SABIC). Sixty-three videotaped lessons were  analyzed. Correlations were computed between interaction measures and various outcome measures. Classrooms using ASEP materials were found to be inquiry oriented, with active student involvement. Among other findings was that of a strong negative relationship between teacher-materials interaction and student achievement, indicating that if the teacher is ill-prepared, essential materials are not readily available, and the teacher is unable to quickly pinpoint student difficulties and deal with them, class achievement suffers.

Students chose their own content and method of learning and were free to pursue, or not pursue, this learning whenever and wherever they decided. Students were required to keep daily logs and to submit both written and oral justifications of their self-assigned grades at the end of three-week intervals. Teachers did present activities, audiovisual aids, and other materials but students were free to choose or ignore them. A control class which was individualized to some extent and which made heavy use of modules and audiovisual aids  was used for comparison. Students had also been randomly assigned to this class, referred to as Teacher-Structured Learning in Biology (TSLB). Analysis of figural creativity data revealed a significant (.05) difference between SSLB and TSLB students, favoring the SSLB group. There were no detectable differences for verbal creativity scores. The researchers considered their major successes to be in the affective areas (although these were poorly measured), citing student attitude changes and increased proficiency in identifying problem areas to pursue.

        "description":"Reported is an investigation of the effects on student performance above the knowledge level (Bloom's taxonomy) as influenced by the use of teacher's questioning strategies. Two parallel forms of an elementary science unit on plants and seeds were constructed. In form A, most of the teacher questions were low level in terms of cognitive thinking; in form B, teacher questions required pupil responses above the cognitive memory level. A randomly selected group of 30 third- and fourth-grade pupils was divided into two groups of 15. The control group was taught by a teacher using form A while the investigator taught the experimental group, using form B. Pupils were pre- and posttested with the paper and pencil test reflecting the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational  Objectives. Test scores were analyzed, using t-test techniques. No statistically significant differences were found. Intragroup scores and percent of points received by each group for each test item on the pre- and posttests were also analyzed. The investigator hypothesized that her lack of significant results may have been influenced by the stage of cognitive development of the children participating in the study. The children were at the concrete operational stage. Critical thinking may not be successfully stimulated by teacher questions until children reach the formal operational state of Piaget's schemata. This hypothesis warrants further investigation. (Author/PEB)",

A content analysis is reported along with recommendations for action and change. Chapters of analysis begin with a survey of where women are left out, noting index listings, quotations, illustrations, pictorial chapter openings, and terminology as examples of omissions. Next, methods by which women are put down are delineated, such as sex stereotyping in text, illustrations, and cartoons. Final focus is on subject matter important to women but usually ignored; examples include woman's role in voting, in political parties and elective office, and in relation to the judicial system and  employment. Recommendations for building women up in new textbooks and for what to do until nonsexist textbooks are available are based on the conclusion that urgent revision is needed to incorporate attention to the role of women in political and governmental institutions. The final chapter contains an annotated source list of over 150 studies on sexism in textbooks and practical remedies. (Author/KSM)",

During the three years the Society, Environment, and Science (S.E.S.) course has been taught, the following individual requirements have been agreed upon by students and teachers: 1) to work within the framework of an individual committee; 2) to be responsible for reading of germane books and articles; and 3) to construct case studies involving situations within the environment. Committee areas from which a  student can choose are air, water, population, survey, commercial law, and public relations. Each committee must make an audiovisual presentation concerning an environmental situation, invite a guest to speak to the class about an environmental concern, plan a field trip to a place having environmental interest, and conduct a study of a laboratory community within the framework of the committee purpose. The committee presents a final community report, which is oftentimes circulated to citizens of the community. The most important accomplishment of the S.E.S. program is increased awareness of environmental concerns among the young people. (Author/RM)",

Major objectives of the program are to stimulate students to develop an awareness of their place in history by studying the cultures preceding them, and to encourage students to develop a method of analyzing cultures which would enable them to systematically appraise any society. Each student is provided with a student learning unit containing many resource materials. After gathering data through the use of readings and audio-visual materials, the student interprets and uses the data in many activities such as simulations, individual research, oral reports, and dramatic presentations. The curriculum begins  with a study of the culture, community and history of Montgomery, Alabama, and then takes up tribal man and proceeds chronologically from that time forward. All major world cultures are included. The method of analyzing each culture, a three-step process, involves the student in locating the culture geographically and placing it in a time perspective, overviewing the culture and determining its principal characteristics and unique qualities, and examining the social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, and intellectual aspects of the culture. Evaluation results indicate a larger gain in social studies knowledge for cultural approach students. (Author/RM)",

The students are from low income families; the majority of the teachers have received their training at the New School of Behavioral Studies, University of North Dakota. In determining what is best for each child the staff has four goals: 1) to develop a positive self-concept; 2) to develop enthusiasm for learning; 3) to develop a self-reliant, self-motivated, independent pupil; and 4) to develop personal responsibility. Teachers assess each student's learning skills and learning styles, and then use this evaluation to design a program for the child. The curriculum consists of teacher developed learning packages. The teacher chooses the  package which best fits the student's needs. This basic instruction is supplemented by activity-oriented learning centers: the students choose activities and keep their own record of the work they do in the centers. The student's work is evaluated and new directions in his program are decided upon in a weekly conference between each student and his teacher. Because of the importance of the teacher role in the Madison program, continual teacher training is provided. With the new learning climate, attendance has improved, and many more Madison students are going on to complete junior high and high school. (Author/RM)",

The fair, providing various instructive experiments depicting alternatives for Boulder's future social and physical environment, grew out of the Student Assisted Development of Materials for Environmental and Social Studies (SADMESS) Project conducted by the Social Science Education Consortium (SSEC). Half of the students involved in the project decided to get the community involved in an educational fair. In their effort to get permission to hold the fair and to elicit the active participation of the community, the students made presentations to political and governmental officials, businessmen's groups, local environmental  groups, and school and university groups. After much discussion and debate, permission to hold the fair was granted. Some of the many fair activities included a glass recycling exhibit, pottery demonstrations, fabrication of a 39-foot geodesic dome, and electricar exhibit, and many lively discussion groups. Evaluation results indicated that people found the fair interesting, enjoyable, and educational. The students recorded the entire process of planning and execution of the fair in the Boulder Experiments Scrapbook, see ED 081 707. It contains many helpful suggestions about how to do a better job of putting on a community fair. (Author/RM)",

The six stages are defined and exemplified by the moral issue of the value of human life. The developmental model, as it is argued, is suitable for instruction in schools for developing higher levels of morality in children by intervention challenging the student at one level of moral reasoning above that at which he is operating. The area of environmental education in particular appears as having appropriate content around which to design a series of moral dilemmas. Four dilemmas follow the introductory remarks. Each dilemma describes a situation involving environmental questions for which there  is a series of questions leading to investigation of the moral questions raised. The dilemmas are entitled, \"The Environmental Activist,\"\"The Alaska Pipeline,\"\"The Starving Country,\" and \"Fast Breeder Reactors.\" The dilemmas raise questions about individual action vs. group welfare, environmental destruction vs. national crisis, feeding the hungary vs. acting against overpopulation, and radioactive danger vs. the need for energy.

        "description":"International social indicators, focusing on assessment of the quality of life, measurement of social changes, and program evaluation, are the subject of this paper. Beginning with a look at various national reports which are currently being produced, it is felt that these documents and the data gathering activities upon which they are based form the bulk of much of what is known about international social indicators. The same national reports, furthermore, confront many of the methodological and substantive issues which must be faced in cross-national projects with social data. The major activities involved in using international social indicators are comparison of conditions in various countries, cross-national programs of data collection, and multinational programs of data  collection. The major portion of the paper presents an outline of some major international projects and a discussion of some on-going data collection activities which will provide important new information to the field of international social indicators. Discussion focuses on potentially comparative studies, juxtaposition of national data and cross-national data collection. Tables illustrate social changes in Japan and a typology of international social indicators. (Author/KSM)",

Four short sections discuss the American democratic society, major areas of concern, a definition of good human relations, and approaches to improving human relations understanding in the schools. Two major sections, resource learning activities and inservice training programs, follow. Each resource learning activity is outlined for concepts, behavioral objectives, learning activities, materials, and resources. Activities for grades K-12 include a culture sharing day and units on  American Indian culture, the law, self concept, and culturel holidays. Inservice training programs are also structured by lists of concepts, behavioral objectives, learning activities, materials, and resources. Topics of inservice include black music, desegregation and integration, Indian education, and guidance of minority group students. A self-evaluation check sheet concludes the guide. (Author/KSM)",

The goal of the program is to understand if contemporary Americans can comprehend the social conditions of the present by a study of the nation in the past and if Americans today detect drastic changes in values, beliefs, and practices. The publication is primarily a resource guide which includes the following four units: American Culture; Social Stratification; Political Culture; and Economic Resources and Growth. Each unit begins with an introductory overview followed by a listing of the generalizations guiding the  development of the unit. Major concepts are then defined and the student objectives are spelled out. Sample suggested activities are then developed. Each unit ends with possible evaluation exercises and a suggested listing of instructional materials for teachers and students.

The Delphi forecasting method operated through the submission and successive iteration of three rounds of questionnaires to a wide range of specialists in economics and education and of community economic leaders. An advisory committee of 32 specialists made suggestions for implementation, and review and refinement of the questionnaires. The questions concerned the goals, cognitive elements, content, instructional materials and procedures, personnel, organization, and financing of economic education during the decades ahead. A few of the implications noted in the conclusion of the study include the following: that preservice and inservice  teacher programs should be a goal; that cognitive elements should emphasize interrelationships; that the major areas of content now emphasized should continue in the future; that process rather than content should be emphasized; that personnel with broad based background and ability are needed; that the most effective type of organization would be one of affiliation with higher education institutions; and that there is little agreement on the best method of financing the economic education movement in the future.

A group of 27 educators, historians, school board members and clergypersons were chosen to write reviews of the books and rate them on a five-point scale. Each book was reviewed and rated by three persons, and the total 54 reviews are reproduced. The report presents an analysis of the ratings and a discussion of the findings. Results seem to indicate that a better job is being done of including the contributions and achievements of minorities and of more  adequately reflecting multi-ethnic, multi-racial and pluralistic attitudes.

The final report summarizes the goals, methodology, results and conclusions of the project. The fulfillment of the first project objective was realized in the publication of a guide to innovative approaches in undergraduate education and of two model units, identifying innovative approaches used in undergraduate study of Asian and African societies. The  second project objective, to encourage more interest in imaginative approaches to the study of the Third World and to develop more linkages between those involved in undergraduate educational innovation and those concerned with international aspects of undergraduate curriculum, was met by a series of conferences which explored different aspects of innovation in undergraduate education.

Attention should focus on those constructive elements in Goodman's social thought which provide a dynamic framework for human association, i.e., the libertarian community. The interrelated principles of mutual aid, voluntary association, and fraternity, along with the organic integration of the background, or physical structuring of the choices and alternatives of human existence, and the foreground, consisting of human activity, are identified as essential to the realization of such a community. The libertarian community is further characterized as an educative community where learning takes place through  individual experience. These considerations help to place Goodman within the broad experimentalists tradition in American education. (Author/JH)",

As youth is a class-dependent social arrangement, it should be expected that normative expectations be held mostly by members of the middle and upper classes of modern industrial societies; the expectation of youthful deviance and protest should be absent or weak in the working classes where youth is not extended and where the moratorium between biological maturity and social maturity is rather short and not supported by social institutions. The first of two small, nation-wide surveys in West Germany included asking the respondents to indicate in which areas youth  should behave like adults and where they should behave differently. Answers indicated that the norm of youthful deviance is held by many. Items expressing these normative expectations included in a second survey were two different but related components of expectations of youthful deviance, idealism and radical criticism of existing social institutions. As predicted, support for these statements was related to social class and to age of respondent. (Author/KSM)",

A Population Autobiography includes both personal and collective activities. A Demographic Riddle exposes the student to the concept of exponential growth. The Blackout opens inquiry into factors affecting fertility. Use of Census Data familarizes the student with census data, the concept of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA), and the idea of racial differences in residential patterning. Values clarification  fits population values into the student's larger values system. Community Population Growth, Risk Population, and Population Forecasts are illustrated by newspaper reports.

        "description":"Three fundamental educational issues which are usually ignored in favor of more trival operating problems are identified as follows: how can the educational process be redesigned to focus on the learning, not teaching, process; how to avoid organizing education around rigid schedules and artifically quantified units of subject matter and instead promote development of a continuous desire to learn and an ability to do so; and how to design an educational system that individualizes each student, preserves his sense of self, and encourages creativity? The contribution of management scientists to these problems is suggested as replacing reactive designing by idealization. Idealization rotates planners and designers toward what one does, facilitates involvement of a large number of  participants, and encourages the consciousness of self-imposed constraints, making it easier to remove them. Some of the possible solutions, contained in an idealized education system developed at an international conference of operational research societies, are summarily outlined in a learner-centered design for preschool through university levels.

        "description":"In the 60's in response to the social studies curriculum reform movement two demands on the training of elementary school teachers were evident: (1) more instruction in the parent social sciences, and (2) more pointed attention to the development of inquiry processes in the various fields. In response, the University of Georgia initiated a double major of education and a teaching field and introduced specialized methods courses, where previously such courses were offered by a generalist. Ten years later the hours available to social science courses had actually declined because of increments in professional education, and a review of course work indicated that not one student in the sample of 23 elementary education graduates had taken an upper division social science course.  This case study points up the need to face these topics: the scope of elementary education, the emphasis on field-based experience, and the subject competency. By limiting the scope of elementary education from 1-7, as it is in Georgia, to K-2, 3-5, 6-8, or similar segments, it would be possible to gear teacher training curriculum more specifically to the cognitive needs of a particular age group thus insuring more precise teacher preparation.

        "description":"This quinmester course guide for grades seven through nine examines Latin America and the United States/Latin America relationship through the concept of stability as influenced by various social, economic, and political factors. The goals of the course are for the student to discover the diversity of backgrounds, aspirations, and customs of the states and regions of Latin America through historical and geographic data: to understand the struggle for stability and the variables that affect it; to apply that understanding to an analysis of actual events in Latin America; to examine the role of the United States with respect to Latin America and decide what it should be in the future; and to consider ways in which the United States might contribute to the development of Latin  America and promotion of inter-American friendship. Suggestions for the implementation of these goals through student and classroom activities comprise the bulk of this course guide. A bibliography of resource materials -- texts, films, and filmstrips that are coordinated within the guide, as well as additional works on politics, individual countries, biography, and a miscellany of special interests -- concludes the guide.

        "description":"Social studies teachers in Liverpool, New York, furnish their students with significant cultural experiences by a strategy called total immersion day. Two middle schools organized this experience by having grade six students examine a particular area, its geography, history, culture, and politics. The culminating activity of the study unit, an activity day, is designed to allow investigation of all aspects of the culture studied -- the politics, work, food, and fun. A six to eight week study unit for the sixth grade classes provides the geographic overview, historical summary and information on social, economic and political organization of an area such as the Middle East, incorporating current events from newspapers and magazines. Each sixth grader is required to complete a  special project which is graded and displayed on immersion day. Costumes representative of the chosen culture are judged, along with typical food prepared for a bazaar. Immersion day itself involves a composite of academic and fun activities, classroom and media presentations. Each student completes a questionnaire evaluating immersion day. Preparatory work and the new experiences of immersion day foster appreciation of a different way of life and insight into a foreign culture for teachers and students involved. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The idea of computerized car pooling originated in an American Contemporary Issues class at George Washington High School in Denver, Colorado, in the fall of 1973 when a fuel shortage was imminent. The students saw car pooling as a way to take effective action and, with the expertise of a computer math class, devised a program capable of delivering information that matched students living near each other and attending school at the same hour. Although the student population did not respond as eagerly as hoped, the working community of Denver did, when newspaper, radio, and TV exposed them to the program's potiential. Response was great enough to require an Action Office and briefing teams of students to describe the program to the interested firms. City, state, and Federal  governments also saw the potential of the program. At George Washington the experience brought self-confidence to those students involved, an interdisciplinary togetherness to the teachers, and a new reputation to the school as a viable institution for education.

Development of these units is based on the following principles: an open-ended, self renewing curriculum; the rights of youth in education; the legitimacy of different learning techniques for different children; the importance of making learned skills adaptive; the responsibility of schools in attitude formation; relieving teachers of the burden of having all the answers; and nongraded education. The elective program allows for selection of a particular course or an independent study as well as of a particular learning plan within the course consisting  of a variety of learning activities in each plan. The program requires new uses of old space, a flexibility of programing that allows teachers to work alone, as teams, or as resource personnel, students contracting for the completion of courses, teachers acting as resource or planning agents, and a well-equipped multimaterials resource center complementing the move away from a one textbook format.

The school is organized on a cluster basis, with three hours per day spent on one of the 28 career clusters and the remainder in regular class schedule. The Advanced Social Studies Career Program serves as an example of an academic cluster for students interested in a social science career in areas such as psychology, political science, or social science education. Approximately 100 grade 10-12 students participate in the two-year program. The first year introduces students to a broad base of psychological and sociological concepts. Specialization begins in the second year when a  specific career area is chosen and a self-directed curriculum is designed. Most students elect to do field work and spend one to four days a week at their position. Work placements have included the police and planning departments, creative learning centers, mental health clinics, social welfare agencies, schools and law-related agencies. Evaluation includes letter grades as well as a subjective judgement by the learning directors. Staff and students testify to the value of this type of learning experience. (Author/KSM)",

An open-structured elementary school, grouped into six teams of children from four grade levels, operates with teams of teachers employing individualized programs. A new approach to learning, necessitated by a group of students unsuccessful in traditional programs, was developed to emphasize practical learning and relevance to daily life by centering on a classroom business. Students prepare the materials, produce clay items and hand-painted note cards, and sell them for profit. The business is the basis for teaching fundamental academic skills: math skills are learned as needed  for business operations; language skills are taught constantly through report writing, advertising, and the like; oral skills are improved through contact with community resource people; research techniques are developed as students seek information on purchasing supplies or marketing their products. Results show continued group enthusiasm, improvement of student skills, and considerable personal growth in the children's communication skills. (Author/KSM)",

To add a personal experience dimension to the curriculum, extensive use is made of resource speakers including political and governmental experts, representatives from social  action and religious groups, and local teachers. Student involvement takes the form of school-wide programs and displays, taped interviews and correspondence with experts in the field, participation in local social action projects, newspaper writing, and fund raising.

A lack of clear and precise scientific research is one of the most serious problems in the study of cultures. This study investigates the cross-cultural method in education as a part of the behavioral sciences. The first part of the paper describes the early developments in cross-cultural research designs and the second part, the specification of some of the elements in cross-cultural methodology. The latter section includes a discussion of objectives in cross-cultural research, stages in research, methodological issues, problems of translating instruments across different cultures, and ethical issues. A summary section notes that the early historical development of cross cultural research indicates an  anthropological influence in research methodology while contemporary methodology is the product of a more interdisciplinary approach. It is finally observed that while scientific procedures are the modern trend, a number of ethical and philosophical elements still existing render the evaluations of cultures complicated and highly subjective.

As reported in the first paper, each child interviewed was asked his opinion about a fictitious child's political preferences and shown drawings appropriate to his own background to illustrate people who might influence his choices. The results show the strong influence of parents and indicate circumstances under which that influence  is mitigated. The second paper discusses the interview questions: \"What does the President do?\" and \"What is government?\" They were asked in order to test an assumption of youthful disaffection with government.

This paper has three parts. The introduction discusses the concept of equal educational opportunity, as defined and then redefined over the past five years. The second part identifies the main focus of this paper, that members of the methodological community have ignored basic measurement problems and have directed their efforts towards analysis and design issues and to debates about what to measure, when assessing outcomes of schooling. Consideration of both is necessary to achieve educational reform and accountability. The third part describes the critical problems in  measurement that must be resolved before effectiveness of schools can be assessed: when to measure, how to measure, how to interpret the size of an effect, and how to gauge the extent of program implementation when interpreting the results of social experiments about school effects.

Elective courses such as Greek Cities and Sanctuaries, The American City in the Twentieth Century, and La theme de Paris dans la litterature francaise, treat aesthetic considerations. Urban life is presented in courses such as Urban Sociology and Ethnic Group Politics.

        "description":"This paper identifies and analyzes some of the arguments employed by those who feel that \"we have done enough\" for the less fortunate members of society, who wish to curtail or end Federal involvement in social change, and who have lost sight of the dual goals of individualism and equality of opportunity. These arguments fall roughly into three categories--biological, social, and political--and can be summarized as follows: (1) certain races are genetically inferior; (2) poverty is due to the improvidence or sloth of the poor; and (3) governmental institutions (especially education) are not effective in implementing positive change in individual circumstances. This paper calls attention to the facts that the debate is a very old one and that the critical choice is not between one  set of scholarly arguments and another; it is a choice of values and ideals. Social science research is a valuable and necessary tool or map but not a determiner of our destination. Citizens individually and collectively, not just social scientists, must examine their values and their ideals and on that basis determine which way America is to move. (Author/JH)",

        "description":"Gaining \"relevant\" political knowledge, mastering specific political-administrative competencies, and participating in community processes -- all avenues of curriculum development for political activism -- can be ineffective if a student has been unable to resolve certain psycho-philosophic concerns. These concerns help to explain the nature and extent of a person's approach to social action; provide a framework for considering effective implementation of curriculum; and can explain the difficulty a student has in taking action either because he is unconscious of these issues or because he has resolved them in a way that inhibits his ability to exert influence. The concerns can be grouped as follows: achieving commitment at the cost of openness or openness at the cost of  effectiveness, finding respect for persons a barrier to commitment to cause and to change in institutions; determining the scope of one's power and the role in which to employ it; maintaining personal integrity in the face of challenges from all sides; and identifying without prejudice one's motivation for involvement as being social or personal.

The following items are discussed in the report: (1) project objectives, (2) approach for achieving project objectives, (3) evaluation, (4) conclusion. The project goal is to develop and establish educational programs which will provide students with an understanding of the law, the purposes of the law, and the problems with which the law must deal. The program provides for the development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional programs regarding law, and our legal  and political systems for students in grades K-12, teachers, school administrators, and selected community groups. The project is to be accomplished in three phases over a 6-year period. Phase I (1 year) involved the initial planning of the program; Phase II, (3 years) the development of the program; and Phase III, (2 years) the implementation and dissemination of the program.

The results of the 1971-72 assessment of political knowledge and attitudes are summarized in this report. Chapters 1-4 present national results for each exercise in the volume. The four chapters group the exercises in the following areas: attitudes toward the underlying values of American society; knowledge of the role and function of government; knowledge of and attitudes toward constitutional rights; and knowledge of the electoral process and of the role of political parties. A rationale for the choice of content of the exercises introduces each chapter. Each  exercise is reproduced with its possible answers, and tables show the percentage of responses to each answer. The fifth chapter presents summary results for various sub-populations at each age level. The variables used for the division are region of country, sex, color, parental education, and size and type of community. Each variable is defined, and tables present statistics on each variable as well as on group differences from the national percentage and limitations of the data.

The old African mythology, which consisted of crude, uncomplimentary stereotypes has been replaced by a new mythology which is much more insidious and detrimental to an understanding of Africa. The new is tougher to combat because it appears objective, is supported by evidence, and is constantly reinforced by the mass media. After a brief discussion of a few of the more notable old myths, the paper discusses and critiques the elements of the new mythology and its foundations. Once teachers recognize the elements of the new mythology, they can study and correct them in an effort to help  their students see Africa as it is, rather than as a mythical structure suggests it is.

The basis of Chinese educational philosophy is Marxism-Leninism; the ideal society is that of the Marxian utopia of a classless society. The role of education is service to the state, not the individual. Educational policy is devoted to developing the economy, political consciousness, reform, and universal education. The key concept to methodology is the unity of theory and practice. The new type of intellectual is one of worker-peasant origin. The Great Leap Forward Movement, characterized by de-emphasis of monetary incentives and self-interest and emphasis on class struggle, elimination of class distinctions, and greater sacrifice for socialism, has had  its impact on education. The introduction of productive labor into all full-time schools eradicated the influence of a traditional disdain for manual labor by the educated. A review of the educational achievements under the ensuing seventeen years of communism is impressive in its realistic planning and practical implementation. The educational reforms are not innovative in fundamental assumptions, but do reflect the purpose of Chinese education in aiding in national development, both politically and economically. (KSM)",

It has been in existence since 1954 and spans the entire curriculum from first grade through university. There are virtually no alternatives unless the African undertakes study by correspondence or physically leaves the country, which is rarely permitted by the government. In describing the entire system most attention has been given to implicit and explicit educational objectives and to the instruments of control to enforce conformity to the education system by children, teachers, and parents. Compensating for the lack of  detailed curriculum information, material on legal and procedural controls indicates that the South African Government views Bantu Education as a vital instrument for sustaining the present political, economic and social system.

The committee found that few positive results could be ascertained for the State's programs, that use of cocaine and alcohol have rapidly increased among the young, that the immediate cause of drug abuse is poor self esteem, and that funding for drug abuse programs should be redirected toward learning, health, and emotional problems. Chapters on the drug situation in New York State and on concepts in drug abuse prevention open the explication of the  committee's findings. Recommendations in the areas of education and health, delivery of community health and mental health services to children and families, the media, and alternatives to drug abuse programs are enlarged on in separate chapters of the report. Commission bills to establish a New York State Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Countermeasure Program and to redefine prevention of drug and alcohol abuse are appended along with a list of 1973 hearing witnesses.

One hundred-eighty subjects were randomly assigned to learning groups of three each. Members of the cooperative groups worked together as a group to make up a story, and all were rewarded. Members of the  competitive group worked independently, and only one person was rewarded. Subjects were then given a prize-giving task and a toy take-away task. Finally, the winners chose prizes, and the others received pads of paper for participating. Results indicated that a) children in a cooperative learning environment are more likely to show goodwill toward others than are nonwinners in a competitive environment; b) winners in the competitive situation viewed the learning experience positively while nonwinners viewed it negatively, and c) data supported the prediction of sex differences.

The POI was administered to 11 teachers of the fourth, fifth and sixth grades to measure aspects of self-actualization. The 288 pupils of the teachers involved were administered the &quot;My Teacher&quot; questionnaire which deals with pupil perceptions of specific teacher behaviors. The top four scores on each POI scale were matched with the low four scores, and the respective pupil responses were compared. A chi square test was used to determine significant differences. Results indicate that pupils are perceptually aware of the attitudes of teachers and that pupils  are affected in different ways by teachers who are measured to be at different levels of self-actualization. The researcher recommends further study to provide empiric evidence that the POI instrument should be used as a screening device in teacher training institutions on the basis that self-actualizing teachers are the best teachers.

There are three reasons for not taking such a course of action: a) there is a possibility of revenue sharing, probably in the area of special education; b) state 1202 commissions may have power with respect to the definition of what the roles and tasks of the teacher education institutions are; and c) there will probably be a small amount of targeted federal work out of the National Institute of Education, the Foundation for the Improvement of Secondary Education, and the Office of Education. Federal funds may be merged to make a special revenue sharing authority,  and teacher training done under this authority will have to be via some kind of contract through state education agencies (SEAs) or local education agencies (LEAs). To plan realistically for this possibility, the SEAs and LEAs will have to consult with the 1202 or state higher education planning commissions if they expect to use higher education resources. Targeted federal work will include several areas: a) further serious study of present accreditation practices; b) the credentialling of teachers; and c) better recruitment and counseling for teachers and better counseling for teachers who are in-service; and d) clinical schools.

He gives three reasons: a) the repeal of the draft; b) the stabilization of the fiscal crisis of 1970 and '71; and c) the enacting of the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program, which guarantees every low-and middle-class student a specific level of federal aid. He notes further that the federal government is beginning to put student aid directly in the hands of students, which will have the indirect effect of encouraging colleges to develop programs which meet the needs of these low-and middle-class students. With regard to the budget, he states that the trend is to lessen funding for graduate education in order to equalize the  population's access to post secondary education. Representative Quie endorses the Newman Task Force recommendations that mission-oriented teacher training institutions be established and that all credentialling of school personnel be competency based. The speech ends with a note regarding the need to strengthen occupational education and an invitation to teachers and teacher educators to participate more fully in the decision-making process.

This study represents one phase of an effort to relate modeling and observational learning theory to teacher training. The problem of this study is the development of a) a methodology for deriving component behaviors of a teaching skill from an array of models of that skill videotaped in the natural classroom setting, and b) a methodology for developing a discriminative observation scale based on the derived component. The specific study skill on which this study was based is the oral story reading behavior of preschool children. Teachers were videotaped while reading two  stories to a group of preschool children; experts from the field of child development rated the instances of oral story reading behavior on a seven-point scale of effective and ineffective behavior. Nine teacher trainees, trained in the use of the discriminative observation derived from the experts' work, rated the instances, and the scale was revised.

Second, an aspect of the Responsive Teaching package designed to encourage adaptation by the local user is used to illustrate the adaptation of training strategy, training sequence, and specific content.

The three steps in the strategy are the identification of teaching skills needed in a particular situation, the development of a procedure for determining teacher needs in relation to the identified teaching skills, and a procedure for assisting teachers in acquiring and improving their teaching skills. In a discussion on the identification of needs, the approaches used by the Atlanta Public Schools and the Mentor, Ohio Exempted Village School District are described. The assessment of needs requires that some type of scheme be developed that can describe where a teacher is in terms of the school district's requirement and also provide an  opportunity to chart a direction for improvement. Who should assess these needs is discussed. The author concludes with the following points: (a) teachers should make the final decision on competencies needed to perform effectively; (b) the assessment procedure should begin with the assumption that needs assessment is for the improvement of teaching; (c) a continuum of proficiency for each competency should be developed in order to allow for continuous teacher growth; (d) self assessment should be part of the needs assessment procedure; and (e) the administrative hierarchy of the school district should be involved in the assessment procedure.

The results of this analysis led to the conclusion that research literature on the relation between teacher performance and student achievement does not offer an empirical basis for the prescription of teacher-training objectives. This is due to sterile operational definitions of both teaching and achievement and fundamentally weak research designs in the cited  studies. Moreover, given the well-documented strong association between student achievement and variables such as socioeconomic status and race, the effects of techniques of teaching on achievement (as these variables are conventionally defined) are likely to be inherently trivial.

Competency goal statements were broken down under nine generic headings, with goals designed to guide the learner, teacher-trainer, and supervising teacher at the practicum site in arranging the desired experiences. Current teachers and supervising teachers of the defined population were requested to  indicate the training experience which contributed most to their knowledge and the frequency of use of the knowledge in relation to each goal statement. Responses indicate that: a) a significant part of students' professional preparation in the area of education of the emotionally and socially maladjusted was considered as having been completed without faculty assistance; b) goal statements were judged to be of minor value to practitioners in the field; and c) many goal statements are important but not frequently used.

The first piece, &quot;Letter from the Director,&quot; discusses trends in the parent participation aspect of the program, including problems for parents and teachers. It notes that a major problem for parents in the program has been their concern for a specific classroom and a specific teacher rather than the development of new reorganizations or generalized considerations or remolding school structure. &quot;A Principal's View&quot; and &quot;Parents in the Corridor&quot; are two first-hand reactions to the Open Corridor program. &quot;Parents Speak Out&quot; presents excerpts from interviews with two parents on their reactions to the program. &quot;Movement as Language&quot; is an account by a member of the staff  of the Workshop Center for Open Education, based on her experiences with teachers in the Open Corridor program. The article stresses showing teachers the possible uses of movement with children to extend learning activities. (JA)",

        "description":"This paper describes a contract approach to teaching a graduate course in educational psychology at Kent State University. The instructor, operating from a set of four premises, offered students a choice of differentially weighted project tasks, with specific criteria, which must total a minimum of 50 points. Options included a film critique (5 points), library research (30 points), book critique (20 points), and a group oral report (15 points). Any student not attracted to the options could offer alternative suggestions and negotiate for points. Next, each student signed a contract agreement statement. Finally, each student was asked to complete an extensive questionnaire evaluating the course, contract, and the attainment of course objectives and to complete the Bills' Index of  Adjustment and Values, indicating their contract choice so that variables related to choice could be studied. In conclusion, the instructor plans to keep contract options only for those students who can demonstrate subject area mastery at both lower and higher levels of the cognitive domain. (PD)",

It is stated that the different orientations that exist between the personnel of the two institutions can create constant tension in such a joint project. Seven propositions are examined by the author: a) field contacts should start at high level and move down to participants; b) leaders best understand the objectives of research; c) observers may see connections between events while participants do not; d) participant observation becomes in part, a process of registering, interpreting, and recording; e) the observer should not maintain situations in which he is in conflict with the observed;  f) the observed relies heavily on informant data; and g) rumor plays a significant role in information transmission. It is concluded that while interpersonal and intraorganizational conflict cannot be avoided, an understanding of the factors that produce the conflict, including those discussed in the propositions in this document, may help to manage the conflict and keep it from becoming dysfunctional to organizations and individuals.

The first study compares the responses of 47 teachers in white high schools with 50 teachers in black high schools on the teacher attribute variable, and the second study presents a comparison between 25 black teachers in black schools and 25 white teachers in black schools on this same variable. The test statistic used was Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient. Both studies demonstrated a significant high positive correlation between the groups on their choices of teacher attributes most essential for success in their school. The three attributes  chosen most often by the respondents were competence in exercising discipline, ability to gain respect of pupils, and patience and self-assurance in the face of irritating or exasperating pupil behavior.

It is stated that the coming of the TTT project to the university necessitated defining boundaries of authority: the TTT Policy Committee only controlled TTT activities; Fordham controlled Fordham; fellowships and scholarships were decided jointly by the TTT Policy Committee and Fordham, in that  members of the Policy Committee served on the Admission Committee. Soon, it is reported, TTT fellows found themselves in the mainstream of university governance. (JA)",

Thirty-seven hours of upper-division professional courses are taken by all physical education majors. There are also 35 hours of core courses for prospective elementary physical education specialists. An integral part of this program is the sequential pattern of public school experiences which each student is exposed to. These experiences are arranged throughout the program in the following order: a) observe in the classroom and gymnasium, b) aid the classroom teacher and physical education specialist with clerical duties, c) assist the physical education specialist with part of the lesson, d)  teach part of a physical education lesson under the supervision of the specialist, e) teach a comprehensive lesson to an entire class, and f) student-teach for 2 hours per week. That student response to the program has been positive is indicated by the fact that in just one quarter 10% of physical education students opted for the new program. (HMD)",

The center provides teachers the opportunity to acquire a set of behavioral skills, which are a prerequisite to individualizing instruction, and serves as a model in training the teachers. The training curriculum is presented in modular form with a linear core of required material and a series of branched programmed options. The set of core materials and branching options is divided into three subjects: Advanced Organizers, Behavior Skills Labs, and Classroom Planning. The Advanced Organizer module components are designed to increase the teacher's awareness of the consequences of his current instructional  procedures and to permit the training staff and the teacher to become aware of his teaching. The Behavior Skills Lab is designed to actively involve the teacher in the acquisition of new skills by permitting the teacher to experience the effects of teaching innovation as a teacher and as a student. The Classroom Planning materials facilitate the teacher's systematic implementation of the previous program curriculum to fit the teacher's situation. After the completion of the Classroom Planning component, the teacher returns to the center to reinforce behavioral and attitude changes. The teacher's progress is self-paced, and a criterion-referenced plan is used to evaluate each teacher. (PD)",

During the school year each of the groups met one night a month, and the entire group met one day a month. The project staff kept a schedule of supportive classroom visits throughout the year. Evaluation of program effectiveness was based on questionnaires given to all participants and on feedback on the monthly workshops. Program teachers were compared with two other groups of beginning teachers: a control group graduated from teacher education  programs and a control group graduated from liberal arts programs. These groups were compared at the end of their first year of teaching in three ways: a) total and factor scores on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory; b) Beginning Teacher Questionnaire, developed for this project; and c) Classroom Observation Schedule, which included the Joyce Category System. Program participants developed more open and understanding attitudes while in the program.

Among the many aspects of IGE noted in this speech, two are highlighted: a) the program assists teachers in varying instructional settings to meet different purposes for different students, and b) the program helps teachers develop ways of organizing instruction to accommodate differences in student responses to individual teachers. There are brief discussions of the following components of IGE schools: the teacher as advisor, IGE Clinical Training Workshops, nongraded schools, and the use of an IGE-trained facilitator who serves as intermediary between the different institutions. The speech  ends with a description of the National Evaluation Study of Attitudes towards IGE. The study found that attitudes towards IGE are overwhelmingly favorable. (JA)",

Per pupil expenditures have increased nearly threefold in constant dollars over the past two decades, while student/teacher ratios have decreased. Those who doubt that per person productivity can be increased do so because of their conviction that there is no substitute in education for a low student/teacher ratio. Many of those who press for an increase in productivity build their hopes for such achievement on the potential of new tools such as television and computer assisted instruction. However, the problem is a cultural one. The attitudes requisite for constant improvement of productivity per person must be built into the culture in which the individuals work. Just as the  profit motive in private enterprise has biased the entire sector to high and increasing productivity per person, the low student/teacher ratio goal in education has biased the entire field toward decreasing productivity. Research and Development efforts in the field of student-centered instruction hold the promise of increasing per person productivity in education, as do multi-unit school models, and should be whole-heartedly supported.

Activities for investigating the use of simulation are in the directions of administrative decision making, problem solving and learning, supervision, and evaluation of education objectives; they focus on the development of research data, experience, and skills necessary to challenge four questions about the use of simulation. Evidence that may be used to shape simulation design includes the following: a) a simulated experience can be designed to significantly modify or change participant response behavior; b) the polygraph is an effective  tool for measuring response behavior of participants; c) flexibility in designing simulated experiences can be achieved through the medium of slides or film; d) external criteria are not significantly related response behavior; e) level of dogmatism and decision-making style of participants may have some effect on response behavior; and f) feedback is a significant factor in shaping participant response behavior.

Then, a number of conclusions were drawn: a) with new competencies being stated, new forms of training must be established; b) training which occurs at the undergraduate level can be made more effective only if the statement of competencies is more realistic; c) new teacher education institutions must be established at the postgraduate level if effective teacher are to be produced; and d) with more effective teacher education programs to be established a greater commitment of funds on a level with medical education must be made. To test the reasonableness of the above conclusions, a postbaccalaureate teacher education program was established under a Title III grant to Central Susquehanna  Intermediate Unit #16. Specifically, the objective of the project was to determine whether a program which assumed effective undergraduate preparation could improve the effectiveness of teaching by focusing on the four objectives specified at postgraduate training and on a financial level thought to be necessary for achieving the desired ends. The teacher education program was organized over a 3-year period. The results reported in this paper are limited to the testing of objectives one and two: a) the ability of teachers to bring their teaching behavior under control and b) the ability to generate and test hypotheses associated with learner attention.

        "description":"This study reports on the results of a classroom management system designed to facilitate academic performance in elementary school children. The management system is applicable to an entire class, is operable by one teacher, is cost-free, shows improvement of the student's academic performance, and takes into account individual differences in students' academic performance. Twenty-two third-grade students considered to be low-average in academic performance were given 25 arithmetic problems each week and were allowed to participate in recess activities, which were divided into three levels of desirability. Access to one or more levels during a given week was based on a comparison of individual in-class performance during the previous two weeks. A gain of 12 percent or a rise to  92 percent or higher allowed the subject to participate in any of the three levels of activity; a change of 11 percent restricted the subject to the lower two activity levels; and a decrease in performance of 12 percent or more restricted the subject to the least desirable activity level. Findings suggest that a cost-free behavior management system can be readily applied by one teacher to improve the academic performance of an entire class and that the emphasis upon individual improvement should be designed into future management programs in an attempt to maximize performance of all class members.

        "description":"This paper explores some of the implications of Justice William O. Douglas's dissenting opinion in \"DeFunis v. Odeggard\" for the selection, education, and licensing of educational personnel. Douglas's argument for \"cultural neutrality\" in law-education selection instruments turns on his argument for racially neutral tests. That is, Douglas's argument appears to say that public institutions have a particular responsibility to make certain that they conduct their affairs on a culturally neutral basis where racial minorities are involved. With respect to the selection of students into teacher education programs, Douglas's opinion, if adopted by the full Court, would require substantial revision in institutional practices. Presently, college grades, English proficiency, and academic  references are among the most commonly used criteria for selection of students. These appear not to meet the tests for adequacy that Douglas suggests in his opinion. While selection is an important phase in the training of teachers, Douglas's arguments are even more important with regard to certification or licensing. According to Freeman, Douglas's argument, when considered in the field of teacher education, would seem to make the use of such standardized and heavily relied upon examinations as the National Teacher Examination inappropriate.

Three: The state and its agencies should develop not only client-oriented but fiscally and culturally neutral educational laws and  management and funding systems. Four: The credentialing of educational personnel ought to be culturally neutral at the state level.

It is the basic argument of this paper that the right and responsibility of the state to certify teachers is a legitimate, moral, and rational use of the political power of the state only to the extent that teacher certification protects and promotes some demonstrably legitimate public interest of the people for whose welfare and benefit State-accreditated schools are established. The author limits his remarks to legal issues on teacher certification as found in New York State and in New York City. The author notes that in these areas and correspondingly in most of the United States  constitutional and statutory law leaves broad discretionary authority to public agencies charged with the responsibility of certifying teachers and administrators. The paper proceeds to cover topics such as certification to protect students, parent role in teacher certification, protection of the rights of teachers and administrators, certification of school administrators as management or labor, job-relatedness of certification procedures, racial discrimination and certification procedures, and proposals to reform teacher preparation and certification policies in New York State.

Proficiencies needed for teaching language, history, and religion are described. Second, a preservice instructional program is described which focuses on giving a total picture of the Indian child in the home and school environment. Seven general competencies and several specific competencies in the areas of instruction, community, and student-teacher relationships for the teacher intern are listed. Third, 13 competencies for teaching in a multicultural society are presented which include recognizing that all cultures have the same human needs,  helping students understand their values and attitudes, and instilling in students an appreciation of human diversity. Finally, an ideal competency-based teacher education (CBTE) program for teaching in a culturally diverse society is described, and seven basic characteristics of CBTE are discussed.

First, the following nine essential considerations should be contained in multicultural education programs: (a) the teaching process is always a cross cultural encounter; (b) all teaching tools are culture bound; (c) the classroom is a potent matrix; and (d) the teacher must understand that all minds are equally complex. Second, teachers must develop the following skills to teach students from other cultures: (a) the ability to communicate; (b) the ability to diagnose knowledge and  capabilities; (c) the ability to evaluate the professional literature bearing upon multicultural education problems; (d) the ability to diagnose oneself; and (e) the ability to recognize cultural equivalencies. Third, three basic attitudes that should emerge as teachers work cross-culturally are described. Fourth, the clinical context for multicultural teacher education is described in seven essentials.

The goals, which can be interpreted as specific behaviors by educational groups interested in working in various settings, include the following: (a) recognizing the importance of cultural identification to the development of a strong sense of individual identity, (b) recognizing that a student's first language is a positive factor in learning, and (c)  recognizing that a student's heritage must be preserved. Next, the model of the sociocultural component for training teachers at the University of Texas is discussed. Finally, reasons why CBTE should be used as a strategy in multicultural education are discussed. They include the following: (a) CBTE recognizes individual differences as positive factors in learning; (b) CBTE offers accountability in relation to multicultural education; (c) CBTE has a wide range of sources that a systems approach requires in terms of input; and (d) CBTE presents a vehicle for reform in terms of affective feedback and mastery learning.

The prime requisites for change must be generated in a climate of willingness on the part of educational institutions to assume responsibility of their role as change agents and validate the definition of educational expectations, needs, and priorities as defined by the Indian community. Those definitions of educational needs by the Indian community should then be processed into existing teacher training programs as viable and essential components in the teacher training process. One of the most comprehensive models that deal with the training of teachers for the  enthnically different child is being developed at the Institute for Cultural Pluralism, San Diego State University. It is composed of four basic components: (a) philosophy of education for the culturally and linguistically different, (b) sociocultural awareness in the home and community, (c) oral language and assessment techniques, and (d) diagnostic and prescriptive strategies. The competency statements of this program are included in the paper, as is a brief bibliography. (HMD)",

        "description":"In order to develop teachers who are able to provide effective education to all youth in general and culturally distinct youth in particular, it is necessary that teachers have a commitment to the goal of effective education for all and that they meet this goal by demonstrating competence in the manipulation of content in cultural context. Historically, educators have agreed that: (a) schools should be concerned with the process and the product of education; (b) affective learning should be stressed as much as cognitive learning; (c) the focus of schooling should be on the development of the student as a social and civic human being; and (d) students should learn the basic values claimed by the \"American Culture.\" However, many would agree that the goals expressed by American  educators are rhetoric rather than actual educational practice, especially as they relate to the education of students who are members of minority groups. Competency-based teacher education may be a way of aligning rhetoric whith reality because it distributes the responsibility for more effective education throughout the educational system. Effective teachers must be able to demonstrate knowledge in the following areas: (a) the visibility of minorities, (b) racism of society, (c) language and the minorities, (d) innovation and minority education, (e) the affirmation of minorities in education, (f) the community and the schools, (g) curricula in minority education, and (h) the preparation of teachers for a polychromatic society.

Data from a comprehensive evaluation program is given, including responses from 24 graduates. The data includes the following recommendations: (a) a set of approximately 70 additional competencies to be added to the program; (b) elimination and alteration of activities but not the elimination of any competencies already required; (c) the integration of training with ongoing school programs; (d) the requirement of higher performance levels; and (e) more frequent  evaluation and feedback during inservice training. Changes in eight areas are necessary for establishing a system for evaluating teacher competencies and basing certification policies on that system. Changes include the following: (a) many evaluation models are needed to fit individual needs; (b) reward systems based on years of experience and hours of college credits must be discarded; and (c) individuals, not programs, must be certified.

Correlations relate high and low inference measures of teacher behavior to measures of student learning gain on five achievement tests.

The authors conclude that (a) data taken from these early elementary grades contrast in many ways with previous findings from higher levels, and (b) the pattern of teaching behavior that appeared optimal for producing student learning gain in low socioeconomic status (SES) schools differed  considerably from that which appeared optimal for producing student learning gain in high SES schools.

The two skills, set induction and probing questions, are described in relation to teaching behaviors and complementary learner skills. Set induction, a process by which a teacher makes clear the purpose and direction of a lesson, is used by teachers to motivate students. Learner activities in relation to set induction include developing set induction activities with the teacher and revising specific sets by diagnosing and evaluating their usefulness. The use of probing questions allows the teacher to encourage the student to give more than a  simplistic answer in order to strengthen student understanding of various concepts. The use of probing questions by students enables them to carry out activities as intended by the teacher and is useful in decreasing communication problems in the classroom. The author concludes that the technical skills enable the learner to play a more active and important role in instruction. (A 10-item bibliography is included.) (PD)",

The third  section deals with techniques for formative interim evaluation which may include collecting internal information such as descriptive information and processing critical appraisals, as well as describing physical specifications of the product. The fourth section deals with formative product evaluation in which a version of the complete product is produced.

On the basis of results for the second stage test, distortion in the total group r was shown to be a function of the pattern of subgroup mean differences, total group sample size, and the magnitude of the pooled within-subgroup r.

Two item writing committees developed forty item driver's license examinations based solely on the material in the driver's manual. The two independently developed tests were administered to 117 high school students who took both forms three to five days apart. The two forms were not equivalent according to Cronbach's criterion. As Cronbach suggests, inspection of  individual items designed to measure the same general area, but worded differently, revealed some marked differences in item difficulty. His suggestion that the standard error of measurement be estimated from split-half reliabilities seemed unwarranted.

This paper raises the question of whether or not alternative criteria of success might not be more appropriate. Gains in learning and the extent to which school learning is transferred to situations outside the school are discussed as alternatives. For example, two children with quite different achievement scores might make equal use of school learning in non-school situations. By the first, (traditional) criteria one child is more successful than the other while by the second criterion (transfer) both children have profited to the same extent from their school experience. The discussion suggests the possibility that  sub-populations that are less successful in the schools may be victims of inappropriate criteria of success. We need to develop effective measures of the extent to which people make use of (transfer) what they learn in school as well as measures of gains in learning. (Author/MLP)",

The topics synthesized include measurement of pupil growth, accountability and evaluation, and personnel systems management. A critical review, analysis and synthesis of pertinent literature is the major source of information, although information from recent experience in development and use of training packages for administrators is also used. Conclusions answer questions of adequacy of pupil growth measures as a basis for making administrative decisions. This should have implications for determining administrative roles and training for such roles. (Author)",

The median pretest posttest correlation was +.60. Although there were many systematic changes, students were generally more negative toward their course and instructor at the end of the semester than they were at the beginning. As a separate portion of this project, two instructors deliberately attempted to alter their students' evaluation in one large section of their introductory psychology course. In both cases, there was a significant overall mean difference between the experimental and control groups on the initial evaluation but there was no  difference on the end of the semester evaluation. The results of this study indicate that students form reasonably lasting judgments of their instructors and courses but are also able to alter their judgments as warranted by changing situations.

The Mexican American community was used to develop a cultural-community based definition of giftedness and to develop a measure for identifying Mexican American gifted children using behavior statements. These behaviors were then used to produce an adjectival rating scale and a behavior rating scale which were administered to the parents of the fifty four bilingual children in the sample. These children were administered five diverse tests of intellectual ability. Thirty four children across grade levels were selected into the gifted category on at least one of the five  tests. Nine children were selected into the gifted category on more than one instrument. Of these thirty four gifted children, twenty two were among those for whom behavior and adjectival ratings had been collected. From the data it appeared that gifted children were seen as having a better sense of humor, greater intelligence, more self-confidence, as being more creative, more ambitious, more truthful, more independent, more curious, as having better judgment and being more expressive than non-gifted children.

        "description":"Since at least 1897, educational researchers have reported, with great frequency, \"no significant differences\" with respect to studies investigating the effects on educational outcomes of various treatments, suggesting that many educational variables are relatively impotent. A possible reason for at least many of the no-difference findings may lie in the nature of the criteria and especially in the use of standardized achievement tests as criterion measures. Oftentimes implicit in the use of such tests are the assumptions that learning and achievement are equivalent concepts and that achievement is modifiable through instruction. Given that educational research findings are now being used as a basis for formulating state and national policies, it becomes increasingly important  that greater attention be given to exploring why so many studies report no-differences. Therefore it is suggested that (1) the distinctions between achievement and intelligence, if any, be clarified, (2) efforts be made to develop instruments which are capable of detecting unique contributions to the school (primarily instruction) to changes in the students, and (3) attempts be made to understand both the similarities and differences between the concepts of learning and achievement.

An understanding and awareness of the forces which control their actions on the intellectual-social-cultural environment of the university is necessary in order to implement an effective program in which students evaluate the performance of the instructor. Student assessment instruments often reflect a clear set of skills and personality characteristics which must be possessed by teachers if they are to receive high ratings. On the other hand, the long selection and training process which finally produces a college teacher may systematically deemphasize the acquisition of  those skills and even penalize those who acquire them. In order to improve instructor evaluation the programs: (1) should be under the auspices of faculty and not students; (2) should recognize that there are many profiles of effective teaching; (3) should emphasize growth and change; and (4) should emphasize the fact that students are recording perceptions, not making summative evaluation.

        "description":"Researchers are often in a dilemma as to whether parametric or nonparametric procedures should be cited when assumptions of the parametric methods are thought to be violated. Therefore, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the ANOVA F-test were empirically compared in terms of probability of a Type I error and power under various patterns of mean differences in combination with patterns of variance inequality, and patterns of sample size inequality. The Kruskal-Wallis test was found to be competitive with the ANOVA F-test in terms of alpha but not for power. Power of the Kruskal-Wallis test was grossly affected in all but one situation for nonstepwise mean differences when sample sizes and variances were negatively related and when small levels of significance were utilized. The ANOVA  F-test, however, was found to be generally robust for the types of specified mean differences. (Author)",

Particular emphasis is given to the question: Is item sampling appropriate for estimating the differences between means as well as the means themselves? A descriptive analysis is made of one aspect of a junior high school curriculum. Twenty four students were administered nine items from the &quot;Resourcefulness Test&quot; on three occasions. Item samples were then generated a posteriori from each 24 x 9 matrix, using balanced incomplete block design. Difference scores were examined. A description of student performance on each item across occasions constituted the curriculum evaluation, or monitoring part of the study.

Measurement equivalence was substantiated by correlations corrected for attenuation between MC and CR items. Subgroups composed by sex, intelligence, and socioeconomic status (S.E.S.) showed no interactions with relative MC vs. CR discrimination, but one interaction was found with relative difficulty. In arithmetic, CR items were relatively more difficult (than MC items) for lower than for  higher S.E.S. students. Comparison of overall item-test discrimination favored the CR items in arithmetic and history, but there was no difference in science. (Author)",

These probabilities reflect the student's perception of the correctness of each option. What is presented in the paper is a rationale for probability testing, the current theoretical and empirical findings, and some suggested directions for further research. The rationale given for considering probabilistic testing includes the following points. First, testing involves making decisions under uncertainty as do many situations faced every day and as such should be solved by using a subjective probability decision theoretic paradigm. Second, using multiple-choice testing situations may be a good way of teaching the subjective probability decision theoretic  paradigm. Third, probability testing procedures should lead to more reliable and possibly more valid tests. Fourth, probability testing in conjunction with specific utility functions yields a way of incorporating and handling \"risk\" and \"guessing\" behavior in testing situations.

This study determined the improvement of the participants, as reflected by their perceptions in: awareness and skill in human relations, racial attitudes, and administrative knowledge and skills. It also sought to determine their success in achieving workshop and small group objectives. Three questionnaires were used (one open-ended, another using a Likert scale, and a repeat of the 1970-71 questionnaires to secure longitudinal data) to arrive at base line information regarding the purposes.  The Likert scale is included in the appendix.

A problem faced by the consortium is the need for a concrete definition of what competencies are needed for specific levels of professionalization. One of the major design concepts of the assessment system is that it be decision oriented; that is, that the system be concerned with the utility and feasibility of competence based decision making. Four basic assessment methods have been  selected: ratings, job knowledge tests, job sample tests, and product ratings. The reliability and validity of the assessment instruments are still being computed. In deriving the taxonomy of educational DD&E competence statements, the project worked with a small sample of subjects who may not be representative.

A positive correlation exists between evaluations obtained from each method, suggesting that the two methods are measuring the same behaviors, but the results are not significant, probably because of the low reliability of the supervisor's assessment. Finally, both methods showed the expected change  with educational level, with the direct observation scores displaying a change of two to three times the supervisor's assessments. The results indicate that the method of direct observation is a more reliable and valid assessment technique than the assessment by supervisors. The implications of this conclusion are discussed.

The positively and negatively stated scores were analyzed separately. Agreement with positively stated items showed almost no difference among the various grades. However, the trend toward more disagreement among older students with negatively stated items resulted in significant differences among the grades. It is conjectured that the observed differences result from the decreasing tendency of older children to acquiesce. Implications for attitude assessment are discussed. (Author)",

Only recently, however, has it been suggested that &quot;posttest sensitization&quot; might also limit the generalizability of results. This latter phenomenon would exist to the extent that the effects of a treatment are latent and appear only when a posttest is administered. Under this condition, the treatment would work differently for subjects in the researcher's sample than for other individuals who might later receive only the treatment without the accompanying posttest. To be scientifically useful, it is imperative that the hypothesis of posttest sensitization be capable of empirical verification, and a quasi-experimental design is proposed for this  purpose.

To measure the achievement of the students in the program, standardized tests will be used along with special tests custom-tailored to the PLATO reading and math programs. Pupils will also be observed on a one-to-one basis. To assess the students' attitudes toward the program, group tests will be administered as a background to a more direct approach of asking individual children a standard set of questions about their feelings toward the program. Finally, in the evaluation of the PLATO program there is no control group. However, there is a need to observe the differences that occur in a naturalistic setting.  Consequently, four types of comparisons among different groups are planned, and it is believed that arguments concerning the effects of PLATO can be constructed. (Author/MLP)",

        "description":"The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss reasons why blacks should be concerned and actively involved with practices in behavior modification. The concern is that as these techniques are refined it becomes more important to be sure blacks should be involved at all levels of the application of these procedures when other blacks are subjects of the practice. A review of the literature illustrated that (1) blacks are prime subjects for behavior modification, and (2) the application of behavior modification requires the practitioners to make judgments concerning social values. The Tuskegee Study illustrates how blacks were used as subjects in a behavior modification study before these practices became popularized. There is every reason to suspect that studies, hopefully not of  this severe nature, are being conducted today without the subjects' knowledge of the intentions of the study or the side effects which might occur as a result of participation. Today, behavior modifiers attempt to prove their worth by working with those populations of people who are considered problems and with whom other practices have filed. Blacks are often considered \"hard to reach\" in disproportionate numbers. Alternatives are offered for increasing the numbers of professional blacks in the field of behavior modification to help preserve the integrity of the black community. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A prediction derived from cognitive dissonance theory is that children devalue an attractive but forbidden toy when mild rather than severe threat deters them from playing with it. One study found the opposite effect for lower socioeconomic class children, i.e., a harsh verbal threat produced more devaluation than a mild threat. Since the latter study was judged to contain methodological and theoretical difficulties, the present study was designed to further explore the &quot;forbidden toy&quot; paradigm with lower-income children. Nature (loss of money versus loss of approval) and level (severe versus mild) of threat were varied in a two by two factorial design. It was predicted that lower-income children (a) devalue a forbidden toy more when threatened with loss of money than with loss  of approval, (b) derogate the toy more under threat of severe rather than mild money loss, and (c) devalue the toy an equally small amount regardless of threat level in the loss of approval condition. The data supported the hypotheses. Four- and five-year old black children (N = 43) selected from a day-care center located in a lower socioeconomic neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida, served as subjects. Findings are discussed in terms of reinforcement history and &quot;sour grapes,&quot; suggesting that when a life history which includes repeated denials to requests for attractive objects leads one to believe that when an adult prohibits a toy, it means that the toy will never be available.

The objectives of the program were as follows: (1) to identify pupils with speech defects, (2) to provide diagnostic evaluations and therapeutic programs for these pupils, and, (3) to provide amelioration or remediation of underlying causes of speech problems through referrals to appropriate medical or psychological personnel. The population for this program was determined by a screening test, a Photo-Articulation Test, and by analyzing classroom teachers' evaluations of pupil language skills. Children in grades kindergarten -  eight are seen for therapy one half hour per week. Forty-five minute periods are scheduled for pupils in grades 9-12. Groups range in size from five to six children. Intensive services are offered at selected locations twice a week for pupils with severe speech handicaps. Inservice teacher training, conferences, special programs and activities, parent workshops, and other innovations are accomplished through the involvement of both the field supervisor and his coordinator. Clinical summaries, case histories, questionnaires, tapes, and records are submitted annually to the project coordinator for evaluation of the program. (Author/JM)",

A sample of 60 children was drawn from a metropolitan kindergarten population. The ethnic composition of the disadvantaged group was approximately one-third black, one-third Puerto Rican, and one-third white. The advantaged group was mostly white with a very small percentage comprising Asian and black minorities. Disadvantagement was determined from Federal guidelines. Five tasks were given to each of the children. The results indicated that both groups are typically incapable of taking  another's point of view. Both groups were also unable to conceptualize what something might be like without experiencing or perceiving it directly. However, the advantaged group seemed to be further along in other aspects of operational thought in comparison to the disadvantaged children--decentration, reversibility, and conservation. The advantaged 5-year-olds seemed to be able to respond more correctly to the before-after facets of a particular experience, to the coordinating relationships of the various characteristics of objects, and to the maintenance of the substance of an object while it undergoes change.

All subjects, 24 of each race, viewed all pictures. For each set, they made three judgments, choosing the pictures which represented to them: (1) the most appropriate spacing, (2) enough forward movement to change the interaction, and (3) enough backward movement to change the interaction. Main results were: (1) in all three choices blacks placed less space between interactants than whites, and choices  1 and 3 were significantly different; (2) when interactants moved close enough together so that respondents thought it would make a difference in their communication, there was no general agreement on the meaning of that close distance; (3) when they moved far enough apart to make a difference, the meaning communicated was negative; (4) two measures of actual proxemic behavior were taken, one of which significantly correlated with the stimulus choices; (5) there was a suggestion in the data that blacks use spatial manipulation more than whites during a conversation to punctuate various changes in content and context.

These workshops will supplement and enrich ongoing training programs. It is hoped that such training will be continued from now on for new teachers entering our schools. The program of after-school workshops for new teachers has several distinguishing features. Firstly, it is a decentralized program in which assistant principals develop procedures under the direction of their principals and field superintendents. In this way, workshops can be adapted most  effectively to the needs of the school, the community, the participants, and the pupils. Secondly, it is a practical program. The teacher trainers are experienced staff members who know the realities of classroom instruction, routines, and relationships and who can transmit these realities to their newer colleagues. The workshop supervisors are assistant principals who are equally aware of what is most necessary in teacher orientation and training. The initiative, energy, and stimulation of these teacher trainers and workshop supervisors are the factors that will make the program function. (Author/JM)",

The subjects were all of the available fifth-grade students from two grade schools, one school from each of two mid-sized central Virginia cities. Subjects were shown one of two video tapes  of other students working on an academic task. On one tape two black students were congratulated by the teacher for having gotten the best score, while on the other tape two white students were congratulated. Planned comparisons indicated that black males who viewed the video tape of blacks succeeding expected, and actually did, score higher than black males who observed white students succeeding.

The Laboratory has five major development divisions, each of which is responsible for different areas of educational research and development. Division IV identifies and investigates problems relating to home-school linkage. This position paper was initiated by Division IV in January of 1973 at the recommendation of a special panel of the National Institute of Education. The goals for this position paper were: (1) to expose the reader to the assessment of educational research in our problem area; (2) to help to clarify a set of complex problems associated with interactions of low-income, urban black children and their teachers; and (3) to identify research areas in which more  research is needed. Our immediate purpose was to provide a base from which to identify a target area for further research and study. The position paper is organized by sections. Section 1 includes a set of discussions of the boundaries of the larger problem area. The next section (section 2) is composed of material associated with the delimited problem area and our intellectual framework. Section 3 includes reviews of the literature; and summaries, conclusions, and recommendations. These sections are followed by a bibliography and a set of appendixes.

        "description":"This study sought to assess the effects of psychological warm-up on the verbal creative thinking abilities of first-grade children. The subjects were 96 black first-grade children enrolled in two schools in Athens and Atlanta, Georgia. Both schools are located in poor neighborhoods. Children were randomly assigned to control, physical warm-up, and physical and verbal warm-up groups. Multivariate analyses of variances yielded no significant differences among the groups for verbal fluency, verbal flexibility, and verbal originality scores. The standard administration procedures of the Torrance tests were as effective as psychological warm-up in facilitating creativity test performance. Since the creativity tests have been criticized for their test-like atmosphere, the present  findings and earlier studies would appear to counter the hypothesis that a game-like assessment context is necessary to facilitate test performance and/or to obtain &quot;true&quot; test measures of creative thinking abilities. A recent reappraisal of research evidence suggests that the discordant results may have been the result of several erroneous assumptions, particularly as they relate to the presumed creativity-intelligence distinction.

The Institute for Educational Development began its assessment of Harlem Preparatory School in December 1972. The plan was to collect information in two stages, the first quantitative, the second qualitative. In the first phase, school records were examined to obtain, insofar as possible, descriptive information concerning the school and its students, concentrating on the graduating classes of 1969, 1970, and 1971. The  information thus obtained is summarized in the body of this report; the full annotated tables are appended. Also as a part of the first phase, a sample of students was interviewed to determine their attitudes and opinions about the school. In the second phase, three independent consultants conducted a qualitative assessment by making site visits to the school, observing classes, and speaking with faculty members and students. Resumes of the site visitors are appended. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Long, Larry H."],
        "description":"This paper relates frequency of interstate migration and the likelihood of a child's being enrolled in school at the modal grade for age, controlling for socioeconomic status of the family. The 1970 Census of Population obtained information on school enrollment and current grade, state of birth, residence in 1965, and residence in 1970. A measure of relative progress in school was obtained by adjusting a child's age back to October 1, 1969 and comparing with grade of enrollment. The probability of a child's being enrolled below the modal grade for age is highly correlated with the various measures of socioeconomic status and family stability. This measure of relative progress in school was cross-tabulated with frequency of interstate migration. This indicator understates the  actual amount of interstate migration, for some children could have moved several times between birth and 1965 and between 1965 and 1970, but in each case only one move would have been counted. Frequent interstate migration is found to be associated with an increased likelihood of being enrolled below the modal grade for age among children whose parents are not college graduates. For children of college graduates frequent interstate migration is associated with a reduction of grade skipping. Interstate migration is most likely to be undertaken by well-educated persons whose children tend to do well in school, and for this reason children who have made frequent interstate moves are less likely to be behind in school than less mobile children.

The target school student population is 2,300 of which 20 percent come from families with low incomes. Project Emerge's major objectives are to reduce the dropout rate in grades 9-12, decrease absenteeism, and improve the students' academic performance and attitude toward school. Emerge further proposes to decrease semester suspensions. The project components include: Instructional (language arts, reading laboratory, mathematics laboratory, and staff development); and Service to Students/Cooperative Education (Guidance and counseling, health programs, &quot;shop,&quot; early childhood program, work experience  program, automotive professional training, and inservice training). During the first three years of the project (1969-72) an average of 1,340 students per year participated in the various project components. This year involved almost all of the 1,700 Roosevelt students and about 100 seventh- and eighth-grade MacFarlane students in the various programs. The project appears to have faired pretty well when overall one year objectives are viewed. The number of dropouts decreased, attendance increased, and semester expulsions decreased. However few of the supporting objectives were met. That the overall one year objectives were met seems to be related more to changes in board policy and the courts than in the efforts of Project Emerge. (Author/JM)",

SAP was conceived as a viable alternative to the New York City Board of Education's Cooperative Education Program, one that would provide a more comprehensive educational experience and that would satisfy the needs of disadvantaged urban students. It is the product of an agreement among three city organizations. Each of these three bureaucracies took on a section of the program for  themselves. City Planning agreed to locate sites and to act as an administrative resource base for the program. Human Resources Administration agreed to supply counselors. The Board of Education agreed to supply teachers and act as a manager of operations. The areas of control were well defined for the members of the &quot;troika,&quot; and this arrangement created a problem for the SAP Administration: the Administration had no real autonomy. Owing to tight restrictions on funds, the program had little room to maneuver. (Author/JM)",

The Center was a model of how high-quality racially-integrated education can be used to change racial attitudes of people in the community and to promote racial understanding and cooperation among different racial groups. Attitudes toward the different races were changed, and racial awareness was fostered through the following activities implemented in the program: film of the school shown to community, community visiting the Center, parent group meetings, staff home  visits, parents' visits to the Center, the affective program--with parents, students and staff, and educational component--that involved detailed studies of the four racial groups at the Center, and conferences held with professionals about the emotional needs of the children. Over 6,000 people were reached by the film and approximately 200 people were involved in other activities of the program. Visitors could observe skillful minority teachers working cooperatively with nonminority teachers. (Author/JM)",

It compares levels of racial awareness, racial preferences, and racial identities between two categories of children: nonwhite children adopted by white families and their white siblings who had been born into those families. The data reported in this paper are based on interviews with 204 families in five cities in the Midwest, all of whom adopted at least one nonwhite child. In total, 366 children were interviewed who were between 3 and 8 years old; 199 of them were adopted, and 167 were born to the parents. The data suggest that in families that have adopted transracially, young children have a somewhat different perspective and a different set of attitudes  toward color, and presumably race, than children who are reared in more typical family settings. Fewer of the white as well as the nonwhite children in \"transracial\" homes associate \"white\" with the positive and attractive and desirable characteristics that other white as well as black children do in our society. The Negro children perceive themselves as \"Negro\" as accurately as white children perceive themselves as \"white.\" (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Using data obtained from a National Center for Health Statistics Household Health Survey, a model for children's medical care utilization was tested. The variables included in the model were need, physician supply, family preference, and family disposable income. The first question addressed was the income effect on children's visits to physicians. Most of the apparent effect of income on children's visits to the physician can be attributed to the number of children in the family and the education of the male and female heads. The income effect is not completely accounted for, however. It may be that the price of medical care is such that it constrains utilization except at the very highest income levels. The second question was the effect of other parts of the model on  children's visits to the physician. The analysis suggested that need--as indicated by the age of the child--and family preferences had the largest effects on children's medical care utilization. This analysis brings into question the direct effect of poverty on health care, an assumption of policies to increase health care for the poor. It suggests that the less frequent utilization of physicians by lower income persons is largely due to their lesser preference for that care. (Author/JM)",

Four common patterns emerge from investigations of the program which have been effective in preparing personnel for inner-city schools. First, the programs featured a sound and explicit theoretical base, an analysis of the problem to be addressed by the effort, and a set of logical assumptions which served as guidelines for the direction of energies. Second, an effective and stable operational staff with a consensus of purposes evolved a set of complementary role relationships consonant with the program goals. Third, interagency cooperation at all levels of the program was evident. Fourth, the time, data, and resources necessary for programmatic self-correction  in low-visibility situations were available. The discussion here analyzes the second characteristic, staff development, and examines the conditions for adapting and implementing a transactional leadership style in one program designed to work with inner-city school personnel, the Ford Training and Placement Program. This was a six-year experimental program undertaken by the University of Chicago and the Chicago Public Schools in 1967, funded by The Ford Foundation. (Author/JM)",

Each of the brief chapters outlines one major antidiscrimination law or regulation, specifying what it prohibits, who enforces it, and how complaints should be made. The laws examined are: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246, Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of  1972. The second part of each chapter notes which specific kinds of inequities the law or regulation has proved most useful in remedying and offers suggestions for increasing the strength of your complaint should you decide to file one. In the appendixes are a series of questions to help you determine the degree of racial and sexual discrimination in your school and a listing of publications and organizations which may be helpful in combating that discrimination.

The two experimental groups and the control group were all black high school students. The curricula suitable for use by high school teachers utilized behavioral modification techniques. In one version of the curriculum students went through a process of self-application of the behavior modificatn process. The measure of competence used judges from the students' own environment to determine what might be called \"competent\" responses in this particular environment. The method used for test construction is that proposed by Goldfriend and D'Zurilla in \"A Behavioral-Analytic Method for Assessing Competence.\"  Results of statistical analysis of pre- and posttest scores on the test of behavioral competence did not indicate any statistically significant differences between the treatment and control conditions. Students in the self-study treatment did, however, show significant improvements in attendance compared to the other conditions. These students evaluated their experience very favorably. Furthermore, 13 out of 16 achieved their goals for behavior change which they had worked on in the classroom. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to study the verbal interactions occurring between black and white teachers in recently desegregated social studies classrooms. Specifically, it sought to determine, by studying dyadic interactions, if there were any significant differences between: (1) black and white teacher's verbal behaviors with black and white targeted pupils; (2) the verbal behaviors of black and white elementary, junior high, and senior high teachers; and (3) if there were any significant correlations between findings resulting from observational data, teachers' estimates, and pupils' perceptions of pupil-teacher verbal interaction. Thirteen black and 61 white teachers participated in the study, as did 314 black and 314 white pupils. Twenty of the teachers taught  elementary school, 32 taught junior high, and 22 taught senior high school. Each teacher was observed on four different occasions with the observation period averaging 40 minutes. The data proved that black and white teachers do differentiate their verbal behaviors with bladk and white pupils in desegregated social studies classrooms. Black pupils were not receiving opportunities equal to those of whites to participate in the core of the educational process in these classrooms. (Author/JM)",

Two Directories, this for the classroom teacher and a separate volume for the principal, provide a complete pattern to follow in creating a similar structure within your own school environment. At 111th Street School teachers, resource personnel, and supporting aides and volunteers are organized into two units. The Early Childhood unit serves children who would normally be in K-3. The Upper Age group serves children who would normally be in grades 4-6. Students are freely transferred between the  units based on their abilities. The environment of the 111th Street School is dynamic. Frequent faculty workshops, team meetings, and staff development activities result in improved procedures for managing the ungraded instructional program and the general operation of the school. Objective-oriented hard work by students, staff, and parents has resulted in significant improvement in academic performance. (Author/JM)",

The report is organized into sections describing how the research was performed and presents the results on a set of topics defined as central for providing a useful understanding of the complex interrelationships of race and education. Three purposes were in mind in designing this study. First, there was the fundamental curiosity to discover the changing nature of participation by the black community of Newark in the creation and implementation of public educational policy. This general purpose was transformed into an empirical description and analysis of black involvement in selected aspects of the educational institution. A second base purpose was to  develop an interpretative understanding of the changes which occurred in the areas of race and education. The intent was to develop a model of change that made sense of the events exprienced by the researchers, as well as permitting some degree of prediction. The third basic purpose was to gain systematic insights that have applied significance for those concerned with revitalization of the black community and in the improvement of the educational institution in Newark.

It addresses the question of why some neighborhoods appeared to be more politically influential than others over the distribution of compensatory education funds in a large urban school district. Data for this study was gathered from 100 schools and neighborhoods of the Los Angeles Unified School District. A neighborhood was defined as a political unit corresponding to the attendance area of each school. Political influence was measured as the demonstrated ability of these neighborhoods to obtain and retain compensatory education funds from the district over a four-year period from 1969-1970 to 1972-1973. The study was planned within a framework for political systems analysis conceived by David Easton. The  school district was conceived of as a political system. It was hypothesized that the system's outputs might be affected by differences in demand structures. Specifically, the political influence of each neighborhood was hypothesized to be at least partially a function of its demand structures. It was found that when ethnicity was specified the use of demand structures had a significant association with political influence especially among black neighborhoods. (Author/JM)",

Four types of changes, with their implications, are: graph or curve-extension change (past history and present observable fact--health manpower has become the greatest growth area in modern American employment); scientific and technical change (the effects of innovation); delivery system change (consequent shifts in proportions of people working in different areas); and quality control change (credentialling, licensure, and other reforms). The evolution of two systems, well-care and sick-care, will result in the need for workers in the preventive aspects of health, including dietitians, records workers, health sociologists, diagnostic workers,  expanded-role nurses, and health educators. Educational planners may be interested in the predictions that the use of institutional licensure will soon be widespread, based on task performance, and that changes in delivery and quality control will require a team approach of both educators and practitioners.

        "description":"A study was conducted to suggest an answer to questions in nursing education concerning what educational changes are necessary, which directions those changes should take, and what type of approach should be used to introduce them. The study investigated the extent to which scientifically obtained knowledge is utilized in the process of change in nursing education, using selected innovations as the focus for the study. Information was obtained through a national survey of current curricular innovations in nursing as was determined by questionnaire and through a small number of case studies. The case studies indicated that there were various stages in each innovation process for each curriculum change. Several different modes of identifying the knowledge needed were determined in  an attempt to classify the approaches used for deriving knowledge. The quality of the evidence was not assessed, however. A literature review pertaining to sources and methods of obtaining knowledge was utilized. (A 36-item bibliography and a classification scheme for the approaches used in deriving knowledge are also included.) (KP)",

A conceptual structure was developed with both instructional and performance objectives listed and a generalization statement made for each concept. Content, learning experiences, and evaluative experiences are presented in some detail for each concept. A time schedule is suggested for the one-year senior high course. Included in the course are these concepts: importance of money management (credit, financial  institutions, purchasing, spending); consumer rights and responsibilities (taxes, personal financial security, consumer protection, advertising); and participation in the business community (economic systems, business organizations, employer-employee relationships, pricing, relationship between world of work and the individual).

        "description":"Opinion polls indicate that public confidence in educational leadership is declining, probably because the educational establishment is not delivering what people want. One demand is that education be made relevant to the world of work--an area in which vocational educators are in a strong position. The second demand is that education be made relevant to the achievement of the good life. This apparent dilemma can be resolved by integrating the educational enterprise and bringing together the three domains of practical arts, liberal arts, and fine arts. For this we must develop a fully integrated educational experience, one which will require the integrated effort of all our educational resources and which will cause far reaching changes in our educational methods. The resistance  which vocational educators are still showing toward this necessary integration is based on unsound reasons, chiefly the fear of becoming lost in the larger picture. If vocational educators could perceive themselves, and be perceived, as being in full partnership in an enlarged view of the educational enterprise, they could break out of their present subordinate role. They should not be resisting the integration of education; they should be leading it. (SA)",

An introductory section discusses teaching children with special needs, emphasizing ways of matching teaching methods to the particular problem area. Guidelines are presented for organizing, planning, and developing cooperative teaching programs, and a model is described. The roles of vocational and special education in planning are outlined. The culminating point of the planning stage is the development of instructional task modules, which can then be localized to fit the employment needs of a particular area and personalized to fit individual teacher-student situations.  Guidelines are offered for monitoring student progress; additional program components and supportive services are outlined for the optimum development of a comprehensive program. Seventy pages consist of a teaching guide for 26 employment task modules comprising a core of skills basic to employment in any occupation.

The project, testing the Fourth National Career Education Research and Development Model (Model 4), is located at Glasgow AF 8, Montana, and serves about 180 families concurrently for an average of 9.4 months. The basic premise underlying the program is that family-oriented career education in a rural residential setting represents an effective way to improve the employability, standard of living, participation in community involvement, and life satisfaction of the rural disadvantaged. Program goals are in these major areas: (1) design and development of the model; (2) evaluation of the effects of the  model; (3) provision of guides, methods, procedures, research reports, cost analysis, and learning activity packages; and (4) provision of career education to a significant number of rural disadvantaged within a six-state region. Heads of households spend approximately 40 hours a week receiving basic and occupational education; the spouse spends a minimum of 20 hours in the program. Home and consumer management, counseling, leisure skills, cultural and ethnic understanding, and job placement assistance are parts of the program. (SC)",

A multidisciplinary team from several agencies with a coordinated educational approach was more effective in treatment than the same agencies providing uncoordinated treatment but similar care. An \"educational prescription\" devised by the entire team for each patient became the focal point and format for decisionmaking; it was the official mode of treatment and part of  the patient's chart. The low level of formal education among the patients necessitated involvement of other family members in treatment, and weekly group sessions were attended voluntarily by patients as an educational supplement to the \"prescription.\" (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"In analyzing past and present conditions of external degree programs, it is apparent there is emerging support for lifelong learning. There has been an increase of American interest in the external degree program, particularly during 1970. There are five external degree-related developments which contribute to increasing lifelong learning opportunities: (1) the extension of degree granting authority, (2) the geographic extension of institutional operations, (3) the use of the community as an educational resource, (4) the stimulation of external degree programs for facilitative and supportive services, and (5) the observations and recommendations reflecting professional opinions. Competence has become the organizing basis for degree programs. If external degree programs encourage  learning outside traditional patterns of residential study, such programs increase the need for techniques and services for assessing learning whenever or wherever it may have occurred. The major approaches receiving attention are credit by examination, course evaluations, individual assessment, and validation model external degree programs. There are problems in the programs which require resolution, however, before the \"Learning Society\" becomes a reality. (A 32-item bibliography is included.) (Author/KP)",

They review teacher education and comment on changes in subject content, the use of simulation (role-playing and simulation games), technological changes influencing teaching methodology, the value of individualized instruction, changing institutional roles, and new approaches in continuing education. One of  the two concluding chapters stresses relating the changes to multi-ethnic approaches to classroom instruction.

While the jail administrator is responsible to the community for maintaining the security of his institution, he must also see that security considerations do not deprive  prisoners of their rights. Two-thirds of the document was developed to inform jail administrators of their legal responsibilities to their prisoners and to serve as a guideline in making important policy decisions which affect their prisoners. One-third of the document is a discussion of these areas of \"administrative discretion\" which require carefully documented rules and procedures: mail to public officials, attorney-client relationship, legal resources material, inmate drafting of legal documents, law school programs, disciplinary matters, restrictions of religious practice, and rights of prisoners suspected of crime in jail.

The jail administrator must continually wrestle with the problems of conflicting priorities, limited funds, deficient facilities, and a limited, often ill-trained jail staff; he must find ways to develop his jail as a progressive institution sensitive to the community's needs. Book 6 was designed to alert the jail administrator to the kinds of problems which are encountered during jail planning stages and to the most productive planning techniques. An eight-page case study is presented, designed to be instructive to  those faced with the need for a new jail or for major renovations in a present facility. The jail administrator's responsibilities in the planning process which are discussed include: evaluating the existing facility and generating community support, suggesting possible members of a planning committee, defining the role of the jail, defining future program plans, providing jail population information, making recommendations to planners, and working with consultants and architects. A 20-item examination for the entire course in jail management is included. (SC)",

The Occupational Expectations Inventory developed in this study is offered as a device for diagnosing and clarifying expectations, values, and ethics. The study involved the identification of types or components of occupational expectations, the evolution of a classification system for those expectations, and an assessment of occupational expectations based on the likelihood of a  specific occupational expectation resulting from an occupation and the desirability and importance of that expectation, and the correlation of those values with certain other factors such as social class, high school curriculum, sex, and other variables.

The Performance Based Apprentice Training (PBAT) experimental group completed a full year of related instruction in an average of 61 hours (compared to an average of 187 hours for the comparison group), and scored 30 percent higher on a related instruction final examination. After less than 40 hours of training, the ratings of quality of shop performance of the PBAT group exceeded those of the comparison group after nearly 1,200 hours of shop training. The introduction of a systematically organized and administered self-paced program utilizing criterion referenced  performance standards is likely to result in a significant reduction in training time, since it has been demonstrated that the most critical variable responsible for producing competent skilled tradesmen is not the number of hours spent in training, but the quality, intensity, effectiveness, and sequencing of training experiences.

Functional literacy was studied in three parts, all dealing with the total planning process. First was project planning. Literacy projects must consider national educational plans and be related to relevant economic development plans. They must be selective in certain aspects, yet intensive and integrated with economic knowledge. They should plan for social change using system analysis. Achieving the desired system change requires social engineering taking into consideration the change agent, linkages, the environment, and available resources. The second area deals with programing by objectives using the behavioral approach and scheduling operations and  activities through PERT--Program Evaluation and Review Technique. The third area of study concerns the administration of functional literacy. This area is complicated by the lack of managerial skills in underdeveloped countries and the necessary government involvement. Five organizational problems were considered, and sensitivity training and project administration were offered as solutions. Program budgets must harmonize with reality. (AG)",

        "description":"Mass literacy, largely the product of the nineteenth century European industrial revolution, may be considered in three facets. First, its sociology: human relationships are different when individuals can refer to permanent, written records than when they rely on a person-to-person transferral of information. Literacy also makes possible more complicated and different types of inquiry than is possible in non-literate cultures. Secondly, the cybernetics of literacy: it results in linearity in human thought processes with many side effects. Symbol-use has increased, making people more amenable to systems. Lastly, its political function: it is a mode of affiliation/exclusion used by elite groups to affiliate or exclude the non-elite in systems of ideas and their related  institutions. Whether it represents an improvement is determined by the elite's concept of the nature of man, society, and good human institutions. Literacy has been one means for annexing men and their lives to ideologies, but there is an important distinction between partial and full affiliation. Literacy is not always welcomed by the governing elite because it also liberates while it annexes. (AG)",

The trainer must consider the educational background, age, sex, place of residence (rural vs. urban), membership in community groups, and previous occupational experience of the trainees.

Subsequent investigation showed that learning centers, operated on a student voluntary, informal, drop-in basis, could help these men correct or upgrade their educational deficiencies without causing their key prison work assignment to suffer as a consequence. Men with critical educational deficiencies, although referred to the learning centers, neglected to make up their deficiencies.

Information was sought from fringe benefit records and from interviews with over 1,700 journeymen, union officials, contractors, and other people with experience in and knowledge of the construction industry. Six basic trades (bricklayers, carpenters, electrical workers, ironworkers, plumbers and pipefitters, and sheet metal workers) were studied in nine cities (Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Chicago; Houston; Jackson, Mississippi; New York; Oakland; and San Francisco). Data support the hypothesis that apprenticeship graduates tend to work more than  informally trained journeymen and that apprenticeship-trained craftsmen are more broadly trained and suffer less from unemployment than other journeymen. The case is not as strong, but the data also indicate that apprenticeship-trained men are relatively overrepresented in supervisory positions. Recommendations for improving the apprenticeship system are made. Included are a 60-item bibliography and guides for interviews with journeymen and business agents. (NTIS/SC)",

Just as career education will increase student options in education, employment, and life style, it can also increase options about the family pattern and the potential of an improved physical, psychological, and social quality of human life. Objectives of home economics education as a part of career education include: (1) helping students achieve educational outcomes relating directly to the family, (2) assisting girls to explore the dual role of homemaking and a career, (3)  preparation of both males and females for their roles in the family, (4) experience in family life and home economics-related occupations, (5) emphasis on educational processes related to career education, (6) providing adults with opportunities to develop family living skills, and (7) strengthening the educational climate at home.

While the eighth grade course (given fall semester 1967-68) had significant short-run impact on understandings and attitudes of instructional students compared with control students matched for mental ability, few longer-run differences were observed between the groups during high school and as of the February 1973 survey week eight months following graduation. Surprisingly, wage rates and weekly pay were not associated with scores on a test of world-of-work understanding or with IQ, academic rank in high  school, family income, and other variables, but were positively associated with labor union membership. The entire sample of graduates (instructional plus control) made a remarkably smooth transition from school to work or to postsecondary educational programs. Labor force participation, wages, and work satisfaction were relatively high and unemployment rates low. Major differences were observed between graduates and dropouts. (Author)",

Few programs have been specifically aimed at or involved a significant number of Asian-Americans. This probably reflects the traditions of social responsibility within this group, but it is also true that this group has been overlooked by the government. Programs are now getting underway aimed specifically at their needs, and they have now recognized that there is no stigma attached to involvement in Government programs. A task force has been established to develop recommendations concerning education and training for minority business enterprise. Since the Asian-American response to poverty,  discrimination, and ethnic visibility has been the development of small business ownership, this entrepreneurial spirit must be kept alive and allowed to expand into areas from which it was once excluded. The task force concluded that this is possible and has proposed eight areas where federally assisted education and training could be used. (SA)",

A total program must be provided, recognizing individual differences and needs and put into practice by educators who are not afraid to make changes, to experiment, and to support programs extending beyond the schoolhouse walls. The continuing lack of equal employment opportunity for many segments of society points up the fact that career development, with its essential guidance component, must be an integral part of any human resources development or manpower training effort. The Office of Education is using many new training techniques and the National Task  Force on Education and Training for Minority Business Enterprise is now working on its final report. Efforts are also being directed to the educational needs of American Indians and toward the removal of bias against women in textbooks, school programs, counseling, retraining, and employment. (SA)",

A review of the current law is made as well as a brief summary of legislation leading to its passage. A quantitative model using concepts from the Theory of Markov Chains is established which meets established criteria. This model is then fully developed and discussed with respect to variations in the economy and their impact on the model. The model itself may be used as a trigger or may be used as a guide by which to evaluate other trigger mechanisms. A general approach in the implementation of the various models considered emphasizes conceptual matters, due to a lack of readily available data for the empirical study which is appended to the  document.

Two versions of OIAS, a computer-linked version and a manual card-sort version, were compared with the traditional mode where counselors deliver occupational information during the counseling process. Research findings based on the experience of seventeen counselors and 267 clients, both disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged, found both forms of OIAS to be a more effective means of delivering occupational information for use in the career decision-making process. The vast majority of clients indicated that they would use OIAS again if they needed information in the future, and  that they would like to see OIAS kept in the employment offices where they had used it. Client reactions to OIAS and the findings of the study are discussed in detail.

Each description indicates target population, grade level, and the career clusters included, to suggest the plan's comprehensiveness and its focus, and reviews the plan's rationale and methodologies. Evaluation criteria are developed in two categories, internal relationships (those exclusive to any one plan) and external relationships (those concerned with how the plans relate to each other); the 12 plans are analyzed in terms of these criteria. Among generalizations drawn from analysis of the plans are these: most focus on the secondary level; could be implemented in any area,  rural or urban; require community involvement; consider individual student needs, societal needs, and manpower needs. Recommendations regarding selection, adaptation, adoption, and further developmental activities include some of general interest to administrators and curriculum planners as well as specific recommendations for adoption of the Comprehensive Career Education Model cluster concept in the State of Michigan.

The first section of the report describes why the conference was needed, the process of preconference planning, the structure and process of the conference itself, and how the conference had both successes and failures. The second section focuses on selected operational issues identified by conference participants: the top-down nature of administrative communication; the misuse of paperwork; the frequent lack of flexibility; problems in  research development, dissemination, and utilization; interagency relationships; staff training and supervision; job development; client selection and processing; and measurement criteria. The final section outlines the need for a new approach to research, suggesting: approaches to peer level information exchanges; a two-way communications process, up and down the line; and need for increasing local initiative and innovation.

The program involves three phases of career education (awareness of various career opportunities, exploration of the universe of career opportunities, and actual career or occupational preparation) and the acquisition of the competencies of: job-getting, job-holding, and job progression; effective interaction with economic and related social aspects of society; effective family management; satisfaction with job and life. The curriculum system is a production process cycle  producing changes in students intended to correspond with desired competencies; it is individualized, competency-based, and applicable to rural disadvantaged. Five phases of Model 4 correspond generally to the five years of funding: conceptualization, feasibility testing, program development; program evaluation, replication/diffusion. To determine the status of Model 4 nationally, a study of six family-residential education programs revealed Mountain Plains representing the most advanced stage of evaluation of the family residential educational approach and Model 4 having the most comprehensive innovative form.

Thirty volunteer students from Oakland high schools participated full time in the 1972-73 program that drew mainly on the use of resource persons, large employer organization resources, and community and supplementary resources as instructional activities.

A general success index must reflect both personal and social success. The shifting of emphasis from AGD to anticipatory success has created a new concept of AGD which is an inverse function of anticipatory success. A system of relationships, which possesses a systematic  logic in terms of sociological and psychological research and theory, may be represented in a recursive model incorporating two types of anticipatory success, educational and occupational, as well as achievement motivation, occupational goal impedance, and status factor. The general model which evolved from this study has yielded nine testable hypotheses; it should be evaluated as a general model and then analyzed controlling for race, sex and race, and sex. (EA)",

Instead of viewing referral in a mechanistic manner, it is suggested that referral include a human factor and be seen as a \"transfer of trust.\" The paper discusses the roles of the various participants in the referral process as well as several of its dimensions including: wholistic/atomistic, horizontal/vertical, and personal/institutional.

The higher the wife's education, the shorter the total interval between Bl and the last birth (Bn), given family size; the effect is even stronger if family size is not held constant. Ceteris paribus, more education for the husband, led to postponement of Bl. Higher family income resulted in an earlier Bl and a longer total interval. Women with more education worked during more of the period before Bl, were more likely to work after either B1 or Bn, and  worked sooner after Bn. If family income was high, she was less likely to work after Bl; but if she worked, it was more likely to be between births. If she worked only after Bn, the high income woman's last child was older when she (re-) entered the labor force. (Author)",

Two groups were identified to determine the influence of academic and intellectual competition on personal development. An &quot;average ability&quot; group that was average on the national norms of the School and College Ability Test was compared to a &quot;higher ability&quot; group that was average on the suburban district's own norms. Correlation coefficients were computed between measures of personality development which consisted of the Capacity for Status, Self-Acceptance, Socialability, Achievement via Conformance, and Intellectual Efficiency scales of the California Psychological  Inventory and level of intellectual ability to determine if level of ability rather than peer competition was influencing personality development. Results indicate that a lifetime of educational competition with highly intelligent peers more adversely affects the personal development of average ability females than males. (Author/HMV)",

In addition to physical and emotional problems, these individuals suffer from a variety of unique handicaps. With this in mind, a program was developed to assess the present abilities and future potential of such a client to perform certain work tasks. Subjects were public assistance recipients who expressed interest in receiving vocational assistance. The program was generally seven weeks long during which time the client had the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of work tasks. Through the use of work modules designed to simulate work activities in entry level jobs, such qualities as judgement, perseverence, coordination, and dexterity could be observed by the trained evaluators. In addition,  the program was designed to simulate real work settings where clients were expected to follow normal work routine. Followup data and client reaction indicate that the program has been productive in aiding high risk clients in assessing their present ability to perform in a competetive job market. (Author/HMV)",

Differences examined were: need to be included, need to be liked, need to be controlled, need to control, view of self as an active person, view of specific jobs as being for one or both sexes and view of the role of women in man/woman relationships. High school seniors (290 girls, 181 boys) from two public and two parochial schools in rual, urban, and suburban areas of New York participated in the study on a volunteer basis. Seventh and twelfth grade IQ scores of each student were compared, and  female subjects were given the FIRO-B test, a semantic differential scale on \"myself\", an inventory of jobs to categorize for males, females or both, and questions on the importance of female inferiority in the dating relationship. The phenomenon of female intellectual decline during adolescence evidenced itself in this study, and young women who declined saw themselves as closer to the passive nonassertive ideal of a woman than did young women who did not decline.

The objective of these two sessions was not to design a curriculum or training program but rather to determine what competencies a teacher needs to serve as an effective drug educator. The competencies outlined are designed to meet the drug education needs of students, rather than to satisfy the perceptions and biases of different adult groups. Four philosophical tenets underline the report: (1) The drug problem is a people problem, not a problem inherent in the existence of pharmacological substances; (2) Problems drug use is a behavior pattern usually directed toward avoiding the user's personal problems; (3) The teacher has the  ability and responsibility to help students learn how to use drugs responsibly and to find alternate solutions to personal problems; and (4) The teacher should serve more as a facilitator of learning than as an imparter of knowledge. The report defines several terms in its discussion of conceptual isssues and examines student needs in drug education by age group. Competencies for the role of drug educator are described in three categories: values and attitudes, skills, and knowledge. (Author/NM)",

They bring to school with them all the diversity and advantages or disadvantages of their homes, families, and environments. From all these influences each child has developed a picture of himself, a self-image. We do not know exactly how a self-image is created, but we can and must try to help each child see himself more clearly. Classroom teachers can help children look at themselves carefully in a mirror, to see their outside features which show prominently to the world. Photographs of individual children provide permanent proof of how they look and give confidence to awakening self-images of disadvantaged children. The  importance of being an individual can easily be reinforced in the classroom by the recognition of the child's birthday. These are some starting points for working with each child on his self-image; every child has needs to be met in these basic areas. Enlarging and clarifying self-image is a lifelong process, but boosts toward self-identification and self-importance given during the early school years promote success in school. (Author/NM)",

        "description":"This document reviews a doctoral dissertation on the self-concepts of Negro children for suggestions teachers can use in the classroom to improve the self-images of their own students. Many psychologists and educators view the attitudes and conceptions that the child has about himself as the central factor in his personality, and studies have shown a positive correlation between acceptance of self and acceptance of others. the doctoral project (1970) tested sixth grade students for self-acceptance and acceptance of others before and after a 16-week interaction with adult community models. Comparison of scores with a control group showed that the experimental group made significant gains in self-acceptance and acceptance of others. An implication drawn from the dissertation is  that the teacher provides every child with an adult model for 180 days a year. The suggestion is made that teachers should invite to the classroom adult guests who are good, substantial, necessary citizens, for the purpose of broadening children's knowledge of the community, the world of work, and the adult world they are eager to enter. In growing more accepting of these adults, the children grow more accepting of themselves and thus improve their self-concepts. (Author/NM)",

One group practiced TM as prescribed by the International Meditation Society; another followed the meditation procedure but used an English mock mantra; the third made no change in daily routine. Two &quot;blind&quot; measurements were made of subjects before they learned and began their respective procedures and one measurement a month for three months during practice of thier procedures. Experimental results suggested that: (1) practice of TM or routine daily rests over a 3-month period had little effect on heart rate  or peripheral blood pulse volumes; (2) when compared with practicing routine rest over 3 months, practicing TM appears to have little effect on, or possibly reduces, the relative frequency of appearance of the parietal alpha rhythm; and (3) there is some suggestion that practice of TM for 3 months may instill a state similar to that of sleep stage 1 during the meditating period.

The black war correspondents during World War II had extra problems, but they accepted the challenges of locating and writing about black troops. They were unable to cover the main thrust of the war because blacks seldom had a role in combat; instead they had tough, thankless jobs. Even though they did not win any journalistic prizes, black correspondents made the war easier to bear for  the black soldiers and for their loved ones back home. The 27 black correspondents were given regular assignments for black papers or news organizations.

The first chapter reviews the critical literature of New Journalism, sorting out some of the many uses of the term, then narrowing the focus to look at what some writers who call themselves (or are called) New Journalists say they do and at what others say they do. The second chapter proposes a definition of New Journalism, states it conceptually, and exemplifies it operationally. The third chapter considers some journalistic aspects of New Journalism and discusses the techniques--once the domain of fiction writers--which New Journalists have applied to news reporting.  The fourth and final chapter presents some conclusions. (RB)",

Traubel (1858-1919) devoted 30 years to publishing the &quot;Conservator,&quot; a monthly newspaper that reflected its editor's idiosyncratic philosophy and crusaded persistently for libertarian principles. He made the &quot;Conservator&quot; a champion of academic and artistic freedom and attacked those who sought to constrain liberties. Although the &quot;Conservator&quot; had a limited circulation, its readers--and Traubel's followers--included a number of noteworthy individuals. Among them were Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, soap magnate and reformer Joseph Fels, iconoclastic lecturer Robert G. Ingersoll, and William E. Walling, the reformer who helped found the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Traubel and the &quot;Conservator&quot; deserve recognition for their contributions to the tradition of dissent in America. (Author/RB)",

There is substantial evidence to show that the newspapers and even the mimeographed news sheets continued to argue for redress of specific African grievances as well as for changes in social, economic, and political policies with responsible arguments and in moderate language up until the Emergency Declaration proscribed the African publications in October of 1952. This reassessment of Kenya's African press is based in part on examination of  government records and interviews with some African journalists of the period under study. The primary sources are clippings and tear sheets from the African press collected by Kenya's Criminal Investigation Division. The material, along with comments by colonial officials at the time, shows that the African press of Kenya was by any reasonable standard responsible and moderate much of the time. (Author/RB)",

Both groups are constricted within societal communication networks, with blacks occupying peripheral positions. Special cognitive and linguistic handicaps erect obstinate barriers to reforms in the distribution and reciprocity of power. The assertion of black identity signifies an attempt to reorder the structure of power that governs relationships between blacks and whites. This assertion is probably a necessary but insufficient basis for the political development of blacks in Africa and the United States. It must be accompanied by fundamental changes in the political and economic structure of American society and the international system to be truly effective. Otherwise, the quest for  change may take the form of massive upheaval instead of peaceful reform. (Author/SW)",

Before nineteenth century police court reporting was born, news writers and literary essayists alike had discovered that readers savored light, bright, shocking, and sordid news. The wisdon that crime, wars, fires, and assorted sins drew more popular attention than a \"Tatler\" treatise on tragedy was confirmed when Bow Street police court reports were credited with tripling a London newspaper's circulation. Reporters like John Wright of London, Thomas Gill of Boston, and Dennis Corcoran of  New Orleans created useful models for varied treatments of formal courtroom sources. Their methods of transforming formal testimony from rigid question-answer interrogations into narrative scenes expanded the boundaries for future reporting and advanced the awareness that reporters would find their stylistic heritage in literature, not in the business ledger or the legal brief.

Godkin's editorials appearing in the &quot;Nation&quot; seeks to reveal the major themes on which he wrote and then, by quantitative analysis, to provide some order to the themes and to study the interaction of the themes. Five hundred and twelve editorials, written over a period of 35 years and representing one-third of the editorials Godkin wrote for the &quot;Nation,&quot; were selected for this study. The factor analysis identified four strong sets of themes in Godkin editorials: affairs of foreign nations; corruption at local, state, and national levels of government--and civil services reform; American business, tariff, and fiscal policy; and American expansionism. Missing is strong presence of themes that marked a changing nation--urbanization, immigration,  agriculture, the West, and race relations. Half of the editorials Godkin wrote commented in some form on the affairs of foreign nations. Godkin questioned morality in politics, in business, in religion, and in the press, but not in the plight of Negroes or the jingoism of the 1890s. (Author/RB)",

News appeared to be part of the community's institutional structure and to be carried and consumed on two levels-- the institutional and the interpersonal--distinguished by the extent to which information and the networks through which it was transmitted were routinized. On the institutional level, distributors included express riders, postal agents, and official military couriers. On the interpersonal level they included individuals and groups who distributed and consumed information for private and personal reasons. Future research might  be profitably directed toward articulation of a conceptual framework within which the findings of this project could be generalized to other, similar studies. Once a conceptual framework is constructed, comparative studies of other communities can be undertaken. (Author/RB)",

Harding's term: both Republicans, both touched by scandal, and both having a unique relationship with the press. But in Harding's case the relationship was a positive one. One of Harding's first official acts as president was to restore the regular White House news conferences which had been dropped by Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Harding made himself available to the members of the press corps; he knew about their job, and he went out of his way to make their work easier. There were times of difficulty--during the Washington Disarmament Conference of 1921 when Harding made a diplomatic slip of the tongue and in the summer of 1922 when a million men were idled in two bitter strikes. But for  the most part, the president worked with correspondents on the basis of complete frankness and respect which was reciprocated. The friendship and goodwill between Harding and the press advanced the status of White House correspondents to the point where they could not be ignored by future presidents. (Author/RB)",

They threaten to upset the comfortable monopoly of internal national communications systems which have enrolled national governments to screen intrusions of unwanted information or ideas.

There are fears that the United States will dominate both information flow and cultural patterns as satellites begin bombarding the earth with news, propaganda, situation comedies, and advertisements. The fears are probably groundless for many valid reasons, but the battle lines are already beginning to form and there is a  serious danger that regulations ultimately damaging to the free flow of information may be written into international codes or that satellite communications may become a new cause of dangerous friction.

        "description":"This research examines two information theoretic measures of media exposure within the same sample of respondents and examines their relative strengths in predicting self-reported aggression. The first measure is the form entropy (DYNUFAM) index of Watt and Krull, which assesses the structural and organizational properties of specific television messages, and the second is a content entropy measure developed by the author, which indexes the entropy of respondents' exposure to categories of television programs. The results of the analyses, compared using linear analysis models, indicate that the form entropy measure has higher predictive power than the content entropy measure in relationships with aggression. Previous information-processing literature suggests that nonlinear,  U-shaped relationships are to be expected; nonlinear regression indicates a small, significant U-shaped relationship between content entropy and aggression. This suggests that the relationship between form entropy and aggression may also be U-shaped, and it is proposed that future research using any entropy measures utilize nonlinear models in the theory building process.

Comparisons of the modal verbal responses and semantic differential mean scores were made between the control and experimental conditions. The results of the semantic differential scales were not conclusive.

The thesis of this article is that either area may be appropriate, depending on the plaintiff's motivation in bringing the action. The case of Lugosi v. Universal Pictures illustrates the situational nature of the choice. Historically, the first two privacy cases involved the unauthorized use of a portrait or name for advertising purposes, but the primary interest in both was protecting individual dignity. The central concern in Lugosi, however, was the protection of property rights. Privacy has been recognized as inadequate in protecting celebrities' property rights because the very  circumstance of being well known can prevent recovery. Some courts have recognized a &quot;right of publicity&quot; in cases involving professional athletes, an approach that may overcome the shortcomings of privacy law for celebrities, if not for the ordinary citizen. Any nondignitory cases concerning commercial appropriation of an individual's name or likeness should no longer be regarded as part of privacy law but should be considered as some form of common-law property right.

In the case of the Indian movement, the brief, superficial television coverage of the American Indian Movement's (AIM) take-over of the Bureau of Indian Affairs building in Washington in 1972, following years of negative filmic stereotyping of Indians, accomplished very little for the Indian cause. The take-over symbol simply reinforced the Hollywood image of the Indian as a wanton evildoer. Instead, AIM might have used creative disorders such as restaging the first Thanksgiving and serving broken treaties instead of turkey. To succeed rhetorically, the Indian movement  must concern itself with its image as well as with its grievances and demands. (JM)",

Subjects for the study were selected classes at the University of Nebraska. The classes were composed of the basic speech, oral interpretation, and business and industrial communication courses. Of the total number of subjects, the number of students in the rural ideological group was 165. The measure of difference in language usage was a 300-word cloze passage to which the subjects responded with the words they felt were most appropriate for the blanks in the passage. The data from the clozentropy study were analyzed for differences in language usage between the members of the  biosocial group and between members of urban and rural background. The results indicated that there were no significant relationships between the language usage of the individual and his membership in either an ideological group or a biosocial group. It was concluded that neither membership in a rural or urban group nor the sex of the individual have been established as having an effect on the language usage of that individual in the university setting.

Even when they do find current topics, by the end of an eight-month preparation period both the coaches and the debaters are bored. One possible alternative to this extension of the debate season might be found in current issues debate. Additional emphasis on this type of debate may have significant educational advantages. DSR-TKA operates current issues debate by allowing schools that have elected to participate in current issues debates to suggest topics for debate about six weeks to two months before the tournament. All participating schools vote on the topics and the most popular topic is selected. About three to four weeks before the tournament, the topic is announced. Each school then  provides debaters prepared to debate on one side of the question. After the first day of debate, a parliamentary session is held with all the debaters and judges, and the participants may, if they wish, change the wording or nature of the proposition. This method may have drawbacks, but it does allow debaters a chance to consider topics that are not possible with a single national proposition, and it can also be enjoyable. (SW)",

One of the reasons that the sudden interest in film expressed by departments other than Speech and Theatre has not led to a solid program of film study is that these departments are sometimes teaching film for the wrong reasons. Futhermore, the professors engaged to teach these new film courses may be enthusiastic and quite knowledgeable, but their professional training and research loyalities lie elsewhere. Finally, many of the departments which are now offering film courses do not really view as significant in itself, but as a way of interesting students in other educational offerings. One possible approach to the teaching of film would be for the Departments of Speech and Theatre to move toward an  interdisciplinary film program. Through such a program the Departments of Speech and Theatre could engage other departments in constructing a master plan for film studies, administer a film program, and essentially coordinate all of the activities for film study. A fully developed undergraduate film curriculum of interdisciplinary nature could cross list the courses offered and indicate the departments which would teach the course. Departments of Speech and Theatre can provide the guidance to begin to develop academically respectable film curricula. (WR)",

A three-part measuring instrument was developed to assess attitudes, evaluate perception of alleged danger, and determine credibility. The subjects were 112 college students enrolled in a basic speech course. An 11-minute speech was presented to the subjects by a graduate student in speech. The message was designed to evoke reflective fear. Using a modified motivated-sequence pattern, the speech presented a detailed discussion of the dangers of unregulated firearms, proposed corrective legislation, and dealt with anticipated audience reservations. Of the 112 subjects who had taken the pretest 12  days prior to the presentation, 77 were available for the administration of treatments. Of these students, 22 listened to the 11-minute speech, 33 listened to the same speech with the addition of five visual aids, and 22 served as controls. The findings indicated that the arousal of reflective fear does create cognitive impairment, but the existence of this form of cognitive impairment does not impede persuasion. (WR)",

Two trained observers spent two days with each teacher recording his behavior and the behavior of his students. Underscoring the importance of communication skills, this study showed that there were identifiable differences in behavior among teachers  categorized according to supervisor and/or student ratings. The \"best\" teachers were very dynamic, had superior delivery skills, spent a great amount of time in direct contact with their students, and created a pleasant social-emotional environment through the use of positive reinforcement and banter. Seven recommendations were made for vocational education on the basis of the findings in this study. (Author/RB)",

The results of the questionnaire were as follows: most of the institutions offered two credits for the methods course; with two exceptions the grading system was found to be the traditional ABCDF procedure; approximately half of the institutions indicated that the instructor of their methods course held a joint appointment with education; only three institutions indicated that the methods course was ever taught on a team  basis; eight institutions indicated that there were followup courses to the methods class; and of the institutions surveyed four major units of instruction emerged as most prominent--philosophy-definition, lesson plans, evaluation and testing, and micro-teaching experiences.

What individuals read from and learn through a symbol varies with what they bring to it. The filmmaker's symbolims must be universal and not private. However, symbolism in a film can be so subtle that the audience may be unaware of its existence. A symbol arises when an image is surrounded by a complex of conscious and unconscious associations. Its impact depends on its cultural context. Film directors integrate symbols with theme, character, and predicament. Ingmar Bergman uses water repeatedly throughout such films as \"Winter Light\" where the rushing, sparkling stream contrasts with the still body of a  man who has killed himself. Directors are increasingly aware of the symbolic properties of color. We must bring to the study of symbols aesthetic experience in the form of viewing significant films, rich in symbolism, together with wide exposure to the humanities and social sciences. (SW)",

        "description":"To determine if a relationship exists between peer selection and success in the basic oral interpretation class, 98 subjects from eight introductory classes of oral interpretation were asked during a testing period to rank each other on the criterion of \"Who would you like to work with on the next project in this class?\" The ranking was facilitated by having each class member's name typed on a note card, and the subjects were asked to stack the cards in rank order. The ranking took place four weeks before the end of the semester so the development of social interaction from the beginning of the semester would be stabilized. Results showed that a significant relationship exists between peer group rank and course grade if the interaction between the structure is at a high level.  (SW)",

        "description":"Recently the call for a \"balanced\" approach to the basic course in speech communication has caught the imagination of numerous directors and teachers of fundamentals courses. This paper examines the assumption that a \"balanced\" course in speech communication can provide significant improvement in the following respects: (1) the ability to see logical, abstract relations; (2) tendency to view a communicated message separately from the source sending it; (3) levels of anxiety when communicating; (4) assessment of their own communicative abilities; and (5) inclination to participate in communicative acts. None of the assumed improvements occurred. Results of the study are discussed in light of the experimental design used, since a less rigorous design, one often found in studies  finding significant positive effects of the basic speech communication course, did produce significant differences in two hypotheses.

        "description":"This paper reports on initial efforts to develop and test a model which will account for the formation of communication structure in large organizations. Communication structure may be defined as those metric variables obtained from the quantitative analysis of communication network data. Communication networks may be defined as the patterns of human-to-human contacts through which information flows in an organization. Laboratory and field studies have shown several factors to be related to communication structure. Their findings provide the basis for a model which is formalized into a set of propositions and mathematized as a set of recursive simultaneous equations, that is, a path analytic model. Findings are reported from a field study in which network and other date were  gathered from naval personnel in a large midwest training facility (n=480). The structural data are analyzed in conjunction with the other data to test the \"goodness of fit\" of the theoretical model with empirical reality. While the data do not permit substantive conclusions regarding the determinants of communication structure, the paper concludes with suggestions for revision of the model and further analysis.

A total of 103 schools responded, and each answer was tabulated by total number and then by percentage. Findings showed that (1) speech and drama courses are not required, are often considered as electives, and assume a low-status role in many school curricula; (2) the most frequently cited reason for lack of participation in speech and drama activities was lack of interest; (3) there is a marked improvement in teacher  qualification since 1963; and (4) many schools (39) not offering speech and drama courses plan to include them in the curriculum in the near future, and many other schools expect to improve and expand existing courses and activities.

When developing a silent screen script, students should first choose a subject, then plot out the incident shot by shot, including all essential details and remembering three necessary rules of camera movement, and finally write the script, following specific guidelines. After mastering the silent script, students can proceed to composing a sound script, adapting a familiar narrative poem or a short story.

First, books, puppets, and painted illustrations may be useful in teaching communication theory. For example, children may be made aware of the paralinguistic potential by working with puppets, allowing the voice to indicate to the audience the character of the puppet. Puppetry provides the teacher with an opportunity to talk about communication theory, body language, and caricature. Second, classical rhetoric also shapes many speech activities. For example, the \"Progymnasmatia,\" the first exercises in rhetorical training, can be adapted to elementary speech instruction today; and the advice of Quintilian, Hermogenes, and Cicero on  narrative exercises is immediately applicable to the primary classroom. And third, love of language which has always been a controlling obsession in the Greek mind, should help to lead children to \"discover the potentialities of language in terms of sound and rhythm, to savor the curiosity of language and to wallow in words.\" (SW)",

        "description":"This dissertation consists of four studies which identify some areas of difference between viewers who use the film medium in a personally profitable manner and those who use it less well. In Study 1 a theoretical definition of \"film analyticity\" is developed. An analytical film viewer is defined as an individual who (1) values the film medium for self-enhancement rather than just entertainment, (2) pays attention to coming films and is very selective about which films he chooses to attend, and (3) exhibits critical viewing behavior when he is inside a movie theater. Study 2 operationalizes the theoretical definition in the form of a unique Guttman scalogram. Study 3 examines three kinds of behavioral reaction to film--evaluation, comprehension, and attitude assimilation. Study 4  explores some personal and social characteristics that might differentiate analytical from less analytical film viewers. Results portray the analytical film viewer as an individual who has been interested in and has had experience with the medium since childhood; who, as a child, was around adults with an interest in the medium; and who still goes to many films and enjoys studying about them. As a child, the analytical film viewer attended more cultural and artistic events than his less analytical peers. (Author/SW)",

The modules focus on building collaborative relationships between change agents and clients and on gaining acceptance of planned changes. The first module illustrates the six stages of the problemsolving process and assists participants to identify the factors and forces that should be taken into consideration at each stage. The second module focuses more specifically on the knowledge and skills relevant to  building and sustaining a relationship with a client system. The third module addresses the variables that should be considered when the change agent is gaining acceptance for an innovation in a system. The training modules are composed of a series of activities for both cognitive input and experiential skill practice and can be used with groups of from 15 to 100 people. Volume 2 is comprised of seven appendixes that contain the evaluation design plan and materials, as well as materials for each of the three modules.

        "description":"This paper takes the position that women can and should be represented as administrators in greater proportion to their numbers in public education, and that concrete steps must be taken to remedy the present imbalance. The paper is based on material from professional publications dealing with sexism and the role of women in education; conferences of educators and interviews with participants in these conferences; interviews with people in government agencies, private and professional groups, and several school systems involved in reform efforts; reports on specific school systems; reports of special task forces; and on events on the federal level and in selected States. The publication documents the virtual absence of women from administrative positions in public education,  explores reasons for the declining percentages of women in public education, and reviews and recommends ways to begin reversing this trend.

The conference was held to satisfy the requirements of an Ohio law which makes the State Board of Education responsible for defining the measurable objectives for which schools are to be held accountable. Conference participants in 21 groups considered a paper entitled &quot;Alternatives for Educational Redesign,&quot; while those in 23 groups saw two videotapes on six possible accountability strategies and discussed each. Sixty percent or more of the educational redesign questions received a favorable response. Topics considered  included curriculum, teacher education, and student programing redesign; education governance; and school-community relationship and service. Accountability Model 2, involving the use of achievement and attitude tests, was selected most by participants. Appendixes 1 and 2 present the small group totals and State totals for each of the redesign and accountability suggestions. Votes on recommendations which emanated from the small groups are included in Appendixes 3 and 4. (Author/DN)",

One approach to the problem is to reduce a building's HVAC energy demands by designing it for lower heat gains and losses in the first place. Another approach taken by designers in response to their awareness of the need to optimize HVAC energy has been to seek new systems and equipment. This booklet is a conceptual review of the state of the art of HVAC systems and components that have come out of continuing efforts toward more efficient use of energy through technology.

The shift in system from relatively independent basic researchers to task force action research teams requires a new organizational structure (accommodating theoreticians and practitioners) and a new action oriented research model and method (allowing tentative solutions to significant problems rather than definitive answers to minute questions). Inflexible university discipline structure and the rigid basic research model, method, and technology are inappropriate to meet the challenge of today's future shock conflict  and change. The Sports Institute for Research (SIR) is a voluntary mutual benefit service organization at the University of Windsor in which the physical education faculty has gathered, from the university and the community, scientists, educators, and technicians capable of and dedicated to programs of community service, dissemination of knowledge, and discovery of knowledge. Change Agent Research (CAR) is a systems analysis technique combining organizational development and organizational research, which consists of organizational audit, dissemination of knowledge via communications technology, and organizational reaudit. In short, CAR is a link between theory and practice, while SIR is a link between the university and the community. (Author)",

        "description":"Because of the high degree of interest in education and physical education in Canada, there has been a phenomenal growth in physical education facilities. Physical educators must become facility specialists in order to contribute to the planning, procurement, and utilization of the new complexes that are being developed. Among the most difficult tasks in developing facilities are justification, recording of details of facilities visited, and the manipulation and orientation of areas in a projected facility. In order to alleviate these difficulties, the facility planning team at the University of Windsor developed three main items: (1) the Survey Check List, which provides a structured comprehensive approach for recording details of existing or projected facilities; (2) the  template for outdoor athletic facilities, which provides a scaled guide to assist in recording playing areas, dimensions, and orientation; and (3) the transparent floor planning kit, which consists of transparent plastic sheets over graph paper and various colored, china, flexible pencils which can be used in conjunction with the template to develop the preliminary floor plans and to show the basic orientation from court or floor to floor in an evolving facility. In those situations where a major project is undertaken and the importance of getting the job done with the least expenditure of valuable human and physical resources is paramount, the Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) is an appropriate system.

It focuses on emerging contemporary societal changes impacting learning theory, curriculum, and teaching methodology; and it outlines the implications of these emerging changes for future educational programs and facilities. A sampling of social trends, or &quot;external&quot; data, are described in flow charts as are trends in current learning theory, curriculum, and facility design and planning. The charts are arbitrarily classified into five major areas of concern: (A) The Real and Changing World (Relevance); (B) Economic Accountability (Shared Responsibility); (C) Uniqueness and  Pluralism; (D) Segregation and Integration; and (E) Life-Long Learning and Leisure Time. Each area of concern is outlined in two pages. Societal Changes (Level One Trends) and learning theory changes (Level Two Trends) are outlined on the first page and changes in curriculum (Level Three Trends) and educational facilities (Level Four Trends) appear on the second page. The purpose of this approach is to focus attention on the importance of &quot;reading&quot; and understanding external data and then relating that data to appropriate program and facilities solutions. The concluding section (Level Four Trends) of each of the charts suggests innovative design ideas to challenge those who are developing plans for future educational facilities. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Traditionally, the most commonly used methods of forecasting school enrollments have been those that looked to the past for a picture of the future. In restricting the forecaster to projections of past trends, the &quot;percentage survival&quot; technique ignores a host of current trends implicit in a changing society. A second problem with most widely used projection methods has been the inadequate expression of the forecaster's certainty or uncertainty. This paper presents the rationale, methods, and documentation for ENSIM, a computer based long-range enrollment simulation. A &quot;multivariable&quot; method of prediction, ENSIM allows the forecaster to consider a broad range of data--both internal (i.e., traditional district information) and external data (i.e., the multitude of  social-economic-political-demographic factors that affect the way we live and the way our children learn). Developed and field tested in the small, semirural town of Morgan Hill, California, ENSIM was specifically designed to apply an enrollment projection &quot;simulator&quot; to districts facing extensive future residential development. For this reason, a future land development projection system was devised and integrated into the ENSIM model to provide data on the number of new dwellings projected for each year of the study. This land development projection system is the heart of the ENSIM model. Built into the model is the capability to evaluate and update enrollment projections on a yearly basis. (Author/MLF)",

Education, by being linked to the economy, while lacking commensurate power to shape industrial activities, is not capable of fulfilling its goals for changing the society.

In the summer of 1970, the Office of Economic Opportunity issued a general nationwide request for proposals from interested districts. The Alum Rock District contacted the Center for Planning and Evaluation, requesting assistance in the development of a proposal and, in the event the grant was awarded, help in planning and conducting the study. The grant was awarded in February 1971. When the grant had been officially accepted by the Alum Rock Board of Trustees, the task at hand was the formation of an Education Voucher Committee which would serve as the main  working body at this stage of the study. Its function would be to represent the views of the community concerning the different aspects of a voucher experiment as well as to generate and report its own opinions. This report details how the committee was selected and organized. The report also presents the results of the committee's surveys of community attitudes toward various aspects of the experiment.

        "description":"Open enrollment is a concept concerned with a student's access to schools. In general, it reflects the possibility of parents exercising choice when enrolling children in schools. In East Hartford, parents may seek permission to transfer a youngster to a different school if that school has space for him; however, the parent must provide the necessary transportation. The feasibility analysis reported on here was undertaken to study the possibility of expanding the present open enrollment policy. The study recommends that permission for a student to transfer schools should solely depend on the availability of space. The analysis also attempted to discover if there is now, or if there will be in the future, space available for a greater number of transfers. To add greater  significance to the concept of choice, it was felt that schools should be encouraged to develop on their own and to be as independent as possible. Therefore, a study of school autonomy was also undertaken. Other areas analyzed the education voucher program whereby per pupil expenditures would travel with a student who transfers from one school to another. The appendix includes abstracts of Connecticut law, and samples of materials used in the study and the publicity received. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"Utilizing a grant from the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Rochester Schools Alternative Study has been established to study the possibilities of developing an education system which would: (1) include a variety of learning programs based partially on the best aspects of those previously tried and (2) provide parents and teachers a choice in selecting the school with which they wish to be associated. Such a choice would allow teachers to select a teaching situation which would maximize the use of their particular teaching skills and abilities; likewise, parents would be able to choose for their child a school which they feel best meets his learning style. The use of educational vouchers is being studied as a means of financing such a system. The first volume of this report  includes general background information regarding the origin of the voucher concept, a brief history of federal categorical aid, a description of the current educational scene in Rochester, and other relevant background information. The most important sections of Volume 1, however, describe the rationale for, and the approaches to, the study--the methods used to inform various segments of the school community and the use of feedback from many individuals and groups in the development of a proposed voucher model. Volume 2 describes the proposed Rochester Voucher Model; and Volume 3 comprises 13 appendixes of supporting tables, narratives, and documentation. (Author/EA)",

Specifically, the study strove to determine which of 25 preestablished site selection factors an administrator uses when considering a site for purchase; to what extent (1) educational specifications concerning future site utilization are written and implemented, (2) local citizens participate as resource people in site selection and development, (3) plans are written for site development, and (4) various sources of funds for initial site development are used; and to what extent  sites are used for the daily instructional program, school recreational and athletic programs, and by the community. Two questionnaires were devised to gather information for the research. Sites included in the study were identified by a thorough search of all nontaxable property records located in each county court house. Site selection factors found to be most important include location, accessibility, availability, size, educational adaptability, utilities available, cost of land, site development, public services, and topography.

The management by objectives system, which has been developed and is presently being implemented in the district, and the evaluation procedures set forth in the Stull Act implementation policy are compatible components of the district's system of accountability. At the center of the district's system of evaluation is the goal of improving the quality of instruction for the students of the district. An evaluation system concentrates on the need for members of the staff to plan, develop, and implement ever-improving programs of education for students. Careful planning and preparation are mandatory in a system of  evaluation. By the implementation of accountability systems, using the process of MBO, district and individual commitments are met. The system is not static and should be continuously reviewed to reflect changing needs and conditions. It is only through continual evaluation and modification that the system will continue to grow and meet the needs of the district and all individuals within the district. (Author)",

Analyses of this type could be timely, especially in the light of the spreading \"alternative schools\" movement; growing recognition among scholars that most educational experimentation remains discouragingly close to conventional practices despite dramatic differences in the educational needs of children; concern that cultural pluralism is declining in a society bombarded by electronic mass media; new attacks on compulsory school attendance laws and other time-honored mechanisms of educational regulation; and at least inchoate recognition that the nation's courts have not yet  adequately balanced the interests of the State against the liberties that students, parents, and teachers seek to exercise in educational settings. These considerations are discussed and documented. The most pervasive and liberty-endangering regulatory approach used by State governments is the programmatic approach--the method of prescribing the programs, methods, or procedures by which children must be reared during the extensive periods when school attendance is compulsory. Little attention has been given to other ways of fulfilling government's regulatory responsibility in education. (Author/JF)",

The San Francisco Unified School District assessed the feasibility of the voucher model as it applies to the San Francisco school environment. This feasibility study differs from that recommended by the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which appeared to take the position that the voucher plan is worth a test even if the benefits for a local school district were less than clear. The San Francisco district believed that it would be unwise for the school district to embark on an  experimental program of any kind unless the prospect of improving education thereby was reasonably assured. The principal criteria used to measure voucher feasibility relate to the plan's relevance and realism in terms of the local school environment and prospects for improving the schools; acceptability of the plan by participating schools, public and nonpublic, and parents and teachers; the timing and scale of the proposed demonstration; and its workability--administrative detail, personnel matters, and legality.

The study was divided into two preliminary phases. Phase 1 conducted over a 4-month period, consisted of an investigation of the areas of the city where the plan could best be tested, an analysis of the legislation required to give the school district authority to sponsor such a program, a study of possible admissions procedures, an analysis of financial implications, and a suggested evaluation system. Phase 2 was directed toward providing the school district with additional information about some of the issues. Much of the additional information accumulated during Phase 2 was obtained through three citizen surveys and an  analysis of census data and population trends in Seattle. This report summarizes Phase 2, provides recommendations, and is intended to provide a basis for public discussion prior to making a decision on a voucher demonstration in Seattle. No definite stand has been taken in this report on whether Seattle should proceed with a voucher demonstration. However, a specific plan has been designed which details both the potential merits and the disadvantages of the plan, and which also suggests procedures for implementation. (Author/JF)",

Recent research relevant to the career education movement is reviewed. Career education is defined as preparation for all aspects of successful community living, its key concepts outlined, and the values of initiating such a program discussed. Three areas of change necessary to implement career education in the total school system (such as a shift from content-based to process-based curriculum) are suggested. Presented is a model program designed to develop 22 competencies in three primary curriculum areas of daily living skills (such as managing family finances), personal-social skills (such as  obtaining a positive self-confidence, self-concept), and occupational guidance and preparation (such as occupational awareness and exploration). Academic instruction is considered as auxiliary to skill development. Personnel who should share responsibility with the special education teacher are identified, and ideas for implementing the model are discussed. The changing roles of special educators, regular school personnel, community personnel, and family in a career education curriculum are explicated and postsecondary services are recommended. An epilogue describes topics to be focused on in future Project PRICE working papers, such as career education materials for EMR students. (LC)",

Presented are a philosophy and nine goals of special education, and a list of six guidelines for implementing those goals. The nature and criteria (such as providing for differential grouping) of a comprehensive special educational plan are outlined, and responsibilities of state, district, and local officials are enumerated. A new classification system which groups &quot;individuals with exceptional needs&quot; under four subclassifications is outlined. Objectives  are listed for eight supportive and instructional program components (such as special transportation services and a resource specialist program). Also delineated are objectives and guidelines for evaluation of the program, development of a financial model for special education funding (including coordination of federal resources), and personnel planning and development.

Discussed are steps in establishing a screening program, selection of screening instruments, and screening procedures. Examined are the establishment of an appraisal program, selection of appraisal instruments, appraisal procedures, professional support services, and communication of appraisal information. Resources, and procedures of educational  planning are explicated. The authors evaluate types of available materials and equipment, materials selection procedures, and teacher-made materials. The following topics related to instruction are addressed: general instructional strategies, instruction in the classroom and in the resource room, instruction utilizing differentiated staffing, measures of student progress, communication with parents, maintaining appropriate behaviors, and utilization of teacher aides. Staff development is assessed in terms of the relation between preservice and inservice training, professional competencies, a competency matrix, considerations in designing training programs, and formats for inservice training.

First year research data is presented in the following areas: independent variables such as instructional programs, appraisal protocols, grade level, teacher aides, and inservice training; sampling procedures; control groups; data collection; criterion testing; and results. Data showed generally that if a LH child identified as such is placed in the  regular class he will achieve less than if he remains unidentified, but that if the child is given the full support of specialized personnel, he will gain more than if he remains unidentified. Second year data is provided for the following topics: the definition of LH, research questions, performance objectives, types of intervention programs, research contrasts between 1 year and 2 years of intervention, attitudes of LH children toward themselves and school, criterion testing, and results.

        "description":"Recommendations based on the two-and-a-half-year history of The Demonstration Center for Language Handicapped (LH) Children are reported. Noted are such recommendations as the following: that each school district develop its own operational definition of LH based on the state definition, adding the concept of significant discrepancy between learning potential and performance as determined by developmental age and expectation for remediation; and that a consultant team of medical specialists be available to the educational planner as needed, but that a mandatory physical examination not be required for LH children. The center's philosophy is discussed with reference to such topics as its commitment to the Texas Education Agency, academic performance, decentralization, and staff  development. Evaluated are the center's procedures related to participating school districts, project organization, comparative research, project staff, inservice training, consultants, and evaluation procedures. The following productions of the center are described: the Language Center Handbook, quarterly reports, statistical reports, research monographys, activity reports, and materials required for project operations. Implications of language and learning disability programing are drawn for special and mainstreamed educational services. Materials used for project operations, including appraisal and instructional materials, program evaluation forms, procedural guidelines, conceptual models, and research designs are attached. (GW)",

Twelve teachers identified approximately 550 behavioral objectives with corresponding criterion test items and accompanying instructional suggestions.

Results of field testing supported such  conclusions as the following; (1) that there is a high degree of correspondence between the importance attributed to skill areas by teachers, parents, and community agency personnel with social skills generally ranked highest and occupational skills lowest; (2) that project materials have a high probability of being used and correspond to teacher needs; (3) that the criterion test item approach to assessment of TMH student performance is inadequate; and (4) that there is need of additional behavioral objectives in the occupational skills area which take account of skills needed for success in sheltered workshop situations.

The objectives were incorporated in a volume of 869 instructional objectives (A Catalog of Instructional Objectives for Trainable Mentally Retarded Students) in the areas or language development, social adequacy, and vocational readiness. The behavioral objectives and criterion test items were field tested by teachers of the TMH, reviewed by experts, and compared with major  curriculum guides for TMH programs. Field testing indicated that the use of criterion test items with TMH students was an expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive evaluation technique. In an attempt to establish a more functional and less expensive evaluation alternative, a checklist of 80 sample behavior items was compiled on the basis of importance ranking of skill areas by parents, teachers, and community agency personnel. Findings showed that the checklist instrument was highly reliable in and of itself and correlated very highly with the use of corresponding criterion test items as an evaluation alternative. (GW)",

        "description":"The term \"faux intermediaire\" refers to a student who has studied French for one, two, or even several years, by means of one instructional method or another, and who has some knowledge, though often insufficient and incorrect, of French pronunciation. Three levels of student pronunciation proficiency are described: the phonological, the phonetic, and the \"orthoepique.\" The student called \"faux intermediaire\" belongs to the second category. The pronunciation exercises and correction techniques suggested are designed for use in the classroom and in the language laboratory during 45-minute periods. Particular emphasis is placed on what the student is allowed to practice on his own. The student is never permitted to work independently on a pronunciation exercise, unless he has first  practiced it in class and in the laboratory. Work in the lab is divided into three stages. At the first stage, the student records simple pronunciation exercises for approximately 5-6 minutes. He works for the same amount of time but with more difficult exercises at the second stage, and the third stage is based on the reading of a short text. It is suggested that the teacher keep a small file for each student in order to record his problems and progress. (PP)",

        "description":"Recent political, social, and economic changes in sub-Saharan Africa have created a new demand for English teaching on a vast scale. The immediate aim of English teaching programs in the French-speaking countries should be to increase the number of national teachers of English who can supply the local school systems. Teacher training programs in francophone Africa range from quite carefully developed down to inadequate and struggling. In most countries there is only one Ecole Normale Superieure, where students can take both content courses and teacher training courses. Many more of these schools are needed. The pattern of conducting English classes in French, following a French syllabus, and using French-published texts, is beginning to change with the introduction into the  school systems of new teachers trained in audiolingual methods. Since many newly certified teachers are often placed in remote areas where their contact with English is extremely limited , it is imperative that a program of inservice training, inspection, and seminars be established to continue a new teacher's contact with English and to reinforce his competence. The extreme shortage of books throughout the continent must also be remedied if African English teaching programs are going to continue to improve. (PP)",

Thirty male Black English speakers and thirty male Standard English speakers, all between 12 and 14 years old, were sampled from junior high schools in two distinct socioeconomic areas of Los Angeles. All interviews were conducted with pairs of informants. Among the main findings of the study were the following: (1) Black English intonation  patterns were different from Standard English intonation patterns for all sentence types and situations, except the specific question informal situation. (2) Black English displayed more level or rising terminal intonation contours than Standard English. (3) Black English displayed more rising initial intonation contours than Standard English. (4) The Black English speaker apparently differentiated between reading and free discourse situations by changing intonation patterns, whereas the Standard English speaker did not. (5) Standard English speakers maintain a higher pitch level than Black English speakers. (PP)",

In planning a cultural component for the bilingual-bicultural classroom, the tangible and intangible elements of culture should be included. The tangible elements, such as language, songs, dances, and legends, are closely related to subject matter and thus can be taught systematically. The intangible elements, such as values, ideals, and attitudes, cannot be taught methodically or directly, but are learned through personal interaction with members of the culture group. Since the intangible elements involve process  more than subject matter, they should be incorporated into the instructional processes used in the classroom. These general methods and approaches are recommended as the basis for all the content areas: (1) the creation of a classroom environment receptive to individual differences; (2) the use of the classroom as a multicultural resource center open to all interested persons; (3) a diversity in teaching and learning styles; (4) a flexible curriculum with attainable goals, responsive to student interests; (5) the teacher's role as a counselor rather than a dictator; (6) teachers and curricula that promote the motivation to learn; (7) the use of field experiences; (8) heterogeneous grouping; (9) peer teaching and learning; and (10) cross-age teaching and learning.

The method divides the study of a vocabulary item into two stages. The first stage involves associating the spoken foreign word to an English word that sounds like some part of the foreign word; the second stage requires the subject to form a mental image or picture of the keyword \"interacting\" with the English translation. Thus, the keyword can be described as a chain of two links connecting a foreign word to its English translation. The foreign word is linked to a keyword by a similarity in sound (acoustic link), and the keyword is linked to the English translation by a mental image (imagery link). The experiments compare the  keyword method for learning a Spanish vocabulary with various control procedures. In all cases, the keyword method proved to be highly effective, yielding in one experiment a final test score of 88 percent correct for the keyword group compared to 28 percent for the control group. Several theoretical issues related to the keyword method are examined; practical aspects of incorporating the method into a foreign language curriculum also are discussed. (Author)",

It identifies theoretical questions raised in the literature, but the main emphasis is on the structures, goals, and outcomes of second language programs at the elementary school level. Many issues discussed are specific to different types of programs, such as those designed to achieve bilingualism for students from dominant language groups (e.g., French or English immersion programs in Canada), as well as native language programs that utilize the mother tongue of students from minority language groups (e.g., Italian-Canadians, Spanish-Americans). Most of the native language programs reviewed have been initiated in the United States, although the changing  situation in Canada and, specifically, Toronto is also included. There is a clear indication that motivational and attitudinal factors are related to the success of second language programs. In addition, social-political factors must be considered. Evidence suggests that students in second language programs do not suffer academically, especially when longitudinal comparisons are made with appropriate tests and controls. Furthermore, native language programs may have specific benefits in the domain of social and personal factors. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The course described here offers computer-based instruction (CBI) in the history of the Russian literary language. It is designed to follow an introductory CBI Slavic course. The object of the course is to introduce graduate students in Russian literature to the types of changes that language in general, and Russian literary language in particular, undergoes in time and to discuss how these changes vary over a large territory. The most important single limitation of the CBI system is the speed of presentation of the materials to the student, which prohibits the asking of questions. In addition, the course material itself presents certain limitations in that there are historical gaps in information availability, making programming difficult. The CBI portions of this course were  offered for the first time to a class of five students during the spring quarter of 1973. On the final examination students were tested on: (1) subjects that had been lectured on and reinforced by supplementary reading; (2) subjects that had been lectured on and reinforced by CBI material; (3) subjects about which they had only read; and (4) CBI material not reinforced by lectures. The results demonstrated that the material presented in the CBI/lecture combination was absorbed the best, and generally the performance of the students was better than in the previous class, which had depended on lectures and reading alone. As a final assessment, it is concluded that the CBI material is pedagogically sound. Sample portions of the programmed lessons and tests are provided.  (Author/LG)",

Teachers are urged to promote career education in order to make students at every level of foreign language instruction aware of careers that  either require or that would be enhanced by foreign language skills.

It is the belief in the influence of culture and language on basic structures of thought and personality that divides groups, not the structures themselves. However, linguistic differences among ethnic groups are real. The linguistic distinctiveness of a particular ethnic group is a basic component of its members' personal identity; thus, ethnicity and language become associated in the thinking of those inside and outside the group. Three questions based on these assumptions are currently being studied: (1) Do beliefs about a particular ethnolinguistic group affect the efficiency of learning that group's language? (2) Is there any basis to the belief that in becoming bilingual or bicultural cognitive powers  are dulled and identities are diluted? (3) Should minority groups try to maintain their ethnolinguistic identities and heritage in the North American setting? Research on English-Canadians learning French demonstrated that attitudes held toward the French strongly influenced the learning of the language. As for bilingualism, French-Canadian bilingual students tested higher than carefully matched monolinguals on both verbal and nonverbal measures of intelligence. Also, testing of adolescent boys of mixed French-English parentage demonstrated that there is no basis for the belief that biculturalism produces a loss of identity. Finally, results of work with French-Canadians, and French-Americans in Maine, substantiate the need for the maintenance of minority ethnolinguistic identities.  (LG)",

Although the great majority of speakers control both dialect, which they use in different contextual situations, there are some speakers who control only one dialect. Through an analysis of examples, it is concluded that with respect to negation, the colloquial dialect is simpler because it lacks three processes present in the standard dialect: 1) \"ne\"-insertion, 2) negative-deletion, and 3) \"ne\"-deletion. The general tendency of the colloquial dialect to omit rules  referring to deletion under identity is also shown. A list of references completes the paper. (Author/PP)",

The similarity of the PSP and the Main Stress Rule (MSR) is examined through the application of these rules to polysyllabic monomorphemic and polymorphemic words. This analysis is based on the hypothesis that the native speaker divides polysyllabic words considered by the linguist to be monomorphemic, such as &quot;Monongahela&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma,&quot; into two morphic units. For these words the PSP is found to be a repetition of the MSR in that two cycles through the MSR achieve the results of the PSP without the addition of the latter rule. Indirect evidence for the native speaker's hypothesized morphic division is found in  the morph reshaping processes of clipping and iconic reshaping of loanwords. The need for further attention to speakers' intuitions about lexical analysis is stressed. (KM)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to examine certain social factors, such as sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic group, as they influence the speech of a sample of black and white children, aged 10-12, from a lower socioeconomic group in Albany, New York. The tapes of the interviews were analyzed to determine the usage of the nonstandard forms of four grammatical features, the multiple negative and the absence of suffixal -Z (i.e., absence of the suffix marking plural and possessive nouns and the third person singular form of the verb). The results showed that the race of interviewer and sex of child had little influence on the use of the four features, as compared with race of child, which was a factor influencing frequency of use of two of the features, multiple negation and the absence  of the third singular marker. It is noted that any explanation of the large quantitative difference between the black and white children's realization of these two nonstandard forms must take into account differences in social interaction patterns and the expectancies of the two groups. Results of this investigation are compared with those of the Washington and Detroit studies. (Author/LG)",

However, there is a danger that in the defense of orthodox concepts and methods, the actual needs of the students will not be met, and guidance from the new directions in linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and education will be overlooked. To strengthen TESOL programs, suggested improvements include: (1) increased emphasis on cultural sensitization so that the non-English speaking cultures are appreciated, while the American English of the target culture is learned; (2) more relevant ESL instruction at the adult level, making classroom work related to life goals and choices; and (3) reorganized ESL training in which the English class serves as support  component supplemental to regular content teaching areas, rather than as an isolated part of the curriculum. A dominant language support program, used in conjunction with the English content and support classes, would provide a total bilingual support program. Thus, the training of TESOL teachers would center on educational methodology rather than linguistics and all teachers would be trained in applying second language teaching methods in regular content courses.

To solve this problem, there has to be a change in our basic attitudes and philosophies about language teaching and learning. Language courses must be transformed from passive exercises into active experiences. Bold new approaches must be considered, such as applied group dynamics, incentive grades based on effectiveness of personal approach, and close coordination with English departments and other branches of the humanities. The Government employs teams of native speakers and linguistics to teach foreign languages to Federal employees; native English speakers with foreign language majors do not meet the requirements for  teaching at the Foreign Service Institute. The number of other available government jobs where language ability is primary is relatively small. The Federal Government can, under existing circumstances, do little to expand the job market for foreign language majors, but foreign language competence can be helpful to a job applicant for many kinds of positions. An aggressive attempt must be made to strengthen the position of foreign language study as communication within the framework of the liberal arts curriculum. (Author/PP)",

The samples represent a variety of styles of modern prose, selected for their representative quality rather than their literary merit. The collection consists primarily of samples from books and some major periodicals available through the library at the National Taiwan University and the National Central Library. For  each sample collected, a copy was made and then transcribed into a modified Pin-yin romanization. For each sample, counts were taken of the following: names, formulae, figures, foreign strings, foreign words, words (in total), and syllables. After the samples were collected and romanized, they were then codified. A manual accompanies the corpus, which comprises one magnetic tape of about 1,200 feet, available in either 7-track or 9-track mode. (Author/LG)",

The method divides the study of a vocabulary item into two stages. The first stage requires S to associate the spoken foreign word to an English word (the keyword) that sounds like some part of the foreign word; the second stage requires S to form a mental image or picture of the keyword \"interacting\" with the English translation. Thus, the keyword method can be described as a chain of two links connecting a foreign word to its English translation through the mediation of a keyword: the foreign word is linked to a keyword by a similarity in sound (acoustic link), and the keyword is linked to the English translation by a mental  image (imagery link). The experiment reported here compared the keyword method with an unconstrained control procedure using Russian vocabulary. On all measures the keyword method proved to be highly effective, yielding for the most critical test a score of 72 percent correct for the keyword group compared to 46 percent for the control group.

Language is now seen as a useful tool, a vehicle for communication. This attitude can be interpreted as a move away from culture-dependence in language teaching. The next quarter-century is likely to produce a wide range of technological developments based on the inexpensive videotape cassette. The trend toward individualized instruction and the growing demand for self-study materials will lead to a renewed interest in programmed learning. Certain general  principles of professional training for language teachers will be detailed by the turn of the century, principles which will define: (1) the parameters of the language teacher's job, (2) the attributes of a teacher, (3) the components of a teacher's special training, (5) standards of training in practical skills, and (6) methods of achieving a realistic program. The relationship between language teaching and the disciplines of linguistics and psychology will be defined. As language teaching develops on its own theoretical bases, the direct reliance of language teachers on linguistics and psychology will wane. We are moving toward a greater understanding of what is actually involved in the complex processes of learning and teaching languages. (PMP)",

        "description":"The two elements of drama are action and dialogue, and both have a place in the foreign-language learning experience. They may be introduced into the classroom by means of a \"drama lab,\" a learning activity that permits students to act out foreign language materials such as tableaus, poetry, ballads, folklore, and plays. Drama allows the student to express his individuality, and the material, if it is culture-related, brings to life the cultural context of the foreign language. The primary benefit of the drama lab is the creation of a situation in which communication in the target language is mandatory. The two basic rules for conducting a drama lab are: (1) All the students should participate actively. (2) All performances should be given in class, rather than as an  extracurricular activity. Classroom drama may be introduced early, beginning with tableaus, perhaps puppet shows or enactments of national legends in elementary school classes. Type and content of the material should vary according to language learning level, maturity, and age. Timing and planning are also important to the effectiveness of drama as a teaching technique. For the high school level, team projects involving research and script writing, as well as performance, are recommended. The bibliography lists additional sources of guidelines and materials.

        "description":"Newspapers and magazines have been used only on a limited basis in the foreign language classroom, because language study has traditionally led to the study of literature. However, this trend is now changing because (1) foreign language curriculum at the secondary school level is expanding to encompass new goals, and (2) the influence from college and university language programs is decreasing. Newspapers and magazines contain three types of materials useful to language study: (1) technical information, consisting of headlines, column headings, tables of contents; (2) short materials, comprising advertisements, want ads, weather reports, and other short items; and (3) long articles, including full feature stories, fiction, comic strips, editorials, and letters, all of which may  be used for intensive, extensive, or supplemental reading purposes. In order to successfully utilize these materials in foreign language study, a list of suggested activities is provided, as well as a sample activity on the use of want ads, presented in English, French, German, and Spanish. Journalistic publications may be used as the basis for a language course, or they may be ancillary to the textbook material, serving to motivate interest in the target language culture. A bibliography is included. (Author/LG)",

Lessons typically consist of two reading passages, a dialogue, 6-15 drills, vocabulary, and exercises called &quot;applications,&quot; which reinforce analogy formation and give  students a chance to use new words and structures. At least one of the reading passages in each lesson is taken from a Cambodian publication. The dialogues, drills, and application exercises are designed to prepare the student to discuss the kinds of topics suggested at the end of each lesson. Romanized script is provided only for those words for which the pronunciation is not evident from the spelling. (Author/LG)",

Many of the recorded exercises do not appear in printed form in the student's book. It is recommended that every student have a &quot;check-out&quot; session with an instructor at regular intervals to assure that he is progressing satisfactorily on his own. Unit 1 introduces the Portuguese nasal vowels. Unit 2 presents new sounds and the first dialogue. Beginning with Unit 3, every unit contains a grammar explanation and  grammar drills, in addition to the pronunciation and dialogue work. An &quot;application&quot; section appears at the end of Unit 6 and each subsequent unit. This section summarizes material covered in the unit and reviews material from previous units. The last unit consists of a review of the following: (1) nouns, contractions, adjectives; (2) verbs; (3) the verbs &quot;ser,&quot;&quot;estar,&quot;&quot;ter,&quot; and &quot;ir&quot;; (4) asking questions with question words; and (5) short verbal exchanges. a Portuguese-English vocabulary list concludes the volume.

Factors were labeled independence and initiative, conscientiousness, critical facility, enthusiasm, research and experimentation, communication, teaching skills, and persistence. In addition to ratings of students, faculty were asked to rate each incident with respect to its importance or relevance for success. Importance ratings were most similar for psychology and chemistry and least similar for chemistry and English. The implications for future studies of graduate student performance are  discussed.

The thesis is that a combination of the traditional liberal arts objectives with the methods of experiential education can result in a strengthening of liberal education at a time when circumstances severely threaten its existence. Experiential learning has a specific relationship to the liberal arts. Abstract curricula are meaningless to many of today's students unless we provide them with some reason, some motivating factor to appreciate and use the abstraction. This motivation can be a field experience. The college learning experience should simultaneously provide the means of generalizing on one experience to come up with a myriad of  experiences, and a conceptual framework for those generalizations. The abstraction provides the individual with a reason to explore an experience, and when the idea and experience are thus observed they both have meaning. Having meaning they will be remembered, used again and again, oriented through their interaction with other ideas and experiences that have been generalized, and will enter the total being of the individual.

Although this manual was written for universities in  Ohio, its principles should be of equal importance and application to other public and private colleges and universities throughout the U.S. This document includes sections covering an introduction to planning, planning as a cyclical and continuous process, organization of the planning function, prerequisites for successful planning, and products of the planning process. Appendixes include guidelines for developing goals, the University of Georgia program structure, the Ohio state university program structure, and the WICHE program structure. (Author/PG)",

This 8-year study covers the period 1966-1973. There are 98 of the 107 historically black schools including 86 4-year schools, 50 private schools, and 36 public. Results indicated that baccalaureate degrees granted increased from 15,728 in 1966 to 25,094 in 1973. In 1973, 31,280 baccalaureate, graduate, and professional degrees were awarded. Over the 8 years 165,435 BA's were awarded. Graduate and professional degrees increased from 2,158 to 6,186; 90 percent of these were master's degrees, with about two-thirds in education. Enrollment increased from 139,444 in 1966 to 183,419 in 1973. There has been a consistent pattern of growth over  the 8-year period. Enrollment in black colleges increased 31.5 percent from 1966 to 1973 as compared to 33.3 percent in all 4-year colleges. (MJM)",

It is intended to: (1) eliminate vestiges of former racial dualism in Maryland's public higher education institutions; (2) increase minority and other-race presence on campuses, with particular emphasis on enhancing and not diminishing opportunities for blacks as students, teachers, workers, and decisionmakers throughout the system; and (3) assure an expanded role for blacks and other minorities in positions of educational leadership such as trustees, presidents, deans, department heads, and faculty members. The plan itself covers the following topics at the statewide segment and  institutional levels: student composition, employment composition, financial aid, administrative coordination, program cooperation, programmatic goals, projections of racial composition, timetables, and monitoring mechanisms. Appendixes include segment-wide and institutional data, a report on student financial aid, additional institutional data, and comparative data on predominantly black and white institutions.

        "description":"Independent study involves those activities that help students develop the capacity for self-paced, lifelong learning. Independent study may be pursued concurrently with regular courses or as an intensive experience by itself. A major question faced by all who consider offering independent study concerns the students. Few institutions offer independent study without screening students on the basis of college grades. The transfer of independent study credit is often more difficult than is the transfer of traditional credit because most institutions hesitate to recognize independent study that occurs outside their own scrutiny. Ideally, the independent study project should be a student's idea that has been refined and formulated by the student and the faculty advisor. Evaluati4n  should involve a review of the study's objectives, which may be fulfilled by writing papers, making objects, or presenting live performances. The costs of independent study to students should depend on the university resources required by the program. Since most professional jobs require problemsolving and independent throught, both enhanced by independent study, universities have an obligation to organize independent study opportunities for their students.

The combination of greater numbers of highly qualified candidates and restricted interview budgets suggests the need for more efficient and less costly methods of employment screening. In addition, further exacerbation of an already difficult situation is developing from the attempts of institutions of higher education to comply with the Affirmative Action Guidelines set forth by the federal government. The videotape technique presented in this document was assessed by the participants in this study to be an extremely valuable tool in the faculty screening preemployment process. In addition, the videotape provided the feedback  information necessary to counsel the interviewee with respect to his relative interview strengths and weaknesses. Most importantly, this information is based on the comparison of the interviewee's self-perception to the recorded perceptions of this subject by the other raters. This procedure affords the interviewee the opportunity to see himself as others do. Furthermore, the prospective faculty member may gain valuable information from this counseling model pertaining to the clarity and congruence of the message he projects to others, and the degree of receptivity he may expect to enjoy at 2-year vs 4-year institutions in various geographic locations.

Academic planning is the primary task of any comprehensive long-range planning in a college or university. Only when academic plans and support plans become an institutional plan can the process of implementation and the careful allocation of available resources begin. Once the academic planning process has been completed or well advanced, the academic and institutional support programs can be prepared. It is essential to emphasize that academic planning is the principal determinant of a comprehensive institutional plan. Finally, it must be understood that planning is a continuous process of assisting managers throughout the academic community in their  decisionmaking. A formal plan is a useful framework for guiding decisionmaking, but the plan itself is ever subject to modification as new circumstances arise and as new decisions must be made. From time to time these changes warrant comprehensive formulation of a new plan for further modification with the events of time. (Author/PG)",

It was the aim of the course to teach students to understand the many facets of science; such as, the origin of science, the uniqueness of the scientific inquiry, the development of scientific ideas, what was actually taught by the leaders and innovators of science, what developments have taken place,  something of the content of technology, how problems are solved, the strengths and weakenesses of scientific thought, philosophical considerations of science, historical impacts, and the hierarchy and relative value in science of concepts, such as verification, experiment, theory, hypothesis, probability, certainty, and validity.

The first section describes what has been happening in the health fields: their growing popularity as a group, relative to other study fields; gains and losses in specific health fields and their relation to trends in the demography of college students; and the impact of changing enrollment patterns on shifts in particular health fields. In the second section, health aspirants are compared with nonhealth aspirants, and trends in the  characteristics of health aspirants over a 6-year period are identified. The third section focuses on health majors, with particular reference to patterns associated with stability in, recruitment to, and defection from a major in the health fields; in addition, some of the factors related to stability of choice are isolated and evaluated.

Some colleges and universities are willing to consider \"new market\" students, described as housewives, blue collar workers, elderly or retired persons, and college or high school dropouts. The great majority of new market students are over 25 and as such require a variety of learning options.

        "description":"Discussion of higher education policy has been hampered in the past by an inability to forecast the effects on student behavior of proposed policies. This report describes efforts to develop a theoretical and empirical model of student behavior that will help to establish a method of forecasting enrollment patterns. In this model, actual college enrollments are the result of decisions made both by college administrators and by prospective students. The administrators determine feasible alternatives for students, who then select the \"best\" college. If this best alternative is more attractive than the various possibilities other than college, enrollment follows. In this report, the student's decision problem is separated into successive stages. Formally, at each stage of the  student's decision problem, he or she maximizes a utility function defined over the relevant alternatives. The results show that a utility-maximizing view of student behavior offers a useful perspective on enrollments. Results also indicated that price--both tuition and room and board charges--had a lower effect on the decisions of students from higher-income families. Also the effect of parental education on college-going behavior declines with increasing family income. After presenting the estimation results, the potential use of the model for forecasting enrollment patterns is illustrated. (Author/PG)",

Once the students are enrolled, the emphasis of the E.O.F. program is to minimize attrition and to maximize graduation. The E.O.F. is now aiding approximately 13,000 low-income, educationally disadvantaged students at 48 public and independent colleges in New Jersey and other states. The program is supported entirely by state funds, and distributes these funds directly to students (through grants) and to institutions to enable them to maintain supportive services for their  students. The E.O.F. is discussed in detail, including purpose and structure, criteria, student needs, student performance, program components, students' career goals, and student composition.

In this paper, the formula of the grant is tested against the theory and practice of negative income taxation. A key concept in both Basic Opportunity Grants and in other types of income taxation is that of the family unit whose income must be counted in calculating benefits. This concept is critical to the success or failure of the Basic Opportunity Grant in achieving the aims that have been set for it. The conclusion is that college students cannot be held in dependent status in many cases and that this means that some of the arguments for the Basic Opportunity Grants are questionable. (Author)",

A sample of faculty from the graduate professional schools were asked to respond to the subsection of the questionnaire exploring their opinions on administrative policies and practices. Self-ratings of the amount of interest they have in various aspects of the professional job rather effectively dispel the oft expressed dichotomy of the teacher and the researcher. Even those with only a moderate interest in teaching have a strong sense of obligation to their students. Many of the faculty are quite isolated from each other and from the administration. Their loyalties are  to their students and their departmental colleagues. The majority of the faculty believe USC is a fairly good place to be and expect that any changes that may occur in the next few years will be for the better. The faculty do not feel that their lot is improved by making contributions in the areas they perceive to be valued at USC. They express a desire for some order to uniformity of policies, particularly in personnel practices. (Author)",

Success (persistence) is defined in this study as graduated or continuing as of November 1971. Conclusions that can be drawn from the present study are as follows: (1) Students who transferred from both 2-year and 4-year schools in 1966 and 1967 showed a high rate of persistence. (2) It can be expected that the persistence rates for transfer students entering in 1973 will be even higher than from transfer students entering in 1966-67. (3) Both advanced standing and  previous school grade-point averages were good predictors of success for 1966-67 transfers. (4) The quality of the students who transferred from 2-year schools was inferior to that of the 4-year school transfers in 1966 and 1967.

Such a small segment of the total college enrollment is represented in health physics and related studies that other surveys cannot single them out. These students are vital, however, to the continued development and use of radioactive materials in industry, medicine, construction, research, power production, and even agriculture. This publication should be of value to those seeking graduates in various curriculums included, as well as to those who have an interest in pursuing careers in the field. The document  covers: trends, placement, foreign nationals, women, and minorities. Appendices include statistical tables accompanying the text. (Author/PG)",

Questions were directed toward policies governing compensation rates and ranges of compensation amounts currently available to graduate assistants in a number of fields of study. Institutions were asked whether specific compensation policies existed, whether they had been established by the institution or by individual departments, and about factors influencing variations in compensation amounts. Information about maximum and minimum amounts that could be paid under existing policy were requested, as well as the highest,  lowest, and average amounts actually paid in individual departments during the 1973-74 academic year. Data on tuition charges and tuition waiver amounts were also solicited. The questionnaire for this survey is included in the appendix, along with a list of participating institutions. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"In the past decade, many colleges and universities have reduced or eliminated the number of required general education courses, which had the original purpose of assuring a 'well-rounded' liberal education. The important question is how such curriculum reforms, which increase student choice as opposed to university choice of courses, affect the product of higher education. In particular, does the removal of general education course requirements affect the student retention rate, grade-point average, or choice of major? In 1969, a randomly selected group of 485 entering students were given the option to not take the usual set of required general education courses. A control group of 485 students were not given this option. Four years later, the data were collected on these  students. The findings generally support a move towards more student choice. The results of the study indicate that students in the experimental group had a higher retention rate and received more university resources, measured in dollars, than did students in the control group. Section 2 presents the hypotheses of interest, section 3 describes the data set, section 4 presents a discussion of the statistical tests of the hypotheses, and section 5 contains conclusions and recommendations. Appendices include the model of student learning and resource choice, statistical data, and the survey questionnaire. (Author/PG)",

This essay explores various aspects of conventional &quot;funds&quot; balance sheets and compares them with the Consolidated Net Worth. Emphasis is placed on how the Consolidated Net Worth Statement can aid in determining financial strategy. Most colleges and universities are at the same time both richer and poorer than their financial statements suggest. By not expressing their assets in market values they often understate their worth; by not depreciating their fixed assets, they overstate their value. In recent studies operating deficits have been used as an indicator of financial distress and impending institutional doom. The total  analysis provided by the Consolidated Net Worth Statement shows that deficits are not necessarily a reliable indicator. The essay points thus to a much broader analysis of financial health or distress than has been the custom until recently. (Author/MJM)",

Positive steps to increase participation in higher education and increase the quality of that education are presented, including: (1) The opening of opportunities for higher education and specialized career training beyond the high school to at least 65 percent of the New Mexico high school graduates within the next 5-year span (2) The realization that some potential students need extra counseling and services without  compromising educational standards. Appropriations for these programs would be doubled each year for the next 5-year period. (3) The evaluation of programs and grants in aid. Much more emphasis should be placed on work-study programs.

(3) Decisionmaking in medical education and community health should be democratized so as to allow participation by representatives of those most intimately involved with these areas, i.e., medical students and consumers. (4) The environment of medical education should be  altered to provide for improved teaching, increased flexibility in curricula, elimination of grades and de-emphasis of competition, and increased recognition of student needs for personal growth and interaction. (5) Medical school admissions criteria should deemphasize previous academic achievement beyond a minimal essential level and substituted criteria based upon personal characteristics, such as motivation and social consciousness. (6) Students should be allowed academic credit for participation in extramural educational programs. (Author)",

The first report provides, as an example, an overview of library systems and networking in Britain as they have developed since the passage of the Public Libraries and Museum Act of 1964. Other presentations summarize cooperative activities at various levels in Canada: those of the National Library, the National Science Library, and of single provinces or multiprovince regions across the country. In the concluding paper it is pointed out that all of the existing cooperative activity does not yet add up to a Canadian library network, which will  not be realized without commitment and five major prerequisites: agreement on objectives, on a plan and on standards, plus money and legislation.

The two disciplines are essentially in the same business, that of systematically changing human behavior. System theory and the system model appear to supply the language and the technology through which such efforts could be effected. The Command Action Planning System (CAPS) employed by the U. S. Navy at the Human Resource Management Center, San Diego was successful for two reasons. First, the entire approach was systematic in nature (i.e., environmental demands were identified, outputs specified, functions derived, resources identified, and the process then implemented and modified until performance was satisfactory). Second, the collaboration of  educational technologists and organizational development specialists allowed a comprehensiveness of effort that would have otherwise been impossible. The collaboration appears to have been made possible by the cross-disciplinary aspects of system theory and the integrative capabilities of the system model. (Author/WCM)",

Results indicated that librarians and newsmen agree that public libraries in Ohio are doing less well with publicity than they should. Generally, public library publicity tends to print oriented, proviing somewhat more effective with newspapers than with the electronic media. Library publicity services most commonly provided to Ohio news media were written news releases, continuing library-media contact, and provision of  news tips and background information. Additional effort to focus public library messages through radio and television could improve communication with the public. Sample questionnaires, selected comments from some survey responders, and a bibliography are appended. (Author/LS)",

The efforts of the non-commercial curriculum development teams have been swamped by this increase and their many expensive product development and learner verification techniques have been ignored by the commercial producers who found the procedures unfeasible and too costly. The extra supply of funds for instructional materials induced publishers to throw more products on the market (where sales were certain) with no thought of instructional effectiveness. California and Florida have led the way in requiring that new instructional materials  be \"learner verified\"; perhaps this might lead to a new style of product development that utilizes common-sense empiricism, small-scale field trials, and accumulated experience. Such evaluations are greatly needed when 99 percent of all instructional materials have not been verified by a single learner. (WH)",

But the higher one goes in the institutional hierarchy, the more time must be spent in managing. Librarians must take the management process seriously and understand what good managing is. Managers are constantly appraising their staff and being appraised by them. Performance standards, or Management by Objective (MBO) provides a system for such appraisal. Objectives for the manager or staff member should be established on a one to one basis between the supervisor and the individual, but it is useful if the entire staff first decides on departmental objectives. Individual objectives should be made meaningful, measurable and flexible, for the growth of the staff member rather than as punishment.  At the Columbia University Libraries, task forces of all levels of personnel are working on the establishment of objectives. This has opened up new lines of communication, but is also shifting the traditional bureaucratic structures and loyalties at an accelerating rate. Organizational redesign is thus becoming a continuing function. The experience of articulating performance objectives has proved difficult, but worthwhile. (SL)",

At Chanute the trial is based on the development and use of materials for the Special Purpose Vehicle Maintenance Course. One lesson involves use of a battery hydrometer. A secondary program PIRL (PLATO Indicated Reading Level) is being used to determine the reading difficulty of developed materials. At Sheppard PLATO IV is being tested on a Physician Assistant program, initially on those aspects of the program dealing with  respiratory problems. The PLATO IV program is expected to depart from the old course in its emphasis on a problem oriented curricula where the trainee repeatedly solves medical problems with the computer as a tutor. These trials of PLATO IV are still in progress, but it is hoped that these innovations will offer the potential for more cost effective technical training. (WH)",

The purpose of the analysis was to assay the strengths and weaknesses of each library in relation to other libraries on a national basis. Also, the organizational structure of the state system of higher education, especially the State Board of Higher Education (SBHE) was examined to determine their effect on the education process and the libraries within the system. The results revealed that these libraries were  somewhat deficient in net holdings, fiscal resources, early acquisitions, and professional staffing. Progressiveness was noted in terms of media emphasis and services to clientele. Automation and formalized planning procedures were not yet firmly established.

A structural analysis determined that the computer's capability to process information helps the coach: (1) store large quantities of information; (2) perform numerous operations in a very short amount of time; (3) provides consistent accuracy while also providing versatility. Next, a computer model encompassing thirteen sports was grouped according to each sport's individual needs. This grouping enabled a coach to develop general types of computer programs for \"common\" activities. Here, the computer was used as a problem solving tool to assist the coach in the analysis of activities and the data which they generate. The programs need to be sufficiently general to suit a  variety of coaches and activities, but have built in definable parameters to meet specific needs. Five areas of secondary athletic computer application areas have been: simulations, scheduling, scoring, statistics, and scouting. As a result, a great deal of a coach's time has been saved and a more meaningful type of information has been obtained from computer usage. (WCM)",

However, present trends indicate a substantial growth in the use of the computer in a supportive role in assisting the teacher in the management of instructional activities. Toward this end, computer programs can help solve problems such as the handling of data and the organization and scheduling of school facilities for physical education classes. Also, the information retrieval process may be used to record supplies maintained in the department. Computer data can also be used to analyze student performance in a particular activity. Athletic simulations of stop action games such as golf, softball, or volleyball  are popular with secondary students and allow strategies of play to be tested and investigated for decisions. In addition, programs may be written by students to underscore the teaching of concepts. Many benefits are derived when the student via the program must teach the computer exactly what to do. Here, a necessary transition must be made from mental knowledge and benefits of an activity to the physical engagement of the activity. (WCM)",

Many adult students were introduced to public library services for the first time through the use of a bookmobile and a visit to the local regional library. The bookmobile also delivered print and nonprint materials to ABE classes and made door-to-door visits to recruit disadvantaged adults for ABE classes and encourage them to use the library. ABE teachers and librarians worked together to compile reading lists appropriate to the students. The project was deemed a success in improving the attitudes of disadvantaged adults  toward both the library and ABE programs.

        "description":"Most existing automatic content analysis and indexing techniques are based on work frequency characteristics applied largely in an ad hoc manner. Contradictory requirements arise in this connection, in that terms exhibiting high occurrence frequencies in individual documents are often useful for high recall performance (to retrieve many relevant items), whereas terms with low frequency in the whole collection are useful for high precision (to reject nonrelevant items). A new technique known as discrimination value analysis ranks the text words in accordance with how well they are able to discriminate the documents of a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on how much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given term is  assigned for content identification. The best words are those which achieve the greatest separation. The discrimination value analysis accounts for a number of important phenomena in the content analysis of natural language texts: (a) the role and importance of single words; (b) the role of juxtaposed words (phrases); (c) the role of word groups or classes, as specified in a thesaurus. Effective criteria can be given for assigning each term to one of these three classes, and for constructing optimal indexing vocabularies. (Author)",

The participants were librarians and representatives of the minorities, the culturally different, and the poor. Following a factual presentation of economic and educational statistics for the six-state area, panel and group discussions were held. Blocks of time were devoted to meetings of groups by state, in which action plans were drawn up. Also discussed were regional interstate services which might assist the states and the American Library Association Office of Library Service to the Disadvantaged in achieving improved service nationwide. While  it was felt that many technical aspects of the institute could have been improved, the program proved strong in the communication among participants, in its consortium-type sponsorship, and in its articulated structure which took into account the fact of local, state, regional, and national complementary responsibility.

Of the total number of visits, 3 were made to public library situations, 3 to commercial services, and 16 to academic settings. Descriptions were made of the system at each library and its plans for change. It was concluded that most of the libraries observed were still very involved in designing and implementing the technical aspects of their systems and were not yet at the point of considering the implications of automation in terms of work flow and staffing changes. The one consistent departure from conventional work flow patterns was the  separation of cataloging-with-copy procedures from catalog departments and making these procedures an intrinsic part of the acquisitions process. It is possible that in the future cataloging and acquisitions departments could be merged into a single technical services division whose computer and staff would handle all such processes.

Forms to determine attitudes of participants were completed at the beginning of the institute and at the conclusion of the first six-week component devoted to the community. All field trips were evaluated by participants. Each participant was informally interviewed by the evaluator sometimes during the program. The institute was considered successful by the participants in that it provided  new insights and new ideas. Attitudes of participants toward the inner city, its residents, and its organizations became more specific, and the view of community organizations became much more positive after the first component.

During the past decade, the problems of technical data processing have been conquered; information dissemination has evolved from a loosely knit group of experimental centers to an organization of established centers, many operating multiple data bases. Competitive data bases are becoming available in a number of subject fields, putting the centers in a better bargaining position with the data base producers. However, on-line retrieval, resource sharing, and networking must solve the common problem of user interface before anyone or any combination of these operating modes can be really effective. Interactions between the user with his question, the intermediary  (the profile code processor), and the search system with its data base are critical to continued evolution of information centers. The intermediaries will, for some time, be the most effective bridge between the users and the computer-based retrieval services. The breakthrough needed for both on-line and batch retrieval systems is the understanding, modelling, and simulation of the man-machine interfaces which are now handled by the intermediaries. (WCM)",

The methods available for promoting these objectives involve passing legislation and allocating money. In Canada, a redefinition of the powers and a desire to establish a distinctive &quot;Canadian&quot; approach has resulted in a conscious and intense study of information processing and related technologies. However, although it is not  difficult to agree on general principles and goals, it is enormously difficult to translate these principles into programs which further national goals. In Canada, the federal government has adopted a decentralized approach of computer services, while at the provincial level, the trend is toward centralization. The general position in Canada is that computer services and software industries are to remain largely unregulated; the problem of whether to participate in a computer network remains unresolved.

The answering of questions is not a simple retrieval and response of stored information; rather the process is embedded in a general structural framework containing knowledge of the questioner, the question, and the world around. The teaching of knowledge requires an interactive process based on the knowledge the other person holds or lacks. A general formal structure for representing semantic information is proposed with examples of network structures for encoding general and specific knowledge. The structure is being tested by simulation on a digital computer.

Student-perceived problems, as reflected by student-initiated reports, are the source of data for this phase of formative evaluation. The self-reporting techniques can reveal individual differences in student/learning-environment interactions which are not obtainable (or more difficult to obtain) by other means. The individual student's perceptions can then be used to improve the instructional program. This technique (report) is described, and some applications of the data for administrative purposes are discussed.

Two possible explanations for the superior performance of the Verbal + Picture Group were offered: (1) pictures provided additional relevant stimuli which strengthened the stimulus-response  relation between the spoken directions and the required performances; (2) pictures induced visual imagery which increased associations of the stimuli (pictures and spoken words) and the responses (direction-following).

The revisions are designed primarily to facilitate marketing arrangements between developers and disseminators of educational materials. USOE has established the framework to place a greater number of educational materials on the consumer market, and developers, such as Project LIFE (Language Improvement to Facilitate Education) and Project MORE (Mediated Operational Research for Education), have formulated systematic dissemination procedures to utilize the revised copyright policy. As more research products become available to consumers, a systematic retrieval system should be designed to: (1) share information between developers, (2) assist developers to  more effectively reach the existing markets for their materials, and (3) inform consumers of the materials available. However, there can be little consequence unless present marketing trends are reevaluated in favor of the increased utilization of educational technology. Also, Project LIFE and Project MORE discovered that developers cannot be content with merely developing educational materials: dissemination activities must command a priority equivalent to that of program development.

Furthermore,  progress has been made in the McLean-Raymore Speech Articulation program. The program design and packaging, however, were not made efficient enough for large-scale application. Other aspects of program development will be temporarily delayed in deference to preparing the generlaization component for marketing.

Results showed learning rates were influenced by the way the correct spelling was displayed. Retention level was unaffacted by method of display.

The major findings were: (1) students taught using audio-tutorial instruction demonstrated significantly greater achievement gain but did not differ significantly in attitude toward course content; (2) an analysis of the opinion questionnaire revealed a favorable reaction by the experimental group toward the use of the audio-tutorial method of  instruction; and (3) the experimental group spent a significantly greater amount of time in formal study than those students taught by the conventional approach.

A network of TWX machines links all types of libraries in the county. Libraries joining the system agree to respond as quickly as possible to queries from other libraries. Products of the system include a membership directory listing special resources of each library, workshops on using the service, and an intern program for interchange of library staffs. Three more libraries have joined the network, forming a prototypical link of what could be a state library network. (Author/PF)",

Students were surveyed in winter quarter 1974 about their life patterns and use of services, with particular attention given to homework assignments and library use. Faculty were given the results of the survey, which generally indicated little use of libraries or library materials to fulfill class assignments. Following the student survey, the faculty was given a questionnaire which required ranking of answers to six questions. Answers received from 63 faculty members indicated heavy reliance on textbooks. Ranked lowest was the quality of the library as a source of information. Increased cooperation between the faculty and library staff was  recommended to promote library use.

Allowing for inflation, but adjusting for the increase in computer power per dollar, it is clear that significantly more computer power is being devoted to instruction--both &quot;with&quot; and &quot;about&quot; the computer. The percentage of computer-using courses teaching &quot;with&quot; the computer is estimated to be about 70 to 75 percent of the total number of courses using computers. In particular, physical sciences, social sciences, business, and mathematics have increased their computer use. The bulk of the application is in drill and practice, problem-solving, games, and simulations. Each of these applications is found in most of the departments reporting use of the computer. By  contrast, there are very few instances of tutorial or inquiry and retrieval uses. (Author/WCM)",

These matters continue to be of critical importance and are still largely unresolved. Scholars in both areas of inquiry have sought unification of scientific thought relative to socio-behavioral phenomena. Cross-disciplinary unification, around the notions of dynamic, organization maintaining, and elaborate structures in particular have been suggested in the works of general systems theory. Developments in human communication theory, which draw on systems theory, underscore factors which have impeded progress toward the development of more generic concepts of sign/symbol processes and their  relationship to human behavior, and suggest, at the same time, alternative conceptualizations of these phenomena. A skeletal taxonomy of human communications systems, in which the concepts of personal and social communication are central, is presented and discussed, providing one example of an integrative framework for conceiving of sign/symbol processes and their role in human behavior in a general, interdisciplinary fashion.

The survey instrument developed for the study was the &quot;Part Time and Extension Student Survey.&quot; A computer program for tabulating, cross-referencing, and printing the data was also developed. The survey was mailed to 3054 students of which 1,285 returned it. The results of the survey, which are discussed and tabulated, are presented under the following headings: Demographic Characteristics, Educational Goals and Achievements, Assessments of the College, and Desires and Preferences (where and when courses should be offered). These results show that a total of 38 percent of  the students indicated that Occupational Upgrading was the major reason for attending the college; in contrast with full-time students, there were a number of differences in demographic characteristics, and the part-time student was also likely to be older. The part-time enrollment patterns suggest that the future growth of the college will be in its part-time student population. Thus, consideration should be given to the admissions and recruitment of these potential students, and the efforts of the college will need to be directed toward serving the continuing education needs of the county's population.

        "description":"The work-study program at Monterey Peninsula College was evaluated through questionnaires distributed to students in the program and to their supervisors. In particular, the issues involved in work-study education as related to disadvantaged students were examined. Analysis of the questionnaire data revealed that the work-study students felt that they were gaining skills and were learning. They expressed the need for more training and opportunity to learn, and felt that supervision was important to their working experience. The need for more information and counseling from the Placement Office was also indicated by the students. Supervisors felt that they were providing training and that the students had good attitudes and work habits. The major problems as seen by the  supervisors were the students' attendance and punctuality. Some supervisors felt that they should offer better training and counseling and that they needed more information on the students and on the work-study procedures. Most employers felt that the program was providing a learning experience for the students as well as financial aid and that it was aiding the employer by supplying manpower. Some supervisors felt the students were not properly motivated and indicated problems existed with hours and allocations of work-study students.

The grades of this group in six subsequent mathematics courses were compared with those of students who did not take Math 01.

The participants' responses as to their educational goals at college entrance and whether they felt they had achieved their goals or not were analyzed. The results of the analysis showed that: (1) within seven semesters following enrollment, 16 percent of the 1970 class had graduated with either an AA or certificate; 11 percent were still enrolled at the college, and the remaining 73 percent had left to either transfer  or go to work; (2) the majority stated that their educational goal had been to either take some college courses prior to transferring or to earn an AA degree before transferring; and (3) the graduates felt that they had achieved their goals; the nongraduates were about evenly divided as to goal achievement attitudes.

This involved holding both planned programs on the Chico campus, coordinating class offerings to minimize duplication in offerings and the times of the offerings, and the sharing of physical facilities such as science laboratories. During the fifth week of the 6-week cooperative session, a survey was made of all students and faculty in the classes being offered by both schools. The questionnaire used was designed to ascertain student and faculty reactions to the experiment and their assessments of various services provided during the summer. In addition, data were obtained on selected demographic characteristics of the summer students and their reasons  for attending summer classes. The survey showed that the Chico faculty and students were less positive than the Butte faculty and students as to the benefits derived from the coordinated session. Their respective attitudes were influenced by the fact that the coordinated summer session produced a decline in Chico State student enrollment and caused an increase in enrollment at Butte College. Closer coordination of courses and greater attention to courses jointly offered might minimize the negative effects. (Author/DB)",

Faculty, administrators, student services staff, and four student groups (current, graduates, nonreturning, and student counselors) comprised the survey population. Of the 1,088 people who received the survey instrument, 533 responded. Section A of the instrument elicited information related to: Admissions, Registration and Records; Guidance and Counseling; Job Placement and Financial Assistance; Student Activities; Administrative Services; and Use of Student Services. In Section B. the questions concerned: Psychological Services; Student Counselors; Advisor Roles; the Structure of Student Services;  Importance of Types of Counseling; Administrative Functions as Related to Student Personnel Services; and Attitudes Toward the Counseling Process. The survey data, which are summarized and tabulated, show that, on the whole, the students and faculty were generally satisfied with the services being provided. The responses did indicate, however, that there was a very real need for the services of a full-time psychologist. There were considerable differences of opinion regarding student counselors; the strengths (academic advising) and a relative weaknesses (nonacademic advising) of faculty advisors were identified; academic-career counseling and vocational/placement counseling were more important to students than to the student services administration; and the majority of the students felt  that seeking counseling was a sign of strength.

The personal needs of the handicapped were significantly higher in  problems with taking tests, reading skills, study skills, economic resources, writing skills, low grades, personal goals, and sexual adjustment.

(2) Will the present system of administrative committees, councils, and task forces meet the needs of a multicampus college? (3) What is the most acceptable form of faculty participation in governance for a multicampus operation at Valencia? A questionnaire was also administered to a sample of the faculty and administrators of both in-state and out-of-state community colleges with a multicampus operation. The data obtained from the questionnaires were treated descriptively. The results of the study reinforced previous findings that the attitudes of the  participants involved in participatory governance are more important than is the specific organizational mode adopted to provide this participation. An open and receptive attitude by the president and other administrators is a key element for effective faculty participation in governance. A strong and dedicated faculty leadership combined with an interested and involved faculty and the administration's attitude will tailor the mechanism to the needs of the participants and insure mutual development of policies and procedures. Another trend that is developing is the necessity to provide a voice for all constitutencies of the college. College Wide Councils are emerging as a policy recommending body in many colleges.

A measurement called activity units was created. One hour of academic credit equals three activity units on the basis of one hour in class and two hours of preparation. An hour of gainful employment equals one activity unit. The winter 1974 grade point averages (GPA's) of 722 full-time students enrolled at Delaware County Community College, Media, Pennsylvania, were analyzed to determine if there was a significant relationship between number of activity units and GPA for eight separate categories of students (16-19-year-old single female, 16-19-year-old single male, 20-23-year-old single female, 20-23-year-old single male, 24 years of age or  older single female, 24 years of age or over single male, 20 years of age or older married female, and 20 years of age or older married male). As a result of the data analysis, it was concluded that at the .05 level of significance, there was a relationship for all categories except the single females aged 16-19 between number of activity units and GPA. The data indicated that those students carrying between 50 and 59 activity units had the highest level of academic success, and all those carrying over 50 activity units earned higher GPA's than did students carrying less; that married students achieved higher GPA's than single students; that married female students achieved much higher GPA's than any other category; and that students carrying 80 or more activity units have almost exactly  the same level of success as the entire sample.

The problem was a result of the absence of positions at the faculty/administration interface and the interdisciplinary housing of the faculty. Position papers of task groups made up of an administrator and two faculty members were analyzed. The analysis provided a list of administrative responsibilities related to five goal areas of the college, as follows: (1) academic preparation for advanced formal study, (2) career preparation, (3) community services, adult education, (4) general education, and (5) education and occupational counseling, student personnel service. Recommendations made by the practicum participants are: (1) interdisciplinary  housing should be retained; (2) two types of leadership positions, with different job descriptions should be established--cluster leader and division or program leader; (3) an extensive inservice program should be implemented; and (4) a committee composed of representatives of each of the campus constitutencies should be established.

Comparisons were made of the college perceptions and experiences of the women and older students with those of men and of younger students. Three age groups were used--under 22, 22 to 29, and older than 29. The responses showed that: (1) sex differences were negligible in more than 100 items concerning academic experiences; only in post-college plans did men respond differently, reporting proportionately greater uncertainty than did women their age; (2) age differences were found to be substantial and linear with  respect to academic performance, satisfaction with classes, preference for student- or instructor-directed instruction, and program uncertainty. The older the student, the more likely he is to (1) be in no academic difficulty; (2) be satisfied with his instructors, responsive, and agreeable; (3) prefer instructor-directed learning; and (4) have definite plans as to what he will do after leaving college. Compared with the older student, those of college age have many academic problems, see their classes as lacking challenge, prefer student-planned and student-controlled learning situations, and are uncertain about their programs.

The responses, received from 73.8 percent of the employers representing 1,013 general office employers, were compared with the relative emphases on course content in the college's typing, office machines, and business mathematics courses. The proportions of typing courses assignments related to purchase orders, invoices, purchase requisitions, debits and credits, telegrams, and minutes of meetings significantly exceeded the proportions of job time devoted to these tasks, according to employers. Disproportionately large amounts of classroom time, in contrast  with employers' work demands, were being consumed by such typing assignments as tables, business letters, and manuscripts. Course requirements and employers' job requirements coincided in the cases of interoffice memos, legal forms, and index cards. In relationship to employers' stated needs, business mathematics courses devoted disproportionately large amounts of course time to fractional computations and percentage computations. Depreciation computations received less course emphasis than job needs suggested. Similarities were found between course emphasis and job requirements in markup/markdown and interest in business mathematics courses. Fewer than 10 percent of the employers' calculating machines were rotary, whereas half of the office machines course time was devoted to learning  rotary calculator operations. (Author/DB)",

Assessment is based on assumptions requiring conceptualization of (1) certification based on competency or performance, (2) education and training that includes both formal and informal experiences, and (3) planning and evaluation that is centered around the community as well as around an institution or agency. The analysis suggests a confusing and probably unjustifiable multiplicity or requirements and supervising agencies. The requirements were felt to provide insufficient flexibility for (1) vertical and horizontal mobility of personnel; (2) adaptation to a particular employment level, a particular clientele population, and the facility or institution  of employment; (3) adaptation for individual differences in personnel; or (4) input from communities. Further, the paper indicates that existing personnel requirements were not based on performance criteria, employment success, or changing times. An alternative competency-based certification procedure is proposed. Guidelines are provided for determining appropriate and relevant competency sources and curricula domains for all levels of training and certification.

Information was gathered through extensive questionnaires and home observations which occurred during site visits to a geographically-representative sample of 162 licensed or approved day care homes. In the profile, comparisons are made between 146 homes which are privately funded and the 16 programs which receive aid through the provisions of the Social Security Act, Title IV-A. Comparisons are also made for areas of different population densities. Descriptive data are presented in these areas: (1) child characteristics such as levels of enrollment, age groupings, and ethnic background; (2) special services for school-age children and exceptional children; (3) length of child care, withdrawal, and  absences; (4) family characteristics; (5) formal and informal training and experience of day care mothers; (6) physical environments--indoor and outdoor; (7) educational and play activities, materials, and equipment; and (8) atmosphere, including verbal and physical contact between day care mothers and children, amount of time spent with children, imposition of rules and restrictions, and response to children's needs.

The majority of data was obtained from 89 employed mothers from 190 intact families in rural and urban Pennsylvania. Each family either had children enrolled in day care centers or had their names on a day care waiting list. Three instruments (two scales and a questionnaire) were administered during structured interviews which measured maternal satisfaction with child care and  employment as well as the quality of mother-child interaction. The theoretical constructs of role dominance and shifting role dominance were used to conceptulize the problem and to interpret the results which suggest that: (1) maternal satisfaction with substitute child care is not directly related to the quality of mother-child interaction; (2) maternal satisfaction with substitute child care is positively related to maternal work satisfaction; and (3) maternal work satisfaction is positively related to the quality of mother-child interaction.

        "description":"This study investigated the linguistic components of Piaget's class-inclusion task. First, hierarchical classification is examined from both Piagetian and linguistic theory points of view. Then, two general characteristics of child thinking that relate to the different interpretations of the responses to classification questions are discussed: (1) the tendency to overgeneralize rules, and (2) the lack of analytic aptitude. The considerations of these characteristics lead to the conclusion that children &quot;understand wrongly&quot; in the class-inclusion tasks because of grammatical constraints. In the third section, five research experiments designed to evaluate the grammatical constraint hypothesis are presented: (1) a methodological study to establish two slightly different forms of  the class-inclusion question; (2) a study of grammatical aids to correct comparison; (3) a direct test of the child's use of grammatical clues; (4) a study to determine the independence of class-inclusion performance and the ability to compare part and whole in other ways; and (5) a study to examine performance for two types of numerical comparisons. The results of the experiments and some possible conclusions are also discussed. (Author/SDH)",

To facilitate this process, an Action Category System was developed through observation in the natural classroom setting and subsequent analyses of the recorded behavior data. Efforts to devise a behavior category system resulted in these final action categories: motion, stance, pause, visual, nonvisual facial, and self-sounds. Dimensions, indications of how a nonverbal activity is performed, were also defined to aid data collection. Dimensions indicate the speed, frequency, duration, directionality, tension, and range of a nonverbal action. To rate these dimensions, a point of reference must necessarily be  identified (five bases, or points of reference, for rating dimensions are given and examples of their use). Some recommended instructions for rating each dimension and an alternative proposal for grouping and defining bases are presented. Further explanations of these data collection processes can be found in two of the appendixes which contain a working paper on dimension definitions and coding procedures and a set of data collection exercises.

A broad range of measurement instruments were employed; results are given in terms of physical, motor, social-emotional, interests and activities, knowledge and achievement, school readiness, and school achievement variables. The second research study describes and evaluates a new preschool curriculum. The characteristics of this experimental program are illustrated in an  excerpt from the teacher's handbook. The evaluation procedure involved a comparison of 438 children from 24 experimental program groups with 451 children from traditional preschools.

The existence of siblings among the subjects of the MCHP was noted by the Verbal Interaction Project (VIP), the research organization responsible for MCHP, as a potential source of difficulty in evaluating the program's effectiveness. Since MCHP reaches the child through the intervention of the mother, it was expected that some dependency existed between the IQ gains of siblings. Four \"mother exposure\" hypotheses, based on the premise that continued exposure to the program changes the mother's behavior toward her children, were formulated to guide the research. Statistical procedures  used in the study were also evaluated. The data was drawn from the IQ scores of more than 300 children who were enrolled for at least one year in MCHP. The investigation of the \"mother exposure\" hypotheses was hampered by methodological obstacles, and only one of the four hypotheses was confirmed.

This phenomenon has been produced by the content, structure, and teaching methodology used in schools, beginning with fourth grade and continuing throughout junior and senior high schools, and into undergraduate university programs. Problem areas highlighted are: (1) a static academic curriculum with little relevance to the real world, (2) a rigid and inflexible policy of school operation based on a model of managerial efficiency, and (3) an attitude of distrust and hostility toward the student body. The paper concludes that if the student is not helped to become aware  of himself as an individual, through education, the educational apparatus is merely grooming slaves and conditioning them to accept whatever conditions of life happen to come their way.

The paper also presents a specific study of haptic perception in 144 preschool and kindergarten children from various socioeconomic levels. The children were randomly assigned to two memory conditions and one of three object groups (Familiar, topological, or Euclidean). Training stimuli for the experiment consisted of two sets of three familiar objects. Each child played a &quot;Can you find it?&quot; game in attempting to recognize and choose a standard object that had previously been presented. Test stimuli were three sets of plastic objects corresponding to  the three object groups under examination. Procedures were similar to those used in training with one modification in timing to determine the effect of memory. Results provided partial support for Piaget's theory of haptic perception. Data was analyzed to determine the effects of age, object type, difficulty level, sex, and memory on the development of haptic perception. (SDH)",

        "description":"This paper discusses beginning reading instruction in the light of Piaget's theory, which demands that we think more broadly about the term &quot;where the child is&quot; in terms of his level of thinking, not simply his reading level or reading skill level. Using Piaget's four major developmental stages as the basis, the task of instruction in reading becomes matching the child's level of thinking with the skills which the school requires. This paper examines the thinking of children during the pre-operational and concrete operational stages, and suggests that the attainment of the stage of concrete operations, or the attainment of conservation, is what constitutes readiness for reading printed material written by someone else. Reading programs constructed from this perspective, must deal  with the reading &quot;process&quot; first, utilizing the different strategies available to a child at each stage of thinking. (CS)",

Fourth and second grade subjects were administered five pairs of these communications for one baseline day and four treatment days. The significant expectancy-feedback interaction and fourth grade mean differences support the replicated study. For second graders, positive feedback resulted in best performance levels for both high and low IQ subjects, and high expectancy resulted in best performance within feedback levels. These results both indicate the presence of developmental differences and suggest that  second graders only attend to the immediate reward value of adult communications, thus neglecting the cue value (for future success and reinforcement) which such statements convey to forth graders.

        "description":"This paper examines several recent lines of research concerning category clustering and describes an alternative to the standard category clustering procedure used to study recall organization in younger children. The specific issue considered is the age at which children first show evidence of spontaneous category clustering in their free-recall. Possible interpretations of the contrasting results presented in the literature focus on the types of organizational behaviors measured by the clustering index: (1) associative modes, or (2) conceptual modes. Examples from research are presented to illustrate the distinction between associative and conceptual clustering. It is concluded that there is no way to distinguish associative from conceptual modes of spontaneous organization at  any age level when using traditional measures of clustering. An alternative clustering measure, which employs a sorting-recall procedure, is proposed and described. Results of using this procedure, which differ on several dimensions with previous results, are reported. The advantages of using this sorting-recall procedure include: (1) the determination of particularly meaningful age trends; (2) the provision of important information about the qualities of organizational processing; and (3) the opportunity to determine the category basis and criteria used in grouping items.

A class of sixth grade pupils were used as subjects. When the pupils were allowed to proceed through the materials at their own pace (Self Paced), the mean number of units completed was 1.54 per day. When the class had to complete two units per day or receive a failing grade (Forced Paced), the number of units completed increased. With a reapplication of the Self Paced condition, unit completion decreased. But when the Forced Paced condition was reinstated, class members again increased their mean rate of unit completion. Data for three selected pupils revealed that the rates of unit completion for the median  and lowest pupil were affected the most by the experimental procedures. Accuracy increased over time and appeared to be a function of exposure to the materials. (Author/SDH)",

A total of 90 economically disadvantaged Anglo and Mexican American Children from six Head Start classrooms were administered the Preschool Inventory (PSI) to obtain a measure of intellectual development. Each child was also independently rated on the Classroom Behavior Scales by a college student and teacher. It was hypothesized that: (1) scores on the PSI would correlate positively with ratings on extraversion, task orientation, general adjustment, and peer adjustment; (2) PSI scores would correlate negatively with ratings on introversion and distractibility; and (3) no correlation would exist between ratings on either hostility and/or consideration of  others and the PSI. Results confirmed each of these hypotheses. The results are in accord with current developmental theories which view the child as an active seeker of cognitive stimulation who interacts on his environment. Implications of the study suggest that preschool curriculum experiences should require self-initiating, exploratory, persistent, and independent activity on the part of the child. (Author/SDH)",

The discrepant findings which report on the order of emergence of identity conservation and equivalence conservation are discussed. An analysis of the procedural details of the conflicting studies reveal that the discrepant findings are probably the results of a measurement error (judgements-plus-explanations response criteria) and a sampling error (older subject samples), routinely committed in studies reporting that identity and equivalence emerge in no fixed order. Some new data from an experiment in which these two errors were controlled provide support for this conclusion.

This approach is in contrast to those which focus on clarifying values and developing an awareness of other cultures' values. Educational intervention in the cognitive-developmental approach is based on the principals of conflict and near-matching, and presented through the media of sound filmstrips, debate, and open discussion. Both \"expert teachers\" (those trained in cognitive developmental theory and experienced with primary grade children), and lay teachers conducted the study's biweekly sessions. Units presented covered the moral topics of Truth Telling, Sharing and Taking Turns, Promise Keeping, Property Rights,  and Rules. Results show that, while change to a higher stage in reasoning may be greater with a teacher who is familiar with the stage theory and is interested in the program than with one who has just read the training manual, the two groups did not differ significantly.

A definition of ideology is presented, and reasons are given in the context of this definition as to why an unreliable data base is the cause for current ideological battles in early childhood education. Ideological camps (Piagetians, Behaviorists, neo-Freudians, Open Educators) are viewed as tending to avoid evidence counter to their beliefs, primarily by rejecting each other's \"data\" as inadmissible evidence. Therefore, it is concluded that policy decisions cannot be made on the basis of evidence, for what we are willing to accept as evidence is a function of our ideologies. (CS)",

During the spring of 1971 a sample of 418 males, 45 years of age and younger, were interviewed to investigate achieved level of living. The sample was about evenly distributed racially (white and black) and residentially (farm and urban areas). Among the basic study objectives were: (1) to specify those factors which influence achievement and examine the casual and intervening function of such factors; (2) to determine the degree to which childhood level of living determines achievement (along with other predictors); and (3) to specify how race influences achievement. A conclusion suggested by the  findings was that the complex of circumstances, including race, which established one's social inheritance were among some of the most powerful factors which influenced ultimate achievement. When race was statistically controlled, education accounted for a sizable amount of the variation on achievement which would otherwise have been explained by ascribed status. The relationship between resident-origin-linkages and occupation suggested that an urban environment represented a more opportunistic social structure for blacks. Among both blacks and whites the higher the wife's educational attainment, the greater the respondent's achievement rank. Manipulations of the multiple regression model impressively increased black achievement, but parity with whites was not attainable.  (BRDR)",

The development and assessment of a questionnaire involved school boards, administrators, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Educational Administrator, teachers, students, parents, and other interested community members. Administered by many of these same people (in the Lakota language if necessary), the final needs questionnaire not only determined educational priorities, but also strengthened school-community relationship. Each community and group within each community were analyzed; comparisons were made of Indian versus non-Indian priorities; and significant differences among group priorities were given. The 11 goal areas (total survey results)  listed from most to least important based on the average ranking given are shown. Significant differences were shown in the top five goals. Itemized in priority order these were: (1) parents--continuing education, communication skills, citizenship preparation, cultural heritage, values; (2) students--continuing education, communication skills, job preparation, citizenship preparation, cultural heritage; (3) teachers--communication skills, values, people relationships, job preparation, citizenship preparation. The critical step in the assessment was the utilization of the findings in the daily process of the schools. Many alternative approaches were possible, and each school had to determine what was most appropriate for it. The Needs Assessment Questionnaire concluded the document.  (AH)",

        "description":"Very little cognitive development research has been done among African children, and most of the completed studies have relied on &quot;translated&quot; versions of Western test materials that are inappropriate to the African milieu. This paucity of research has had two affects: (1) rural African children have been represented as somewhat less advanced mentally than Western children; and (2) it has kept researchers from discerning whether the patterns of development discovered among Western children are truly universal or merely a product of Western cultural and educational systems. Described are methods developed to study how Kamba children in Kangundo, Machakos (Kenya), acquired adult semantic categories and to investigate the child's learning of certain aspects of logical thinking.  Animals were chosen as a semantic domain familiar to Kamba children. The domain's structure was described, using Kikamba-speaking adults as informants who were asked to match &quot;those which are alike&quot; and to give their reasons for the groups they formed. Next, four sorting tests were administered to 30 Akamba children, ages 6, 7, 9, and 12. Some tentative findings were that not surprisingly, children learn more adult dimensions as they get older, and the younger child's sorting ability far exceeded his ability to verbalize the reasons, particularly with very familiar animals.

Separate questionnaires were developed for each respondent category (present and former students, CSA's, school administration, and community employers), describing the school program, and reporting the various test data relating to both present and former students.

Today it suffers from high rates of malnutrition, unemployment, welfare, disease and infant mortality, poverty, malfunctioning social systems, and few sources of employment other than Federal, State, and local governments. It is hypothesized that a major cause of today's poverty among the Spanish Americans there is the imposition of alien Anglo American legal, political, social, and economic systems shortly after the American occupation of the Southwest, systems that the  rural village people have not yet completely understood or assimilated. There is a history of conflict between Spanish and Anglo land tenure systems, of a negative impact caused by imposition of Anglo county systems, and of failure of government programs to benefit the Spanish Americans. The document examines the geographic environment, natural resources, genetic backgrounds, social and economic systems, land grants, taxes, State and county government systems, Federal programs, and the rural farm economy of the area.

Guidance programs are rapidly growing and changing as are the conditions and circumstances confronting high school graduates. An inclusive educational guidance program which is attainable by every school system regardless of its budget or staff is the Guidance Timetable approach. This approach is based on the belief that individual teachers and administrators gain confidence when they can quickly examine an overall guidance plan and see where they fit in. A timetable is so basic to a guidance program that everyone concerned (pupils, parents, and teaching staff) must know its contents. The timetable is a comprehensive and flexible plan which assures an orderly and systematic  effort. This 1961 bulletin discusses the Guidance Timetable approach focusing on activities essential for grades 7-12. The discussion and brief description are divided into two sections: (1) Sequential Activities (on a grade-level basis) and (2) Continuous Activities. Special emphasis is on college preparation, but the contents and procedures suggested are directed to all students. A bibliography of guidance books and pamphlets is also included. (NQ)",

Of the 53 treaty and non-treaty Native students who entered the program in 1971, 32 percent dropped out the first year. Of prime importance was the fact that IMPACTE had shown an ability to identify and cope with its own problems; therefore, continued funding and support for IMPACTE was well justified. This first evaluative report concentrates on descriptive diagnostic information about internal operations which provided the administration with  feedback about positive and negative features of the program's first year. Given in the report's three sections are: a description of program objectives, assumptions, and organizational structure; a report of an independent evaluation of the first year; and a description of program changes in the second year which have attempted to solve some of the problems raised by the evaluation.

Student data were gathered by a largely closed-ended questionnaire. The goals and objectives of this study related to black vocational education, tri-ethnic analysis, vocational education composition and enrollment analysis, and a thorough demographic analysis. Part 1 discussed the findings of a previous study which were responsible for the present research effort  project goals, general methodology, description of target population, and the organization and phasing utilized in its execution. Part 2 analyzed and compared characteristics, attitudes, aspirations, and problems of 1,600 black, Mexican American, and Anglo students in six urban Texas school districts with large minority student populations. Part 3 summarized the results and discussed some of the implications which this and other studies have for vocational education in Texas and the role of occupational research activities. Many issues concerning vocational education and minority youth were clarified in this study; other questions were raised. However, the data base established here should alert educators to and inform them about the special sensitivity of today's high school youth.  (AH)",

This 20-year time span was selected because of the availability of the comparable census information for these groups. Three aspects of population dynamics examined were: growth, components of growth, and distribution. Data were taken from several U.S. Census Reports for 1950, 1960, and 1970. Some findings were that: (1) each group experienced an absolute increase in size during this time, with the Spanish surnamed having the largest increase and Anglos and blacks having the least; (2) despite this increase, their sizes relative to one another remained virtually unchanged; (3) the one single factor which accounted for most of the growth and  the changes in growth rates was the fluctuations in the number of births; (4) migration was also an important factor affecting the size of the Spanish surnamed, but was of minimal consequence for the black and Anglo populations; (5) throughout the 1950's and 1960's, Texas' population was concentrating more and more in metropolitan areas, especially in the Houston, Dallas, and Fort Worth areas; and (6) the Anglo population increased in the areas outside the central cities while the black and Spanish surnamed populations increased inside the central cities. Some generalizations concerning present and projected population characteristics are also made. A problem encountered in this analysis was the possible undernumeration of the black and Spanish surnamed groups. (NQ)",

Studies indicate that most of the job openings available between now and 1980 will not require a college education; however, a large number of them will require specialized training. Programs need to be initiated or expanded for occupations promising substantial demand and program areas with declining demand and large enrollments need to be curtailed or perhaps eliminated. Since emerging economic trends have their roots in the past, an historical perspective is required to assess the labor force status of the three major ethnic groups in Texas (Mexican Americans, blacks, and Anglos). Each student's aptitudes and interests must also match the training undertaken. This report examines: (1) the occupational education  programs available to students in grades 9-12 in 11 Texas public school districts; (2) vocational education enrollment patterns for the State as a whole and for these school districts; (3) vocational enrollment patterns in comparison to the State's manpower requirements; (4) the economy in terms of industry structure and occupational composition; (5) expected changes in the industrial structure and their effect on occupational demand; and (6) implications of the occupational demand trends in terms of current patterns and emerging trends in high school occupational education.

The total thrust of the study was to improve occupational training opportunities and career development of all high school students in the State of Texas. One important aspect was to make recommendations to the funding agency and selected school districts concerning program development. Other recommendations, based on the needs expressed by the respondents (mostly low income) to the eight questionnaires and interviews included: better coordination between vocational education programs and labor market demands, improved guidance programs, and utilization and implementation of major recommendations made as a result of these findings.

A sample of 418 male household heads who were 18 to 45 years old in Washington County, Mississippi were interviewed during 1971. A prescreening using census and local housing survey material determined black and white households. Respondents were interviewed by members of their own race. The analysis was based on two indexes which were also used to construct a typology of vertical mobility: (1) an index representing the respondents' level of living at childhood and (2) an index for achieved level of living (the dependent variable). The independent variables were race, ascribed rank, highest level of education,  spouse's education, age, respondent's age at birth of first child farm residence, town or village residence, farm origin, town or village origin, birth rank, and military service experience. Some findings were: (1) race was the most important characteristic associated with vertical mobility and achieved level of living; (2) education, age, and urban residence had the greatest influence on the blacks' upward mobility, while for whites, education and farm residence were the most positive factors; and (3) postponement of family development, place of birth, and military experience had negligible influences on achievement for all respondents.

Data were obtained from a data file compiled primarily at Cornell University as part of a Northeast Regional Research Project. Multiple indicators of each concept were classified using factor analytic techniques. Having obtained satisfactory factors for 1960, a similar analysis was performed for the same variables measured in 1950 to assess the stability of the factor structure. Of the hypothesized determinants, the level of and change in  socioeconomic status appeared to be of greatest importance. The level of differentiation had no effect on net migration among nonmetropolitan counties in the Northeast; however, change in differentiation had the expected positive effect in both urban and rural counties. Subsequent regression analytic procedures indicated that county socioeconomic status was of substantial importance and economic linkages of virtually no importance in statistically explaining intercounty differentials in rates of net migration.

A large proportion of these youth were born during the decade of high birth rates following the end of World II; others are younger and may relfect more recent  developments in the South's population characteristics.

The report is a summary of the 28 local district project evaluations. Enrollee participation during the regular school term included 4,937 students (preschool through grade 12); and 2,891 summer term students (preschool through age 14 or over). Twenty-four districts reported that project activities and services were designed to meet the needs of the migrant enrollee and were successful; three stated that the project was successful, but limited funds handicapped the total program. All districts felt the project had an  impact on raising the level of educational attainment for the migrant participant. Sections cover: (1) exemplary program (teenage summer migrant program); (2) project data; (3) inservice training; (4) coordination with other programs; (5) nonpublic participation; (6) dissemination; and (7) program summary. The attachments provided include: a list of the Idaho migrant programs (FY 1973); the yearly report of the Migrant Education Resource Center; and an evaluation of migrant programs which lists the 22 objectives set forth by &quot;Idaho State Plan, Migrant Education, Fiscal Year 1973, Title I ESEA&quot;, calls attention to successful practices, and summarizes areas in which improvements and/or additions might be desirable.

        "description":"The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) and, most recently, the National Institute of Education (NIE) have been involved in contemplating a national planned variation study of bilingual education. In order to determine the feasibility of such a massive study, several approaches to bilingual education, with emphasis on bicultural as well as bilingual considerations, were developed. Next, usable models were extracted and cast into a planned variation experimental design. It was specified that these models represent a theoretical or methodological base, embody an observably distinct approach to education, be operational long enough to make a difference in the children's academic competencies (in this case K-3), and have reasonable possibilities of acceptance by the professional and  ethnic communities having to implement and support them. The four models delineated shared the following characteristics: (1) affective, academic, and linguistic objectives on which to base lesson sequences and content, student placement, and progress; (2) growth in both English and Spanish language proficiency; (3) provision for staff training, classroom materials, and community participation at each site; (4) specific strategies relating to awareness of and respect for the cultural, linguistic, and social variables of the installation site; and (5) specific methods for assessing these strategies and objectives and for monitoring the installation and its effects on the population. The models are: the Behaviorist Model, the Immersion Model, an Eclectic Model, and a Child-Centered Model.  (NQ)",

The program was an innovative direction for rural education in expanding the students' (predominantly Native American) experience during their senior year in high school, and offering early entrance into college. The Center for Northern Educational Research was asked to evaluate: (1) the increase in the students' entrance and success in college; (2) attitudinal changes occuring in their outlooks and future options; (3) the influence of the structure of the program on their success and how the structure differed every year. To measure the effects of the program on college entrance and success in each of the 3 years, the students' rates of entrance and success in college were  compared to Native American students enrolled for the first time in the University of Alaska. Assessment of student attitudes toward themselves and their future were obtained (third year only) from: (1) a questionnaire asking if they had changed on the trip, and how; and (2) a questionnaire concerning occupational educational goals administered three times during the program. Some findings indicated that the increase in college entrance and success had: a large impact (1970-71); a sizeable impact (1971-72); and a good effect (1972-73). No definite conclusions were made about attitudinal changes in self-concept and future possibilities. However, the students' self-reports raised the possibility that some favorable results did occur.

The training manual is divided into three sections: (1) organization and administration--State and Federal roles, legislation, State Board of  Education role, and other State responsibilities; (2) school board organization--local organization, meetings, educational philosophy, board policy, program evaluation, school board-community relationships, school board personnel relationships, and school board and related organizations; and (3) other school board responsibilities--budgeting and buildings.

Tabular data supported previous studies which established correlation between aspiration and expectation. Male occupational expectation surpassed that of female, while urban student aspiration surpassed that of rural student, and parental occupational prestige was correlated with student occupational/educational expectation. Unexpected sex bias became apparent when females, particularly mothers, exerted more influence on the expectations of daughters than did male figures, and there was a comparable  male sex bias. Respondents on the extreme ends of the investigation continuum (i.e., farm and urban residents) were evenly arrayed, while those of intermediate classification were unevenly arrayed. Since North Dakota has an agricultural rather than an industrial base, the response of this study differed from that of a similar study in North Carolina (ED 079 000), though this difference bore out the underlying assumption that socioeconomic factors affect the expectations of high school seniors.

The State migrant program's priorities are regular school term and summer projects for interstate and intrastate migrants; staff development activities; a migrant student record transfer system; migrant education regional services; mobile vocational instructional program; and services for students eligible under the former migratory provision (5-year migrants). During 1973-74, 6812 migrant children were served. Supplemental instruction and reinforcement were provided by 50 projects administered indirectly through 29 local educational agencies. Only limited supportive services were provided during  the regular school term since emphasis was on instruction to supplement existing programs and not to supplant any available services with migrant funds. More value was placed on the supportive services during the summer since these projects were generally the only activities in operation. More responsibility for evaluating local projects was shifted to the local directors. After reading and processing all available information from project evaluations, on-site visits, test data, and monitoring reports, this 1974 evaluation report was prepared. All available information indicates that the North Carolina Migrant Education Program is meeting the State program goals. (NQ)",

Two general assumptions contributed to the focus on education: (1) the total development of the Latino community depends on the kind of educational opportunities available; and (2) more Latinos are directly affected by the educational system than by any other public institution since 75 percent of Latino families have children. Information was gathered from a variety of sources. Topics covered included  enrollment, teachers, administrators, educational policy and practice, funding and the law, and the need for institutional change. Some findings were: (1) a pluralistic education program does not yet exist in Chicago's public schools, thus resulting in the systematic denial of these students' rights to an education; (2) the alienation of students, parents, and Latino community leaders from educational institutions is increasing; and (3) cultural and linguistic bias in testing and placement underestimates Latino students' abilities.

        "description":"In compliance with Federal regulations, the State of Idaho submitted this 1971-72 annual report to the Bureau of Indian Affairs regarding their educational funds under the Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) program. Support for the education of public school students is provided by the State Foundation Program. JOM funds and the Indian Education Program affect 14 school districts. The major objectives of the Idaho Indian Education Program were to: (1) assist public schools with categorical grants-in-aid; (2) encourage new programs and approaches to learning and teaching; (3) bring about better understanding and communication between the school and community; (4) provide inservice training for teachers and teacher aides; (5) make possible the participation of all Indian students in school  activities and programs by providing funds to schools for costs and fees normally paid by parents. JOM funds have helped to provide the expenses of kindergartens, summer programs, workshops for teachers, and many other special programs that State funding alone could not provide. New legislation that took over most of the funding of the lunch program left the JOM lunch funds to be channeled into other special programs. Statistical tables and charts covering such items as enrollment and transportation, attendance, school district tax levies, drop out rate, and JOM financial reports for the State and the school districts comprise the majority of the document.

There has been a drastic decrease in the use of JOM funds for basic school support due to P.L. 874 and local funds provided for Indian education. District administrators, working with the JOM Parent Advisory Committees, have provided special programs and activities designed to benefit the Indian children. Ongoing JOM programs included summer workshops for teachers and aides, kindergartens, summer tours, and other activities designed to solve problems generally peculiar to Indian children. Problems faced by trustees and administrators in school districts educating Indian children fell generally within the  categories of: parental permissiveness; direction; communication breakdown; student attitude, behavior, attendance, and self-image; responsibility and function of trustees, administrators, and faculty; and other home-school-community related problems. Some suggested goals to inhance the present programs were the continuation and expansion of financial aid for summer workshops, provision of funds for inservice training, development of &quot;on reservation&quot; programs for parents and children to explain the public school operation and parental responsibility, etc. The majority of the document is made up of statistical tables and charts for State and JOM financial assistance, attendance, transportation, enrollment, school lunches, and tax levies.

Major objectives for the 14 districts under JOM funding were not revised or evaluated formally, but they appeared to be successful (according to the district reports). Special educational activities funded under JOM were directed toward providing every  Indian child with the opportunity to develop his potential. The report consisted of four sections: (A) the narrative, which reported the accomplishments, difficulties encountered, and plans for next year's operation; (B) school enrollment data for all participating districts; (C) financial information which included State and local districts expenditures; and (D) miscellaneous information concerning the programs in the individual school districts which were supported by the JOM program.

        "description":"The characteristics, particularly those related to low income and poverty, of rural Wisconsin households (families and individuals living along) whose head was age 63 or older were studied. &quot;Rural&quot; was defined as towns of 2,500 population or less and the open countryside, including farms. Data were gathered in early 1968 through interviews in 1,021 households of which 290 were with heads age 63 or older. The total household income for each respondent was compared with the poverty line as calculated by the Social Security Administration and then classified as poor, near poor, or above average income. Some findings were: (1) mean income was $3,678 for those 63 or older as compared to $7,927 for rural households with heads aged 21 to 62 years; (2) 68 percent of the heads had  finished eight grades of schooling or less; (3) among rural aged households, 39 percent were poor, 34 percent were near poor, and 27 percent had above average income in 1967; (4) among the farmers, the poor received most of their income from farming but the nonpoor received half their income from a variety of nonfarm sources; (5) farmers held substantially more net worth than nonfarmers of comparable poverty position; and (6) relatively more female-headed households were poor than those with male heads. While primarily descriptive in nature, the report has implications for action programs, assistance agencies, and public policy makers, and it establishes the magnitude of the low income problem among Wisconsin's rural aged.

In August 1973 a committee of professional educators was appointed to develop guidelines for the Student Rights and Responsibilities Program. During December 1973 and January 1974, the draft of the guidelines was circulated to 195 BIA schools, the 12 area offices, who distributed it to tribal leaders, the American Indian Law Students Association at the University of New Mexico, and the National Indian Youth Council. Items used to elict response were: suggested changes and additions, weakest features, strongest features, and general comments. This report is important to the total thrust in the Student Rights and Responsibilities Program since  it shows that each step of the program's development was reviewed in some form or another at the grassroots level of education. A brief analysis of reactions to the draft guidelines, a copy of the instrument used relative to the review, actual comments, and a copy of the draft are included in this report. (NQ)",

Interviews, questionnaires, and classroom observations were used to collect data on this teaching method compared to others and the applicability of this approach to rural students. Teacher and student attitudes toward automated teaching as an alternative were reflected in the answers. The benefits of automated teaching were that automated instruction provided an alternative way of teaching; it was an innovative approach that motivated low achievers, and offered the multisensory  stimulation, repetition, and/or drill needed by some students. Individualized, as well as limited group instruction, freed the teacher to help in areas most needed. The skills being taught were well planned to expose the student thoroughly to that area and content relevant to his interests. The biggest problems faced were breakdown of equipment and time spent for coordination of audio to visual. The financial expense of programs and machines was not closely examined since equipment was donated for the use during the school year, but when planning for rural education, all costs and benefits should be examined closely to find out if automated teaching is effective in meeting rural students' needs for a reasonable expenditure.

        "description":"La Raza Advisory Committee, created in September 1971, was to recommend to the State Board of Education the means by which the quality of educational services to Michigan's Spanish speaking community could be improved. A problem was encountered in obtaining the necessary data to evaluate the current services offered the Spanish speaking community. The major educational problems identified by the committee as facing the more than 31,000 Spanish speaking students in Michigan were: (1) too few bilingual-bicultural staff at all educational levels; (2) too few relevant curriculum, textbooks, teacher training, and instructional materials; (3) relatively little commitment by local school districts in accepting the financial responsibility for bilingual education programs; (4) lack of  response by the school districts to the needs of the migrant child; (5) disproportionate financial assistance for these students in higher education; and (6) inadequate testing instruments, tracking systems, and academic counseling. Among the committee's recommendations to the State Board of Education were: (1) mandate that colleges and universities establish a curriculum leading to a degree and teacher certification in bilingual education; (2) continue La Raza Advisory Committee to advise the State Department of Education; and (3) investigate the extent testing instruments contribute to the &quot;tracking&quot; of these students into special education and other compensatory programs.

Jamestown, North Dakota was chosen as the study area since it typified a rural area which was heavily dependent on agriculture, but which had been successful in attracting industry. Questionnaires were used to gather data from: (1) managers and personnel of four firms recently locating in Jamestown, (2) four other firms who had evaluated the site but did not locate there, and (3) business and civic leaders of Jamestown. Factors designated of greatest influence  to site selection were community attitudes toward industry, grants and concessions made available to manufacturing firms, and labor related factors. Positive labor related factors were labor costs, willingness of local workers, a large supply of trainable labor, labor laws (right-to-work law), and labor unions. Although some dissatisfaction was expressed toward the personal time discipline required in manufacturing work, most workers expressed approval of their job role, of the higher standard of living manufacturing employment provided the majority of persons, and of the opportunity for employment afforded 81 percent of the personnel who objected to outmigration from the State.

        "description":"This monograph attempts to describe the rural population as reported in the 1960 Census of Population and to evaluate the residence categories used. The hypothesis that the proximity to large metropolitan centers plays a crucial role in determining the characteristics of rural areas is applied. Substantive and analytical portions of the monograph assist in evaluating the utility and relevance of the rural-farm and rural-nonfarm residence categories. Questions raised by these considerations are: (1) how homogeneous are the populations that are now isolated by the application of existing definitions of these categories; (2) to what extent does the aggregated rural population display identifiable patterns in each region or division, and what effect does distance from a metropolitan  area play on these patterns; and (3) what kind of a case can be made for the retention of current definitions of the populations according to residence? Included are: (1) a definition of rural America; (2) number and distribution of rural population; (3) age and sex composition of the rural population; (4) differential fertility; (5) factors related to fertility differences; (6) educational status; (7) employment of rural people; (8) income and earnings; (9) intercommunity differences in income; (10) summary and implications. The text is supplemented with statistical tables, charts, and graphs. Methodology is explained in the Statistical Appendix. (AH)",

Data gathered by a questionnaire administered to 2,736 students in a previous study was refined by applying the chi-square test of significant differences to certain student characteristics and variables. Each area office also conducted its own evaluation and five areas (Juneau, Minneapolis, Muskogee, Phoenix, and Navajo) participated in an audit of their self-evaluation. The four variables selected for analysis were age, college classification, blood quantum, and area office serving &quot;your&quot; tribe. No significant differences were shown for college classification and age. Area office and blood quantum showed significant differences. In relationship  to less than full-bloods, full-blood Indian students were more likely to have less parental encouragement to attend college; go to universities with 25 or more Indians enrolled or attend a private college; work toward an AA instead of a baccalaureate; speak their tribal language; live on campus; have special counseling services available to them; own and operate an automobile; or come from a home where the earnings are $3,000 annually. These differences could have an impact on the administration of programs. The educational audits pointed out a need for simplification and revision of record forms, but overall they showed that programs seem to be sound. (AH)",

After introducing the topic to the student, each section presents a pretest, educational objectives for the topic, &quot;mini&quot; case problems, and at least one fairly complicated case story involving several legal questions. Information is also included to clarify the legal questions involved. Teacher's notes, following each topic unit, include responses to self-quizzes and an outline of case studies issues requiring discussion. A teacher's foreward  describes the strategies and resources for using the handbook. Information on the availability of a slide show and suggestions for outside research assignments are given. Appendixes on the judicial systems, due process, and equal protection conclude the handbook. Although geared particularly to the law of Minnesota, this guide could be used in other states. (JH)",

Intended to help teachers apply theory and objectives in the classroom, the book consists of specific class-tested lessons which focus on how a study of the American past might be made more relevant in meeting the needs of students today. The yearbook is arranged in three major sections. Part 1 is a rationale for why the teaching of United States history should remain a vital part of the quest for relevancy within the school curriculum. Part 2 concentrates on how students can begin to better understand the nature of the discipline of history and how the teaching of history can assist students in further  developing a mode of inquiry, concepts, a sense of empathy, and ways for dealing with suspected myths and stereotypes. Eight sample lessons are included. Part 3 focuses on how historical topics can be expressly utilized to assist students in coping with issues which may arise in the future. Three sample lessons are included in this section. Major objectives, teaching suggestions, and student and teacher resource materials are provided for each lesson plan. (Author/RM)",

New approaches are needed for further research. A review of major occupational choice theories shows that they are constructed for primarily male populations and thus are inadequate in their handling of factors which may influence the occupational choices of women. There are more developmental stages for women, with a relatively greater complexity of factors operating within any given stage. Some of the more critical contingencies which affect the occupational choice and status attainment of women are marital plans, fertility plans, residential plans, mother's and father's education and occupation, family finances,  presence of discriminatory laws or hiring guidelines, internal motivation, husband's occupational expectation, desire for a working career as opposed to being a housewife, perception of the kinds of jobs that are appropriate for women, the influence of parents and peers, and presence of male siblings.

Conference papers and discussion deal with the nature of the social science disciplines and the meaning of their integration; the principles--knowledge, skills, problems, concepts, and methods--on which integration would be based; and the problems of implementation. An introductory paper presents &quot;The Case for Integration.&quot; The nature and logic of integration are discussed in case studies from a secondary school, university, and college for further education. Implications of curriculum change for the education of intended teachers and in the instance of an integrated curricula at one college are discussed.  Recommendations from discussion groups are summarized and put into the perspective of three considerations: (1) inquiry at the senior level is a new method of instruction, one usually reserved for primary school; (2) little is known about how to teach the elusive and explosive content of the social sciences; and (3) affective learning on such topics requires careful handling.

Two case studies of relatively large secondary schools are presented because many teachers are working for the first time in such schools. General points relating to organization are the formulation of aims and objectives of a school; decision making with respect to organizational strategies and priorities; and curricular organizational patterns. In the case studies each analysis considers the school's background and objectives; education prior to fourth and fifth years; preparation for curricular specialization; the nature of fourth- and  fifth-year courses; balance of curriculum; opportunities for the less academically interested; organization of courses; staffing; education at ages 16 to 19; and organization for change.

According to the guidelines, textbooks should portray cultural pluralism as a value to respect; present sexual, racial, religious, and ethnic groups in such a way as to build mutual understanding; help students to appreciate contributions to our history by members of various ethnic groups and women; and foster the impression of equal worthiness of all groups. In examining interactions among groups, United States history textbooks should describe and examine both historical and contemporary forces and conditions which operate to the disadvantage and advantage of minority groups and women. They should  analyze intergroup tension and conflict fairly and objectively, with emphasis on resolving social problems, and lead students to comprehend and fulfill their duties and responsibilities as citizens in a pluralistic democracy. The checklist is intended to apply to both older and newer textbooks and can be used by textbook writers, editors, teachers, parent groups, textbook selection committees, and students. (Author/DE)",

The research involves a measure of teacher attitudes toward education and a valuation of behavioral objectives in both cognitive and affective domains representing all levels of those objectives in the social studies. One hundred and forty fourth, fifth, and sixth grade teachers in Michigan, interested in the use of behavioral objectives, participated. Analysis of the data suggests that (1) a significant relationship exists between a progressive attitude toward education and a high valuation for the highest level  affective behavior; (2) there is little evidence of a strong relationship between attitude and valuations in the cognitive domain; and (3) a positive relationship exists between a progressive attitude and a greater number of graduate hours in social studies. Implications for inservice training of teachers should be drawn by those interested in implementing objectives in the affective domain. (JH)",

Analyses of how views on physical, regional, and human geography have affected the elementary and secondary curricula and a history of the incorporation of geography into the social studies curriculum in the 1940's are included. In the sixties, the High School Geography Project (HSGP) and various elementary level projects shaped elementary and secondary geography into an interdisciplinary and conceptually oriented subject with emphases in affective learning and urban studies. Critical elements for geography education envisioned for the future are decision making, valuing, and resolving conflict. Traditional tools  for locational analysis applied to these elements will validate geography's importance in the curriculum. Conceptual models for these processes and specific examples of their application -- deciding whether to build the Alaska pipeline, investigating the values behind locating a parking lot, and resolving a conflict over the location of the future settlement of Jamestown -- included in the document provide direction for teaching the geography of the future. An annotated bibliography on geography and the teaching of geography is also included. (JH)",

Modifications in 1943 and 1963 had already required a fifth year of graduate study and supervised student teaching, usually as a culminating experience, for certification. At the university campus at Stony Brook the new program, which is both competency- and field-based, contains an introductory course with structured field-based experiences. In the spirit of accountability and public sharing, the substance of this course is presented in this overview of course content and components and collection of 14 field-based investigations. The course covers social studies as a subject taught in the  secondary schools, particularly the curricular materials, teaching strategies, learning activities, and modes of evaluation used in secondary instruction. Teacher education students choose five field-based investigations which include observation, participation, tutoring, and possibly micro-teaching in order to integrate clinical experience with the theoretical understandings gained through the other course components of individualized reading, directed activities, and an independent project.

Classes of students were assigned to experimental and control groups in grades 7-8, grades 9-10, and grades 11-12. In the fall 2,000 students were administered a social studies skills pretest. Tests of students in the experimental group were returned to teachers with instructions to use them for instructional purposes while students in the control group were not given any feedback. In the spring, all students were posttested with a parallel form of the pretest and scores were compiled. The information analyzed does not make a clear case for the efficacy of the treatment to provide for increased social studies skills for high school students.  The results concerning the efficiency of the use of tests as teaching devices on the grounds of the \"feedback\" principle are inconclusive. Skills tested at each grade are listed and copies of pre- and posttests for each level are included in the appendixes along with the copies of the posttest instruments and the resulting scores.

Educational philosophy and content are seen as pawns in the social and political struggles of those years. Detailed coverage of the historical events describes the structure of education as it has evolved and the battles that brought about a popular, practical aspect to curricula. In this struggle the use of demotic or popular Greek is a real as well as symbolic issue. The slow progress of modernization, impeded most recently by the 1967 military takeover is described as the result of Greek pride in a cultural heritage embodied in traditional, classical education. Reforms achieved in 1964 are seen as indications of what  may come with time. Greek terms are used throughout the history and are defined in a glossary at the end. (JH)",

Two established university committees, one established departmental committee, and four student ad hoc committees were investigated. Sixteen meetings were videotaped, transcribed, coded, and analyzed. A general systems model was used to conceptualize the decision process and the stochastic theory of Markov chains was used to operationalize the concept of decision making. Five research questions were posed and thirty-five major hypotheses were tested to provide answers. The questions concerned the stability of the transition probabilities from various speaker-mode states and communicative function states during the decision processes. Results indicated that in committees with a majority of faculty members, students  initiated the fewest proposals of all members. But in the student ad hoc committees, more proposals were initiated than in the established committees with faculty membership and a faculty chairperson. (Author)",

        "description":"A critical review of traditional publications on the history of American education reveals an exclusion of the participation and contribution of blacks. This study covers the 20-year period during which the acquisition of an education was deemed by blacks as the most significant element for their survival as independent and productive citizens. Data for the study are gathered at national and state archives, research centers, and numerous predominantly black and white insitutions of higher education. A few of the topics of analysis are the extent to which the black man assisted in providing education for members of his race; the individuals and groups which provided education for the black adult and the methods utilized; the success of groups in opposition to the education of  blacks; and the political, social, and economic reasons that generated efforts toward education of the black man. The data supports the conclusion that concerted efforts were made by blacks and benevolent whites to provide continuity in educational activities and ultimately to develop a viable education system. While education for black adults was initially rudimentary in nature, institutions of higher learning that were incipient during this period were invaluable to blacks in their acquisition of technical skills.

The articles also examine one or more of four themes which transcend the four research areas: learning one's own culture, learning about another culture, formal educational programs in culture learning programs. The first theme is represented by a survey of cross-cultural research, analysis of which gives insights into one's own culture. Next, four papers on learning about another culture provide specific criteria and examples of such learning, for instance, when to use first names and nicknames. In the third topic, four papers discuss  programs to preserve cultures, especially with respect to their indigeneous languages and intellectual manpower. The several papers on the fourth topic of issues in culture learning discuss the politics of cultural pluralism, the effect of participation in bicultural education, and the motives of people engaged in bilingual-bicultural programs.

The results reveal that preadults' orientations are influenced by the level of cognitive development attained by that individual. Piaget's theory of cognitive development is shown to be useful in interpreting most of the major changes that take place in the preadult's developing orientations to politics.

The effects of these changes on selected educational variables--reading comprehension, school dropouts, and admission to institutions of higher education--are studied. A comparison is made between data collected in 1966 and that collected in 1973 for the present study of a probability sample of 884 students from intermediate and high schools both public and private, urban and rural. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that the SEL for school children is increasing, that there is a high correlation between SEL and reading comprehension scores, that dropouts have continued to be very low in comparison with public schools, and that the  existing relationship between SEL and academic achievement creates discrimination toward the &quot;poor&quot; in university admission policy. The study confirms that which was expected; however, continuing study of socioeconomic and educational levels, particularly in the developing countries, is necessary if planning and resource allocations are to be effective.

Value sheets, carefully planned activities designed to elicit value clarifying patterns of language from students, are one way of securing value clarification. Sheets, planned in conjunction with ongoing units of instruction, avoid isolating valuing from its important content. Six different formats -- standard, forced-choice, affirmative, rank-order, classification, and criterion -- represent different demands in valuing, from learning to express and share values to identifying a basis for decision making, inventing solutions, organizing preferences hierarchically, linking choice with consequence, and recognizing the relationships among choices, social  policies, decision making grounds, and consequences. Two examples for each format indicate some ways that contexts can be chosen from Social studies materials. Each of the value sheets contains the social and scientific context of a situation to which a student reacts or in which a student participates, as well as questions in the form of discussion starters.

It endeavors to find out why the politicians and educators who contributed to development of the primary school believed that mass education was important to the regime they were working to establish. The investigation relied on published sources, including the speeches and writings of leading republicans, the pedagogical press, school textbooks, monographs, histories of French education, and governmental publications. The major finding is that republicans looked to education to promote order and social control. By propagating a common set of values and ideals and  a standard appreciation of the republic, the school was expected to be a powerful agent of public tranquility and the balance wheel of popular sovereignty. In converting social and economic problems into educational problems, republicans effectively denied the need for significant government intervention and placed the responsibility for imporvement on the shoulders of the individual.

A theoretical model explores the role of schooling as an informational or screening device with an expected profit maximization framework. The issue revolves around the extent to which formal schooling serves to augment worker productivity and, thus, social product, as opposed to conveying information to employers about the probable productive capabilities of prospective workers without, in itself, affecting those capabilities. Empirical tests are formulated to disentangle schooling's productivity augmenting and identification functions. The conclusion drawn is that the apparent use of schooling as a screening device does not appear to stem from a mere identification of productivity types. In fact, the  pure productivity augmenting view of the income-schooling relationship appears greatly more tenable. (Author/KSM)",

The study is is based on data gathered in Sweden from 1938 to the present from 1,544 third graders. Eleven hypotheses tested by applying the model to the data confirm the United States model with the following variations: father's occupation is in indirect rather than direct relation to the son's occupational status; background effects are mediated by schooling and ability, especially with  respect to occupational status, and are more powerful determinants of education; and educational effects are more powerful determinants of ability at maturity. Some incongruences between the Swedish data and current analytical techniques and theoretical questions related to use of background variables, caution against basing educational policy on the models. Tables and figures illustrate the data and models; a bibliography concludes the report. (JH)",

A second section lists graduate and undergraduate theses, and other print sources which deal with the labor movement in the state of Maine. The last and final section of the bibliography cites 16mm films, some of which deal with the history of the American labor movement while others treat specific up-to-date issues of interest to labor.

Topics covered include perceptions (1) of contemporary urban problems, (2) environmental quality, and (3) minority groups and social justice. Responses to the open-ended questions are displayed in tables and graphs which distinguish the age groups surveyed, 9, 13, 17, and adult; acceptable responses; and categories of answer content. For example, 13- and 17-year-olds listed the three most important problems facing large cities in the United States. A table showing the percentages of students able to respond and a table of those responses with percentages of students mentioning them are presented. Then the students chose one  problem about which they would like to ask questions; percentages choosing various problems are given. The tabular evidence is investigated, and sample responses are given. The material in this document can suggest areas for curricular emphasis and new questioning exercises that may &quot;turn students on.&quot; Use of these materials to stimulate discussion and for comparing student responses is encouraged.

The research reported here concentrates on the latter. It is felt that, because it is expected that educational expansion affects economic development, complicated analysis strategies are called for. The strategy supported is that of a longitudinal investigation of the issue using a large sample of nation-states. Special problems concerning longitudinal analysis and the use of conventional cross-national data are discussed. Using a revised panel model and the data for 1950-1965, relatively strong effects of educational expansion on economic development are shown. These findings persist under a wide variety of  modifications of the analysis structure and, further, appear to be inconsistent with a model in which both education and economic development are not causally related.

The report, based on a survey of UNESCO members, first attempts to describe the characteristics of rural areas, the size of their population, and the reasons for and the scope and impact of the exodus from the countryside in so far as women are concerned. The present situation with respect to the access to education of girls and women in rural areas is described. Essential factors of rural development and the extent of women's role in this process form the third part of the report. In conclusion, the education of women for rural development, their place in literacy and agricultural education and training programs makes it possible to pick out certain  features of the various countries' policies for the advancement of rural women.

These skills included musical performance, ability to use traditional notation, ability to discriminate and label instruments and voices, ability to recognize important aspects of music history and literature, and the disposition to listen to music and participate in musical activities. Eighty thousand individuals in four age groups were tested. Results indicate that performance, knowledge of notation and terminology, and knowledge of music history and literature rank the lowest. Knowledge of the names and sounds of musical instruments and general attitude towards music rank  the highest. The general pattern is that people are involved at the simplest levels with the activity of music, while more specialized knowledge is lacking.

        "description":"Since 1965 the National Assessment of Educational Progress has conducted a nationwide survey of musical abilities, during which 150 musical exercises have been administered to about 80,000 individuals in four age groups. Members of the Music Educators National Conference studied this survey to determine implications for the music teacher in terms of curriculum methods and priorities. Exercises were grouped into the following five categories: musical performance, knowledge of notation and terminology, recognition of instrumental and vocal media, knowledge of music history and literature, and attitudes toward music. Results of the exercises were generally low, although attitudes toward music were positive. This led to the implication that music education programs are not taking  full advantage of the positive attitude that people have toward music. The panel limited themselves to the discussion of national results, foregoing results by sex, color, region, parental education, and community type.

The research is a followup study to one conducted in 1964. Responses to a questionnaire, related to curriculum revision, were received from principals, department heads, and teachers of the same schools surveyed a decade earlier. Changes during the 10-year interval, as shown by the study, include (1) an increase in the number of social studies courses, (2) a trend toward elective, micro-courses (rather than full-year courses), (3) a shift toward student involvement on conceptual issues, (4) an increase in the numbers of courses in behavioral sciences and area studies, and (5) a slight increase in the use of inquiry techniques with an accompanying  plea for materials and facilities to enrich and further increase these student-centered techniques. In regard to valuable influences on curriculum revision, a strong preference is indicated for educational books by Bruner, Fenton, Glasser, Silverman, and Postman and Weingartner. In addition, the National Association for Secondary School Principals Bulletin, National Council for the Social Studies materials, and social studies texts also rated high. Despite these encouraging trends, need is suggested for increased teacher training in the use of inquiry techniques. (JH)",

Foshay, in order to achieve a humane curriculum subject matter and each experience must be responsive to the human condition in the context of all pedagogical intentions of the teacher. Six classes of experience--intellectual, emotional, social, physical, aesthetic, and spiritual--make up the human existence. Teachers may then set three goals--fluency, manipulation, and persistance--for their students' personal development in each of the six aspects of human existence. According to the author, the resulting 18 cell grid is somewhat misleading because it suggests that some of the aspects of the human condition may be considered separately. Instead, since these aspects are inseparable and continually interacting, it is better to conceive of the grid as  three dimensional, with each aspect overlapping on the other. Further, the social aspect must include two distinct dimensions, those imposed by the mores of society and those imposed by the individual's needs and potentials, producing seven dimensions on which to plot points in order to fully describe any learning experience or plan any learning environment.

Topics discussed include how girls experienced hotel life in London, field studies in English, a housecraft course, education for and through a leisure course, an outdoor pursuits centre, and other  examples of residential work. Among examples of single-school strategies presented are how a town school converts a rural railway station into a residential centre, and an outdoor activities week. (Author/RM)",

The major intent of the publication is to provide a broad framework of goals and objectives, content, teaching strategies, class activities, and materials related to American government so that teachers may accept the model framework in total or draw ideas from it to incorporate into their lessons. Course goals require that the student: (1) identify and analyze the mutual obligations of a government and its citizenry; (2) differentiate among the various alternatives man has developed to govern himself; (3) infer that the U.S. system of government has evolved from many historical lessons and political experiments; (4) describe the major issues faced by the drafters of the constitution and critically  discuss their resolution; (5) analyze and evaluate the evolution of constitutional government in the United States; and (6) propose changes in the U.S. constitution and predict the effect of these changes on our national life. Among the teaching strategies suggested are role-playing, research, debates, oral reports, readings, films, classroom discussions, and many individual or small group activities. Learning activities are provided for each teaching objective. A list of print and nonprint resource materials is also included. (Author/RM)",

DMP is a research-based, innovative, process-oriented elementary mathematics program developed at the Research and Development Center for Cognitive Learning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After two months in the field test, participating teachers were asked to evaluate the program with open-ended comment. Most responded favorably, some reserved judgment, and some were having a little trouble adjusting to the new program. At the end of the year, however, all 16 teachers responding to an attitude survey  reported favorable reactions to the program. On criterion-referenced measures, the second-grade DMP classes gained substantially over the control group, but the first grades gained equally. On standardized tests, the control group scored slightly higher on computations and mathematical concepts. Inasmuch as DMP is sequenced along a different continuum, the standardized achievement test scores represent an unfair and invalid measure of mathematical success as taught through DMP. (HMD)",

Recent court opinions are discussed, in relation to the declared need for a principle of neutrality in respect to language, by which the language or dialect of any student should not be disparaged or denied. Examples involving Chinese-speaking and Spanish-speaking students are cited. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico in 1848 recognized the differences in customs, traditions, and language of the people of New Mexico, and the Ninth Amendment  to the federal Consititution provides grounds for claiming the right to such differences by all U.S. citizens. Court cases dealing with obscenity, the study of comparative religion, Indian education, and the traditions of the Amish community are examined in this context. A model for preparing educational personnel to assist in the building and preservation of community identity is proposed, which would give primary considerations to the sufficiency of the individual and the development of decent and humane communities.

Preservice education prepares the teacher only to the readiness for teaching stage, and on-the-job experience occupies only a minor proportion of the teacher education program. In the first years of teaching, provision should be made to diagnose, prescribe, and program for the beginning teacher; to correct teaching weaknesses; and to develop competencies. Several exemplary programs, which are discussed briefly, suggest 10 steps that could help in developing a 2-year program of inservice training for the beginning teacher. A concluding section calls for a portion of the funds now available for educational innovation to be used for the professional  development of the teacher, with the heaviest investment during the first 2 or 3 years of teaching and the balance used for inservice development during the remainder of the teacher's career.

Nine systems were selected for factor analysis: Aschner/Gallagher; Flanders; Gallagher; Hough; Medley;  Simon/Agazarian; Ober; Schalock; and Withall/Lewis/Newell. Coders trained in the use of these systems were provided with tapes of science lessons for coding in their system. Coders were also asked to make arrangements for key punching and analyzing their own data and to calculate and define those variables that are frequently employed by users of their system. The individual variables for each observation system were factor analyzed. This process provided a list of factor scores for use in a second order factor analysis.

        "description":"Recent attempts to clarify the roles of master teacher, regular teacher, teacher assistant, teacher aide, intern, and student teacher are pointless because there has never been a clear and widely accepted definition of just what the role of the teacher is. The reason a professional teacher is needed should be the basis on which he is evaluated, and the only process for which all teachers must be held accountable is motivation. Motivation as a teacher behavior has two parts: (a) it is the demonstrated effort to elicit from students a behavioral manifestation of their need to pursue an activity, extend an idea, or experience a feeling and (b) it is not standing in the students' way once the manifestation of motivation is observed. There are various behavioral styles teachers can  use to implement the function of motivation, including personal model, gadgety instruction, group pressure, reward and reinforcement, curiosity needs, newness needs, and situational pressure. Those who perform these motivational functions are engaged in professional activity regardless of their status, while those who do not manifest these competencies are not teaching regardless of their certification. The next step in the development of this approach is to analyze schemes that will free teachers to perform at least the motivational structures, and the subsequent step is to develop a progression of preparation with regard to the development of motivational competencies.

Results indicate a favorable response toward the foundations studies in general. Sociological aspects were valued most highly, followed closely by philosophic aspects. Historical aspects received low evaluations. Sex of student was found to be a significant variable, but major and student teaching experience were not.

Seven recommended changes are discussed, and competencies and knowledge areas are presented. Some implications for community development are discussed, and the need for a matrix organization that creates the opportunity for fluidity of personnel rather than rigid classifications is stressed. A model of one possible matrix approach is presented. The author concludes that the fundamental purpose of education is to create people with the kind of values which will be appropriate for  the future; and to do this successfully, educators must have an image of what the world is going to be like, so that they can work to develop appropriate values for this world.

The second category includes children with moderate behavioral disorders who can remain  in school but require intensive help from specialists. The third category includes children with severe behavioral disorders who require assignment to a special class or school. General findings include data concerning the overall incidence of behavioral disorders as perceived by classroom teachers, possible factors related to behavioral disorders in children, and incidence levels in relation to the general category of behavioral disorders in addition to a breakdown with respect to mild, moderate, and severe disorders.

To bring about an effective linkage with the state education department, it is stated, a state college is in a unique position to be a catalyst: two state agencies are thus more effectively able to join forces with the local district and regional groupings of districts and help coordinate projects and assure more effective planning, continuity, and long-term development.

Four clearly distinguishable models of fair selection are presented: the Cleary, or traditional, model; the Cole model; the Thorndike model; and the Darlington model. A distinction is made between the use of tests in a manner which is \"fair\", and the concept of \"test bias\", which most frequently refers to the content of the items of the test, regardless of any particular use to which the test is being put. It is possible to conceive of a biased test being used in a fair manner, and also possible to imagine an unbiased test being used unfairly.

It consists of 95 objective test questions designed to measure the applicant's vocabulary, reading comprehension, knowledge of English usage, and ability to reason quantitatively in solving problems with numbers. The objective of this research is to provide information relevant to two questions: (1) Is there sufficient evidence that the FSEE is screening out applicants who would have done more poorly in Federal service than those who pass the test to warrant the continued use of the FSEE? and (2) Do proportionately fewer black applicants pass the FSEE than white  applicants? The validity of the FSEE is explored, and the results of analyses of data obtained from the Civil Service Commission are presented. FSEE passing rates are compared for students from black and white colleges. It is concluded that the use of the FSEE is unfairly discriminatory to many black applicants, and its use should be suspended pending strong evidence of its validity. (Author/RC)",

Continuing for 19 days after the mail-out date, the experiment randomly assigned people from the same sex and school to either a certified mail group or a first-class mail group. The overall difference in response rates appeared to be appreciable. The cost effectiveness of using certified mail for a 10 item and a 150-item questionnaire was then  formulated. The results indicated that the most cost effective plan was the use of certified mail with the long questionnaire and first-class mail with the short one.

Six major areas of emphasis were identified reflecting district thinking and national trends: self awareness; decision-making; career awareness; attitudes and appreciations; economic awareness; and educational awareness. Information Based Evaluation Exchange (IBEX) was chosen to evaluate this effort. Workable definitions of career education and evaluation were arrived at through conferences with principals and administrators and the IBEX staff. The three major components on which IBE rests: information users, information domains, and evaluation questions, were carefully reviewed and given priority ranks in the evaluation. Major concerns in terms of  evaluating the program which, in essence, were inadequacies that the staff of District II had experienced with other programs and program evaluations, were formulated. Overall, IBEX proved to be an integral part of the change process in the district. However, because the post-test data has not yet been collected and analyzed, the results of the first year's effort are not yet known. (RC)",

Different types of tests are designed to sample different universes and norm-, objective-, and criterion-referenced tests are distinguished in aspects of design, development, use, and interpretation. Several of the nationally-normed achievement tests may  exhibit characteristics of both NRTs and CRTs to a greater or lesser degree, according to how CRTs are defined.

Sixteen tests of visual processing speed were administered to 110 undergraduate students. In summary, scores tended to be only slightly correlated. The largest correlations were produced by various forms of the same technique, i.e., tachistoscope test with numbers and tachistoscope test with letters. Given the generally low intercorrelations, the factor analysis did not yield interpretable factors across various types of tests. Data produced by this study indicates that estimates of the processing speed of individuals tend to be inconsistent across  various types of tasks.

Score comparability from administrations on the two answer forms was investigated. It was found that the answer form change had negligible effect on average examinee performance overall score distributions, or correlations among the battery's tests. Significant interaction between initial ability (as measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test) and answer form used was found  for two tests (Word Knowledge and Coding Speed); however the interaction did not follow a clearcut pattern.

In this study, it was assumed that practically all students should master consumer-producer-citizen arithmetic applications prior to leaving school. Data from the 1970 and 1971 testing programs showed how New Hampshire grade 10 students marked test items relating to such applications. The data for seven items are presented and discussed. The data suggest that a great many students were seriously deficient in performing simple arithmetic applications that may be important for everyday adult living (survival skills). How serious  this is cannot be determined by one person, it must be decided by parents, citizens, students, teachers, school administrators, and finally by school board members. (Author/RC)",

The objective of this research program is to further refine an organizational development approach which provides schools with a structure consistent with the environment of educational systems, the professional capacities of school personnel, and the inherent demands of the educational technology. A modified and abbreviated version of this district-level intervention was pilot tested and evaluated in a previous action-research project. The pilot program focused on the superimposition of complementary collective decision structures over the existing authority configuration in schools through the use of survey feedback  and problem solving processes. The intervention succeeded in increasing organizational flexibility and adaptability by providing for problem identification, solution generation, and change initiation at the faculty level. Product evaluation confirmed that the structural intervention brought about significant favorable changes in teacher work attitudes and perceptions of collectivity in organizational decision processes.

Learning takes place through the child's manipulation and experimentation with objects and through his experiences with the cognitive goal areas incorporated into his activities by the teacher. The observation procedure used is SCOPE (Systematic Classroom Observation of Pupil Experience) and consists of six broad categories: (1) child-adult contacts, (2) child-child contacts, (3) child-material contacts involving reading or writing, (4) child-material contacts not involving reading or  writing, (5) lone, and (6) group size. A separate instrument for coding teacher behavior, SCOTE, was also created. Since classroom behaviors are directly relevant to curriculum goals, observational data can be used for assessing success in meeting those goals. The intensive data on individual children may serve a useful formative function since a profile of the interaction patterns of the children can be provided to the teacher. (Author/RC)",

The number of significant relationships between certain nonverbal tests and final technical school grade varied as a function of mental category and career field. When all nonverbal tests were used as a composite, significance was found in all courses for the total group and in three of five courses for the lower mental ability groups. On cross-validation the number of significant relationships between the nonverbal composite and final school grade were reduced to four total group courses and one lower ability group course. When added to the  selector aptitude index (AI), the nonverbal tests made a significant and unique contribution to the prediction of technical school success over and beyond the selector AI alone. Further investigation indicated that additional aptitudinal and educational data added significantly to the prediction system in some courses. Results indicate that the use of nonverbal tests as well as other aptitudinal and educational data could make a significant contribution if added to the operational selection and classification battery.

The problems provided were an extension of the materials developed for the Purdue Elementary Problem-Solving Inventory. The Premack Principle of behavior modification states that a preferred activity can be used as a reinforcer of related but less desirable activities. Phase 1 of the investigation served as validation for the training materials and reinforcement procedures. Phase 2 involved the formal training program. Three experimental groups were formed from classes selected to represent differences in social class and ethnic origins. One group received reinforcement for working on the materials; a  second was given the materials as a regular part of the schoolwork with no reinforcement; and a third served as a control, and received no materials. Results demonstrated that the materials were effective in increasing problem-solving ability, but that children who used the materials without rewards outperformed children given rewards. Socioeconomic differences were observed, and it appeared that black children improved to a level equal to that of white children in the materials-plus-rewards group. (Author/SE)",

Three groups of people are dealt with specifically: children in the early years, (through grade three); children in the middle years, (through grade eight); and professional educators. The conclusion of the assessment process is in two parts: a decision about an individual and an analysis of the total assessment system. The decision about the individual should involve the individual and result in an educational improvement. Analysis of the system should result in an improved system. It is the responsibility of the system to assist the individual to refocus existing knowledge, attitudes and skills or develop new ones through  existing in-service activities. Professional assessment depends upon the allocation of sufficient resources to do the job. It is essential to that task that professionals develop a comprehensive approach to the question. A process for getting started, some problems to avoid, and some characteristics to include have been suggested.

Some guidelines for developing an accountability system for pps as part of the total educational enterprise are provided. Some of the basic elements of accountability are discussed and their application to a school system or district program of pps and to programs at the school level are described. This general discussion is followed with brief illustrations designed to clarify the procedures previously discussed. These illustrations are not be be interpreted as an  organizational model for pps. Nor are the elements of accountability discussed here intended to be a blueprint for an accountability system.

The purposes include: program formulation, budget resource allocation, grant-in-aid designs, performance incentive payments, consumer information for school selection, and program evaluation and review. This paper outlines methods for controlling population differences to make data on performance more comparable across time and from place to place. The resulting estimates of achievement scores, standardized for population differences, are useful for comparison only. Such comparative indexes remove the influence on average scores of population changes over time, or population differences between schools or  school districts. Adjusted scores are not intended to take the place of the basic data but to complement them. Standardization procedures can be applied to achievement test scores and to other measurements of competence such as attitudes or attributes. In this report, achievement score adjustment is used as an example. The selection of sex, income, and race (SIR) as control variables is proposed as a first step. (Author/SE)",

It was determined that such a study was not feasible. However some committee members suggested that many graduate departments used some type of ratings of graduate students; that rating scale criteria would be generally acceptable to the various disciplines; and that it would be feasible to conduct studies using this type of criterion. It appeared from the investigation that a sufficient number of departments use a three-or-greater level rating procedure to warrant an attempt to conduct some preliminary validity studies using existing rating data as criteria. The  probable variation between the rating scales currently in use in departments at different universities both in terms of attributes rated and type of scale quality, suggests that a uniform set of criterion rating scales should be developed prior to attempting to conduct validity studies using rating scales as criterion measures.

The report includes a description of the tryout scope and the procedures used for teacher training, the measures of the assessment, and entry and end of program test pattern types and sampling data. An analysis of the program shows that all classes attained a high level of  proficiency on the end-of-program test. The report concludes by tracking student progress through the program. (SE)",

        "description":"Observer disagreement is important insofar as it limits the reliabilities of observational records. This discussion evolves around methods and conditions under which observer agreement can be measured as to minimize such an occurrence. Observers should be trained to nearly perfect agreement with a criterion or expert coder on unambiguous examples of behavioral categories before actual data collection. Disagreement on ambiguities may help reflect a more accurate representation of the real world. In addition to criterion-related agreement, it is suggested that intraobserver agreement be obtained by showing a video tape twice to all observers in which conditions parallel those encountered in the field. While criterion-related and intraobserver agreement measures have been  recommended for both before and during a study, they should not be used as evidence of observer agreement in the actual classroom, but rather to assist an investigator in documenting adequacy of observational skills. After a study is finished, reliabilities of observational data and coefficients of stability and observer agreement should be calculated by using intraclass correlation coefficients. (Author/RC)",

Awareness was determined by a recognition task. The personality variable was a measure of the agreeing response set to Likert-scaled personality items. Subjects were grouped as extreme or moderate responders. The tendency to respond extremely was viewed as a type of deviant behavior, related to other nonconforming behavior, and growing out of early socialization patterns. Unaware subjects showed no performance gains, which is consistent with a cognitive viewpoint. Among aware subjects, moderates showed high performance gains, while extremes showed only small gains. A breakdown of extremes into highs (yeasayers) and lows (naysayers)  revealed that 77 percent of the yeasayers and 33 percent of the nay sayers became aware, as compared to 50 percent of the moderates. These findings were discussed in terms of the need to consider individual differences in the statement of general behavioral laws. (Author)",

Students in the SCIL program chose more positive responses when compared to students in teacher-made traditional curriculum. The SCIL students also chose more positive responses when compared with nonindividualized programs. Third grade SCIl study chose more positive  response than did SCIL students in grades, 4, 5, and 6 suggesting that the units were well suited for the third grade students' developmental level.

Neither memorization nor temporal placement of the memorization tasks significantly affected performances on posttest or rule application retention test.

Since degrees of urbanism had previously been shown to be related to some of the variables in question, the schools were grouped across the urban location variable for each comparison. Data was derived from the 1970 Survey of Compensatory Education, which included over 58,000  schools from 800 districts chosen at random from the states participating in the Belmont system. Of those schools over 33,000 have been identified as having Title I programs and nearly 25,000 have been identified as non-Title I schools. The survey had been so administrated that these schools were weighted to project the national population of elementary schools in districts having enrollments greater than 300 pupils. The comparisons between the Title I schools and the non-Title I schools utilized crosstabulations built on each of the subgroups. (Author/JM)",

Also, the study was to find out and document how these successful schools were different so that other schools would know what to do if they aspired to the same level of success. The study proceeded through three phases. The first phase called for the identification of successful and unsuccessful inner-city schools. The second phase  called for defining the factors to be studied and methods for collecting and interpreting data. And the final phase, not yet completed, called for reporting findings. The set of factors studied were mostly drawn from Weber (with some wording changes), with two additional factors, related to the attributes of teachers, added: leadership, coordination, additional reading personnel, atmosphere, individualization, evaluation, expectation, use of phonics, training and experience, and, quality of teaching. However, there were no main effects on success of school for any one of these factors. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper pursues the question: \"When is conflict functional to a proponent of change?\" Interview data from school desegregation controversies in 91 Northern cities is used. Four major findings from the data show ways in which conflict seems to both facilitate and hinder effects to obtain desegregation: On the one hand, cities with militant black populations are more likely to have the issue of school desegregation come up, and desegregation is more likely to occur if the school board has a high level of internal conflict; but at the same time both civil rights demonstrations and grass roots anti-integration activity by whites seem self-defeating. Five hypothesis are drawn from the findings: (1) A non-issue can be made salient by a powerless group with conflict-raising tactics.  (2) The pressure of a tradition of conflict is a facilitator of change. (3) Grass roots activity without the support of some elites is often ignored by other elites. (4) Conflict is generally dysfunctional if a decision for change must be made by an informal decision rule based on consensus politics. (5) Conflict-increasing tactics are less likely to be self-defeating, and may be helpful, in a group with compulsory attendance and a decision-making rule requiring less than unanimity. Examples of groups with compulsory attendance are bureaucracies, legislative bodies, and firms. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"During the first half of the nineteenth century, the aristocratic, monarchical, and oligarchic societies of Europe were anathema. From the nineteenth century down to the present, a much larger percentage of the appropriate age population has attended secondary schools and institutions of higher education here than elsewhere. Most noteworthy of all has been the stress on equality of opportunity. The spread of the common school idea included a practice which would have far-reaching consequences. These schools, designed in part to Americanize the immigrant and to &quot;civilize&quot; the lower classes, knowingly set their educational sights at the levels of the culturally deprived. In a sense, they consciously lowered standards, or rather educational aspirations, from the levels  upper-middle-class children could attain so as to make it possible for those of &quot;deprived background&quot; to catch up. By going slowly at the elementary and high school levels, the U.S. system permits many more to enter an institution of higher education. The gradual acceptance of the community's responsibility for upgrading the level of life of the underprivileged in America constitutes an important shift in our values. There is, however, a more fundamental change in the making, one that is implicit in the shift in emphasis from extending opportunity rights to the individual to extending them to the group.

A novel and successful type of inservice education was recently initiated by the Ohio State University College of Education in collaboration with Columbus, Ohio, Public Schools. The program is called the Preface Program. The 21 elementary teachers who participated included both Negroes and whites; none of these men and women has previously taught in low-income schooos, although roughly half of them were experienced elsewhere. Twelve psychological-personality instruments were administered to know the participatns better. It seemed reasonable to determine whether certain types of  selfhood structures were more susceptible to training for inner city teacher than others. During the school year of the study the performance of each of the the 21 participants was monitored and rated to produce four criterion measures. After scores on the dozen selfhood examinations and the criterion measures were accumulated, first order correlations were calculated between every variable and every other variable. A stepwise regression analysis of each of the criterion measures was used to determine what parsimonious subset of psychological measures could predict each criterion with a reasonable amount of success.

The recent project in which it was field-tested was supported by a federal contract from the U.S. Office of Education. The Preface Plan began the summer preceding the assumption of inner city elementary school classroom responsibilities by its 21 participants and terminated in June upon completion of their first-year assignment. Designed to offer staff new to the inner city a preface of positive experiences to increase the likelihood of their success, the program is structured so that any urban school system working in  conjunction with an institution of higher learning, or, independently if necessary, can strive to provide an adequate education for all children of the community. Preface teachers enter the inner city classroom with an increased sensitivity toward children of the poor, with more confidence and understanding about the job. The most valuable aspects of the training are those involving direct experiences with the poverty population. An important factor in the confidence of new teachers stems from the procedure of building support for them into their assigned school. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Alternate Secondary Center (ASC) Program, is the latest step in a series of activities which have been taken to individualize prescriptive learning programs to meet the identified needs of alienated secondary school youngsters. As the external component to the chain of alternate secondary programs, Hartford's two ASC's focused on two operational concepts. (1) Each Center was staffed by one unit leader, five teachers, a secretary, and a paraprofessional. These instructional services were further supplemented by a half-time assignment of a social worker and a guidance counselor. With this staffing pattern, each ASC was set up to provide individualized instructional services to approximately 50 alienated youngsters enrolled in grades seven through 12. The instructional focus was  on basic skill mastery and particularly language arts remediation, the development of a functional self-concept which would enable each youngster to succeed in a mainstream environment, and both vocational and career exploration. (2) Because regular school offerings had proven to be ineffective with the alienated youngster who produced symptoms of emotional and behavioral problems within his classroom, each ASC was held responsible for the identification, construction, piloting, and validation of individualized learning materials which would work. Return of youngsters to mainstream classes was resisted. (Author/JM)",

The general objectives of the program were as follows: (1) to raise the level of achievement of pupils who are deficient in the basic skills of language and reading; (2) to improve the self-image of the pupils through approval for any achievement and to provide an atmosphere of mutual self-respect; (3) to develop an appreciation for and pleasure in reading; (4) to investigate techniques and materials which will assist teachers in more effective teaching of reading; (5) to create materials and operate a model demonstration center for the teachers of Hartford; (6) to provide a flexible environment that promotes individualized  instruction geared to the learning styles of each pupil; (7) to develop a learner who is self-motivated; (8) to teach to the strengths of each child's learning style and provide remediation for his learning weaknesses; and, (9) to promote an interest on the part of parents in the importance of school-home relationships. The successful departmentalized structure was continued the last year. This design included intensive reading emphasis in three areas--decoding, individualized reading, and vocabulary and comprehension skills. Pupils received approximately one hour of instruction daily in each of the three areas. (Author/JM)",

Intended to serve Spanish and English-speaking students in direct proportion to their distribution within the Barnard-Brown attendance area, the program was planned so as to include two interrelated dimensions. Exito was to serve a demonstration effort in bilingual education which could then be expanded to other populations if the results were favorable; it was also to serve as a bilingual community school which could and would provide direct services to students ranging from preschool to  adult education. While the evaluation design was a relatively straight forward pre-post-test model, a number of operational controls were build in to the design so as to insure program validity to the resultant data. The design included pre- and post-measures which could be administered not only on a grade by grade basis, but over a longitudinal period as well. While the design did attend to affective indications of change, data in this area were not reported; instead, only various forms of the &quot;Inter-America Test of General Ability&quot; were used.

        "description":"This manual is a companion to an earlier one, \"Reinforcing Productive Classroom Behavior,\" that dealt with the use of reinforcement procedures by school personnel as a means for shaping constructive behavior in children. The present pamphlet continues to focus on the behavior influence process, but its topic is modeling and role-playing as applied to classroom settings. Their educational implications have stimulated both general excitement and the development of specific techniques that are relevant to pressing problems in the classroom. Modeling is a process by which responses are acquired through observing the behavior of someone else (the model). When people role-play they enact social roles other than their own. This manual was written to help school personnel use modeling  and role-playing in productive ways. Its intended readers include teachers, teachers in training, counselors, and administrators. Its development was guided by both educators and research workers. Although more basic research in modeling is needed, it is clear that it can have powerful impacts and that these can be either for good or ill. This pamphlet describes how modeling can be used to achieve desirable goals. It summarizes the literature on modeling and discusses how teachers and other personnel in the school can use modeling for the benefit of students. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"New Jersey's current performance and the likely effects of various reform proposals were evaluated according to the degree that the following goal was attained: that no group of children, distintuishable by race, sex, locality, ethnic background, religion or economic status, shall consistently perform below the State average on measurements of specific skills. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that when we define equality of opportunity in this way equal expenditures do not necessarily insure equality of opportunity across school districts, and that even after fiscal capacity for schools is equalized, those districts which have the greatest needs for above average expenditures, are least able to raise additional revenues through local taxation. New Jersey's Educational  Assessment Program of 1972-73 revealed that urban districts were performing significantly worse than the State average in all academic fields tested. This deficiency is not the result of lower expenditures in the cities. The problem is that there are much higher concentrations of children who are harder to educate in urban areas than in the State as a whole. Such children cannot achieve at the State average unless greater-than-average revenues are available for special educational programs. (Author/JM)",

Black Studies are intended to effectively link the campus and the community, Africa and the Americas, so that each helps the other to survive and free itself. It is because some whites recognize this potential that they have moved to co-opt the field of Black Studies or destroy the programs altogether. These guidelines can help us develop and maintain Black Studies programs. Black Studies programs should have clearly defined purposes. All things being equal, the teachers in Black Studies programs should be  black. Black Studies materials need to be integrated into all of the disciplines taught and taught as separate programs; Black Studies need to be taught in school and nonschool settings. A Black Studies program should be based on key concepts and generalizations that are crucial to black survival and freedom. One must carefully evaluate the materials intended for use in such programs. Black Studies program administrators and teachers should establish and maintain strong supporters outside the school to serve as resource personnel, political and economic supporters, and as continuous renewal agents.

Ethnic, really multiethnic, ferment is now accepted as part of the 1970's social climate. But now the difficult task is just beginning, especially in the schools. There are many ways school administrations, teachers, and curriculum developers interpret &quot;ethnic studies.&quot; Most of the materials reviewed in this publication were extensions of traditional education methods. Yet, as the examples suggest, the area of ethnic studies  offers many possibilities for innovation that go beyond adding textual content or new individual learning packets. There are many needs for sensitivity, self-understanding, and a better grasp of the complexities of American reality among all children. Similar needs exist among teachers. Publishers are beginning to shape materials more along truly multiethnic, pluralistic lines. One purpose of this paper is to point to useful examples so that each school or system does not feel compelled to &quot;reinvent the wheel.&quot; In short, new curricula in ethnic studies, or adding an ethnic dimension to existing curricula, need not be difficult.

The new report studies academic trends, in terms of credits earned, grade point average, and the ratio of credits attempted. Data on which the study is based were collected for freshmen who entered in 1970 and 1971. For the 1970 freshmen, academic outcomes were described over the course of the first four semesters. For the 1971 freshmen, academic outcomes were described for the first two semesters. Data on the first year performance of the two classes were compared. Data were reported in aggregate  form for senior and community colleges: comparisons between individual CUNY colleges were also present. Four major topics were considered: (1) academic performance of students (grade point average and credit operation); (2) retention as related to academic performance; (3) the impact of compensatory programs on retention and academic performance; and (4) comparison of academic outcomes for SEEK and non-SEEK students. Based on high school grades, analyses were conducted within certain high school average categories. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Ogbu, John U."],
        "description":"This paper deals with the issue of black-white differences in cognitive skills. Some authorities attribute these differences to differences in the environments of black and white homes. Others state that the differences are due to differences in genes, i.e., heredity. Scholars holding these two opposing views have become more or less entangled in an endless debate since Jensen published his article in 1969. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative, structural explanation. The hypothesis proposed here is that black-white differences are due to adaptation to different cognitive requirements of their respective positions in the American caste system. In particular, it argues that the ascribed status of blacks which restricts them from participating in higher levels of  American techno-economic organization has resulted in blacks evolving patterns of cognitive skills which are different from those developed by white Americans. This hypothesis has the advantage in that it can be applied to explain the observed differences between black males and black females as well as to minority-majority differences in other societies where similar pariah groups exist. Its significance for social policy lies in the fact that it identifies the cause rather than the symptoms of black educational problems. (Author/JM)",

The basic data consist of IQ scores for fourth, sixth, and eighth grades and associated environmental data obtained from their school records. A statistical model is developed to analyze longitudinal data when both process error and measurement error must be accounted for. IQ tests are used in this paper as convenient measures of a certain kind of performance thought to be important for success in schools and certain kinds of jobs. Most of the environmental variables included in the model can be construed to measure the nature or degree of contact with mainstream culture. The data were collected in the summer of 1971 from the cumulative school records of all  students who had just finished the ninth grade in the Pittsburgh public school system. The time period examined is nine years between 1962 and 1970, during which time a proportion of the group passed from kindergarten to eighth grade in the Pittsburgh system. IQ tests were administered during this period to children in kindergarten, fourth, sixth, and eighth grades. The tests administered were the Detroit (kindergarten), Kuhlmann-Anderson (fourth grade), Otis Beta FM (sixth grade), and Otis Lennon (eighth grade). (Author/JM)",

Second, it estimates the achievement equations of a simultaneous equations model of the educational process. The report, &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity,&quot; (EEOR) acted as a watershed for research into educational production functions. Virtually all of the voluminous research in this area chooses verbal achievement as the sole achievement measure. With a single exception, moreover, no model of the educational process allows for feedback effects from one variable to another. A model of the educational process should postulate pupil achievement and control of the environment as endogenous variables. Both the home and the school are shown by the  results of this study to be important for all achievements, especially verbal and general informational. More variables seem important for nonverbal achievement than for any other type of achievement. The absolute value of the coefficients in the mathematical achievement equations are generally smaller than in the other equations. This finding indicated that the explanatory variables may be less important for mathematics than for other achievements. Contrary to the probable expectations of the EEOR's authors, the general information equation fits the data best, not the verbal equation. (Author/JM)",

The program consisted of instruction in reading, mathematics, physical education, art, speech therapy, and counseling and psychological testing. The target population was children who had completed grades 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Children were selected for the program on the basis of educational need in reading or mathematics. The children were selected by means of achievement testing and teacher referral. Each child participated in reading or mathematics instruction or both, depending on need. All children participated in art and physical education activities. The evaluator visited the three schools  in which the program was conducted, observing instruction and activities and interviewing the staff. Test results and other information were submitted to him for analysis. Progress in reading comprehension occurred at each grade level. Phonics knowledge was initially good or showed significant improvement. Third, fourth, and fifth graders made significant gains in mathematics. No gains were made on the motor screening test. Speech and counseling work evidently serves as a helpful bridge between the preceding and following school years. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Although a lot of data on the psychological characteristics of children having learning disabilities have been gathered, not very much has been done to discover the underlying mechanisms, processes, or phenomenon of learning disability. Without more investigations which attempt to get at these, we will continue to be at a loss to prescribe effective methods for improving the health, education, employment opportunity, and social health of these children. A homomorphic psychometric model has been proposed to show the integrative functions and relationships between and among psychometric measures of learning ability, aptitude, and/or achievement. If the proposed homomorphic psychometric model can be used to demonstrate interrelationships among psychometric measurements as do the  cognitive structures of learning theorists and as do neuron during interfacilitation, then a systematic study of the distribution and interrelationships of such measures among high- and low-achieving children might offer insights into means by which each group proceeds to solve educational tasks. In a recent study an attempt was made to discover the differences between the cognitive functions of 109 high-and low-achieving eighth grade students. Six tests of cognitive ability and eight subtests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were used in the analyses. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The study reported here was an attempt to systematically manipulate certain factors which might be responsible for the poor communicational performance of lower socioeconomic status children. The major questions raised were: Can differences in task difficulty, perceptual characteristics of the task, and task instructions attenuate or eliminate observed SES differences? These three task variables are concerned with the information processing demand characteristics of the communication task. This study attempted to determine whether the problems encountered by the lower SES child in a referential communication task were communication problems or whether these problems could be attributed to information processing difficulties. This study utilized a simple referential description  task in order to explore the possible effects of information processing factors on the speaker's communicational performance. If interactions were to be observed between the three above mentioned classes of task variables and the SES of the speaker, this might indicate that the problems encountered by the lower SES speaker were caused by information processing difficulties. Seventy-two fourth grade male and female white students (half lower SES and half middle SES), who had achieved normal age-grade placement, served as subjects in the study. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 called for a comprehensive attack on social, economic, and physical problems of blighted urban areas through the concentration and coordination of resources. It also required the involvement of neighborhood citizens in all aspects of planning: from setting goals, choosing objectives, and identifying problems, to preparing programs and determining priorities. It was anticipated that three major outcomes would result. Disadvantaged people would experience a substantial improvement in their lives and opportunities. City governments would have a greater ability to deal with both physical and social problems at the local level. Imaginative approaches to alleviating age-old dilemmas would emerge from the synergistic  efforts of professional helpers and the people needing the help. This report deals only with the Educational Component of Model Cities--those projects in each of the 16 participating Region VI cities which dealt with academic, vocational, and self-perception needs of the residents. Section 2 offers an inventory of each city's Model Cities educational programs, followed by closer examination of one or two projects considered by local leaders to have made a significant impact on their community. Notice is made of those programs which have been brought into the state and/or local structure. (Author/JM)",

In this paper we develop several alternative models for the purpose of estimating the effects of per pupil school expenditures on future earnings, and on the basis of these estimates we calculate a range of rates of return to expenditures. After a brief review of the literature, we describe our data, develop the models, and the present and discuss the empirical results. Most of the data comes from the University of Michigan Survey Research Center's Income Dynamics Panel. This survey contains information for the five years from 1968 through  1972. The study uses only male respondents who are between the ages of 30 and 55 in 1972. The Michigan Survey has such data as annual and hourly earnings for five years, years of schooling, age, race, and father's years of schooling. Researcher also obtained data from the 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960 U.S. Censuses of Population on per pupil expenditures and per capita income by state. From 1930, 1940, and 1960 Biennial Surveys of Education, researchers obtained per pupil school expenditures by race for the 17 Southern states with separate school systems prior to 1954.

The first phase of the study was the conducting of a workshop for administrators to assess personnel needs and provide programing experience. A needs assessment questionnaire was developed and mailed to workshop participants; the next phases consisted of surveying teachers and coordinators through the questionnaire. Phase four involved contacting a sample of students who had taken career adult education courses in Iowa during 1972 and having them complete a special students' questionnaire. Administrators expressed a need for training in techniques of management,  techniques of identifying and assessing community educational needs, and developing systems of evaluating teacher effectiveness. Teachers indicated a strong desire for an area media/curriculum center and familiarity with techniques of teaching adults. Inservice training was viewed as essential, with local mini-sessions a desirable format. The students' survey revealed a very favorable response to the career supplementary program.

Expressed willingness to commute and socio-economic characteristics data were accumulated from a regional survey of 643 households. The estimates are of value to regional planners and potential investors in north-central New Mexico, as they reflect the potential flow of labor resources within the region in response to new or expanded economic opportunity. Estimates of labor availability at various wage rates have been provided for the six primary population areas of this region. Tables specify wage rates from $1.60 an hour to $4.00 an hour and commuting time in intervals  from under 15 minutes to over 90 minutes. Occupations include: professional and technical, managers and administrators, sales workers, transport operatives, laborers, farmers, service workers, clerical, and craftsmen. The availability of labor through commuting does not preclude individual needs for training or retraining to suit job needs. A computer program also is described which can be utilized to assess response to alternative wage rates. (Author/EA)",

Two assumptions made in the study were that inadequate counseling, due to insufficient knowledge about technical education, and an unrealistic emphasis on four years of college and too little prestige attached to technical programs were deterrents to the technical education program. A major hypothesis of the study was that technicians have greater occupational stability than engineers--no salary loss for new jobs; fewer days of unemployment, and lesser distance for job relocation. In reports reviewed for the study, salary change, length of unemployment, and relocation were given as  primary concerns of technical personnel seeking new jobs. Conclusions indicated no significant salary difference for technical personnel or engineers in new jobs after lay-off. Technicians experience a longer period of unemployment than engineers after lay-off, while engineers are more likely to relocate than technicians in accepting new positions after lay-off. (EA)",

The established attachments were then used as a basis in building a model illustrating the relationship between the individual attachments to work and the collective action of workers in union-management relations. From analysis of the model, it was concluded that: (1) the development of modern managerial paternalism may be a significant means by which to minimize union militancy; (2) most managerial practice, as it relates to workers, is designed to broaden the number of sources of attachment to work; (3) the degree of union militancy in unions with collective bargaining functions is dependent upon their limited concentration on features of the collective  agreement; (4) only a limited number of issues can effectively be the object of militant action, and (5) union militancy declines when collective bargaining is institutionalized. This approach, whereby the nature and sources of participant attachment to organizations is examined as a feature of organizational theory relevant to the bargaining process, supplements other kinds of analysis of collective bargaining and union militancy.

The case studies include a range of discipline, ethical, and interpersonal problems in classroom and work settings, and involve students, teachers, DE coordinators, and employers of students.

In the first development decade (the 1960's), industrialization did not fulfill expectations, and gaps in economic status widened. The modernization trend increasingly incorporated orientation to the future, but emphasis on growth lessened while emphasis on environmental consequences intensified, and the post-industrial service sector assumed major importance. Regional and global theaters of development gained in importance; and economic, social, and biological philosophies were blended in the revival of ecological values. \"Part II--Industrialization:  Implications for Other Sectors\"--surveys the classical model of impact, growth of population, distribution of population, poverty and the maldistribution of income, occupations and employment, and infrastructure. \"Part III--Concluding Note\" discusses some major implications, such as industrialization is a necessary but insufficient contribution in the development of developing countries.

A two-round, 35-statement survey of attitudes, concerns, and needs polling professional staff, students, parents, and business representatives revealed consensus on 32 of the statements. A strong need was indicated for career education for all students and grades, career education concepts and activities infused into the total curriculum, active teacher/administrator implementation, and community participation in program development. The model is based on  continuous individual development in phases of awareness, development (personal and career) and competency (personal, social, economic and occupational). Piloting efforts have commenced in the four elementary schools used in the survey, inservice programs have been developed, and community-career education dialogue has been established for feedback.

Fourteen career education units in nine projects were field tested. Data were gathered through UNIVAL, a panel review, and a community review, with approximately 5,000 students and 174 teachers included in the study. Of the students, 51 percent were female and 49 percent male; 61 percent were Anglo and 39 percent from minority groups. Of the teachers, 54 were male and 120 were female. Teacher attitude toward career education was fairly high and moderately positive  toward the particular units. Student response to the units was positive, and learner performance was a high 80 percent. Measurements for each unit were calculated, based on teacher attitude, learner attitude, and learner performance. Student demographic data were subjected to an ethnic profile, and 14 cost factors analyzed for each unit. It was concluded that all 14 units in the field set were sufficiently satisfactory to be included in the 1974-75 statewide implementation program. (AG)",

Objectives included providing an interdisciplinary approach to curriculum and teaching, opportunities for related classroom and work experience through on-the-job training, and providing the project with a coordinator having hospitality industry and Indian cultural background. Further objectives were to create incentive for potential dropouts and to increase student awarenesss of various occupations in the industry as well as awareness of individual interests, aptitudes,  and aspirations. A custom-designed curriculum, which was developed through teacher workshops, was one of the major outcomes of the project. Some problems encountered were lack of certified vocational teachers, getting parent and community involvement, cultural attitudes, counseling for participants, and lack of direct funds to the schools.

Among the major findings from the cases studied: (1) projections of job openings were possible in all contracts considered, by the use of estimating techniques which are described in the appendix; (2) the number of job openings generated by the awards were sufficient to be given serious weight in local manpower planning; (3) local manpower agencies, generally aware of the likely employment increase, lacked the detailed occupational information and timing of the employment increase to translate this awareness into program planning; (4) such projections can precipitate a common effort by local manpower  officials, company personnel, union officials, and others; (5) job openings estimates, while important, are only one ingredient in local planning, which must also include local labor supply indicators. The first appendix, which takes up about half the document, maps in detail the precise data, methodology, and projection techniques used. The second appendix explains the criteria used in the selection of contract awards to be studied, and the third lists data and data sources used. (NH)",

A study of typical dissemination methods, including project publications, conversation presentations, workshops, commercial publications, and inservice teacher training, has shown they have merits as well as limitations. Educational products, like seeds planted to take root, grow, and bear fruit, should be disseminated so they might be adopted by practitioners and, through their use, bring about change in the learners. Better interagency linkages, one-stop information centers, and using educational extension agents are ideas to consider in approaching new ways to the dissemination/adoption of  innovations in adult education.

In 1961, Technical Education Committee (TEC) Centers were created and since that time, with the help of Federal funds, the program has trained approximately 500,000 South Carolinians. Sixteen TEC Centers and special schools provide training leading to a diploma, certificate, or associate degree, offering occupationally-oriented programs that match individual and community needs. The paper traces the procedures and ramifications involved in attracting and developing new industry in the State, determining the  type of training needed, developing and equipping training facilities, and planning a curriculum. Recruiting trainees for the program, screening applicants, teacher training, and the maintenance of a manpower supply for industry are problems dealt with in discussing this State-wide approach to manpower development.

First to be examined are basic questions in training evaluation strategy: the barriers to conducting evaluation of training efforts, the reasons for conducting such evaluation, where and when such evaluation should enter the training process, and who should conduct such evaluation. Following this is a consideration of six approaches whereby evaluative questions may be posed, including an outline of the assumptions of each along with their advantages and disadvantages. The tactics of evaluation of training efforts and the bases for choosing different tactical approaches are two major concerns dealt with.  Concluding the document are a discussion of recent trends in training evaluation and a seven-page bibliography. (Author/MW)",

        "description":"The study, fourth in a series of reports on the attitudes of youth, analyzed the 1972 results of a continuing Department of Defense national survey aimed at studying the enlistment motivation and attitudes toward military service of American youth. A total of 1,924 male youths, aged 16 to 21 years, were interviewed during a period of low draft calls, reduced troop levels in Vietnam, and increased service pay allowances. Topics covered included their willingness to enlist in the active service under a zero-draft condition, to volunteer for active service as officers, and their views on enlistment incentives, service preference, and career objectives. Results varied according to age and educational status, with high school students showing a higher enlistment potential than college  students and males not in school. Fully paid college educations provided the greatest enlistment incentive, especially to the 16- and 17-year olds. Bonus options appealed especially to nonwhites. Pay and secure employment were endorsed as the two most important life goals. The present research has not investigated enlistment potential among women; the concept of increased female utilization in the military service deserves additional study. (Author/EA)",

The third in a series, the report presents the results of a comprehensive 1973 Department of Defense survey of enrollment (applicant) potential for college-based military officer training programs. Analysis of the data indicated that most enrollees intended to stay in their programs, and that 30 to 40 percent intended to pursue a military career, while about 50 percent were undecided. Knowledge of financial benefits did not influence career  intentions.

Program assessment, curriculum development, and program implementation are also reviewed in the \"guidelines,\" which should be helpful in improving industrial arts programs. Many  program changes are implied, and no doubt some will not materialize. However, the role of industrial arts is vital in the career education thrust.

Constructed at a cost of five and one half million dollars, the correctional institution offers many innovative programs. As part of the Federal Bureau of Prisons building program, three objectives are to be kept in mind: (1) to reduce critical overcrowding resulting from the substantial increase in commitments from Federal courts, (2) to provide smaller institutions with environments designed to facilitate correctional programs and meet the human need for privacy and dignity, and (3) to eventually replace our large antiquated penitentiaries. Past changes with positive effects will be retained. These programs include vocational and academic training,  industrial training, work and study release, college-level courses, and a wide range of intensive counseling. One innovative program at Pleasanton will be its cocorrections program, an opportunity for male and female offenders to work together--a major step toward normalization. The Functional Unit Concept will utilize small housing areas handling 600 or fewer inmates. Each of these functional units has its own resident staff. These programs attempt to resolve the problems inherent in larger facilities and more successfully deal with rehabilitative needs of the young offender. (MW)",

The agents completed an Agency Climate Questionnaire (ACQ) on managerial support, managerial structure, new employee concern, intra-agency conflict, agent independence, and general satisfaction. The fit between the expectations and preferences and the realities of the climate of the agencies was correlated with new agent success (tenure and sales) one year after hire. The correlations were essentially zero. It was concluded that the degree of fit of a new agent to his agency did not predict success. The practice of informing a person what to expect on a job or in a job  situation appears to enhance the person's probability of success only when the organization is a basically positive one to begin with.

Implications the climates an organization creates for its employees were examined with respect to the attraction and retention of employees. Finally, the kinds of organizational climates created for the reward and support of individual differences in ability and personality were discussed with reference to the predictability of employee performance. It was concluded that organizations must take a broad  systems approach to thinking about the intended and unintended effects of chosen goals and the implementation of practices and procedures since the climates created by them will be demonstrated in many ways: attracting employees, employee behavior, dictating orientation, and determining success or failure.

        "description":"Part 1 of this paper presents some logical and conceptual distinctions between job satisfaction and organizational climate, the former being viewed as micro, evaluative, individual perceptions of personal events and experiences the latter as macro, relatively descriptive, organizational level perceptions that are abstractions of organizational practices and procedures. Part 2 proposes a formal definition of climate as meaningful perceptions (concepts) people share and which function to help adapt people to their organization. The Structuralism, Functionalism, and Gestalt schools of psychology were each reviewed, and the implications of each school were indicated for the definition of climate and climate research methods and theory. Perhaps the most interesting &quot;finding&quot; was a  hypothesis derived from Functionalism on the impact of an organization's &quot;climate for individual differences&quot; on individual attribute--individual performance relationships. Some conditions leading to a &quot;climate for individual differences&quot; in which individual differences in performance should be predictable were identified.

Clusters of life insurance agencies were identified on the basis of manager, assistant manager, and already-employed (\"old\") agents' climate perceptions. Agency success, including production of old agents, production ranking of agencies, and success probability (turnover and production) of newly contracted agents were examined in the different clusters. The effects of climate as a moderator of new agent aptitude--new agent performance relationships were also explored. For each agency success variable and in the moderator variable analyses, some differences between agency clusters were found. Implications of these results for a  taxonomic approach to defining organizations, for research on organizational climate and for personnel selection practices were discussed.

It was shown that: (1) climate and satisfaction measures are correlated for some people but not for others; (2) people agree more on the climate of their agency than they do on their satisfaction; (3) production and retention are uncorrelated but size is positively related to the former and negatively related to the latter; (4) ratings of agency effectiveness are highly related to gross agency size; and (5) satisfaction, but not climate, is correlated with retention.

        "description":"Although the hypothesis that behavior is a function of the person in interaction with his environment is a very old one, an overview of current theory and research on work motivation and job satisfaction reveals an emphasis on either one or the other sets of variables, at the expense of investigating systematically the interaction between personal and environmental variables. The literature on the concept of organizational climate and its relationship to organizational behavior is briefly reviewed in an attempt to find a framework within which the interaction hypothesis can be systematically investigated. The lack of specific conceptualization concerning organization climate and the multitude of noncomparable operational definitions of organizational climate is noted. The paper  argues that this state of affairs makes the climate concept untractable and greatly distracts from the potential that this concept has for clarifying the study of the interaction hypothesis. It is suggested that the relatively explicitly stated expectancy models of motivation might not only help to provide conceptual clarity to the concept of organizational climate, but might also provide a framework within which the person-environment interaction hypothesis can be investigated. Such an approach should also increase our understanding of the work motivation process. (Author)",

Three experimental and three control classes were identified in each of two elementary schools. The testing instrument for grades 1-3 was the &quot;Pictorial Self-Concept Scale for Children in K-4,&quot; while the Self-Esteem Inventory was selected as the instrument for grades 4-6. The elementary project was developed on the concept that career awareness is related to the total development of the individual. Teachers of both experimental and control groups were all highly oriented toward helping students develop a positive  self-concept; however, teachers of control classes were not provided with planned project activities. Results of pre- and posttesting indicate greater positive change in feelings about self for the experimental groups. Future recommendations were to: continue the self-awareness program for elementary students, provide adequate materials for teachers, provide the services of an elementary counselor, and arrange for inservice programs for teachers.

Varying patterns of two general types of workweeks are presented: (1) the compact workweek which may be compressed, for example, into four 10-hour days; and (2) the flexible workweek in which the employee has latitude in scheduling work time to meet the standard weekly requirement. Information is given about various administrative experiments in work scheduling. Given primary attention are the various kinds and degrees of impact that alternative schedules of work can have on human performance, social processes and organization, and the  quality of life. Such alternatives may require that social-political systems develop means for greater control of free-time activities to ensure equity. Particular attention is given to the social and psychological adjustments required as a result of the trend discerned by the researchers, who offer guidance to those involved in anticipating and preparing for the foreseen changes.

Statistical data is offered in three tables, comparing occupational mobility between January 1972 and January 1973 of employed persons over 18: (1) by age and sex; (2) by age, sex, and race; and (3) by occupation and sex. About six million persons employed in January 1973 were in different occupations from those in which they were working in January 1972. Nine percent of the men and about eight percent of the women employed at both dates changed occupations over this period. The demographic characteristic most closely associated with mobility was age of worker, though occupation and other  characteristics also were important. (Author/AJ)",

The study also examined some technical, vocational, or career programs offered in noncollegiate institutions to determine whether proprietary or vocational institutions have developed new insights which could be adapted to the collegiate situation. The study had disappointing results, in that vocational or occupational curricula were found to be not particularly innovative; education for career and occupations was found to be a display of traditional practice accompanied by theorizing. These findings are discussed in the monograph's first three chapters. The authors were successful in  identifying curricular issues of occupational education. These are specified in the monograph's last two chapters, and a rationale is presented which may assist faculties and administrations in resolving some curricular perplexities. The intent of the authors in preparing the monograph was to bridge the gap between theorizing and the actual conduct of vocational programs. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The objective of the project was to pilot test the Model to Evaluate Inservice Personnel Development. The pilot test was designed to determine: (1) whether the model could evaluate the personnel development programs in the two States where the model was pilot tested, (2) applicability of the model in other States, and (3) the potential of the model, with modification, to evaluate projects other than the kind funded under Section 553 of Part F of the 1968 vocational amendments. The pilot test was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a test of the components and procedures of the model in Tennessee with a list of the changes resulting from that phase included in the report. Phase 2 was conducted in California, and additional changes resulted from the pilot test there. It  was concluded that more time was needed to conduct the pilot test, but using two different States and numerous reviewers was beneficial. The final part of the report states four recommendations for the dissemination of the evaluation model. The remaining one-half of the document consists of an appendix of observation and interview schedules. (BP)",

Support for career education at the State and local level and from non-governmental groups is also encouraging. A significant step has been taken with the publication of the Office of Education position paper on career education containing a generic definition of career  education. It is hoped that career education will be primarily a State and local matter, and that creativity in that area will be encouraged. Its quality must be improved, and its effectiveness evaluated. Work remains to be done in implementing programs, particularly at the high school level and among special groups. The State coordinators are commended for ably filling their leadership role in making career education operational. (AG)",

The response can be made through the use of the concept of work. \"Work\" is defined as conscious effort, other than that involved in activities whose primary purpose is either coping or relaxation, aimed at producing benefits for oneself and/or for oneself and others. Career education is defined as the totality of experiences through which one learns about and prepares to engage in work as part of her or his way of living. Based on the latter definition, 10 basic concept assumptions were formulated which represent a philosophical base for current career education efforts. Certain programmatic assumptions were arrived at, and  suggestions for implementation of career education programs involved members of the educational and civic communities. Nine specific learner outcomes were determined which will involve basic educational policy changes. A 28-page appendix presents the results from a tabulation and analysis of responses to a study guide (especially prepared for eliciting responses from local, State, and national educators to specific statements in a draft document) to assess the degree of consensus on the concept of career education.

SIGI is viewed not merely as a demonstration of computer-aided education, but more as a demonstration of how technology can be used to give students more control over their lives.

Records were available for 40 students with varying types of criminal backgrounds who had been admitted to the university during the period 1965-73. Only one of these students had graduated from the institution, and the data suggested that most inmate-students had difficulty completing the academic requirements. Because of these problems, the author suggests several remedies. Inmate-students might profit from special assistance and concerted efforts toward the successful attainment of collegiate goals (as has been successfully demonstrated with Opportunity Scholars, Upward Bound Students, etc.). Counseling and motivational techniques may be fruitful in  increasing the opportunities for success. The author further recommends that the progress of inmate-students be monitored more closely at the university, and that there be continued research and evaluation to help future planning and rehabilitation efforts for these individuals.

Theoretical models explicating the role of individual differences constructs are examined in a developmental context and compared with empirical efforts to cross-link components of intelligence and learning. In contrast to earlier evaluations, this review suggests that cross-linkages are often meaningful, systematic, and interpretable and that they may form the building blocks for inclusive conceptualizations of intellectual development which pay attention to both  treatment and individual differences variance.

AGG is a process in which group participants experience and discuss one or more guidance principles through the planning and completing of some task or project. One group purpose calls for the leader and group members to work together to complete the task. A second purpose is to use the group process and experiences involved in completing the project to learn a guidance principle. The content of AGG includes a planned cognitive and/or psychomotor activity with an affective focus. The three stages usually involved in the process of implementing a group session are: (1) warmup discussion, (2) activity  implementation, and (3) followup discussion.

The author attempts to differentiate power situations in which the flow of influence is primarily unilateral from an identifiable source to a target, from those in which there is a more dynamic give-and-take between the interacting entities. He argues that while we know a great deal about the former (unilateral) types of interactions, we know very little of the latter. This is unfortunate, for it is the latter (bilateral) type of power relationship which characterizes much of social life. The author attempts to delve into some of the differences inherent in these various kinds of power relations regarding the decision to trust or not to trust another  person, organization, or nation. He focuses on the variable of trust rather than on that of social cooperation, since the latter variable can be elicited in numerous ways that do not imply genuine \"cooperativeness\" as existing between parties to conflict.

He focuses on several component parts of this difficult task, including developing a theory of curriculum, defining counseling--its goals and outcomes, and explaining counselor characteristics. Only when these more general questions have been answered in a manner which reflects the commitment of an institution and a staff can the more typical steps of curriculum planning be undertaken. The specifications of courses, the allotting of credit hours, and the formulation of degree plans are mechanical and relatively unimportant aspects when compared to the fundamental concepts which undergird a program's reason for being. If a curriculum becomes a superficial arrangement of academic experiences  providing little substance and preparing the individual to do little more than he would have been able to do without the program, then the problem most likely lies in failure to decide what kind of program to propose, and to develop outcomes with which all can be satisfied.

In broad terms, the program is viewed as a human development program and not simply as a technical training program. The adult population it serves is defined as rural disadvantaged, and the primary selection criterion is un/underemployment. Intensive developmental career guidance including awareness, exploration, and choice is the critical area of the core curriculum, although other important general need areas (health education, consumer education, parent effectiveness training, and home management training) are also addressed. After a career choice is made, students enter specific career preparation programs which include work experience and permanent job placement.  The unique aspect of the program design is that entire families participate in the program. Based on research and experience, the program developers found that putting an individual into an artificial program environment, working with him, and then returning him to his unaltered family environment pre-assure a high failure rate. The author attempts to inform others about the program and to stimulate a new interest in the &quot;unvisible&quot; foundations of educational approaches, particularly those for disadvantaged adults.

There were two observations on each child. Results included the identifying of configurations of preschool personal-social behaviors which turned out to be familiar in their dimensionality and very similar at both measurement periods. These static structures were then considered more dynamically in terms of multiple gradients  for behavior change. Certain determinants of personal-social behavior and change were then investigated, and findings were viewed as interpretable in relation to alternative theories of personal-social development.

The phenomenological method called \"epokhe\" is defined as the \"suspension of preconceptions\" or \"judgments\" concerning a series of events, and, as a result, the achievement of greater clarity in experiencing those events. Changing or suspending feeling reactions is viewed as central to therapeutic effectiveness. This is the purpose of epokhe--to eliminate blinders in order see phenomena freshly. Discussion centers on specific therapeutic and practicum experiences where epokhe can be exercised. The author also relates how a person learns to suspend judgments by first intending or wanting to experience differently. From a phenomenological  perspective, meaning emerges as one focuses on experience. As the experience is described and entered, the confusion and meaninglessness drops away, and structures beneath it or within it become apparent. (Author/PC)",

The inventory related well to other scales which measure related characteristics. Furthermore, through use of the inventory it was discovered that adolescent drug users, instead of being withdrawn and marginal, were interpersonally active and outgoing and, instead of being hostile and cynical, tended to be cognitively passive and accepting of others' ideas and pronouncements. It was also discovered, in passing, that high school boys become more generally active during high school, and high school  girls become more passive as they move from the sophomore to senior year.

Shame inducement occurs when one significant person breaks the interpersonal bridge with another. Following internalization of shame within the personality, shame activation becomes an autonomous function of the self and the sense of shame lies at the core of one's identity as a person. Therapy needs to aim at dis-internalizing shame, enabling the client to effectively cope with the sources of shame without internalizing that effect, and enabling the client to affirm himself from within. Most importantly, within the therapeutic relationship, the therapist needs to return internalized, autonomous shame to its interpersonal origins, thereby reversing the  developmental sequence.

        "author":["Alperson, Erma Dosamantes"],
        "description":"To fully explore the range of our human consciousness, we must have access to all available modes of experiencing: the bodily-implicit and the rational-explicit. To the extent that we become alienated from our bodily-felt side, we respond solely in terms of what the external situation demands. We lose sight of our own feelings and needs and function only in accordance with the expectations of others. To the degree that we fail to make explicit our internally felt experience, we limit the impact and exchange that we may have with others. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a movement therapy process that includes movement, imagery, and verbalization as one unified experience can be facilitative to psychotherapy-trainees. As a consequence of their exposure to such a  movement therapy process, five psychotherapy-trainees became more effective facilitators in verbal therapy. The author claims that a process, such as movement therapy, that begins with the bodily-felt level and helps to extend this experiencing outward through verbalization, places an individual directly in touch with his own experiential process. A psychotherapist who contacts his experiential impasses in an implicit-bodily way, is then better able to adopt an intuitive, empathic attitude toward the concerns of his own clients. (Author)",

The catharsis argument posits that watching programs high in aggressive content provides a socially adaptive outlet for involvement with aggression. Groups of college and noncollege educated psychiatric patients and college educated normals were compared according to their television habits and their response to the dependent measure. The dependent measure used a modified Prisoner's Dilemma Game in which S was given 10 \"zap\" options which, if exercised, enabled S to (maladaptively) aggress against another at a cost to himself. Results lent only mixed support to the catharsis argument. Findings suggested that  as a predictor and determinant of subsequent behavior, television preferences must be considered along with situational and personality variables. (Author)",

The I-E dimension refers to the degree to which people view themselves as responsible for the occurrence or lack of occurrence of reinforcement (internals), as opposed to viewing luck, fate, chance, or powerful others as being responsible (externals). The present investigation was concerned primarily with how individual differences along the I-E dimension would relate to various reactions to others in need of assistance. Subjects were 146 male and female college students (66 externals and 69 internals). A number of situational manipulations were included in this investigation. Reaction was observed as the subjects were  confronted with: (1) a Korean war veteran, (2) an ex-convict, and (3) a welfare client. The data were analyzed through a 2x2x3x4 ANOVA design. Results indicate that internals and externals do indeed differentially attribute responsibility for others' behavioral outcomes. Also, reactions to others needing assistance are mediated to some extent by subjective attribution of responsibility. (Author/HMV)",

Results indicate that intrinsic job factors are more potent than extrinsic factors, both as satisfiers and as dissatisfiers. Satisfaction with present job was moderately related to the decision to reenlist, with two groups of factors dominant: intrinsic factors related to job content; and extrinsic factors related to supervision and fair treatment. Satisfaction with overall career bore a much stronger relationship to the reenlistment decision, than did satisfaction with present job. Results were discussed in terms of possible differences between Marines and civilian  personnel in their perception of their jobs. Development of a new job satisfaction instrument for use with future Marine Corps task analysis projects was outlined. (Author)",

While having an advocate on the mental health team is an attractive idea, these client advocates are quite susceptible to \"corruption.\" The author discusses two major causes of this \"corruption\": (1) role confusion--the tendency for workers to slide back into doing therapy while purporting to be doing advocacy, consequently corrupting both; and (2) role instability--the destroying of client advocacy by the depersonalizing, alienating mode of organizing community mental health centers. The author is convinced that client-advocates can be effective change agents when they are not confused by the conflicting roles of  advocate and therapist, and when their efforts are not being undermined by a paternalistic system. He offers several steps which can be taken to strengthen the position of the client-advocate. (Author/PC)",

Reading has been and must continue to be an essential element in an instructional program which produces critical thinkers who can communicate effectively and efficiently in the oral and written symbols  of their language. It is every teacher's business to meet that goal. (TO)",

The overall objective is to train the teacher to identify the child who needs help in developing the modalities necessary for all learning and for learning to read in particular. In the first year program, 88 teachers serving 2,328 kindergarten and first grade students participated with 632 children identified as deficient in one or more of the 10 skill areas considered basic to reading. Teachers focused preventive and/or constructive procedures in only the area(s) identified as being deficient. Both background information concerning reading skill development and learning modality development and techniques of detection, prevention, and/or correction  were provided the teachers in university classes, workshops, and through assistance from local educational consultants and university graduate assistants. End-of-the-year test results indicate that the goal of 60 percent growth was achieved in six of the basic prereading areas. A comparison of 1972 and 1973 kindergarten students showed an overall improvement in ability to cope with the formal reading skills introduced in the first grade. Overall teacher reaction to the program was favorable. (TO)",

Except for the crossover period, female and male subjects' responses to auditory and visual stimuli follow the same general pattern; younger subjects respond at a greater rate to visual stimuli. Additional research also shows that subjects' sex provides a significant interaction with age during the crossover period. Even though this study did not attempt to assign a cause to the crossover phenomena, there are several possibilities. The crossover ages are approximately those of puberty, so the possibility of maturational process exists. It is also possible that as reading level increases attention shifts to the visual mode, and  the sex difference could be related to the earlier reading behavior of females. There could also be some sociocultural factors. (SW)",

The experimental boys, reading at a second- or third-grade level at the beginning of the project, met four days a week with their individual tutors and once weekly for an hour of group instruction. Control group students were reading at levels ranging from the second grade to the sixth grade. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests (1965) were administered to both groups at the beginning and at the end of the project, with the experimental group receiving an additional testing in April 1971.  Results showed that the range of reading gain for the experimental group was from nine to sixteen months, that 100 percent of the experimental group showed a gain in the comprehensive or vocabulary test sections, and that the range for the control group was from a loss of four months to a gain of 27 months, with 89 percent showing some gain in comprehension or vocabulary.

Reading instruction consisted of a two hour reading period, one hour with a paid teacher aide and one with volunteer aides. Language experience was emphasized with dictated and creative story writing. Speech and phonic diagnosed students were provided experiences in small group or  individual sessions with both teacher and teacher aide directing their learning. Evaluation of the program indicated that K-3 screening and diagnostic sensory testing was completed successfully and individualization did occurr in 77 percent of the classrooms.

The model presents a classification scheme for the development of reading and auding skills which considers basic adaptive processes, languaging precursors, and languaging processes. Four hypotheses consistent with the model were derived: (1) the ability to comprehend language by auding will surpass ability to comprehend language by reading during early school years, until reading skill is acquired, after which the ability to comprehend by auding and reading will become equal; (2) performance on measures of ability to comprehend language by auding will be predictive of performance on measures of ability to comprehend language by reading, after reading skill  is acquired; (3) performance on measures of reading rate and auding rate will be comparable, after reading decoding skill has been developed; and (4) training in comprehending by auding will transfer to reading, after reading skill is acquired. Research findings reveal that reading is based on, and utilizes, the same conceptual base and languaging competencies as auding, and that reading skill can be improved through training in languaging using oracy skills (auding and speaking).

The period since 1953 is emphasized, although there is some consideration of earlier work. Primary emphasis within the review is based on readability measurement; however, a final section is included which reviews recent work bearing on the topic of increasing comprehensibility through multimodal presentation methods. Various formulas for calculating readability are presented and placed in historical perspective. The contents include: &quot;Introduction,&quot; which presents the scope and organization of the review; &quot;Methods for Measuring Reliability,&quot; which discusses rating methods, use tests, readability formulas, early formulas,  detailed formulas, recent formulas, cloze procedures, and multimodal presentations; and &quot;Discussion,&quot; which discusses the estimation of reading levels, formulas, and future research.

        "description":"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the learning and retention of concepts formed from novel visual stimulus materials (wave-form patterns). The purpose of the first experiment was to scale sets of wave forms as a function of difficulty, i.e., subjects were shown a prototype wave form and were asked to give same-different judgments for subsequent wave forms. On the basis of these results, sets of \"simple\" and \"difficult\" instances of concepts were chosen. In the second experiment, subjects learned four wave-form concepts with either simple or difficult instances over a four-day period and were tested for retention after periods of 1, 3, and 10 days. The data showed significantly better performance for simple concepts, but neither group showed any performance decrement  measured by the percentage of correct identifications over any of the three retention intervals. Both groups did, however, display longer decision reaction times during the retention testing. It was suggested that the results indicated a longer retrieval route for the correct responses after the passage of time. (Author/SW)",

The other group was designated as a control group. All three treatment groups were administered four pretest measures: Primary Mental Abilities Test; Metropolitan Achievement Test-Reading; Metropolitan Achievement Test, Word Discrimination; and Bender  Visual Motor Gestalt Test. Posttest measures consisted of the Metropolitan Achievement Test, Word Discrimination and Reading subtests; the Gray Oral Reading Test; The Wide Range Achievement Test, Spelling subtest; and Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test.

As one reads, one anticipates what is written and checks one's guesses through the application of phonological, syntactic, and semantic rules. English as a Second Language (ESL) students are hindered by a different conceptual framework. For them, the grapheme/phoneme correspondences lack any apparent system; the grammatical patterns are confusing and many signals which aid in comprehension are not recognized. Lack of knowledge of English hinders the ability to choose cues, while the wrong choice or uncertainty make it difficult to confirm or reject them, thus curbing the hypotheses-testing process of skilled reading. When trying to read English, ESL students are faced with difficulties due to  lack of language skills and possibly conceptual skills, upon which reading depends. (WR)",

        "description":"Reading to children provokes curiosity about books and arouses the desire to learn to read quickly and well. It helps them to learn what reading is all about, it enlarges their vocabulary, and it exposes them to new and exciting experiences. Reading to children also helps them to become familiar with books, their use and their handling. In addition, children learn that books are a rich source of information, enjoyment, and challenge. Positive associations with reading are established when families read together, with a bond formed between reader and listener. Thus, reading in the home should be a daily activity and should even become a group activity. To make reading appeal to children, allow them to help select the books, and to personalize the reading, have a special place to  keep each child's books. Books are gifts children never outgrow. Parents can serve as models for children because when they see their parents or other adults reading, children realize that reading must be something special. What one does about reading says a lot more to children than what one says about reading. Take the time to read with your children. Take them to the library to shop for books. And make your home a place where reading is a natural, useful, and enjoyable activity. (SW)",

In some instances there are significant losses in reading ability, while in other cases the losses fail to reach significance. However, in some cases, such as with basic visual discrimination tasks, gains may actually be made over the summer. The degree to which reading ability is retained may be directly related to the skill being assessed. General reading ability such as vocabulary and comprehension skills may be more apt to change over the summer than would be specific reading skills such as the ability to learn beginning consonants, short vowels, or compound words. Conflicting data make the role of intelligence in retention of  reading ability unclear. Tn some instances it seems to be a significant factor while in other cases it seems to have a non-significant relationship. The sex of the student appears to have no significant relationship to the retention of reading ability over the summer.

It was concluded that since a subject's focusing strategy score is lowered by increasing the  amount of information in a concept learning task, the learning of concepts in the classroom would be enhanced by presenting students with concepts which involve small amounts of information, making it possible for students to develop strategies appropriate for coping with such information. Also, since strategies appear to develop over time, students should be given an opportunity to solve several problems in order to perfect their strategy and performance at solving such problems.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between word recognition and comprehension achieved by second and fifth grade students when reading material at various levels of readability. A random sample of twenty-five second and twenty-five fifth graders, taken from three middle class schools, was administered a researcher-developed informal reading inventory (IRI). The IRI was composed of oral and silent reading passages for the readability levels of primer through ninth grade. Subjects, randomly assigned to one of two examiners, began reading at the primer level and continued reading until they had read two consecutive levels where either their word recognition was eighty-five percent or less, or their achieved comprehension was fifty percent or less. Pearson  product-moment coefficients of correlation were calculated between word recognition and comprehension, and tested for significance. Chance correlations suggested that no relationship existed between word recognition and comprehension for either group of subjects. (WR)",

Some 15-pair lists were constructed of category instances in such a way that the learning of three contingent associations based on category names would mediate correct performance for all 15 pairs. The first experiment gave no evidence that the three contingencies aided learning. The second experiment showed that subjects could be taught the three contingent associations in isolation and that they could then apply them successfully to the double-function list. To make the contingencies more apparent to the subjects, the category names were used during feedback in the third experiment. The learning was not facilitated by such feedback. It was concluded that the  learning observed for the usual double-function list does not involve contingent associations. (Author)",

Students' use of language should be encouraged in the classroom through expressive talk but with teacher guidance and example, through improvised drama, and through creative writing. Language should be studied consciously in forms other than literature, as in mass media and in everyday use--the language of gossip, interviews, children, politicians, different kinds of workers, and town signs. Teachers in the United Kingdom are finding several models of language useful, particularly those of modern linguists, the transactional model, and the restricted and  elaborated code theory. (JM)",

It was concluded that the employee's job type and his  feelings about the corporate newspaper covering corporate news will have an effect on several attitudinal variables. Several suggestions are made concerning the best method of improving relations with those employees with the least favorable attitude toward the corporate newspaper. (Author/RB)",

        "description":"Although empirical research on the agenda-setting function of mass communication dates only from the 1968 presidential election, historically there has been long-standing concern over the control of communication because of its assumed influence. Early communication research shared this concern and assumption, focusing on the ability of the media to change attitudes. While little attitude change was found, these studies did find substantial communication impact on cognitions. It is this cognitive impact of mass media--the ability of the mass media to shape our map of the world, to determine the priority of items on our personal agendas of issues--that agenda-setting research has been exploring in recent years. Agenda-setting research will explore the following areas in the  immediate future: the causal link between media coverage and individual cognitions; establishing the contingent conditions affecting learning from mass communication; measuring and conceptualizing the difference in interpersonal and intrapersonal agendas; exploring the behavioral implications of agenda-setting, and extending the concept of agenda-setting to domains other than political behavior.

A questionnaire was sent to all 23 reporters registered at the court during the 1973 October term. The group included \"regulars\" with fulltime assignments and \"occasionals,\" who cover the court rarely. The study provided a number of findings about reporters, evaluation of coverage, and court information policies. The news media reporter at the Supreme Court seems to be a relatively young, well-educated individual with several years of media experience before  coming to the court assignment. Tenure at the court, however, is rather short. Most of the reporters queried were pleased with their own performance and that of their colleagues. However, a number of specific innovations are still sought. The most commonly mentioned of these is a lockup system that would allow reporters to puruse opinions before they are actually announced in order to be better prepared for stories on significant decisions of the court.

        "description":"During the recent election campaigns in the United States, speculative arguments about the use or the abuse of televised political spot commercials to \"package\" and \"sell\" the candidates to the public were widespread. With this popularly held belief in mind, the present study concerned itself with the reactions to and utilization of televised political advertising by the electorate during the 1972 presidential campaign. Findings of this survey indicated that the campaign strategists in 1972 presidential elections had a relatively small margin of \"undecided\" voters to work with. However, to a certain degree the political advertising was functionally utilized by most to obtain information about the presidential candidates while not necessarily yielding to the persuasive intent of  the message.

Although Arab editors see these facts as negative, they feel that there are positive aspects which can be exploited. They believe that the major role of the press under occupation is to keep the conquered Arabs well informed and enlightened with their morale high. (Author/RB)",

First, the course may be introduced by stating objectives and procedures, and by asking students for ideas about the value of reading and studying poetry. The teacher should involve all students, especially the reluctant ones, by making a large number of poetry collections available to students and having them browse until they find poems that they like. Then each student may make a copy of his or her poem and prepare to read it aloud the next day in class. The teacher may read for the reluctant students, arrange chairs in a circle for intimacy, and encourage students to tell why they liked a poem. Some poems selected may be used to provoke excellent  discussion and writing assignments. This last procedure enables students to learn the usual things teachers teach about poetry, such as terminology, symbols, and types of poetry, while at the same time providing enjoyment for the student.

The sample was based on use of the years 1922 and each decennial census year since, allowing a comparison of media growth, ownership status, and population data. The findings of the study were that the number of media outlets in the top markets increased by 270 percent while the number of voices increased by 185 percent over the 1922-70 period; since 1950 there has not been an increase in overall media ownership concentration; several trends suggest that concentration of ownership may increase by the time the 1980 data is  examined; the proportion of independent or single station ownership remained constant in the last decade; newspaper control of broadcasting outlets and voices has declined to record low levels; and both media outlets and voices have increased in proportion faster than the population. The study concludes that various trends in the data suggest action may be called for in the future if the policy of diversified media control is to be maintained. (Author/RB)",

Sometimes the teacher has to provide happenings about which students may write, or a book may serve as a source for some of their writing.

They were asked such questions as, what would you say if your child (1) refused to go to school and you knew there was nothing wrong, (2) took something off the shelf of a supermarket without paying for it, (3) picked flowers from a neighbor's garden, or (4) refused to go to bed long after bed time in order to watch something on T.V. Results show that on each of  the communication measures, children of predominantly person-oriented parents were more effective communicators than children of predominantly position-oriented parents. The differences in communicative effectiveness, as measured, reflected differences in the children's ability to coordinate listener-speaker perspectives. (SW)",

        "description":"A problem currently facing many advertising agencies is the recruitment of top quality business school graduates as potential account managers. Viewing the problem from a marketing perspective, a career in advertising is seen as a product competing with other careers for the market of new graduates. Then it is possible to use one of the traditional methods of market analysis, attitude measurement, to compare the attitudes of students toward various careers. Recent research on brand attitudes has utilized an expectancy-value model, where attitude is conceptualized as a function of certain beliefs about the attitude object, weighted by some assessment of the value of the beliefs to the individual. In a study using the expectancy-value model, graduate students in business  administration at the University of California, Los Angeles, responded to a questionnaire measuring attitudes toward seven different business careers, including advertising management. Results showed that advertising management ranked fourth among seven careers and was evaluated relatively neutrally. Students exhibited little disagreement as to the value of the 10 career features mentioned; however, there was considerable difference of opinion as to the ability of the careers to offer these features. Further analyses are given. (Author/TO)",

        "description":"The ancient principle of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) is largely dead, but remnants of the rule remain in the privilege to use puffery, a type of subjective opinion claim which is defended by the law on the ground that it does not deceive the public even though it is false. While behavioral evidence suggests that many such claims actually deceive, the law relies instead on precedents descending from the heyday of caveat emptor which hold that various false statements are not deceptive. An examination of early English and American court precedents reveals that the precedents have arbitrarily and without reasonable justification determined that consumers are not deceived by puffery because they presumably know they should distrust it, do in fact distrust it, and have full  opportunity to check the truth of such claims. The law's reason for legalizing puffery, in other words, is that it does not work. A comparison of the contrasting attitudes toward puffery taken by major advertisers, who would hardly use such claims if they thought that they did not work, would be valuable. In conclusion, puffery is no more justified today than would be any of the now-rejected aspects of caveat emptor which once prevailed. (Author/TO)",

        "description":"In an attempt to ascertain the facilitating functions of audiovisual between-channel redundancy in information processing, a series of audiovisual experiments alternating auditory and visual as the dominant and redundant channels were conducted. As predicted, results generally supported the between-channel redundancy when input (stimulus) was beyond the human information processing capacity. Data were also interpreted in terms of various theories such as the lower threshold, summation, energy integration, cumulative strength, cuing, and multiple traces of the audiovisual bisensory presentation, implicitly supporting between-channel redundancy. Evidence obtained from the study was also dismetrically opposite to the hypothesis that short-term memory was essentially an auditory  system. Based on findings in neurophysiology, it was argued that both short-term memory and long-term memory might very well be integrated systems. Some conflicting evidence was also found on the position of redundant information of one channel in relation to the other channel. Redundant information coinciding with the dominant channel in the beginning was found significantly better than that at the end with the digit-recall tasks, but not with letter-recall tasks.

        "description":"Most of the literature on communication satellites deals with the technological, legal, and political problems of international communication. Few writers have considered what sorts of programing the international audiences might wish to receive or would watch. Several sources of evidence suggest what the choices might be if the entire world is served by satellite-to-home, multiple channel international television. These sources are: audience reactions to \"foreign\" programs presently available through the domestic television services of certain countries; numerical data on programs interchanged through such regional structures as Eurovision and Intervision; and amounts and kinds of viewing done of foreign stations that can be widely received in other countries, for example, West  German stations in most parts of Holland and Syrian television in many parts of Lebanon. While there appears to be an increasing interest in national and regional history, this greater interest in things national may be accompanied by a decreased interest in things foreign where television is concerned, resulting in a take over of foreign program forms for recasting in a more national mold.

About half of the children studied regularly watched the special Saturday morning newscasts, while almost half watched adult news programing at least occasionally. News viewing increased steadily from kindergarten through fifth grade. A small number of children expressed positive evaluation of the Saturday \"In the News\" segments and a much smaller group strongly preferred adult news. Communication about news events with parents and friends is somewhat related to viewing; however, there is little evidence of parent-child similarities in actual exposure behavior. Demographically, sex is the major determinant of news viewing, as boys watched  considerably more news programs than did girls. Assuming that exposure is either a sole or a reciprocal causal agent, the following tentative conclusions can be suggested: television news exposure produces moderately increased levels of knowledge about political affairs and popular events and persons; exposure to television news produces moderately increased levels of interpersonal discussion of news with peers and parents; and it stimulates perhaps half of the children to seek additional information.

Newspapers pay an annual sponsorship fee which goes into a fund to be used for awards and for the operation of the National Spelling Bee. The only requirements which a sponsor must fulfill concern the age and grade of the speller it sends to the National Spelling Bee. The speller must not reach his sixteenth birthday on or before the date of the national finals, and he must not have passed beyond the eighth grade. Every contestant participating in the  National Spelling Bee in Washington receives a cash award, the amount depending on his or her order of finish in the competition.

        "description":"In introducing drama into the elementary classroom it is wise to start by having children portray that which they have experienced. First attempts should be short and simple with later attempts more complex and of longer duration. The first section of this bulletin offers numerous types of preliminary activities. The remainder of the booklet presents two experiences that are culminative as examples of what can be done with elementary school children and drama. The first experience described is the Medieval Day, an attempt to immerse the child in an environment in which things happen in a spontaneous, though structured, manner. It fills an entire school day in which the children and the teacher assume roles and engage in activities befitting those roles. Preparations for these  role-centered activities are the core of the unit as the Day is its culmination. The second experience presented is the production and staging of a play. A description of the actual production of \"Wizard of Oz\" at one elementary school provides examples. A glossary of stage terms completes the bulletin. (TO)",

The three major bodies of literature studied are the major theoretic approaches utilized in the general area of developmental psychology, the theoretical paradigms evident in studies dealing more specifically with child socialization, and the research evidence related specifically to mass media and socialization. The more common of theoretical approaches has been to designate three major models: (1) mechanistic, in which man is seen as primarily reacting to external forces which mold his behavior and personality; (2) organismic (structural or cognitive-development), in which man is seen as an active rather than reactive organism; and (3) psychoanalytic, in which  emphasis focuses on a combination of drives, thoughts, and emotions in conjunction with basic psychosexual stages. These approaches to the mass media provide conceptual and empirically derived research schemes for the study of the media's influence in the socialization process. (SE)",

The concepts image (the locus of a plan) and plan (a chain of images) are then related to the acts of sending and receiving messages, and the element of intentional and unintentional communication is discussed. Finally, the contributions from the fields of behavioristic and neobehavioristic psychology and linguistics are discussed, and it is concluded that a semantic theory which recognizes the plan/image  duality in communication systems will have to be formalized.

Introducing students to studies selected from closely related strains of research literature could enable them to understand such concepts within the field of communication research. Two areas of communication research provide studies for such literature review: the \"risky-shift\" phenonomenon, perhaps best suited for undergraduate introductory courses, and the dissonance theory/self-perception controversy,  probably more appropriate for a graduate course.

The two main independent variables involved sex of communicator and occupation of communicator. Occupations, analyzed only in terms of whether or not the occupation could be considered typically a &quot;man's&quot; or a &quot;woman's&quot; field, were chosen on the basis of a pretest used to determine male or female dominance. The dependent variables were initial source credibility scores as measured by a semantic differential. Independent variables were manipulated through an introductory statement. For each occupation all information was held constant. Subjects were then asked to rate each proposed speaker on the basis of information given. The authors used a semantic differential consisting of 12  scales. Results from the study indicate that sex of the source alone (sex stereotypification) does not account for credibility ratings and that sex stereotyping of occupational roles cannot be considered a single determinant of source credibility. Tables of findings are included. (Author/JM)",

The DYNUFAM scores for program form entropy and the Structure measures of program organization were found to be correlated at a statistically significant level, and it appears that two measures of program form  are tapping the same underlying dimensions. One hypothesis failed to receive support: although liking of both measures of program form was expected to be non-random so that programs were tightly clustered, the data indicate that the opposite is true.

An outline for teaching an interpersonal communication course to high school students is presented in this article. The goals of this course are (1) to create an awareness of communication barriers within oneself and within and between others, (2) to create an understanding and appreciation of self and others, and (3) to provide self-confidence so that individuals will be less hesitant to express themselves in all speaking situations. The course is divided into seven units:  knowing and trusting each other, the sharing of selves, trust, communication theory, verbal symbols, nonverbal communication, and listening. Numerous activities are given for each unit. A bibliography concludes the article. (TO)",

Because the junior college has a commuting student body, many of the students hold part- or full-time jobs apart from class work, and nearly one student in four is married, the forensic program must show the student postcollege vocational applicability while being an immediately stimulating but not constantly demanding responsibility. It must also be an educationally sound, need-satisfying program which provides for a wide range of student abilities and motivations. Debate/forensics is valuable for the community college student because it provides training in how to think quickly as well as critically, in how to express ideas clearly so that they may be understood and evaluated by  others, and in organizing and integrating many arguments coherently. It also develops tolerance for different points of view. Community college forensic programs must have balance in the following areas in order to satisfy the needs of the students, the objectives of the college, and the demands of the community: competitive intercollegiate activities, competitive and nondecision intramural events, and community service in the form of a speakers' bureau.

Some of the problems students usually encounter in graduate school are limited social life, adjustment to work loads, disparity between formal and experiential knowledge, and constant worry about job opportunities after graduation. The problems are often lessened in smaller universities because faculty members in speech departments are usually willing to listen and are easily accessible to students. Though this may not be true of larger universities, students should take advantage of whatever assistance they are given. (SW)",

It was hypothesized that exposure to campaign content in newspapers, television, radio, and news magazines would lead to higher levels of knowledge and interest. A reciprocal flow of causation from each variable back to exposure was also predicted. Undergraduate students at Michigan State and Colorado State Universities were administered a questionnaire five weeks before the presidential election, and again the day before the election. The analysis showed that October exposure predicted November knowledge above a \"no cause\" baseline and that the reverse correlation  also exceeded the criterion figure. (Author/RB)",

The first award, made to the Berkeley Unified School District, was funded under Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, which provides funds to local educational agencies to develop and carry out demonstration bilingual and bicultural programs. The audit indicated that these funds were used for the development of a national television series although the provisions of Title VII require that grant funds be used only to assist children within a school district and that the Commissioner of Education award such a grant only after determining such a need. A second award was  made to Bilingual Children's Television, Inc. (BC/TV), a nonprofit Oakland corporation, under the authority of the Emergency School Aid Act, which authorized OE to provide financial assistance to local educational agencies and public and private nonprofit organizations for special needs incident to the desegregation of elementary and secondary schools. The basic objective of the BC/TV proposal was to develop a bilingual and bicultural (Spanish-English) educational television show to be aired nationally. This award, made by the Commissioner of Education-elect, was granted over strong objections by OE officials after BC/TV's failure to perform under the first grant and management deficiencies disclosed by the Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) audit agency. The audit agency concluded that  BC/TV suffered from delays in funding. (Author/DN)",

The employee with the complaint is interviewed by his immediate supervisor and then, if necessary, by the principal if the principal is not the employee's immediate supervisor. The second step includes two options and is designed for those grievances that have not been satifactorily resolved in the first step. In the first option the employee appeals the principal's decision to a review panel. The superintendent receives a copy of the appeal and may, if he wishes, reverse or modify the principal's decision before the review panel  hearing. If the superintendent chooses not to act or acts in a way that does not satisfy the employee, the review panel holds a hearing and makes a recommendation to the superintendent. The panel's recommendation is not binding on the superintendent, and his decision, if it is not appealed to the board, is final. In the second option the review panel's decision is binding on the superintendent. The third stage of the procedure provides for a final review of the grievance by the school board. (Authors/JF)",

For each of four important sections of the California Code bearing on the structure and authority of cities and school districts, the study summarizes (1) the primary provisions of the present Code, (2) some recent experience illustrating the effects of the Code, and (3) suggested changes in the Code. Major findings indicate that student performance is either unrelated or negatively related to the size of the school district. It is suggested that voters in a community within an existing local government should have the right to form a new unit of government, subject only to a substantial consensus within the community and protection of the  legitimate rights of other affected parties. It is also suggested that parents should have the authority to enroll their child in any district in the State, subject only to the approval of school officials in the attending district.

The publication considers the relation of the quarter system to summer school, compares the impact of the 55-minute period and the 80-minute period, and  explains new graduation requirements under the quarter system. Specific school subjects considered include art, business education, drama, driver education, English language arts, foreign languages, health and physical education, industrial arts, mathematics, music, science, social studies, and vocational courses.

The schools and programs include free schools, community schools, open education schools, street academies, schools without walls, minischools within schools, minicourses in the curriculum, and alternative programs that bridge the gap between schools and colleges, the world, and work. This document considers the factors behind the movement toward alternatives, the differences between current alternative schools and the traditional alternatives, the relationship of alternative schools to open education and to career education, the effective alternatives for college-bound students in the later years of high school, and the relationship between the development of alternatives and the processes and  goals of New York State's redesign effort.

Major findings indicate that decentralization of the governance in the program has been accomplished through the establishment of representative advisory/governance groups; these groups have brought more, and different, people closer to the governance procedure in Southeast schools; the groups have included a variety of roles and organizational patterns; and these groups generally have not remained static. Groups that serve individual schools spend a majority of their time dealing with school-specific issues. More of this time is spent in planning programs and developing procedures for implementing those programs than is spent on budget and personnel issues.  (Appendix B may reproduce poorly.)

MBO identifies eight major areas of management which become involved in the process: (1) planning, (2) performance appraisal, (3) individual motivation, (4) coordination, (5) control, (6) supervisory relationships, (7) individual development, and (8) a total system of management. The process is one in which the managers of an organization jointly identify common goals, define each individual's major areas of responsibility in terms of results expected, and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contributions of each of its members. In other words, MBO serves as a systemwide process for  determining organizational direction and evaluating results through the identification, clarification, and communication of mutually accepted and carefully defined goals and objectives through the school system. To assist all members of the educational community to ascertain the real mission of the East Allen County Schools in New Haven, Indiana, for the future, an ultimate goal and systemwide objectives were identified. The systemwide objectives are the major areas of growth and development of students which support the ultimate goal of the school system and the East Allen organizational structure is designed to direct the activities of the personnel and functions of the various programs toward a cooperative and coordinated effort to achieve the district's common objectives.

The normal school day would be from 7:45 a.m. to approximately 3:30 p.m. The plan places an emphasis on increased use of facilities with little or no disruption in normal functions. Some other advantages would be less need for students to be programed into a \"lock-step\" type of scheduling; the availability of a wide area of subject elections to all students; and the availability of more time for on-the-job training, vocational inservice programs, and community service projects. A  school that utilizes this program would be able to handle one-third more students than its rated normal capacity without increasing the school budget. (Author/MLF)",

In addition the study examines aspects of interpersonal styles on group functioning, in particular self-oriented, individualistic behavior which is apparently dysfunctional to group processes. The major implication of the study is that it is indeed possible to improve group performance, even in groups with potentially&quot;poor&quot; members, via a simple structures intervention.

In the 20 months following the Serrano decision, scores of school finance suits were filed throughout the country. The momentum initiated by the California Supreme Court was clearly on the side of the plaintiffs. On March 21, 1973, the United States Supreme Court announced its decision in San Antonio Independent School System v. Rodriguez and reversed the momentum that Serrano had begun. Nearly 50 suits have been disposed of in Rodriguez's wake--most terminated voluntarily by the plaintiffs; a few decided in favor of the defendants on motions to dismiss. Despite this apparent setback, the overwhelming number of dismissals  in school finance cases should not be interpreted as the demise of school remains viable. Indeed, the measured pace the movement has followed in the past year has begun to pick up once again. This booklet discusses terminated and pending school finance reform court cases, in each case identifying the parties involved, describing the issues, and stating the case's status. (Author/JF)",

        "description":"During the 1973-74 school year, 230 trainable mentally retarded (TMR) children (ages 7 to 14 years) were exposed to one of two language training conditions: Distar or Peabody. A population of 116 continuees from the first year of the project and 114 new entries were assigned in as random a fashion as possible to either Distar or Peabody. Ss were divided into low IQ (21-43) and high IQ (44-53). Sex was built into the design, as was pretest-posttest and new entries versus continuees. Thus, a five-factor, 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 repeated-measures design was subjected to analysis of variance for each of three basic criteria: Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, and Mecham Verbal Language Development Scale. Seven children were selected randomly from  each of the 16 between-factor cells to yield a total of 112 children. Longitudinal analyses were also conducted on just the continuees with pre- and posttest data from the three basic measures from both years of the project to yield a treatments-by-IQ-by-Sex-by-Measures (2 x 2 x 2 x 4) design. While no significant differences emerged for the high-IQ children, the low-IQ children were aided more by Distar than by Peabody. In the 5-way designs, gain in the total sample was not marked. However, when one considers only the continuees (in the second set of analyses), significant gain in language functioning did occur. (DB)",

The schedule for a typical week includes field work experiences and  class participation. Noted is the involvement of community members. Compared are six modes of program evaluation such as gathering empirical evidence on pupil progress and evaluating the rationale on which a particular program is based. An evaluation design is proposed which would include provisions to collect empirical data, gather information to evaluate the program rationale, and assess the motivational and attitudinal variables of the program. Implementation and feedback phases involve activities such as taking standardized tests prior to and following the program. (DB)",

A questionnaire completed by a site visitor provided supplementary information. Data showed an upward shift in Ss professional aspirations, involvement with professional organizations, and involvement with parents, other teachers, and the community after graduation from the program. Retrospective appraisal by graduates revealed that the program needed more emphasis on community  involvement, parent organizations, and workshops but had provided adequate work in early childhood, exceptional child education, and fieldwork. Educational content areas included in the program (such as cognitive development and communication skills) were all considered important. Data gathered from the questionnaire revealed that the majority of graduates were working with children directly in the classroom and were in racially mixed settings with heterogeneous groups of children. Students suggested that training be expanded in such areas as cultural pluralism, children with learning and behavior problems, and development of listening skills among teachers and children. (LC)",

The schools studied were Roman Catholic parish schools and two types of ethnic supplementary schools: (1) those serving new immigrants along with American-born ethnics; and (2) those serving ethnic groups which no longer have sizable numbers of new immigrations. Questionnaires were used to collect data from ethnic school teachers and directors. The findings showed that the TBEA is perceived as having: (1) a potential negative impact on the educational  efforts of certain ethnic groups, i.e., Chinese and Greek; (2) no impact on the supplemental educational efforts of groups that immigrated primarily before the mid-1950's, i.e., Armenians and Poles; (3) no impact on Roman Catholic parochial schools serving ethnically homogeneous parishes. Methods for involving the ethnic group schools in the implementation of the TBEA are suggested. Concluding the study are recommendations for State recognition and support of ethnic schools because of their valuable role in the process of socialization of immigrant children, as well as the preservation and development of bilingualism in both immigrant and native-born children. A brief history of the TBEA and a copy of the Act and the questionnaire are provided. (LG)",

The color terminology of the Baganda is described, and several psycholinguistic techniques are used to determine the cognition of these terms. These include: (1) word associations, (2) triad sorts, (3) the semantic differential, and (4) listing tasks. Data were collected from samples which maximized the variance in sociocultural characteristics. A multivariate analysis of the data demonstrated a large degree of intracultural variation in the cognition of terms which can be related to formal education, reading and speaking English, residence, age, reading Luganda, and sex. Evidence  from the four psycholinguistic techniques provides a considerable degree of convergent validity for these claims. The significance of these findings with regard to various communication situations (e.g., education, public information) and anthropological research methods which have been based on the assumption of cultural homogeneity are noted, and areas for further research are indicated which can potentially result in findings that can be used to facilitate the communication process within the research population.

        "description":"The problems of teaching German literature survey courses have increased in the 1970's because of the drop in enrollment in language classes in general. Previously German literature courses (at the University of Utah) covered large amounts of material superficially; they were designed to familiarize the student with names of authors, titles of works, and dates. Critical analysis and discussion were not fundamental to the study. Today this approach does not work. Contemporary students are interested in literature for personal understanding and growth. Consequently, the instructor of foreign language literature courses should attempt to meet the students' intellectual needs by teaching works relevant to their search for self-realization. In order to do this, it is necessary to  limit the quantity of literature to be read so that it may be studied in more depth. In addition, an interdisciplinary emphasis is preferable, making it necessary for instructor to be informed of current trends in fields related to literature. Factual lectures might be replaced by introductory lectures on focal points of a cultural period, followed by discussions that would lead to a greater exchange between instructor and student. Examinations should be essays rather than objective short answers, and students of all departments and fields should be welcomed into the language classes. (LG)",

A student who is unaware that vowels are normally quite short and sharp in a French utterance could, for example, easily misinterpret the emotional state of a French speaker. In English, such a style usually indicates that a speaker is somewhat irritated or upset.

The classroom strategies described here have been found effective and can be used during one semester. The Spanish-speaking student consistently speaks more than he writes, and consequently writes as he speaks. In order to compensate for spoken dialect irregularities, he needs to learn spelling rules. Many spelling irregularities can be corrected, to a large extent, by teaching Spanish sound and symbol  correspondences. By using a chart listing Spanish phonemes, and the most common mistakes made by the Spanish-speaking student who already reads and writes English, the student is introduced to Spanish consonants, vowels, and vowel diphthongs with the corresponding orthographic symbols. Students also must be given a complete explanation of stress in Spanish. In teaching reading, the objectives must be that the student acquire: (1) ease and confidence in his ability to read Spanish and (2) comprehension closely approximating his comprehension in English. Emphasis should be given in reading to understanding meaning in context without English translation. (LG)",

        "description":"A survey of written and spoken Tennessee English was recently begun. Work is in progress on the first stage of the project, which involves the compilation of a bibliography. Data from the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (LAGS) and the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) will be examined in planning the survey itself. The next stage will consist of the preparation of a questionnaire which will concentrate on informants' phonological, orthographic, and syntactic systems (data not collected by the LAGS project). Research techniques will be similar to those of the Arkansas Language Survey (ALS). The questionnaire is model-oriented rather than item-oriented, and enables the interviewer to record informants' speech in a wide range of styles. Samples of written English  will also be collected. The general aims of the survey include: (1) the continued gathering of linguistic data useful for identifying geographic boundaries in Tennessee; (2) the investigation of the processes of obsolescence and replacement in the syntactic, phonological, and lexical systems of native Tennesseans; (3) the identification of the linguistic correlates of social stratification of Tennessee English in both its spoken and written forms; (4) the determination of the importance of style shifting as an explanation of linguistic variation in Tennessee; (5) the testing of the hypothesis that Americans generally have a negative attitude toward their own use of language; and (6) the gathering of data yielding information about the relationship between speech and writing.

However, as in previous years, the fund's foremost interest was to strengthen medical education. In a related area, the fund continued its support for medical schools that are attacking, through expansion or modification of their curricula, those behavioral problems with roots in medicine that have awide impact on our society.

Students had a tendency to believe that grades are related to faculty ability, but faculty disagreed with this. Students and faculty alike were split in preference for objective and subjective grading, but AI's preferred objective. All groups agreed that faculty should be allowed to  choose different products (papers, tests, etc.) as a base for grading different students. Students and faculty saw grades as motivating (males more than females), and as anxiety producing (females more so than males). All believed that good grades are useful in getting jobs and in being accepted for graduate work, but students believed grades do not accurately reflect their achievement. Faculty had a tendency to believe grades do reflect achievement, but AI's were undecided. All groups lean toward agreeing that some form of grading is necessary if academic standards are to be maintained. (Author)",

        "description":"In an effort to investigate various methods used in awarding academic credit for nontraditional learning experiences, this study analyzed a 3-page questionnaire returned from 229 U.S. colleges and universities offering at least a bachelor's degree. The major portion of the schools responding were public institutions, located in the Midwest, with an enrollment of between five and ten thousand, and on a semester time schedule. Wide variances were found between schools even in accrediting so-called \"traditional\" courses taught in a lecture situation. Accrediting agencies have just begun the task of establishing specific guidelines for crediting nontraditional learning activities. Most schools have no specific policies of their own for crediting these experiences. The majority of  schools are awarding credit for many different types of nontraditional learning activities. The criteria most used in crediting various activities were: sponsoring departmental judgment, the advice of the involved faculty member, and time expended on the activity. The majority of schools are planning some enlargement in this area of crediting nontraditional learning activities within the next 2- to 3-year period. Although there is increasing interest by some groups for this \"opening up the options\" to meet graduation requirements, there is also a counter current hesitation and in some cases opposition to this movement by some faculty members.

Findings indicate: (1) The automated Guaranteed Student Loan System (GSLS) contains inaccurate data files and computer programs that do not process the data correctly. (2) OE estimates that future losses on loans insured or reinsured as of June 30, 1973, will amount to $302,627,000. Including these losses in the Statement of Financial Condition results in a deficit of $258 million instead of a surplus of approximately $44 million. (3) OE estimated the default rate to be 17.2 percent for loans insured since program inception and 10.1 percent for loans reinsured as of June 30, 1973. (4) Collection  action is not started promptly or pursued adequately to either obtain payments or determine that the loan is uncollectible. (5) OE is authorized to charge an insurance premium rate of one-fourth of 1 percent on loans insured directly by the government. A comparison of premium income with recognized and anticipated losses indicates that a premium rate of 4 percent would be required to finance the insurance. (6) OE does not consolidate information on the GSLS program. However, such information is necessary to enable either the Congress or OE to evaluate the program's effectiveness in relation to its cost. Financial statements are included. (MJM)",

A questionnaire consisting of 15 situations of an academic, social, and professional nature was administered to 314 freshman and sophomore students (60 percent male, 40 percent female, 56 percent white and 44 percent black). Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance and Scheffe post hoc tests. Results indicated that regardless of race, students tended to feel most comfortable in an integrated situation (50 percent black, 50 percent white), less comfortable when they were in the majority, and least comfortable when they were in the minority. Exceptions where students preferred to be in the  majority involved the situations of a party, a blind date, and having major surgery performed. Whites generally felt more comfortable than blacks in most situations. Blacks felt more comfortable than whites in an integrated neighborhood or dorm situation. Whites felt more comfortable than blacks being in a minority when discussing civil rights. Implications of the results for educators were discussed. It was concluded that while there were some negative findings, generally the results appeared to indicate that blacks and whites are approaching equality in their relations with one another.

Conclusions suggest: (1) Institutions in higher education are experimenting with a wide variety of practices, and these experiments are causing much distress to some registrars, professors, and deans. (2) There are as many different types of grading systems as there are institutions. Some institutions reported different policies within that institution. (3) Most of the responding institutions use one or more types of nontraditional grades, but few use them exclusively. The prevalent practice  reported by most institutions is to use the nontraditional grades in courses outside the major and to allow student option. (4) There is a trend toward being less punitive with grades in institutions of higher education. (5) As competency-based education becomes more widespread in higher education, it appears that additional modifications and changes in grading, recording, and averaging practices will come into being and that the traditional transcript/GPA approach will lose more of its historical meaning.

This problem was brought to a head at Colgate in 1972, four years after the Board of Trustees adopted a &quot;general guideline&quot;, connected with a policy of improving faculty salaries and increasing promotion standards, that no more than 55 percent of the faculty may be on tenure at any given time. What was fair treatment for those young faculty members who had been hired prior to this policy without knowing that it would reduce their chances of continuing employment, or tenure, past their probationary service? Should the guideline be abolished, raised to 65  percent suspended temporarily, or implemented in a flexible manner? All these questions are explored in this document, their anticipated consequences are debated, and the compromise solution, adopted in January 1973, is presented. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Current issues in engineering education and supply and demand information on engineering personnel in the Southern region are summed up in this report. Highlights of the report include the following: (1) Although changes in national priorities make it difficult to forecast the demand for engineers, projections are in agreement that the national demand for bachelors of engineering will exceed the available supply. (2) The minimum annual national projection of demand for graduate engineers is 44,000. Yet with declining enrollments the expected annual supply in 1976 will be only 28,000, and will not reach 40,000 during the remainder of the decade. (3) For the Southern region the gap between available graduates and jobs will mirror the national imbalance. (4) At the Ph.D. level,  however, it is expected that engineers will have difficulty in finding jobs that require training at that advanced level. (5) The current manpower situation has the following implications for the education of engineers: recruitment of women and minorities, integration of the engineering curriculum with social sciences, reduction or stabilization in the number of Ph.D. programs, and stress on continuing education for engineers by colleges and universities.

Two departments were surveyed at each university, providing 24 reports or case studies. The results were reviewed by the members of the Task Force on Crucial Issues, and conclusions were synthesized indicating: (1) Effective cooperation exists between the administrators of the academic departments surveyed and the universities' foreign student advisor's offices. (2) Departments do not provide special orientation and counseling services for their foreign students. (3) Most of the departments are not accommodating the special needs and problems of foreign students, except adjusting course loads during the initial  semester if a language handicap exists. (4) In one-third of the departments surveyed a few foreign students serve on departmental committees. (5) The departments offer neither special services nor special programs to foreign students as differentiated from those available to all students. (6) Doctoral candidates are not encouraged to write theses in absentia on topics pertinent to their own countries. (7) In most departments, the faculty will make an effort to determine the unique needs of a student's country in planning his program. (MJM)",

Conclusions and recommendations include: (1) Accreditation should continue to serve as one means by which postsecondary schools become eligible for federal programs. (2) The functions of reviewing accrediting agencies and recommending some for inclusion on the Commissioner of Education's list of recognized agencies should be largely transferred to the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation. (3) The Office of Education should institute a program to improve the training of state education staff and to  gain their fuller cooperation in enforcing federal eligibility regulations. (4) Student loans should be insured against school closure. (5) No really satisfactory solution exists to the problem of determining the quality and eligibility of over 13,000 postsecondary schools. Chapters cover the meaning and origins of accrediting, accrediting agencies, regional accreditation, approval systems for veterans, student loan programs, consumer protection.

In the spring of 1972, detailed interviews were conducted with 400 library users and 200 matched nonusers in two middle sized Hungarian towns. Interviewees were asked to evaluate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the attractiveness of 16 leisure or cultural activities and 11 kinds of television programs, first to themselves and second to the general population. The same people were revisited in 1974, and, by the reuse of the original research instruments, judgements were made as to the presupposed changes in favor of the library users, in the rise of their cultural demands to a higher level. The results, showing the varieties of  values between users and nonusers, plus individual changes over two years, indicate a greater achievement motivation among users. Since such motivation is developed in early childhood, it is recommended that attention be focused on providing children with improved library services and with stimulating role models. (SL)",

Demonstrations to the student can provide good illustrations of the context, gestures, facial and mouth movements that naturally accompany language production and reception. Visual scenes can often provide meaning to the content of the conversation. In addition, videotapes allow a measure of individualized instruction and can preserve lectures for students who missed them or want to review them. The principal advantage of demonstration by the student is the provision of  feedback and evaluation of his own and his classmates' speech.

The concept of a working memory, or &quot;mind's eye&quot;, and its importance in learning is described along with some conceptions of how this might serve in the generation of mental imagery from digital propositional information stored in long-term memory. Some research bearing on the use of external imagery for facilitating learning and improving retention is also reviewed.

The materials for a 90-hour block of instruction, entitled Waveform Analysis, included printed and AV material and covered complex cognitive and performance skills. The mean written test score for the block was 80 percent (passing was 70 percent), but this was achieved with an average 31 percent reduction in training time. Trainees indicated a positive attitude toward the course. Similar results were obtained in trials with smaller blocks of time.  The reduction in training time coupled with trainee achievement supports the feasibility of individualizing the PME course. The projected cost savings in excess of $40,000 a year argue strongly for the cost effectiveness of individualizing the entire PME course and other similar technical training courses. (Author/WH)",

In addition, a number of data collection instruments were designed to assess the effectiveness of diffusion techniques. The results indicate that staff reactions to all three diffusion techniques were extremely positive. When the staff was asked to indicate their preference regarding diffusion techniques, 78.7 percent preferred interpersonal techniques, 19.2 percent preferred written techniques, and 2.1 percent cited other techniques. Moreover, requests  from centers and other human service agencies for written materials far exceeded original estimates.

Starting with the Medical Library Assistance Act of 1965, various plans of organization have been tried for improving the national diffusion of medical information. In 1968 the John Crerar Library became the Midwest Regional Medical Library, serving as an intermediary between local medical libraries and the National Library of Medicine (NLM). North Dakota was a member of this centralized information system. In 1973, the Midwest followed other regions in switching to a decentralized network, with 10 libraries designated as resource libraries for their regions and consortia of neighboring libraries being encouraged to form. The NLM requested that each region and state develop a resource sharing plan. The  state plan for North Dakota will include division of the state into four service quadrants and central coordination by a new Director of Health Science Libraries. (PF)",

However, the audiotutorial students were able to complete additional supplementary minicourses of their choice within the same time span; hence, in reality they were able to achieve more by the individualized instruction. Furthermore in responding to an attitude questionnaire, students indicated a preference for this type of learning experience. Taking confidence from these results and combining that  information with the experience gained through field testing minicourses from Purdue University, the Lake Land College Life Science staff has implemented an expanding program of supplemental packaged units (minicourses).

        "description":"Audiotutorial instruction is one application of instruction tailored to individual needs. This method imposes certain requirements for instruction to be effective and for students to be properly motivated to learn. Some of the key requirements are: (1) individual control of the program material, (2) convenience of materials acquisition by the student, (3) simplicity of presentation methods, (4) costs, (5) timeliness of materials available, and (6) ease of courseware development. The Ampex Pyramid System satisfies each of these requirements. In its simplest form, the system provides high speed cassette copies of any program in its master storage bank. In a second form, the student accesses the system from a terminal located at a carrel. In addition, a feature may be added which  allows the same functions described above to be performed at home using a touch tone telephone. Another feature is that of student response and conditional branching. Most importantly, the system has been purposely designed to allow a full range of presentations from very simple linear program presentations to sophisticated, fully interactive, multimedia lessons with conditional branching. All may be presented on the system without a significant investment of time and dollars in computer software. (WCM)",

The CARE curriculum currently offers four basic courses: early identification of handicapped children, diagnostic and prescriptive teaching of preschool and primary children (two courses), and education of visually handicapped children. Two additional courses are planned for the CARE program and their development will follow the step-by-step course development procedures previously established. An evaluation was performed  on the first CARE course, identification of handicapped children. The results of the evaluation, which included a two-group t-test of achievement scores with conventional instruction as a control and a student questionnaire, indicated that the CAI students scored significantly higher in achievement, needed less instruction time, and appreciated the program.

The methodology of the evaluation included student questionnaires, student interviews, student critics, teacher questionnaires, expert judgement, attention measures, and observers.

        "description":"To determine the professional preparation and experience of instructors hired by community junior colleges and technical institutions during the 1972 to 1974 academic years, questionnaires were sent to 100 junior colleges and technical institutions representing all 50 states. A total of 83 colleges and institutions from 43 states responded, of which, 76 replies were usable. The data were compiled into three enrollment categories: schools with less than 2,000 students, with 2,001 to 5,000 students, and with enrollments over 5,000. The data were also compiled into one general total category. Responses were cross-tabulated to determine the percentage of full-time instructors who had received degrees and the percentage of the instructors' past employment positions. The results of the  data analysis were: (1) the average number of full-time instructors increased as the institutions' sizes increased; (2) there were, on the average, a higher proportion of resignations in the smaller schools; (3) the larger schools doubled and tripled the number of full-time instructors hired at the smaller schools; (4) only 17 percent of all full-time instructors at these schools had had any course work relating to the community junior college, and only 1.8 percent had had any type of internship or field work in a community college prior to being hired; (5) most of the states surveyed do not require credentials to teach in a community junior college; and (6) a large percentage of full-time instructors came from business and industry.

Responses were received from 6 state directors, 43 college presidents, and 25 board chairmen. The survey results indicated that: (1) in the majority of states reporting, the state-level agencies regulated only public two-year colleges; (2) the basis of authority for the state and institutional boards existed in statutory provisions in the majority of cases; (3) institutional boards governed the local  colleges; (4) the size of the state and institutional boards varied from state to state; (5) the majority of the institutional boards were elected by the public; a sizable number of institutional boards were filled, however, by gubernatorial appointment; (6) the length of terms of institutional board members varied from 3 to 7 years; (7) in the majority, there was no limit on the number of consecutive terms that a board of trustee member could serve; and (8) only geographic considerations were made to assure representatives in the institutional board of trustees in most cases.

        "description":"Various aspects of faculty workload are reviewed, with emphasis on definitions of workload and on major problems in developing workload formulas. Attention is also given to the erosion of parietal policies, the quality versus quantity issue, and the effect of collective bargaining on workloads. For most instructors, the important factors are the number of credit or contact hours assigned per week and the number of students in each class, with credit or contact hours having greater significance to the faculty. Although workload formulas have been developed, they still approximate the number of weekly contact hours. Hourly loads are lower today than they were in the 1950's and earlier. Faculties object strenuously to the practice of equating workload to quantitative criteria,  particularly number of contact hours, student-faculty ratios, and average class size. Parietal regulations are still found in many statements of college policies, and are based on the principle that teaching is a full-time occupation. In light of the strong tradition equating low or moderate workloads with quality, administrators face a formidable task in their efforts to increase the loads. Within the limits set by state laws and state administrative regulations, faculty are participating in the initial determination and subsequent reappraisal of workloads, as recommended by the 1969 AAUP Statement of Faculty Workload. New teaching methods and technologies have made it necessary to modify the faculty load formulas. Faculty fear that the major purpose of introducing the new  teaching/learning modes is to increase faculty productivity, which will, in turn, lead to the use of fewer instructors. (DB)",

Further, it was an effort to gain information from employers regarding what improvements they felt could be made in Montgomery's curriculum to better prepare students for their future occupations. The data were gathered by questionnaires completed by the employers of graduates. The programs evaluated in the survey represented both career and transfer oriented curriculums. The majority of the graduates were employed in the metropolitan Washington area by private firms, hospitals, or the Federal Government. The study found that Montgomery College is providing employers with graduates who have sufficient backgrounds and preparation to succeed  in their occupations. This was evidenced by the number of employers who stated that they would hire additional Montgomery graduates in the future, without reservation. It was further found that an AA degree was not necessary for obtaining many of the positions held by the graduates, but that once hired, chances for promotion were improved with the degree. This finding leads to the conclusion that in the eyes of the business world, the role of the community college is to provide the training needed for job entry, and that this training is not necessarily equated with the Associate of Arts degree.

They suggest a range of activities and an evolving philosophy of accommodating the student entering a compensatory program at the college level. The articles are by the speech instructors at designated HEAP centers. The first essay, by Ethel Young, details a particularly successful activity at Meridian (Mississippi) Junior College, the use of the journal. The second essay, by Orlando Taylor of Delgado (New Orleans) Junior College, elaborates on the approach a speech instructor might take in organizing a year's course. The third article, by Elaine Amerson of Kennesaw  (Georgia) Junior College, also suggests organizational possibilities within a particular approach. All agree that the emphasis of the program is to be student centered, and that its success depends heavily on a strong student/instructor relationship. In the final essay, Christa Carvajal discusses some ways to build better listening skills. (Author/DB)",

The data are divided into three areas of the transfer pattern: academic entry pattern, including GPA by group, sex, semester, and transfer shock; the attrition pattern; and the persistence pattern by academic division, sex, and age. The data are based on 235 students who transferred from six Missouri junior colleges in the fall of 1971, and completed at least the fall semester. Individual student files, student transcripts, and the Data Processing Center at the university were the data sources. Students were divided into four groups, based on their  number of transfer hours. Results of the study showed that by the spring of 1973, 66 students from the original transfer population had earned B.A. degrees. Of the 76 students who transferred from the junior colleges with an A.A. degree, 31 students (41 percent) earned the B.A. degree by the spring of 1973. (DB)",

The grade point averages of 830 full-time students at Wilkes Community College (North Wilkesboro, N.C.) were analyzed to determine: (1) if working students' GPA's differed significantly from those of the total student population and from those of nonworking students; (2) if working a specified number of hours per week produced significant differences in GPA's; (3) if specific academic loads produced significant differences in GPA's among working students; (4) if working students in various degree programs obtained significantly different GPA's; (5) if working females make significantly different GPA's than working males; (6) if working freshmen made  significantly different GPA's than working sophomores; and (7) if single working students made significantly different GPA's than married or other working students. From the data analyzed, it was concluded that at the .05 level of significance: (1) working students carrying an academic load of 12 to 15 credit hours and working 40 or more hours per week made higher GPA's than students with the same academic load working from 27 to 39 hours per week; (2) working students enrolled in the College Transfer program and working from 14 to 26 hours per week made higher GPA's than did those in this same program working 40 or more hours per week.

Analysis of the opinionnaire data showed a pronounced difference of opinions among instructors and administrators.

        "description":"The new approach to library services in the two-year college, called the &quot;learning resource program,&quot; focuses on the improvement and self-discovery of the individual student. Learning resource programs must be selective and discretionary about the type and amount of hardware and software available for learning activities. The learning resource programs contain many of the fundamental services that enhance learning, along with newer media and information retrieval that assist in implementing the philosophy and programs of the individual two-year college. The nature of the learning resource program insures and accounts for flexibility. Traditionally, educators have always controlled student academic behavior, but today researchers are encouraging librarians and faculty to merge,  thereby sharing and equalizing their roles. Learning resource programs operate most effectively if they maintain the characteristics of adaptability, flexibility, and implementation. Realistically, however, since two-year institutions have proportionately smaller enrollments, it is difficult for them to build up substantial acquisitions. As compensation for this, it is suggested that two-year institutions develop cooperative arrangements with neighboring libraries, colleges, and communities. Since learning resource programs reflect curriculum and curriculum reflects students' needs, the amounts and types of technology used are predicted to grow in the future.

After a review of the literature, possible grade inflation at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida is examined. The research clearly indicates that very significant grade inflation has taken place at the college, both in the Social Science Division, in particular, and in the college at large. Many reasons why this has occurred are indicated. Recommendations are made that student grading conform more closely with academic achievement, and explanations of why this should be done are offered. At the same time, allowance and accommodation for the underprepared student are recognized. Limited innovative  teaching techniques are suggested in order to help such students, including individualized instructions. Perhaps a no-fail or pass-fail evaluation system might be in order. The public demands that students achieve academically if they are to receive academic credentials to that effect. (Author/DB)",

Two mailings of questionnaires were carried out, the first to 2,432 former students and three weeks later, the second to 1,935. In addition, interviews were carried out with selected students. The questionnaire, telephone, and personal interviews were designed to answer the following questions: (1) What were the reasons students terminated their enrollment at the college? (2) Were the educational experiences received at the college subsequently useful in their career preparation? (3) What improvements are needed in the college's supportive services? (4) To what extent are former students utilizing their educational experiences obtained at the  college? and (5) What problems were encountered by students entering full-time employment or transferring to other colleges and universities? The returned questionnaires were divided into three program categories--Vocational, Transfer, and General. The data are provided in 29 tables and 10 figures. Two general conclusions resulting from the study were: (1) the respondents in the General category tended to rate their experiences at the college lower than those in the Transfer and Vocational categories; and (2) a higher percentage of the college's students transfer than was anticipated, and transferability of courses presents a problem.

The author presents an evaluation of the Inventory and make recommendations for changes, deletions and additions so that more satisfactory measures will be available for use in the study of the impact of day care on child development. The evaluations are based upon the findings from 282 day care children in Pennsylvania. The Day Care Inventory contains sixteen separate assessment components; these measures can be used to assess the development of preschool children in the following areas: (1) problem solving; (2) creativity; (3) sensory experience; (4) language; (5) gross motor skills; (6) visual discrimination; (7) social development and skills; (8) self esteem; (9) self concept; and (10) affective behavior. The  format for each component evaluation includes a test description, discussion of the administration and scoring, a report of the findings, and a summary containing recommendations. (SDH)",

This model proposes to fit two linear time trend lines to a set of mailed questionnaire data. Application of the model provides an estimate of the intersection point during the time period at which the estimate of the parameter has stabilized. It is at the stabilization point that the researcher can be relatively confident that his estimates do not differ significantly from those which he would make were he to wait for additional returns to be received. To illustrate the application of this model, questionnaires were  sent to 1,120 child care centers in Pennsylvania. Nine weekly subsamples of the 545 returned questionnaires were analyzed according to the model to estimate the average maximum allowed enrollment, the proportion of centers either licensed or approved, and the proportion of centers reporting Black children in attendance. Also, the appendices contain analyses of the data from each of twenty categories of information contained in the questionnaire. (SDH)",

        "description":"This paper reviews two major advances in preschool evaluation strategy that developed as a result of trying to evaluate Head Start, and proposes another evaluation approach. The first advance in evaluation procedure was to conceive educational objectives in terms of processes rather than products; that is, there was a shift from achievement tests to tests of cognitive process based on Piagetian problem-solving tasks. The second evaluation advance was to recognize the importance of comprehensiveness by extending evaluation content to include affective and social as well as cognitive processes. The alternative plan proposed in this report entails systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the child's school environment, to be followed by a theoretical analysis of the potential  impact of his school experience. This approach represents a shift in emphasis from the assessment of impact on children to the assessment of the antecedent condition, the classroom environment. To implement such an approach to the evaluation of early childhood education programs, there is a need to explicitly formulate propositions regarding how and why preschool programs should work. On the basis of such a framework, methods must be devised for moving into a classroom and reliably describing, in quantitative terms wherever possible, the salient dimensions of its environment and its interactions.

        "description":"This paper deals with some of the social and educational implications of Piaget's concept of &quot;stages&quot;, (as formulated in structural-developmental psychology) and focuses on a basic aspect of interpersonal cognition--social perspective-taking ability. The analysis emphasizes the structure of social understanding rather than the content, the ability to conceive of subjective perspectives rather than the accuracy of person perception. From a longitudinal study of children, aged four years through young adulthood, four levels of interpersonal perspective-taking in children prior to adolescence are identified: (1) egocentric perspective-taking, (2) subjective perspective-taking, (3) self-reflective perspective-taking, and (4) mutual perspective-taking. In a second study, subjects  responded to filmed, socio-moral dilemmas. On the basis of the responses, the levels of interpersonal perspective-taking were related to moral conceptions in children. The last half of the paper concentrates on the educational implications of the sequence of perspective-taking levels, particularly social-conceptual conflict and exposure to reasoning slightly above the child's own level. A peer-oriented developmental program for social education is presented, along with a description of the teacher's role in social education and some pilot research which evaluates the author's procedures.

Practical information is provided on the prime factors that should be taken into account in selecting the ideal physical location and the proper educational environment of family day care homes, along with a list of suggested guidelines for recruiting family day care teachers. The minimal standards of the model described in this report reflect both the necessary requirements for good developmental child care and what can reasonably be expected in the family day care system. Optimal standards reflect non-essential but important elements to include in a program for  achieving the constant goal of improved care for children. A network of inter-relationships and responsibilities involving the agency, the family day care teachers, and the natural parents is also outlined. The report highlights the general philosophy of the child care committee that a diversity of family day care systems is desirable to meet the needs of families and communities. Information given in the report is therefore applicable to family day care homes attached to day care centers, nursery schools or social service agencies. (CS)",

The peculiar differentiating aspects of group identity lie in the content (the particular values and goals espoused by the different groups), and style (their distinctive forms of expression) - not in the processes through which the groups achieved these values. Black Americans must use the same techniques that are presently used to socialize the Black child to the middle class white American value system, and re-connect the Black American with his own historical identity. Using all the known techniques of learning, from role-playing to story-telling, the  processes of socialization for the black child must be filled with black ego-enhancing content. Black children must be taught the skills for exploding derogatory myths and critically analyzing written material - books, newspapers, and so-called scientific studies. They must be disciplined to careful study and to love of knowledge. Such a process of socialization for the black child toward a self-respecting, self-actualizing authentic person, demands an armament of ego defenses to serve as counteractives to the unrelenting stream of assaults by a sometimes inhospitable larger culture.

The author, after a brief survey of federal involvement in early education from 1933 to 1973, suggests that the historical perspective might provide a critical context for policy decisions in early childhood education if future historical research would shift from a descriptive to an analytic level of inquiry. Numerous examples of such an analytic historical method are provided in the text, along with a variety of suggestions for further historical public policy research, such as the impact of early education on: (1) the lives of American children, (2) the development of the  professional organizations, (3) public attitudes regarding early education, and (4) on the development of private institutions of early education.

        "description":"This is a report on an experimental study of a cognitive curriculum supplement developed for the I.V.Y. (Involving the Very Young) Program of the Baltimore City School System. The study concerns the development and transmission of a curriculum for two-year-old children, and an evaluation of its effects. The present version of the curriculum is not a complete one, but a cognitively oriented supplement which seeks to teach the most adaptive style by which representational skills might be used by the two-year-old subjects. Evaluation utilized a design in which 16 preschool centers were paired on a number of relevant variables and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Implications of the study are relevant to the general problems of teacher training for preschool  programs, the transmission of curricula, and the utility of preschool programs in changing the social and cognitive development of young children. Nine lesson plans are included, as well as the checklists and test batteries used in the evaluation. (Author/ED)",

Specifically, two hypotheses were tested: (1) that children who viewed several &quot;Misterogers Neighborhood&quot; programs would evidence more prosocial behavior than would nonviewers, and (2) that young viewers would show an increase in prosocial behavior greater than that shown by older viewers. The five programs selected to test these hypotheses contained three basic prosocial themes: restitution, sharing, and empathy. One program a day was shown to 21 children, aged 3 to 6, randomly selected from a local nursery school population. Another group of 22 nursery school children who did not see the programs served as controls. After the viewers were exposed to the five programs,  restitution sharing, and empathy behaviors were assessed using two separate tasks. The results indicate that children viewing network programming designed to teach prosocial behavior can benefit by viewing. However, no support was obtained for the hypothesis that younger children derive greater benefits than older children from network programming. (CS)",

One-half of the group viewed a segment from a violent detective series; the other half saw an exciting but nonviolent segment from a major league baseball game. Immediately afterward, each child was asked to \"babysit\" two preschoolers. The preschoolers eventually behaved aggressively and destructively. Children who previously witnessed the aggressive segment were significantly slower to summon adult assistance than were children who viewed the control film. These results replicate those of a similar study done by Drabman and Thomas, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to televised violence may serve to make viewers, particularly children, tolerant  of real-life aggression and less likely to intervene.

Project Early Aid was designed to implement a program model that would upgrade both the interpersonal and physical environments of young children attending day care centers. It quickly became apparent to the consulting team that their values in regard to positive mental health were often discrepant from those of the caregivers who may or may not be reflecting shared values of a particular community. The resulting suggestions of the group on how to begin a primary prevention program include: (1) clarification of the belief systems concerning  behavioral-emotional functioning of children to the consultants themselves, to coprofessionals, and to community members; (2) encouragement of the consumers' articulation of long-term goals and belief systems; (3) understanding of the historical factors at work in a community that have led to the establishment of and change in such belief systems; (4) a differentiation of those values which are widely shared and those which are idiosyncratic to certain persons or subgroups; and (5) an attempt to capitalize on points of convergence, while openly discussing divergent issues.

This problem has provoked debate in the context of three empirical questions: concept age norms, concept training effects, and concept invariant sequences. It is argued that only the question of invaniant sequences in same-stage concepts is theoretically crucial. With regard to this question it is shown that both Type I (&quot;false positive&quot;) and Type II (&quot;false negative&quot;) criterion errors tend to produce data which are spuriously supportive of theoretical predictions. It is concluded that the objective psychometric consequences of criterion errors provide no grounds for the current view that obtaining or not obtaining theory-supportive findings in concept development research turns on arbitrary  decisions about response criteria.

Creative abilities of 155 children from four preschool centers in Bismarck, North Dakota were identified through the use of three instruments: Kindergarten Evaluation of Learning (KELP); the Starkweather Test of Conforming and Nonconforming Behavior; and a Creative Activities Checklist (an instrument designed for teacher and parent training). Data were collected by teachers and college students enrolled in a 15-week course on creativity. At the end of the course, correlations among the three  instruments were computed using Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient and Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient. General conclusions were: (1) teachers and students working with the three instruments can become aware of the total education of the child, including cognitive, affective, and psychomotor aspects; (2) the Creative Activities Checklist is a valid instrument for measuring small children's creativity; and (3) the checklist is of value in alerting both teachers and parents to the significance of creativity and some means of fostering it in children.

The paper points out the modeling research has neglected to consider subjects' self-evaluation and task competence as factors possibly mediating the acquisition and performance of behavior.

In the first experiment 1-, 4- and 7-month-old infants experienced simultaneously their mothers' faces and voices. The various conditions consisted of displacing the voice from the face. The results indicated that infants as young as one month of age show increased looking behavior although there was no indication of emotional upset when there was face-voice displacement. In order to determine why voice displacement results in increased looking, several other face-voice pairings were observed. In the second experiment face-voice discrepancies, such as mother's face with stranger's voice, were presented. The results indicate that face-voice discrepancy is as effective as face-voice  displacement, suggesting the face-voice schema integration exists in the very young. These results are discussed in the context of the integration of schema in the young infant. (Author)",

Results indicate a consensus on values  related to parenting styles, desirable attributes for preadolescent sons, and expectations and aspirations for educational and occupational attainments. Actual characteristics of the sons whose school achievements fell below grade level differed from those whose achievements were average or better.

        "description":"This paper discusses the research methodology used to determine the main dimensions of satisfaction-dissatisfaction (fertility values) associated with family size. A survey instrument was used to interview approximately 300 white women with none, one, two, or four children. Within the survey instrument, three different approaches were used to elicit the respondents' fertility values: (1) &quot;why&quot; questions which probe the motivational bases underlying answers to other structural questions, (2) an eight-part, open-ended question used to elicit fertility values for specific family sizes, and (3) a card-sorting task that measured respondent judgments on a pre-established list of potential fertility values. It was concluded that the administration of the three methods was worthwhile  since the analysis of the data indicated each method produced some results in common as well as some unique results. The examination of the comparisons between methods, illustrated by three tables, include: (1) an outline of the fertility value coding scheme for content analysis, (2) the 10 top responses in each of the three approaches to revealing fertility values, and (3) a listing of the likes and dislikes of family sizes. Indications for future research are discussed. (SDH)",

Data was gathered from 310 Caucasian Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish women from the Buffalo metropolitan area. The subjects were between the ages of 15 and 44, lived with their husbands, and had either none, one, two, or four children. The survey imstrument employed two main methods of eliciting responses: a series of openended questions and a card sort task which indicated opinions on a pre-established list of potential fertility values. Results presented in data tables and figures show: (1) the fertility values most mentioned by the respondents, (2) most important fertility values from the card sort tasks, (3) fertility values correlating with desired family  size, and (4) feeling about various family sizes among respondents desiring two children. The results are discussed in terms of the patterns of the correlations, the importance of personal benefits of husbands and wives in determining family size, the absence of motivators for large families, the relation of reward values to family size, and the religious differences reflected in the correlates of actual desired family size.

        "description":"This paper presents a discussion of the gradual changes in society's sex role attitudes and the implications for children and early childhood education. The author states that the move toward equalizing the women's role in society was precipitated by the employment of women during World War II, and this movement is supported today by the following realizations: (1) the traditional structure is no longer functional to our economy; (2) traditional sex roles are dysfunctional in individual development; and (3) traditional sex-role typing is dysfunctional for marriage. Egalitarianism, now being focused on women, should be extended to men; the answer to sex role stereotyping lies not in role reversal but in role flexibility. Suggestions for early childhood educators include: (1)  consciousness-raising sessions for preschool staff in which attitudes and feelings about sex role stereotypes are examined and worked through; (2) parent education programs dealing directly with sex roles to prepare parents to help their children recognize stereotyping role models; (3) curricular materials and books which do not reinforce traditional sex roles; (4) integrated play areas arranged so that all children are free to play in all areas; and (5) role models for children which are selective and nontraditional.

The propositions are generally based on the results of two successive interview surveys involving approximately 600 married, white women between the ages of 15 and 44. This number includes approximately equal numbers of middle class and working class women, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish women and those with none, one, two, and four children. Assessed were the relative preferences of these women for desired as well as alternative family sizes. The study is based on a rational model which states that many people choose a family size by weighing the pros and cons of alternative family sizes. The three propositions presented and discussed are: (1)  when asked to evaluate specific family sizes, people tend to cloak their answers; (2) people who are nonrational (who do not evaluate the differences among family sizes) tend to want larger families; and (3) people tend to become more rational as they build their families.

Each subject was asked to rate his or her impressions of some typical names using a seven-point scale for each of nine semantic differential subscales. Results indicated that there do appear to be differences in the content and quality of first-name stereotypes among teacher subgroups. These differences seem more pronounced for female first-names and for names thought to carry undesirable stereotypes.

Subjects were 30 children, grades K-4, who were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The treatment procedure consisted of an elicitation by a teacher of a positive self-statement from an experimental subject. Each statement was immediately followed by a positive social reinforcer. At the end of the 40-day treatment period every child receiving the treatment showed a large gain in self-concept score. These gains were maintained on a delayed posttest given one month after cessation of the elicitation procedures.  Discussion of the results indicated that the study provided evidence that, by altering specific behaviors, attitudinal changes can be effected even on a more global self-concept measure. An alternative explanation however, is that changes shown by the experimental group may possibly be due to the amount of attention that the children received, rather than the experimental procedures per se.

The reinforcement strengths of two candies were determined for 40 preschool children as measured by rate of response on a button pressing apparatus. The children then observed a videotape of an adult model being rewarded in a different situation who: (1) chose one candy over the other and consumed it, (2) chose one candy over the other but did not consume it, (3) consumed one candy but did not have a choice of candies, or (4) did not receive a candy reward. Rates of response supported by each candy were then determined again. The predicted interactions of the candies, sessions, and modeling conditions  were statistically significant, indicating that the reinforcement strength of the candy was enhanced by observational learning. This finding increases the viability of the concept of conditioned reinforcement in accounts of complex human behavior. (Author/SDH)",

Indian doctoral students participating in the class did all of their own teaching and furnished all input for the class. The first step in the class organization was the development of a set of basic beliefs common to all participants. These basic beliefs are examined in depth in 10 personal philosophies written by the participants. The Indian Philosophy of Education class expressed basic beliefs in \"the need to be Indian...the  need to define Indian-ness...that education is a moral development, not only an intellectual one...that contemplation is the way to reality and ultimate truth...that man without the Supreme Being is helpless and insignificant...that a successful person is one who has humility, self-denial, and wisdom...the need to know Indian ancestry...the return to Indian values.\" The 1972-73 class is the first faltering step toward a full-blown Indian education philosophy.

Most of the heroes and heroines whose lives are briefly described were chiefs; some of them have become famous around the world. All were leaders in a great struggle to preserve treasured lands and lifeways. With their tribesmen, they are inseparably linked to our country's history from its earliest beginnings through generations of growth. A suggested reading list with headings for \"General Background,\"\"Tribes and Individuals,\" and \"Publications on Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Sale Through the Superintendent of Document\" concludes the document.

        "description":"The Cabinet Committee on Opportunities for Spanish Speaking People supports the belief that the coordination of migrant programs requires national responsibility. The problem of providing comprehensive services to migrant farmworkers transcends state and regional boundaries and goes beyond the limits of the separate legislative authority held by administering agencies. In the past, Congressional committees, public agencies, and private businesses have conducted a number of studies on the problems which confronted migrant farmworkers. In most cases, the findings produced similar or complementary conclusions and recommendations. Specifically, these studies identified the need for strong unified direction and coordination of migrant programs by Federal, State, and local agencies. A  brief overview of selected proposals or projects related to establishing a national coordinating mechanism which would be charged with administering all programs that benefit migrants and other seasonal farmworkers is presented in this paper. Covered are: two proposed national coordinating units--Special Office for Migrant and Ex-Migrant Affairs and National Migrant Council; a list of 15 programs which could provide assistance to migrant farmworkers; Experimental and Demonstration Project conducted by the Rural Manpower Service; and Michigan's program coordination experiment Brief general information on the migrant stream and the migrant condition (income, health, and education) is also given.

        "description":"With a major emphasis on cooperative planning in rural development, three elements of development process were identified: (1) integration of units involved, occurring when several organizations contribute to a larger collective effort; (2) decentralized planning and local initiative, occurring when planning initiative is at the local level; (3) balanced contributions from public and private sectors, occurring when there is simultaneous input from public and private sectors. Questionnaires and personal interviews were given to administrators of 160 sample organizations (selected from 16 Iowa counties representative of different socioeconomic problems found throughout the state), which were categorized as Federal agricultural agencies, state and county public agencies, and private  associations. Definitions of rural development varied, but economic development headed the list, while development activities most frequently mentioned were agricultural aspects and natural resource conservation. Difference in the focus of the three groups coupled with evaluation of organizational commitment revealed the necessity for assurances of interagency goals, costs, and responsibilities as prevention against conflict of interest. Development priorities were identified as schools and education, agriculture activities with farmers, and agricultural-related business and industry. Assessment of organizational structure and function and administrative attitudes was made to determine the level of cooperation attainable. (JC)",

        "author":["Weber, Bruce A."],
        "description":"The past decade has seen a number of studies of how the poverty incidence (the percentage of families below the poverty line) of certain demographic groups changes in response to economic growth. The question of whether regional economic growth trickles down to rural and rural poor families was examined by statistically estimating the relationship between family income change and multicounty regional economic growth for a sample of 669 rural Wisconsin families with white, nonaged, nondisabled heads of household. These families, surveyed in 1968, were grouped according to farm poor, farm nonpoor, rural nonfarm (RNF) poor, and RNF nonpoor. Ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate the relationship between family income change and the two indicators of regional economic  development (income growth and job growth) over the period 1965-67. The results indicated that poor farm families did not get a proportional share of additional regional income growth. Rural nonfarm nonpoor families appeared to be similarly unable to share proportionately in additional regional income growth. While farm nonpoor and RNF poor families did appear to respond somewhat to regional income growth, it appeared that, on the whole, additional regional income growth could be expected to widen the income gap between urban and rural families.

        "description":"This study investigated middle school children's ability to form a mental image of a planar figure and to: (1) mentally flip, turn, or slide this representation and then construct the resultant image in correct position (\"performing individual motions\"), (2) perform two such motions in succession (\"composition of motions\"), (3) perform the process in reverse (\"inverse motions\"), and (4) hold length invariant while attempting the above three operations. The sample consisted of 30 students at the upper three-fourths ability level in each of grades 4, 6, and 8. Five tests were given to each student: (1) a 20-item paper-and-pencil pretest to determine ability to perform transformations at the perceptual-recognition level; (2) an individual test to see if students could physically  perform flips, turns, and slides; and (3) a three-part transformation test, measuring performance on individual motions, compositions, and inverses. Five Age X Motion ANOVAs were used to analyze the five tests. Age was significant only in the pretest and the individual motions test. Slides were easier to perform than either flips or turns. A majority of subjects in each group failed to perform individual motions, compositions, and inverse motions; the majority of the errors on each task came from the failure to conserve length. (DT)",

        "description":"This study was concerned with the delineation of relationships among teacher attitudes on progressive and traditional teaching ideologies, personal philosophical orientation, and the degree of individual differences in openness or closedness of belief systems among secondary and elementary teachers. Sixteen science student teachers and 54 science, English and elementary school teachers were participants in the study. Three tests, the Kerlinger Education Scale I, the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, and the Hug Philosophical Consistency Test, were taken by all participants. Multi-linear stepwise regression and analysis of variance were used to determine predictive value of life philosophy upon educational attitude and to determine differences. Significant differences between pairs of  groups were determined with t-tests. Conclusions from the study indicate life philosophy is related to educational attitude. Knowing the life philosophy would help in the formation of teaching teams and in assignment of student teachers to co-operating teachers. English teachers scored significantly different on the philosophical test; the results indicated they had greater experience with philosophy during college years than did science teachers.

Suggestions are given for ways of encouraging women to pursue the broad range of all science careers, especially those which can be identified as traditionally male. Four strategies are described as means to increase the participation of women in science careers. First, educators should modify their own behavior or alter school practices which perpetuate outmoded myths about specific roles for women. Secondly, supplemental curriculum materials should portray women in a variety of science career roles.  Science educators must encourage women into those science and math courses which have been avoided by too many women which will enable them to pursue collegiate science majors. Another strategy would be to acquaint women of all school ages with women already pursuing high level science careers, and the final strategy, a basic need for opening up the broad range of all careers for all women.

Thirty elementary schools in a 25 county area were studied and data gathered via multiple choice questionnaires and personal interviews. Thirty-one secondary schools were randomly selected from those located in the 25 counties comprising the northeast corner of Missouri. A Basic Secondary Questionnaire was given to 65 secondary teachers, with 34 being randomly selected from this group to complete an in-depth teacher interview. Principals and/or superintendents of the participating secondary schools also completed a Secondary Administrative Questionnaire. Teacher and administrator factors were identified as  affecting implementation of innovative programs. Data and results are presented separately for each of the two major educational levels.

Forty girls, 11-12 years old, were randomly assigned to one of four instructional situations: (1) subjects talk aloud while doing mathematical activities and then are silent, (2) subjects are silent while doing the activities and afterwards answer questions and explain findings, (3) subjects verbalize both during and after the activities, and (4) subjects do not verbalize either during or after the activities. A machine  wired to embody the Klein-Four Group structure was used as a manipulative aid. Among the results found were: (1) subjects performed better, retained more and discovered more rules when they were silent while doing the activities and afterwards answered questions and explained findings; (2) there was significant interaction between learning and questioning; (3) the subjects' overt verbalization during questioning did not accelerate learning; and (4) the nature of the rule and the number of discovered rules influenced performance.

Emphasis is given to the thinking processes of young children and the provision for many opportunities to engage in creative thinking. Each instructional module (1) lists all required materials; (2) provides 10-15 learning experiences organized with a statement of content, required material, behavioral objectives, focusing questions, and overview; and (3) suggests supplementary  experiences. The teacher's guide describes and illustrates teaching strategies based on three cognitive tasks--concept formation, interpretation of data, and application of principles--and on productive-divergent thinking behaviors.

In sections 2 and 3, the author discusses the Skinnerian and Rogerian theories by selecting and explicating key elements and delineating the general, comprehensive, theoretical position of each. Sections 4 and 5 present each man's thoughts on education. Chapters 6 and 7 infer some of the issues and problems if each theory were accepted totally and applied to a real social setting. Chapter 8 contains conclusions and implications of the study. The main conclusion is that both Skinner's and Roger's models have their merits, but an educator cannot value both of them equally without creating an inconsistency within his professional practice. A reasonable approach might be  to consider either set of theories only in selected and limited educational situations. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The primary argument of this paper is that student political attitudes are a function of historical and politcal inputs acting on their attitudinal structure. Around 1970 the proportion of students supporting leftist causes reached a peak and began declining. Attitude surveys among students at the University of Oregon in 1970 and at Arizona State University in 1973 indicated this change in student attitudes while representing the inherent differences between the two schools. If the structure of student attitudes remains constant, the political effects of Watergate will increase student support for leftist causes. A new factor, and one that may change the attitudinal structure somewhat, is the declining level of disagreement between parents and students. Since disagreement with  parents is closely related with support for demonstrations, declining disagreement with parents suggests that an increase in support among students for leftist causes may not be associated with the traditional forms of student activism.

Doctoral dissertations and mainstream academic journals in political science, economics, anthropology, geography, sociology, and history were examined for topics dealing with Western Europe. In addition, programs and organizations on both campus and national levels which deal with Western Europe and Western European language training for nonlanguage specialists were analyzed. The assumption that the number of scholars in the United States whose interests and research deal primarily with Western Europe is considerably greater than those whose work focuses on other areas of the world proved to be wrong.

This relative lack of interest represents efforts on the part of the educational system to heighten the international character of higher education.

        "description":"A program developed by the Center for International Studies (CIS) at Cornell, focusing on world-based, political problems was evaluated for the ongoing improvement of the program. Of particular interest was whether the program was meeting its characterized goals of interdisciplinary content, problem orientation, and team teaching at the introductory level for undergraduates. The &quot;Context-Input-Process-Product&quot; evaluation model chosen to assess the program relied on data collected from student questionnaires and ratings, course and program documents, grading data, interviews with faculty, and observations of course activities. The results of the evaluation presented descriptively, begin with a history of CIS and the development of the program. A description of the character of the  courses, then, indicates a change in the focus of the program as it progressed. The six courses are now more aptly characterized as being specialized, advanced, international studies courses. Suggestions for continuation of the program take these changes into consideration. A bibliography and appendixes containing data collected and important aspects of each course complete the report. (JH)",

Two hundred and two social studies teachers from 24 public high schools in Missouri served as a sample population. The survey instrument contained questions on political involvement and various personal background characteristics. The results indicated that Missouri social studies teachers valued liberalism over conservatism; decentralization of government power over centralization; a controlled economy over a free economy; individually regulated birth control measures over government regulation; concern for underpriviledged groups over self-concern; dissent over acquiescence; and concern for domestic welfare over maintenance of national prestige. The social studies teachers who are older, have  taught a greater number of years, belong to a greater number of professional organizations, and have an undergraduate major in history have a greater amount of political involvement and tend to be more liberal than conservative.

The program kit consists of a teacher's guide which provides an overview; separate teacher's guides for social studies, science, and industrial arts; a student booklet of readings; and a wall chart. Each of the components can be used independently of the other. The program is intended to introduce students to the problem of solid waste disposal and to involve them in doing something about it. Teaching strategies involve the student in community studies, research, and classroom discussion. The teacher's guide and the student book are available in this document. For other components of the program see the related  documents listed in the descriptive note. The teacher's guide discusses the need for teaching about solid waste disposal and the approach to content used in the program. It also describes the six components of the program, the unit topics, and specific objectives and presents information on environmental careers and industrial resources.

Diversification as opposed to expansion is currently being tried in many countries because of the traditional university's lack of pedagogical leadership. The working party wished to investigate this trend, particularly on the following points: new types of institutions, problems of mobility between one institution and another, guidance for students, access to tertiary education, training and recruitment of university teachers, planning concepts at the university and national levels, and curricular reform and development. In  the first part of their report the aims, resources, and implication of diversification are explored. This theoretical discussion is illustrated with case studies in the second part, which also includes the members' reactions to the fundamental issues involved. Recommendations from the working party include the monitoring of ongoing experiments and continued research into tertiary educational experiments for the benefit of all the member nations. (JH)",

The survey examined the academic backgrounds of the teachers, their preparation in economics, the extent and nature of course offerings in economics, and the types of programs which the teachers would like to have available in order to help them become more effective and proficient teachers of economics. The results indicated that only 5 percent of the 241 who returned the questionnaires had undergraduate majors in economics.  Sixty-four percent of the teachers responding indicated that they would like to further their knowledge in economics. The measurement of the extent of high school course offerings in economics showed that economics is generally not offered as a required course. Rather it is often taught as an elective course or as part of a general social studies course. (Author/DE)",

Issues in the report deal with major achievements and shortcomings of high schools; ways in which these institutions meet or fail to meet individual and societal needs; new directions in which these institutions must move to meet the problems of adolescent education; and the role that the federal government should play in promoting change. The two-year study found that the United States has nearly succeeded in the pursuit of the egalitarian aim of universal secondary education. Today, however, despite the fact that adolescents mature physically two years sooner than their  grandparents, schools as an instructional imperative tend to prolong dependence. As a result, we have succeeded in producing a youth society housed in an overburdened institution excessively isolated from the reality of the community and the adult world. This isolation has negative effects with respect to fundamental education and civic goals. The latter half of the publication contains summarized results of the panel's 16 months of discussion, providing valuable substance of the 24 commissioned papers that bear on the education of adolescents and the way they live today.

(6) What issues are discussed in social studies classes? (7) How can parents help their children in the social studies? The answers emphasize that social studies focus on people, the world, and the relationship between these two and that, in consequence of this broad scope, social studies have expanded outside of the traditional history courses to include all of the social science disciplines. Social studies also emphasize skill in the thinking processes, not just in  the acquisition of facts, and in freedom to inquire openly. Examples of ways in which parents can help their children with social studies include encouraging their children to express their own ideas at home; subscribing to at least two periodicals with differing points of view; taking an active part in PTA; going with their children to political, economic, or social events; and maintaining their faith in the ability of human beings to solve their problems.

Favorable impressions gained by the mission members include the  growth and development of nurseries and kindergartens, dignity and respect between boys and girls, cooperation of industry with schools, and an emphasis on foreign language instruction. Less favorably noted are the lack of emphasis in the humanities, lack of instruction on other economic systems and societies, and other aspects of their uniform society. An appendix includes the studies required for various specialities at the Pedagogical Institutes and &quot;Soviet Educational Reorganization for 1959-1963.&quot; (JH)",

        "description":"In spite of attempts to destigmatize themselves with the \"black is beautiful\" rhetoric, efforts by Americans of African descent to disavow their imputed inferiority have not been successful. The black is reacted to as a handicapped person by the white American. Whites look with disdain on black-white sexual relationships, black language, and culture. They discriminate against blacks in housing, education, employment, religion, and criminal justice. The effect of these responses on the self-concept of the rejected black person is self-hatred, because consciously and unconsciously the dominant person's acceptance means so much to him. The most direct way to remove self-hatred in black Americans is to excise racism in the society at large. (Author/DE)",

The course begins with a discussion and lesson on basic design. Twelve projects--pen practice, geometric landscape, color theory and application, two small color roughs plus one comprehensive layout, introduction to printers' materials, television titling card, travel or resort ad, teaser ad, silk screen project, book jacket, scratchboard, and photographs and tint block--in illustrating, lettering,  layout, screens, keyline, and mechanical art are outlined.

        "description":"Because economic geography is viewed as a field with too many different aspects for one person to master, teaching an introductory course in the subject poses the challenge of selecting an organizing theme. One specific approach, organized around higher level generalizations and theories, is the use of location theory. Coupling location theory with the trend toward problem solving can result in the theme of the locational analysis of welfare economics. Welfare economics, which is the evaluating and ranking of economic alternatives open to society, is a topic in need of research but available to classroom consideration in part because of its interest to students. Examples of use of this theme range from the simple question of where ice cream vendors should stand on the beach for  the greatest benefit to their customers to the location of a factory for the greatest benefit to the immediate population and to society as a whole. In the footnotes economic geography texts and materials, some of which use the locational theory approach, are cited. (JH)",

The evaluation asks how close the relationship is between ethnography as defined in anthropology and the classroom ethnographic approach presented by Shaver and Larkins, and how viable the need is to generate field theory to advance the cause of social studies research. The domain of ethnography, its relationship with theory, the level of insight it is designed to achieve, and the problem of cultural perspective are areas discussed in relation to the study of the social studies classroom. Two of the major premises of the Shaver and Larkins proposal on classroom ethnography are examined to see how much is known about the teaching  and learning process in social studies and whether ethnography can generate the kind of theory that is needed. It is concluded that ethnography is not suited to the purpose of formulating middle range theory in the area of psychology of the instructional process, but that researchers might apply it to examine social education within the context of the culture at large.

The conference first considered two key themes: What Is A World-Minded Individual? and What Is A World-Minded Institution? Examples of internationalizing education in four countries--Sweden, Poland, France, and the United States--were then discussed. Group sessions concentrated on teaching in a global and development framework, institutional support for such teaching, and the need for society as a whole to help such teaching occur.

The first article in this issue, Ian Shelton's &quot;The Sociology of Everyday Life,&quot; describes an experimental short course in secondary sociology. The course is designed to produce an understanding of sociological methods and methodological problems through first hand investigations of the taken-for-granted rules which underpin all everyday life. The second article, &quot;The Place of International Relations in Training Teachers of World Studies,&quot; by Peter Bradshaw and Norbert Briemann, purports the usefulness of international relations as an area of study from which teachers can derive an understanding of contemporary world  society. The third article, Roland Meighan's &quot;How Do You Start...?&quot; suggests using attitude scales, self-assessment schedules, and questionnaires to test the adequacy of students'&quot;common sense&quot; ideas about social behavior. Examples given assess attitudes toward immigration, communications, national stereotypes, and crime. A special interview with the chief of &quot;A&quot; level sociological exams explores the new syllabus to prepare secondary students for examination as well as the history of the exam, first instituted in 1965. Book review and correspondence sections complete the issue. (Author/JH)",

Reformers believed that two things needed to be done to change curriculum: (1) develop higher quality materials, and (2) educate teachers in new subject matter which they were being asked to teach. To meet these needs, extensive projects developed new materials in the social sciences. Teachers participated in summer and academic-year institutes offering courses in content. For various reasons, however, the hoped-for marriage between subject matter competency and appropriate uses of the new curricula did not occur. If curriculum is to change, new approaches to teacher inservice programs need to be developed making the variety of new social science curricula  the major focus of inservice activities. In addition, teachers need to learn the skills necessary for creative adaptation of the curricula to local community settings. Listed characteristics of successful programs and procedures to enhance the chances for a successful inservice program for teachers help insure curriculum change. (Author)",

The following characteristics of American education with particular relevance for education in developing nations have been organized as inputs, structures and strategies, and outputs. Inputs to the system of American education, defined in an historical context, include sociocultural pragmatism vs. long-range planning; centralization vs. decentralization; and democratic vs. elite education. Innovative structures and strategies provide the following: (1) new ways of perceiving the educational process, for instance the accountability movement; (2) new housing for education, such as open classrooms; (3) new values--humanistic vs. manpower; (4) expanded participation in the  educational decision-making process by students, professionals, parents, and other interest groups; (5) variety in instructional level organization, including the nongraded approach; (6) learning how to learn; and (7) examination of the process of educational change itself. The output of American education is no longer being absorbed by the society. More emphasis on humanistic programs could counteract this situation. Human experience with educational problems should be incorporated into a world information pool on education strategies. (JH)",

Each of 16 class sessions is divided into self-contained learning activities or into large group sessions, addressed to particular behavioral objectives, depending on the needs of the subject matter. Students are made aware of exactly which objectives are to be attained at  each activity. Various types of audio and visual aids are used in the activities. The effect of team teaching is accomplished with the help of social science education majors in the planning and presentation of session activities. Evaluation of course mastery indicates that students learned at a level comparable to that in traditional courses. Students evaluated the course favorably. (JH)",

The program content covers four skill areas including the inquiry method, class questioning techniques, values clarification, and class discussion techniques. The suggested training design outline contains suggestions for determining program content, program structure, program climate, and detailed list of activities and questions dealing with subject content of the four skill areas. The program structure incorporates the use of microteaching and lesson design presentation as a means of having the teachers experience and  practice the instructional skills as opposed to discussing them. The program climate emphasizes process-oriented teaching and the importance of feedback in learning and understanding the skill areas. A concluding unit requires the teachers to specifically indicate their strategies for integrating the new skills into their classrooms. (Author/DE)",

Its purpose is to establish a separate identity for high school psychology teachers by tracing the growth and documenting the breadth of present-day psychology at the secondary school level. The focus is on distinguishing between the needs of the college professor and the high school psychology teacher. Discussion is limited primarily to high school psychology courses, where most curriculum development efforts and enrollment increases have occurred. A few efforts at the elementary and junior high school levels are also mentioned. A brief history of the field and documentation of the rapid growth in recent years are reviewed. Next, some of the philosophical issues behind the teaching of psychology below  college are considered. The main issue of contention is whether personal development or substantive knowledge of psychology as a discipline should be the primary goal. The last two sections are devoted to the primary areas in which the philosophical issues have had an impact: instructional approaches and teacher training. (Author/KSM)",

Janet Hanley's \"Success or Failure in Curriculum Development: Six Ways to Know\" provides a set of review questions for curriculum developers to help insure a successful course. A. D.

Hyman Kavett emphasizes the importance of teachers' enthusiasm, willingness to make bold decisions, and ability to cooperate with other teaching colleagues in curriculum development. Frithjof Bergmann's report on a visit to the Berea Community School in Kentucky justifies a program emphasizing respect for the individual  student's development and initiative. David Tyack's paper \"Ask Yourself About the Humanities,\" is a set of questions for private pondering and public discussion in the preparation of a humanities curriculum. John Ratte's report of several days of brainstorming on the development of a humanities curriculum to examine values, culture, and their interrelationship reveals the nature of the development process.

        "description":"The National Humanities Faculty working papers in this document represent reports of faculty participation in humanities projects around the country and emphasize program content that might be useful to teachers developing their own humanities programs. Arleigh D. Richardson's report is a description of the program he visited and is written by the teachers who developed it. The program, geared for the average student, stresses the interrelated and values content of the humanities. The result of John Cawelti's visit to a black, inner-city school is a detailed model for an 11th grade course, \"Who We Are,\" that would involve the whole student. Roland B. Kimball, after visiting a Connecticut high school, suggests an outline and activities for a 9th grade humanities program that  centers on the life of the students' community. John Anthony Scott's report on the theme and content of an American studies course is a specific program with a human and historical orientation to be implemented by integrating literature with historical topics. John Cawelti contributes another paper: his thoughts on the construction of an integrated curriculum that would develop the basic analytic and interpretive skills of the social studies, science, and the humanities, independently, and then set up problems requiring the interworking of the different skills.

        "description":"These National Humanities Faculty working papers are presentations from the Question of Authority Workshop. Frithjof Bergmann's &quot;The Logic of Freedom&quot; distinguishes two approaches to the concept of freedom--that freedom is the ultimate good and that freedom is a burden. A theory of freedom is constructed in the second part of Bergmann's presentation. It states that an act is free if the agent identifies with the element from which it flows; it is coerced if the agent disassociates himself from that generating element. This theory requires identification or self-knowledge prior to freedom. Leon Sinder contributes &quot;What Makes an American an American&quot; and &quot;The Authority of Biosocial Factors.&quot; American culture is delineated in the first presentation according to an underlying system  of American values. Some of those values are puritanism, efficiency, and the ideal of the man of action. The biosocial factors that exert authority on man, chosen for discussion in the second presentation, include not only requirements common to all living things, such as reproduction, but also those more peculiar to man, such as the need to belong, the passage of time, the will to power, and conservatism. Societal and individual accomodation of these biosocial factors is also considered. (JH)",

The survey consisted of 2,000 personal interviews held in more than 100 geographical areas and conducted by high school seniors under direct faculty supervision. The study raised questions concerning student attitudes toward school and home, as well as reactions to the social, political, and economic environment of the day. Among the results are the following: (1) youth acknowledge the importance of education and approve of the way high schools are providing that education; (2) a majority feel that good student-teacher interaction exists in their schools; (3) almost all think that year-round,  part-time work should be a part of student activities; (4) regarding their futures, the students are extremely determined and ambitious; (5) students have grand salary expectations; (6) happiness and family life are valued as vital elements to a complete and satisfying life; and (7) primary concerns of students during the next five years will consist of completing their education, finding jobs, marriage, and raising a family.

First, results of a number of research studies conducted by the authors are reviewed. Among the conclusions, it is shown that men generally view women more positively than whites view blacks, that sexism appears to be more of a reluctance to view men and women outside traditional roles than it is a negative feeling, and that perceptions of sex roles seem to be critical in understanding the relationships between black and white cultures. Secondly, the sequential stages of the model are outlined. These include identifying racial and sexual differences, understanding racism and how it operates, examining racist attitudes and their sources, and establishing what and how behavior can  be changed. The model emphasizes the results of actions of those attempting change rather than the actions themselves and relies on the participation of minority and majority group members as change agents.

Visual anthropology is conceptualized as the study of human nonlinguistic forms of communication involving film making for data collecting and analysis. Several areas of research are suggested which include studies of human interpersonal behavior such as greeting, interviewing, and teaching; macro-units of human behavior such as rituals, ceremonies, artistic processes, socialization practices, subsistence patterns, and warfare; and films themselves as societies increasingly begin to produce their own sets of mass mediated messages for culture and communication. Courses are set up for three levels  starting at the beginning undergraduate, undergraduate major, and graduate level. At the undergraduate and beginning graduate level emphasis is placed on studying cultures and communications in their verbal and nonverbal forms. Appropriate methodologies and film production techniques for research and fieldwork are emphasized for the advanced graduate student. Special emphasis is placed on the fact that a department does not need a large budget and expensive equipment to start developing courses in visual anthropology. (DE)",

The purpose was to determine if those perceptions were related to the potential adopters' attitudes toward the innovations and to adoption of innovations, and if relative advantage, compatability, trialability, observability, and complexity are useful concepts to help predict the degree to which social studies innovations will be adopted. Principals of 250 high schools in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia received a New Social Studies Materials List and a Materials Information Questionnaire. Statistical analyses performed on the data from the completed questionnaires indicated that potential adopters tended to come  from more urban and suburban communities, that there is correlation between perceptions and attitudes, but that little correlation exists between perceptions and adoption and between attitudes and adoption. Attitudes were shown to be influenced by observability and compatability. The New Social Studies Materials List, Materials Information Questionnaire, and tables of data are included. (Author/KSM)",

After a brief historical review, the author discusses four basic accreditation problems: (a) the need to allow for institutional differences; (b) the need to base decisions on substance rather than on form, (c) the need to determine the actual qualifications of the graduate, and (d) the need to determine the focus or function of accreditation. Institutional statements of objectives for teacher education are frequently vague and provide little guidance for the accrediting team. The objectives of one institution are examined in detail to illustrate these problems. Performance-based teacher education, which requires the explicit definition of  expected competencies, could help to move accreditation toward being based on elements of substantive achievement and could encourage a rethinking of admissions criteria. Finally, the two purposes of accreditation are considered; whether it should be used to identify institutions which meet a minimum set of standards or to stimulate institutions to improve their programs significantly.

        "description":"This speech begins with the presentation of a conceptual scheme of the physical working capacity of a person starting a training program. The scheme shows that after exercise, when recovery begins and sufficient time elapses, the individual recovers and adapts to a level of physical working capacity which is higher than his starting level. From this scheme it is shown that a light workout produces faster recovery but a lesser degree of adaptation to a higher level; a strenuous workout that allows insufficient time for recovery before exercising again might impair the individual's physical working capacity. For an exercise session for cardiopulmonary conditioning for deconditioned or pathological adults, the following is recommended: a warmup, a stimulus period, and a cool-down  composed for the most part of aerobic exercises (exercises which utilize energy which is liberated mainly through aerobic rather than anaerobic pathways). It is stated that during the stimulus period the individual should moderate his heart rate so that his heart stays within the \"target zone\"; the use of the heart rate in this manner provides a built-in barometer of relative exercise stress that is independent of the person's fitness level and requires the individual to perform a higher intensity of work to achieve his heart rate as his fitness improves. Charts and diagrams are referred to in the text and appear as appendixes. (JA)",

Group one consisted of 22 liberal arts program graduates with no professional education courses. Group two consisted of 38 liberal arts bachelor degree recipients with education courses but without student teaching, and group three consisted of 40 graduates of a bachelor of science in education program. The sample was stratified to include an equal number of different majors in each group. Principals of the beginning teachers were asked to rate them according to a 20-item beginning teacher rating scale. The author concludes that there is a significant difference in principals' ratings of beginning teachers in terms of professional education preparation, but  there is no significant difference in terms of other types of academic preparation, in terms of personality characteristics, or in terms of physical or emotional health.

        "description":"This study determines effects of posthypnotic suggestions in dealing with attitudinal impediments of students performing the overhand volleyball serve. Subjects were 54 male and female college students enrolled in beginning volleyball. Subjects were assigned either to a control or to an experimental group. After four class sessions, a 10-trial pretest on the overhand volleyball serve was administered to both groups. Points were awarded according to distance from the net, with a back court serve receving the highest point value. The test was repeated after nine additional class periods. Prior to this repeated test, the experimental group had been hypnotized three times. During the repeated test session, these subjects were hypnotized for the fourth time. In this state the subjects  were given the suggestion that their performance ability would be increased and that they would perform with confidence and ease when they served the volleyball. The subjects were then aroused and instructed to serve 10 volleyballs. The control subjects were also instructed to serve 10 volleyballs. After nine ensuing class sessions, a posttest was performed by both groups. Results indicate that hypnotic suggestions enabled these students to overcome their mental impediments in learning the overhand volleyball serve and that it is possible for verbalizations of the hypnotic type to accelerate skill development under such conditions as described in this study.

Subproblems were to determine how stride length and stride rate are affected by changes in skating velocity, to ascertain whether the basic assumption that stride length accurately approximates horizontal movement of the center of gravity during each stride is valid, and to identify some of the fundamental differences in skating stride between above- and below-average performers. Groups of five skaters performing at three different velocities were filmed. Each subject performed three trials at each of a maximum and two submaximal speeds. Graphic and statistical analyses were used to determine performance trends and the statistical significance of  differences in performance parameters. Analysis of the data revealed that stride rate increased as a function of horizontal velocity for both levels of performers. No apparent trends were found for stride length in relation to velocity. Above-average skaters exhibited higher stride rates, longer stride lengths, and longer glide phases than did skaters of below-average ability. Also, above-average performers displayed less flexion of the lower leg, and, consequently, vertical displacement of the foot was less during the recovery phase of the ice skating stride. (Author)",

It provides a descriptive baseline of data on high school football injuries upon which to design and evaluate further analytic and experimental study. During the 1968 football season, a pilot study was performed a) to determine if the interview items were yielding the desired information, b) to provide a training opportunity for interviewers, and c) to establish a workable schedule for interview visits to participating schools. During the study years 1969-1972, data were obtained from 8,776 student athletes  at 43 schools. Of this number 4,287 were injured. Raw data were classified, coded, and placed in computer-acceptable form for analysis. Principal findings are summarized that relate to distribution of injuries; environmental variables; host variables; activity at time of injury; the agent of the injury; coaches' background and experience; and data related to type, condition, and fit of protective equipment. Data upon which to implement countermeasures to protect the student athlete from harm are included.

        "description":"This study investigates the relative effects of thermal applications of varying temperatures on the flexibility of specified joints. Subjects were 14 male college students ranging in age from 17 to 22 years with no previous joint injury or orthopedic disability. Each subject became familiar with the experimental design and was asked not to engage in any strenuous physical activity during the experiment. During the 8-week testing period, each subject reported at a prescribed time and was seated on a table for testing with the body and joints in a standardized position to evaluate the amount of joint motion. The test administrator measured ankle flexion and wrist flexibility and manipulated all movements while the subject remained as passive as possible. Experimental conditions  consisted of cold and hot water treatments. To determine the effects of the varying temperatures, an analysis of variance was conducted on the change scores (post-immersion score minus pre-immersion score) using a 2x3 (temperature x time of immersion) factorial arrangement of treatment with repeated measures across both factors. Results indicate that cold water applications failed to affect range of joint motion at either the wrist or the ankle and that the range of motion at the wrist can be enhanced by immersion of the joint in hot water.

Selected scales of the Jesness Inventory were administered (value orientation, alienation, denial, and occupational aspiration) at the beginning of the program to 66 11-year-old boys enrolled in a 1971 program at a large southwestern university. Measures of occupational aspiration were taken by categorizing responses to open-ended questions, in accordance with Hollingshead's Two-Factor-Index of Social Position scale. A large proportion of this sample were either Mexican-American in origin or black. The students constituted the entire population of 11-year-olds in the program (males). The data were analyzed using an IBM 36-65 computer.  Step-wise multiple discriminant analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that boys who fail to complete the program have a more delinquent psychosocial profile than boys who complete the program. Group 1, those who completed the program, was composed of 27 boys; Group 2, those who failed to complete the program, was composed of 39 boys. Analysis of data supported the hypothesis. The conclusion that the problem lies in the psychological characteristics of the participants is not entirely satisfactory. The use of team sports in the program might result in alienation of the participants on a smaller scale similar to the alienation they experience in the larger social-cultural system. (JA)",

All runners were also tested in the 220, 440, 880, one-mile, and two-mile running events. Oxygen uptake was significantly related only to time in the one-mile run. Heart rates (HRs) at each submaximal load on the treadmill were significantly related to time in the one-mile run. For the two-mile run, HR at every submaximal load but one were significantly related to time. In these events, the runners with the lower treadmill submaximal HRs tended to do better. Conversely, in the 220-yard run higher submaximal HR seemed to be associated with lower times. However, the correlation coefficients were generally not quite significant.  These data suggest that distance runners are characterized by high parasympathetic tone while sprinters are characterized by greater sympathetic tone. Furthermore, for this sample of subjects submaximal HR was better than maximal oxygen uptake as a predictor of distance running performance. (Author/PD)",

Forty-three tests of physical size and fine and gross motor skills were administered to a stratified random sample of children who attended the public schools of Battle Creek, Michigan in 1969. The sample involved 100 boys and girls, respectively, at each of the three grades (total N=600). Intercorrelations of the test items were determined by grade and sex, and the intercorrelation matrices were subjected to factor analysis. The principal components solutions were extracted and rotated according to the Varimax Criterion proposed by Kaiser. Differences in the factor structures were noted between sexes and grade levels. In general, the factors that  accounted for most of the total variance across the three grades were body structure (height and breadth), body size (girths and skinfolds), gross hand-eye coordination, fine hand-eye coordination, static balance, dynamic balance, grip strength, coordination of gross movements, and ocular coordination. A 19-item bibliography is included, and statistics regarding body size, body structure, hand-eye coordination, gross motor coordination, dynamic balance, static balance, ocular coordination, grip strength, rating of aggression, and social development are appended.
