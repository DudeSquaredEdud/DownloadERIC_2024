        "description":"A group supportive testing procedure and acculturation level are investigated as to their influence upon achievement test scores of 150 culturally diverse inner city school students in grades four through six. The group supportive testing procedure was specifically designed as a facilitation strategy that attempted to mirror the more typical interaction style of minority children. The multidimensional measure of acculturation sought to elucidate whether students with particular acculturation profiles would present a particular test-taking performance. The experimental facilitative procedure employed did not improve either the Anglo or Mexican American children's test performance. The authors state (1) that minority group children should be administered group achievement tests  under standard administration procedures, and (2) a student's sociocultural status, at least socioeconomic status and family size, appears to be a potentially relevant psychological construct that warrants further attention.

        "description":"The Louisiana Round Table of Program Evaluators was organized in 1980 among educational evaluators from large parish school systems and the State Department of Education to discuss topics of mutual concern. Since its inception the group has been instrumental in the development and implementation of various workshops directed toward the improvement of educational evaluation across the State. On November 4-5, 1982, the Round Table presented a Statewide training workshop for local program evaluators and compensatory education coordinators in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The two-day program focused on evaluation design, instrument development, and evaluation report writing. A theoretical local school system compensatory education program was used as a case study upon which the various  activities were focused. Approximately 130 local school systems and 40 State Department personnel were in attendance during the two-day workshop. This monograph presents the information determined necessary within the report writing phase of the training. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"In an attempt to increase the usefulness of future National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) findings, yet retain the usefulness of past assessments, a framework for the conduct of assessments is presented. This framework is supported by agreement on three major goals, by overall methods for reaching those goals, and by firm concepts of how these goals and methods affect the interrelated phases of assessment work. The three most basic purposes that NAEP should serve over the next five years are: (1) NAEP should provide the basis for a highly credible and useful national report card, (2) NAEP should improve the utility of assessment results for educational policymakers and practitioners, and (3) NAEP should improve the utility of assessment methodology to states and local  education agencies. A discussion, on a conceptual level, indicates how the Educational Commission of the States believes NAEP should gather, process, and transmit information and how electronic technology can support these efforts. Generally excluded from this overview of assessment design are the yet to come detailed descriptions of specific assessment activities.

        "description":"The potential of item response theory (IRT) for solving a number of testing problems in the Maryland Functional Reading Program would appear to be substantial in view of the many other promising applications of the theory. But, it is well-known that the advantages derived from an IRT model cannot be achieved when the fit between an item response model and the test data of interest is less than adequate. The principal purpose of the research reported in this paper was to investigate the fit of the one-, two-, and three-parameter logistic models to the test results obtained from the administration of the 1982 Maryland Functional Reading Test (MFRT). The evidence addressing model-data fit seemed clear: a two-parameter logistic model was able to adequately account for examinee  performance on the MFRT. The one-parameter model could not handle the substantial variation among test items in their discriminating power. The three-parameter model improved the fit only slightly because of the minimum amount of guessing on the test. Several suggestions were offered in the paper for conducting goodness-of-fit investigations. (Author)",

It is intended to increase understanding of the process of evaluation utilization, showing how evaluation findings and other kinds of information can work together, over time and in a variety of ways, to influence decision making. The Van Leer Study provided a comprehensive review of three major areas: resources and their allocation among the different types of Israeli public schools; student achievement in reading, arithmetic, Biblical studies, geography, and science; and home and school variables associated with achievement. The study was designed for multiple clienteles and was reported in a variety of formats. When released, the  evaluation report generated considerable controversy among its major audiences. The ultimate impacts of the lengthy report were that the various groups were led to a closer examination of the issues; that a number of Parliamentary recommendations were made; that a variety of program changes were initiated at the Ministry of Education; that additional research in the form of replication studies and supplementary analyses resulted; and that further study is currently ongoing.

Under study are the technical aspects and methods associated with the reporting of objective-referenced data. An exploration is then made into the use of patterns of errors in responding to basic skills test items to possibly improve various score reporting processes. In addition, the feasibility of using these patterns to construct instructionally equivalent test forms is discussed. Finally, an approach is presented to project budget requirements and allocation of resources in school districts or states in which instructional remediation is a corollary of a basic skills assessment program. This work is geared to the needs of planners of statewide or  districtwide basic skills assessment programs and to other people such as students, parents, and teachers who would benefit from test interpretations which are detailed yet simple. Procedures which enhance the identification of weaknesses in the acquisition of basic skills, particularly among disadvantaged students, will undoubtedly contribute to the mission of testing for instructional purposes and for program evaluation.

        "description":"This study evaluates the impact of the basic core course offerings, as mandated by the Montgomery County, Maryland, Board of Education. In 1981, the Board adopted 19 basic core courses, identifying specific courses in the schools' curriculum that must be offered to all high school students and setting the enrollment guide for the courses. The decision was made in order to enhance the efficacy of countywide programming. The study contains information on the impact of the resolution on course offerings, course enrollment, staffing, class size, policies, and practices. It concludes that: (1) all high schools in the county complied to a great extent with the resolution; (2) senior high schools offered more basic core courses than before; (3) the new requirements had little effect on  staffing and staff use; (4) overall class size remained the same in the schools in their implemention of basic core requirements; (5) previous policy decisions, such as the movement toward grades 9-12 versus 10-12 senior high schools and loss of the seven-period day, did not adversely affect implementation of the basic core; and (6) the Board's efforts to improve class size in some courses by mandating minimum sizes in others had more negative than positive effects because students could be deprived of course opportunities by the deletion of small sections.

The philosophy of the program, which was conducted at Walton High School in the Bronx (New York City), was one of transition, equipping students with the language skills, career awareness and orientation, and general skills necessary for smooth transition from school to the job market. Program staff provided instructional and support services and staff development activities. Evaluation of the program's second year achievement data indicated that many of the program objectives were  met by participating students, particularly in the areas of English syntax, native language arts, and social studies, and that the attendance rate among participants was higher than the school-wide rate. Many of the noninstructional activities (resource and curriculum development, academic and career counseling, and staff development) were also judged to be successful. The evaluation concludes with several recommendations, focusing on: (1) establishment of a resource center; (2) systematic followup of participants who are mainstreamed; (3) the need for a bilingual secretary; and (4) revision and modification of the program's proposed scope.

This report represents results of an evaluation of the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)/Bilingual services offered during 1981-82. The first phase focuses on the entry/exit testing process, and was designed to evaluate the individual instruments used for testing as well as the entry/exit testing process in general. The entry assessment battery utilized consisted of three instruments: the Language Assessment Scale (LAS), the Minimum English Competency Test (MEC), and the Entry Teacher Evaluation interview. The exit battery consisted of a parallel form of the MEC, the LAS, and the Exit Teacher Evaluation. Major  objectives of the evaluation were to determine: (1) the validity of the MEC as an entry/exit assessment of students' English proficiency; (2) whether parts of the battery are redundant; and (3) the reliability and validity of the overall testing process. It was found that: (1) test scores on the MEC and the nationally validated LAS are similar, suggesting that the MEC is a valid measure of English skills for Hispanic students in MCPS; (2) MEC scores successfully correlate with classroom performance; (3) the time required to administer the LAS is probably not justified, given its redundancy; and (4) regardless of their scores on the MEC, Asian students receive higher scores on the Exit Teacher Evaluation and are often mainstreamed with less proficiency than Hispanics. These findings led to  the formulation of several recommendations to improve measurement validity and reliability. (GC)",

        "description":"A sample of 160 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in a Baltimore City (Maryland) magnet school participated in an experimental study on the effects within cross-race and cross-sex friendships on a mathematics program that used Team Assisted Individualization (TAI). TAI is an instructional method that combines individualized instruction with cooperative learning. Children of different race, sex, and achievement levels worked in small teams on individualized materials. Team members depended on one another for skill checks and were encouraged to assist their teammates with problems. Members' performances counted toward a team score, and teams that met certain preset standards were rewarded. Pretest and posttest scores on two sociometric instruments and two peer rating scales  were compared with measures for a control group. Results indicated that: (1) compared to students in the control group, those in the experimental group demonstrated greater increases in cross-race friendships, and fewer rejections of peers from other races; (2) experimental group students less frequently rated students of other races or of the opposite sex as &quot;not nice&quot;; and (3) positive effects of TAI on cross-race friendships appeared to be due primarily to reductions in negative attitudes of white students toward black students.

Focusing on the interaction between the curriculum and one group, East European Jews, the paper examines: (1) what the schools were attempting to teach Jewish and other immigrant students; and (2) if and how the Jewish community in New York sought to influence the nature and content of the public education that the children were receiving. It is suggested that New York City's German Jewish leadership and the leaders of public education shared the common concern of promoting the full assimilation and integration of East European Jews into American society. The paper describes how, toward this end, both elite groups  collaborated on instructional programs designed to meet their transformational goals, and implemented the programs without ascertaining the wishes or seeking the consent of the East European Jewish community.

Specifically, an attempt was made to determine whether black and white adolescents, when given cameras, an entire school day, and complete freedom from class assignments, would select different physical and social aspects of their school environment to photograph, and if so, whether these differences were governed by classroom social role or race. Participants consisted of 82 middle level grade students from two different Florida communities, 41 of whom were identified as class clowns. Results show that: (1) no significant differences occurred between the photographs taken by clown and nonclowns, but many occurred between those of white and black adolescents; (2) the private world of the  adolescent is defined by race; (3) black students were more responsive to the people in their environment than were white students; (4) there was a difference in the perception of females by black and white males; and (5) photographs by white students tended to reflect criticism of their surroundings more than those by blacks.

First, a demographic overview of Hispanics, concentrating on population size, ethnic subgroup identity, age, economic welfare, language background, and educational attainment, is provided. The findings of recent major studies on Hispanics' learning achievement during high school are then reviewed. Following this, data compiled by the American College Testing Program, the College Entrance Examination Board, and the Graduate Record Examination Board, for college admissions of Hispanic students are analyzed and contrasted with  those of nonethnic minority examinees. Then, studies evaluating the prediction of undergraduate Hispanics' college grades and college admissions test scores are discussed, as are studies done on Puerto Rican students by the College Board Puerto Rico office. Finally, issues underlying improvement in the prediction of Hispanics' college grades and other measures of college success are synthesized for use in predicting either Hispanic students' college aptitude or college achievement. Suggestions are made for improving: (1) understanding of Hispanics' preparation for college; (2) understanding of how the college admissions process operates for Hispanic candidates; and (3) understanding of Hispanics' college experiences that affect their college achievement and the prediction of this  achievement.

Included among the major activities of the project were the following: establishment of a consortium center at Okaloosa-Walton Junior College to house a consortium to which representatives of each vocational center, community and junior college, and university in Florida's Region I district were invited; formation of an advisory committee comprised of health occupations educators and industry representatives; research on the state of the art; visits of operational models; and development of an operational plan  patterned after a similar consortium in California. Because of its readiness to start its own licensed practical nurse (LPN) and associate degree nurse (ADN) articulation program, Pensacola Junior College was chosen as the consortium pilot program. To date, combined philosophies for the LPN and ADN programs have been formulated, and curriculum revision has been started. While future plans for the continuation of the consortium's articulation project depend upon securing adequate private sector funding, it is anticipated that the other institutions of Region I will follow suit according to a timetable formulated by members of the consortium.

        "description":"A survey was conducted to determine the attitudes, perceptions, and experiences of employers of low income youth--specifically of youth between the ages of 16 and 21 who had participated in federally funded programs under the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA). Data were obtained in 1981 from the employers of 1,496 disadvantaged youth, most of whom had participated in various career development programs identified by the project staff. The largest type of employer was in the service and retail trades, while public agencies made up the next largest group. The study found that employers insisted upon entrance criteria, such as cognitive skills and personal appearance, but did not measure these skills. At the same time, it was found that most of the low-paying,  low-skilled jobs performed by youth did not require the skills that employers expected. Employers were in agreement about areas in which youth needed work preparation. Cited most frequently was an improvement in work-related attitudes and knowledge of proper behavior on the job. These items were cited much more frequently than were needs for improvement in job skills or technical education. Employers also felt that youth lacked an appropriate work ethic and that they were in need of basic educational skills. Young Employees also had higher job turnover and more lateness and absenteeism than older employees. Although employers cited these items as problems, they were not unsympathetic to the fact that the routine, low-level work performed by these youth contributed to the turnover. The  employers thought job training should have been provided by public agencies and that there should not have been a different minimum wage for youth. (KC)",

In order to assess the impact of this change upon CETA prime sponsor and private industry council (PIC) activities across the country, a telephone survey was made to all 473 CETA prime sponsors, with successful contact made with 361 prime sponsor organizations. Sixty-five prime sponsors commented that they had CETA funded activities in the upgrading and retraining program areas and provided a brief description of these activities. Some of their input was as follows: (1) 58 prime sponsor programs, representing 1,620 subsidized training slots, were reported at an average of $1,120 per slot (compared to  about $3,500 per slot nationally); (2) about 60 percent of these programs used on-the-job training as the principal method of new skill acquisition, and most of these programs used their job training staff in marketing upgraded training to the private sector; (3) 620 of the upgrading slots were in structured off-the-job classroom, shop, or clinical training situations; and (4) success rates of more than 90 percent were reported by almost all the prime sponsors both in promotion of workers who had completed training and in hiring of new employees by companies who participated in upgrading programs. (After the survey, 12 of the sites were visited; a report on each of them is included in this publication, along with a synthesis of the activities reported in terms of marketing, occupations  selected for training, clients served, and training methods used.)

During September 1978 to August 1979, projects were studied, and four broad strategies were identified. These strategies are expanded private sector involvement, career awareness, job creation through youth-operated projects, and academic credit for work experience. This report is a tentative outlining of  the strategies and their variations, with no new data reported. It outlines the distinguishing characteristics of each of the broad strategies and the alternatives available within each approach, without providing conclusions about the merits of each. (KC)",

The purpose of the study is to help those responsible for organizing youth employment programs to identify points in program design and implementation whereby the quality of the educational experience that participants will have can be increased. Five work experience programs provided written materials, observations, and interviews used for case studies in this report. The study consisted of four parts: (1) curriculum design (the set of learning activities); (2) curriculum principles (assessing the design); (3) concepts and behaviors (assessing the  content); and (4) context for implementation (the art of the practical). After examination of data from the five projects in these four areas, recommendations were made for improvements in each of these areas. (KC)",

In preparing its findings and recommendations on youth unemployment, the commission received information from the Youth Task Force; academic consultants; public and private agencies; public hearings held in Detroit, Memphis, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles; and the Vice President's Task Force on Youth Employment. The principal findings and recommendations of the commission are the following: (1) while most young people are able to make the transition from school to work without undue difficulty, many, especially minorities, high school dropouts, and low-income persons, face serious  difficulties; (2) only through intensive programs, such as the Job Corps, that provide a broad range of services including educational remediation, skill training, and placement can we hope to reverse the cumulative disadvantages that these young people have faced since birth; (3) presently available funds for disadvantaged youth should be used to encourage a closer linkage between schools and local employers; and (4) the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission should encourage employers who are seeking to expand their proportion of minority and female employees by directing them to the youth who complete remedial education and skill training; and (5) the federal government should explore the possibilities of including in contracts commitments from employers to hire job-ready  disadvantaged youth. The commission also noted that a sustained high level of general employment is necessary to provide employment for disadvantaged persons and that the country should work to increase employment levels.

Much of its efforts were directed to exploring how the coordination between federally funded economic development programs and employment and training programs could be improved in order to expand employment opportunities for the structurally unemployed in distressed urban and rural locations. The other primary thrust of the commission's work during the year was to assess how federally funded employment and training programs, in particular Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs and vocational education, could better serve the needs of disadvantaged White, Black, and Hispanic women--a high proportion of whom are trapped on welfare or have  access only to the low-paying jobs traditionally held by women. Seven recommendations were generated concerning the increase of job opportunities for the structurally unemployed through cooperation with economic development programs and changing regulations to permit such cooperation. Also included in the annual report are a chapter on the relation of monetary and fiscal policies to employment and training policies and an overview of the employment and training system. (KC)",

This report contains the commission's findings and recommendations together with the staff's report that summarizes the available knowledge of how past employment and training policies and programs have operated together with two specially prepared studies on troubled and displaced workers. After a review of literature, several studies by the commission, consultation with others, and discussions at a conference on employment and training, the commission reached the following conclusions: (1) there has been a long tradition of federal involvement in employment and training programs starting with the Morrill Act of 1862; (2) the  primary grounds for a continuing federal interest involve the contribution of employment and training programs to promoting economic growth, facilitating adjustments to labor shocks, and contributing to equal opportunity; and (3) even in the face of current and prospective federal budget cuts, the commission believes that there is a continuing federal interest in employment and training to increase the human capital of hard-to-employ youth and adults so that they will be able to participate actively in the world of work.

An introduction provides a brief review of the evolution of programmable automation and sets out several factors that influence the social and economic consequences of new technologies. Chapter 2 discusses methodology and provides background material useful for evaluating employment and working environment changes. Shortcomings of many publicized employment forecasts and requirements for satisfactory forecasts are pointed out. Chapter 3 examines the changing role of  education, training, and retraining; describes how industry and labor engage in instructional services delivery; presents current views of representatives of the industry, labor, and educational community concerning changes in instructional requirements and providers; and outlines critical issues for those engaged in instructional design and delivery, in light of possible widespread use of programmable automation. Appendixes include the methodology of a survey to identify education and training requirements inherent in the use of programmable automation, a paper on industrial relations, and six papers presented at a workshop on the analysis of labor markets and industrial relations.

No policy shift has occurred in the treatment of &quot;class action&quot; litigation, or in the &quot;pattern or practice&quot; suits in the Justice Department's Title VII enforcement activities. Significant money settlements have been obtained in &quot;pattern and practice&quot; cases on behalf of those victimized by discriminatory conduct. Statistical analyses continue to be used in determining liability, and from this it follows that the Reagan administration looks for discriminatory effects in the employment field no less than for discriminatory intent. The enforcement record over the past two-and-one-half years underscores the strength of the administration's commitment to equal employment opportunities. In  every case the Justice Department insists that the prior discrimination be enjoined and that the employer engage in nondiscriminatory hiring and promotional practices in the future. Furthermore, employers who have discriminated in employment practices are required to make affirmative action recruitment efforts. Under this approach, no resort to hiring quotas or numerical goals exists, since preferential treatment due to race or sex cuts against the grain of equal opportunity. (YLB)",

        "description":"Because self-directed learning behaviors are inherently interwoven within a foundation of lifespan cognitive and contextual characteristics, researchers must examine the theory and application of self-directed learning not just as an externally-defined or self-perceived process but also as an internal process of continual development grounded in a framework of both cognitive and human developmental psychology. The developmental perspective for examining the evolution of cognitive and affective transactions of self-directed learning suggests a three-dimensional framework. This framework would incorporate the following components: (1) specific levels of behavior and skills to engage in and complete the action of self-directed learning, (2) specific levels of cognitive complexity  necessary for the specific nature of acts of learning, and (3) specific levels of affective value toward knowledge and learning actions. This framework assumes that there are specific developmental changes caused by person-environmental interactions that must occur rather than movement influenced solely by common sense, intuitive, or environmental context for the learners. One theoretical framework for such a lifespan developmental context of self-directed learning is Dr. William Perry's scheme of cognitive and ethical development. (MN)",

        "description":"Two paths may be followed to project training needs for high technology: concentration on the employment composition of high technology industries or focus on high technology occupations. The pervasiveness of high technology occupations appears to verify the wisdom of considering total industry employment in manpower planning for high technology occupations. While there has been interest in expanding the supply of engineers and computer personnel, less has been said about manpower needs at the technician level. An adequate supply of engineering and science technicians who are trained primarily in postsecondary institutions below the baccalaureate level will be equally important to the revitalization of industry. While the state employment agency projections of the occupational  demand for engineering and science technicians in several southern states indicate a balance between supply and demand, these projections may not reflect the dynamic changes taking place. When demand for engineering and science technicians is measured on the basis of more dynamic projections--on the basis of what the demand would be if southern states were to employ the same proportion in their industries as is projected for the nation in 1990--need for expansion of training programs below the baccalaureate level for engineering and science technicians exists.

During the study, supervisors of Ohio's 10 extension areas each appraised the performance of those agents working under them who had been employed for at least 6 months but for less than 3 years. Job analysis and the technique of item selection were used to judge item availability on the form. To measure the reliability of the form, researchers utilized  Cronbach's alpha. In addition, multivariate measurement was used to determine the accuracy and relevance of the form. Because evidence indicated that the revised Performance-Against-Standard form does provide an accurate and relevant measure of employee performance, recommendations were made calling for including the form into the appraisal system of the Ohio Cooperative Extension Service.

Using a post-test only control group design, researchers administered a 35-item multiple choice test on poinsettia production to 207 students in 12 randomly selected eleventh grade vocational horticulture classes. Of the 207 students participating in the study, 90 were in the control group and 117 were in the experimental group. Before being asked to complete the test, classes in the experimental group received a series of task instruction sheets on poinsettia production along with a monograph describing the nature and use of task instruction sheets. Classes in the control group received neither the task sheets  nor the monograph. It was concluded that task instruction sheets are capable of causing significant increases in student achievement and that, as such, they should be given consideration as an important element of effective laboratory management. Based on these findings, recommendations were made calling for the integration of task instruction sheets into normal units of study included in vocational agricultural courses with extended laboratory periods and for the development of packages of such task instruction sheets in specialized vocational agricultural taxonomy areas.

        "description":"This special demonstration project was undertaken to field test and disseminate a curriculum entitled Emergency English for Refugees (EER). Designed to meet the immediate English language needs of pre- and non-literate adult refugees and immigrants, the EER is a 26-unit competency-based English-as-a-second-language (ESL) curriculum that deals with areas of competency judged necessary for survival in the daily routine of American life. During the project, the EER was field tested on a group of 41 pre- and non-literate Indochinese women of childbearing age. After compiling data from pretests and posttests administered to the women as well as from unit evaluations submitted from the EER instructor, project staff developed a revised version of the EER. Next, efforts were made to  disseminate the EER to adult basic education and ESL professionals and paraprofessionals across Pennsylvania. These dissemination efforts included a seminar on the EER curriculum and three statewide six-hour training workshops on the use of the EER. (Appended to this report are the EER curriculum; its 26 units of study; sample pretests, posttests, unit tests, and unit evaluations; and a brochure describing a videotape of the EER training workshop.)

(Authorized in 1968 to provide funding opportunities to organizations for the purpose of assisting severely disabled persons in obtaining competitive employment, the PWI program has provided support to projects that involve private sector representatives in the design of placement, training, and other services for disabled individuals.) The sources of the information for the study included interviews with persons familiar with the operation of the PWI program, a review of program documents maintained by the Rehabilitation Services Administration, and visits to seven PWI project sites around the country. Based on the information collected and analyzed in the study, the PWI projects appear generally successful in meeting  the program's goal of developing private sector linkages to assist disabled persons in achieving competitive employment, although quantitative information to verify the performance of specific projects is limited. Furthermore, no single type of organization was found to be more successful than others in accomplishing PWI goals. Rather, the diversity of organizations operating PWIs and the flexibility projects exhibited in providing services appear to be important factors in the PWI program's overall effectiveness. (MN)",

Fifteen community/technical colleges, representing 43 percent of the total enrollees in the system, and 30 major industries in North Carolina provided data through structured interviews. A literature review and an advisory group also provided input for the study. Nineteen elements were identified as being of importance to college responsiveness by both colleges and industry representatives. The top six elements identified referred specifically to college commitment, policy and/or activities, which included: (1) reliability of the institution (to do what was  promised); (2) strong personal commitment of the college president to industry training; (3) high quality of the instruction provided; (4) quick response and follow through by the institution; (5) tailoring of courses to meet specific industry needs; and (6) flexibility of the institution to meet the unusual needs of industry. A series of conceptual models was created to explain the situation and provide a means for institutions to improve in responsiveness. Recommendations were made to encourage and enhance the institutions' abilities to respond to industry needs for training. (KC)",

        "description":"Research points to numerous examples of the successes that occur when learning disabled adults are rehabilitated. For example, a study of learning disabled adults who were clients of the Arizona Division of Vocational Rehabilitation between 1975 and 1981 revealed that 64 percent of the clients had found work and remained working for two months or more. Included among the many difficulties that learning disabled adults face on the job are the following: deficient academic skills, problems learning a sequence of tasks, problems in managing time and in being on time, inefficiency and errors, clumsiness, and social skills problems. Learning disabled adults can overcome these problems. Many of them, however, need help, and many strategies are available to the vocational rehabilitation  counselor for use in helping learning disabled adults. Sometimes knowing about the disability helps the rehabilitation counselor guide clients toward a job in their area of strength. Sometimes a job can be found in which the client does so well that the employer makes accommodations in order to keep a high producer on the job. Other strategies that are useful in rehabilitating learning disabled adults include vocational evaluation, remediation of specific disabilities, social skills instruction, and psychotherapy. (A glossary of types of learning disabilities and a brief bibliography conclude the pamphlet.) (MN)",

The system includes procedures for using standards data to monitor and evaluate program performance and to assist program managers in directing their programs toward improved performance. During the last two years, the system of standards has been pretested in six model evaluation unit states. This report summarizes the results of that pretest and includes final recommendations for refinement of the system. The report is organized into 10 chapters. Following an introduction  in chapter 1, the next chapter presents an overview of the development of evaluation standards in VR, while chapter 3 deals with the uses of standards data as a tool in managing VR program operations. In the fourth chapter, the discussion of the pretest results begins, focusing on the eight performance standards, while in chapter 5 the discussion turns to the performance standards data collection forms. Chapter 6 digresses somewhat from the standards themselves to provide working illustrations of the analytic model developed for use by program managers. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 return to the standards system to examine the five procedural standards and the pretest results. Finally, chapter 10 summarizes the various changes that are recommended for the standards, data elements, and data  collection forms in order to have the most useful and effective program standards system.

This report, which is Appendix A of the analytic paradigm for management use of the Program Standards Evaluation System, contains decision trees and displays for the data elements of the revised performance standards. The report is organized as follows: (1) decision trees are summarized in table format, indicating several possible explanatory scenarios for problematic performance on the data element; and (2) displays are keyed to each table, providing interpretation at  various steps in the decision process and directing the analyst to the data elements. Most displays include a summary of the problem as defined by the relevant stage of investigation, including tests to use and norms for each data item. The tables, one for each element, show how the problem flagged by a particular element can be broken down into more specific subproblems by looking at other data items; table numbers correspond to the number of the data element in the standards system, and each table includes two or more possible scenarios that might explain problematic performance on the data element. Other displays show the logical steps summarized in the tables in more detail, introduce tests on other data elements, and compare the values of these elements with agency norms to analyze  the display problem. In addition to the data-element-related tables, two special displays describe particular situations. (KC)",

The report provides information concerning relationships among student ability, school performance, and fleet supervisory ratings for 5,811 graduates of 19 Navy &quot;A&quot; schools and three pre-&quot;A&quot; school basic courses. The graduates received training under one of three different methods of instruction: self-paced, computer-managed, or group-paced. Significant relationships were found between student ability and school performance measures. Higher-ability students completed individualized courses in less time and received higher grades than lower-ability students; however, this relationship did not hold for conventional courses. Neither of these measures was  significantly related to fleet supervisory ratings of training adequacy. Recommendations were made for resolution of problems associated with the measurement of training effectiveness. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Lateral brain research can be used to develop an understanding and appreciation of the vocational and occupational significance of black expressive behavior manifested in some blacks. Historically, employers have placed primary emphasis on cognitive abilities--functions of the left side of the brain. Research has shown, however, that the right side of the brain has the ability to acquire concepts and skills necessary for job task effectiveness. Job requirements and management styles are often prohibitive to the maintenance of good mental health in view of their stress-inducing characteristics and are unduly restrictive to black expressive behavior in the marketplace. This expressive behavior is composed of five aspects: depth of feeling, naturalistic attitudes, stylistic  renderings, poetic and prosaic language and speech, and expressive movement. Instead of trying to extinguish the expressions of core black people, educators and employers should assist them to become functionally bicultural. To decrease black unemployment, educators and job trainers need to utilize the communicative modalities of the right side of the brain in concert with those of the left to make their methods of instruction consistent with the learning style of many blacks.

In order to study the relationship between these groups, clergy from mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish churches and synagogues (N=34) and social service agency administrators in a midwestern suburb were interviewed. Examination of the data gathered in the interviews indicated that services provided by churches and synagogues fall into four basic groups: (1) religious programs, which include worship services, holiday food basket distribution, transportation to church for the elderly, and assistance for the elderly in climbing stairs; (2) pastoral care services, which include hospital visitations to seniors, nursing home visitations,  telephone reassurance, home delivered meals, general transportation, free clothing, senior clubs, and educational discussion groups; (3) the Church as host, which includes use of the church or synagogue as a nutrition site and home companion service wherein outside social service agencies borrow the building and provide staff and programming; and (4) the Church as service provider, in which the Church has actually created its own social service agency, in this case a home companion service. The results suggest that churches and synagogues have moved from providing a majority of the services for the elderly to providing support for the social service agencies, which currently provide most of the needed services. In this particular midwestern community, the church functions mainly as a  helping neighbor in an area rich in formal social service resources. (AG)",

        "description":"Although prior research has shown the importance of income and health status in predicting the decision to retire before age 65, a systematic comparision of the relative importance of social pressures to other variables important to the retirement decision has not been conducted. In order to ascertain the usefulness of the behavioral intention model in predicting early retirement decisions, and further, to compare the attitudinal and normative components of the model with the traditional predictors favoring early retirement (poor health, adequate income), male industrial workers from six major plants in a midwestern city were interviewed. Data collection included measures of intention to retire, perceived outcomes of retirement, desirability of each outcome, social pressures,  motivation to comply, income, and health status. Analyses of the data indicated that social pressures were significant predictors of retirement intentions while health and income were not significant. The strongest source of social pressure was the family; another source of pressure was the respondents' physicians. The lack of importance attached to health and income may have been due to several factors: (1) lack of variance in these dimensions in this population; (2) income status and the strong pension program of this sample; or (3) respondents' belief that companies would provide adequate pensions. The results suggest that, given the importance of the family and other social support networks for the industrial worker, retirement planning sessions should incorporate social issues such  as human relations and interpersonal communications along with the economic issues.

        "description":"Gerontological research appears to indicate that a relatively small percentage of the elderly population of the United States attends any of the nation's senior centers. In order to identify the correlates of senior center participation for a sample of elderly living in a small urban community, elderly male and female center users (N=97) and non-users (N=125) participated in personal interviews. A difference of means test for the four categories of independent variables (need, predisposing, enabling, and informal suport) indicated significant differences among users and non-users for only one variable in each of the need, enabling, and informal support rubrics. A large number of the predisposing variables showed differences between the two groups. Multivariate analyses, however,  indicated that not all these variables distinguished between center users and non-users. Reasons for participation identifired by users included something to do, invitations from friends and relatives, and a desire for company or to make friends. Major reasons for non-involvement were being too busy and lack of interest. These findings appear to support the view that a primary function of a senior center is a social one. The differences in results between the simple and multivariate analyses seem to indicate the need for multivariate data analysis. (AG)",

The methods which family  violence researchers use are detailed, indicating that survey research and quasi-experimental designs are the most common form for child abuse research; survey research is the most common method for spouse abuse research. Theories which underlie family violence research are discussed including the social/structural models which are used in foreign countries more than in the United States.

To study the development of adult day care centers in southeastern New England, and to identify the relationship of day care centers to the long term care network of services, the 11 day care centers in the catchment area of the southeastern New England Long Term Care Gerontology Center were studied (6 in Massachusetts and 5 in Rhode Island). Surveys of professional personnel and clients, and site visits were used to compare the centers in terms of physical facilities, admission criteria, participant characteristics, financial resources, staffing services and activities, and relationship with families and community activities. Results showed that all centers  admit clients regardless of living conditions, although 41% of those admitted live alone. Day care had no significant effect on nursing home entry or length of stay. The population served was similar to the general elderly population rather than those at special risk. The data indicated a clear identification of day care centers as an integral part of the network of long term care services. The results suggest leadership and advocacy roles for the southeastern New England Long Term Care Gerontology Center. Appendices include letters to centers, interview questionnaires, a list of day care centers in the catchment area, and the Massachusetts Adult Day Health Manual. (JAC)",

To examine factors affecting older adults' use of services provided in an accommodating environment, 52 physically independent residents of an Arizona apartment complex for the elderly were surveyed. Time spent living in the residence, perception of internal or external locus of control, and self-assessed health were correlated with services available to the residents in order to identify use trends. Special use rooms, a bank, beauty shop, gift shop, and dining room were located in the building. Transportation, meal plans, and cleaning services were available upon request. Results generally were insignificant, with the exception of time spent living in the  environment, which appeared to have a negative influence on satisfaction with several services. The lack of significant findings indicates support for the individualized approach to the process of aging. The sporadic service usage by this group may indicate that services are truly being used for the purpose of attaining and maintaining environmental independence. (JAC)",

Case studies are used to illustrate the need for mastery of different clinical models. &quot;The Integration of Behavioral and Psychodynamic Techniques in the Group Treatment of Sex Dysfunction,&quot; by Robert Muller, presents an  open-ended, client-based, interpersonal orientation model. A study showing the effectiveness of this approach is included. &quot;Integration of Behavioral and Analytic Modes: A First Year Student's Perspective,&quot; by Aimee Grunberger, points out that the notion of rapprochement originated in the form of endless journal debates over the relative merits of one type of therapy over another. Reviews of several studies on comparative therapies are presented. &quot;Learning to Listen: Modifying a Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy,&quot; by Linda Kanefield, presents a case study based on the dynamics of the counselor client relationship. Modification of the therapist's neutrality, use of interpretation as a major tool, and analysis of transference are discussed along with the effect of these changes on the  therapist's capacity to respond differently to different patients.

        "description":"Because the life expectancy of women is longer than that of men and because men seem to marry younger women, most of the literature on caregivers of the elderly has focusd on women who care for elderly, disabled husbands. In order to explore the role of men as caretakers of disabled wives, 25 elderly widowers (aged 63-93) participated in interviews designed to elicit recollections of the time they spent caring for elderly or disabled wives. Data analyses indicated that 12 of the 15 husbands whose wives were disabled before death had the primary responsibility for caregiving. Several husbands became ill while nursing their wives and almost half claimed that they had become ill or that a chronic condition had worsened in the first year of widowhood. Men who had nursed their wives  were less likely to consider remarriage. The caretaker role among elderly men appears to provide anticipatory socialization to widowhood as men learn to cook and clean house during the time of the spouse's illness. Because of the small sample, this study was intended to be suggestive rather than definitive. Further research could be directed toward elucidating household and marital roles of elderly men, roles of other family members in caring for a disabled relative, and needed support services for men who are caregivers.

The purpose of the present investigation was to assess differences in performance between &quot;cautious&quot; and &quot;risky&quot; older adults. Male and female older adults, aged 65-80, were classified as either cautious (N=9) or risky (N=9) on the basis of a personality test. Participants also completed an attention task consistng of 12 separate dichotic messages (trials) composed of numbers and letters. Errors of omission and intrusion were recorded and summed across trials to obtain a maximum error score. Data analyses indicated that cautious older adults made significantly more errors than risky older adults. The significant difference in total errors may have been due to the additive  effects of cautious older adults' omission and intrusion errors. (Author/AG)",

To determine whether the families of aged victims exhibit an inordinate number of stressful situations, 20 elderly abuse victims were interviewed about family relationships and problems, and completed a modified version of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale as a measure of stress. Results showed that the most common type of abuse was psychological. Physical abuse was reported by one-fourth of the victims, while 10 percent suffered physical neglect, and one-half suffered financial abuse. In over half of the cases, the abuser was a son or daughter. The victims came from settings with a large number of problems and serious stresses, including the death or  illness of a friend or family member, gain of a new family member, a change in finances, or poor health. Most victims defined their most serious family problems in terms other than direct abuse. This may represent denial or resignation, or a recognition that the abuse is one portion of the greater difficulties they and their families feel. Results are compared to a Justice and Justice (1976) study of parents of abused children. (JAC)",

To test this theory in relation to the social climate of university living units, and to assess initial perceptions and predictions of the future in relation to level of social exploration as a coping style, 92 entering freshmen completed the University Residence Environment Scale (URES) and the Edwards Social Exploration Scale. The URES was administered again, 12 weeks later. Results showed the freshmen were not able to predict accurately what their dormitory environment would be like. Males and females had similar initial perceptions and predictions. Freshmen with a more active social exploration preference both predicted and perceived their social environment  differently than freshmen with a more passive preference. However, active preference freshmen did not predict their future environment any more accurately than passive preference freshmen. Examination of how students' expectations are formed is needed in order to provide accurate information for preventive intervention. (Author/JAC)",

To determine the relationship between mealtime companionship and morale, a representative group of rural adults (N=418) aged 65 years or older completed questionnaires. Possible significant differences in the morale of older adults who usually ate alone versus those who ate with others were analyzed using multiple regression techniques. When marital status, educational level, sex, and self-rated health were controlled, the data showed that mealtime companionship was of no relative importance to the morale of older adults. The data supported the greater importance  of physical health to psychological health over social factors such as marital status, educational background, sex, and social contact. This observation suggests that efforts to alleviate problems associated with social isolation among the rural elderly should include viable health components that address the multiplicity of their health needs.

        "description":"Recent trends toward earlier retirement have exacerbated the financial problems facing the Social Security system and many other public and private pension plans. The massive commitment of public and private funds to Social Security and pension funds is partly responsible for the trend to early retirement. This, in fact, was one of the early goals of Social Security: to induce older workers out of the weak labor markets of the 1930's. Now, however, the age distribution has changed and the population of retirees has risen. There are three general approaches to bolstering the Social Security System: (1) an increase in employee contributions; (2) a decrease in the schedule of benefits, or delay of eligibility; and (3) an alteration in public policy to induce later retirement. The  benefit structure of Social Security and pension plans often provides strong financial incentives to retire precisely at the mandatory age: the carrot and stick are frequently applied simultaneously. To observe actual labor force transition behavior, adults employed in 1973 who did not face mandatory retirement by 1975 were studied. Results showed that health, full-time earnings, and whether or not retirement income would be lost by working, were significant variables. Research suggests that the extension of the mandatory retirement age will not greatly affect work effort of older persons. A public policy that hopes to alter individual retirement decisions should focus on the financial incentives at the heart of retirement plans. (JAC)",

To examine the effects of non-contingent rewards on children, two studies were conducted, in which children were exposed to two series of tasks. For the first task, 24 children, aged 10 to 14, were randomly assigned to 3 reward schedules including contingent reward for correct performance; 100% reward; and random (50%) reward regardless of performance. A fourth group of control subjects were not exposed to the first series of tasks. For the second series of tasks, all children (N=60) received a contingent reward. Response latency and errors on  coding tasks served as the dependent measures. In both investigations, significantly greater response latencies were found for children receiving 50% and 100% reward than for those receiving contingent reward or for controls. No statistically reliable differences were found in errors. The findings suggest that current educational practices should be examined to determine whether learned helplessness states are inadvertently produced by instructional or placement procedures in field settings.

To examine these competing perspectives, 1,128 secondary school males completed self-report questionnaires providing information about their attachments to parents and peers, the conduct of parents and peers, and about their own delinquent behavior. Analyses of results showed that respondents reporting more negative paternal role models also reported more delinquent behavior. Greater attachment to both parents and peers was related to reports of less delinquent behavior. The relationship between attachment and  delinquent behavior held for youths with either negative or positive parent role models. The results imply little or no support for the differential association-learning hypothesis that attachment to a negative role model leads to delinquency. They also imply that a model which accords causal priority to delinquent peer association would explain more variance in delinquent behavior than a strict control model, which assumes that the link between delinquent associates and and delinquent behavior is spurious.

An afterlife anxiety measure and measures of physical and psychologial health were administered. Pearson correlations failed to support the hypothesis that afterlife anxiety would be related to well-being. However, small effects were noted for time perception and setting: elders who perceived time as slow, and those who lived in institutions, tended to feel more anxious about life after death. No demographic data were related to afterlife anxiety. The low correlations may be due to the complex nature of the afterlife anxiety variable, which demonstrates poor  results empirically, indicating a need for further research. (JAC)",

        "description":"A study examined how the text variables of organizational plan (top-level structure), emphasis plan (implemented through signalling devices), and presence of details influenced the selection of reading strategies by adults. Subjects--149 young, middle aged, and older expert readers--read and recalled in writing two expository prose passages of 388 words each. The results indicated that when the author's emphasis plan corresponded with his or her organizational plan, the readers were more likely to use a &quot;structure strategy&quot; in their processing. This resulted in recalls that were organized in the same manner as the original passage, showed a strong levels effect, and contained many of the logical relationships from the original text. In contrast, when the author's emphasis plan  was in conflict with the organization plan (a &quot;differential&quot; emphasis plan), readers tended to use a &quot;default strategy&quot; of simply listing what they could remember or to devise other strategies. These recalls were less likely to be organized by the same plan used by the author, showed little or no levels effect, and contained fewer logical relationships than those from passages with normal emphasis plans. In addition, the presence of specific details was found to affect the processing strategies of readers under certain conditions. No significant differences were found in recall performances among the three age groups. (Passages used in the study are appended.) (Author/FL)",

        "description":"In light of the importance of a teacher's managerial ability and the use of small and large group instruction to increase direct instruction time, teachers should apply specific managerial skills in their reading classes to ensure student learning. Successful teachers get to know their students, set instructional goals, and make sure students know what is expected of them. Preparing reading materials in advance and distributing them before class begins will minimize disruptions. The use of individual student activity folders will also minimize disruptive transitions and can aid in keeping students on task. Students should be taught to use a help sign when they have a problem with seat work, which can cut down on the amount of time wasted when a problem arises and reduce student  interruption of a lesson when the teacher is busy elsewhere in the room. By positioning students so that they can be seen by the teacher at all times from anywhere in the room, teachers can more easily monitor student engagement in learning activities. Task-related comments, which specify what the students should be doing at the moment, serve to refocus students' attention to the assigned task without embarrassing them. The best way to minimize disruptive behavior is to note when a student misbehaves, whether there is a pattern to the behavior, and how much it affects other students. Such reflections can help teachers understand the problem and take steps to correct it. (HTH)",

Students in an Old Order Amish school in Iowa receive instruction in language arts from a secular basal language arts workbook, and a basal reader containing biblical stories. Comprehension of content is evaluated from completed exercises contained in the basal reader and workbook. Pupils in grades 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, completed the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Eighteen of 23 students ranked below the 50th percentile in vocabulary, whereas only 12 of 23 ranked below the 50th percentile in reading. All students ranked above the 50th percentile in arithmetic computation. Since the Amish philosophy and culture emphasize hard work, self-reliance, and practical  situations, the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills might not be a valid measure for these pupils.

Subjects were 79 third and 78 fifth grade students in eight intact classrooms. Both the oral reading miscues and the cloze replacements were categorized using a modification of Y. Goodman's miscue analysis system. The cloze tests were prepared by leaving the introductory sentence of a passage complete and thereafter deleting every fifth word. The reading passages were grade appropriate and selected from naturally occurring instructional materials. Each subject was tested in two sessions, with both the cloze test and a standardized reading test administered in the classroom setting. The oral reading sample was collected during an  individual session with each subject. Results indicated that there were clearly some strong similarities between information yielded by a miscue analysis and a relatively indepth exploration of the types of responses made on a cloze task. In general terms, oral reading accuracy was closely related to success in completing the cloze tasks. The two classification systems, however, frequently produced disparate reading level estimates for individuals within the sample. (FL)",

        "description":"A study investigated at what point during eye fixations visual information is used in furthering the reading process. The study identified two aspects of information processing: registration, in which a light pattern on the retina triggers a pattern of neural activity in the visula cortex; and utilization, in which the registered pattern has an effect on the reading comprehension process. Specifically, the study sought to determine when this utilization of information occurs. Sixteen college students read short texts from a cathode ray tube (CRT) as their eye movements were monitored. During selected fixations, the text was briefly masked and reappeared with one word changed. Subjects were often unaware that the word had changed. Sometimes they reported seeing the first word,  sometimes the second, sometimes both. When only one word was reported, two factors were found to determine which it was: the length of time it was present during the fixation and the predictability of a word in its context. The results suggested that visual information is used for reading at a crucial period during the fixation, and that this period can occur at different times on different fixations, termed the Variable Utilization Time Principle. The pattern of responses also indicated that the first letter of a word was not utilized before other letters and that letters were not scanned left to right during a fixation. (Author/FL)",

This is known as associative response. A study was conducted to investigate the cognitive processes underlying this response. Subjects, 112 fifth grade students, were administered a battery of tests designed to assess different components of analogical reasoning. The Children's Associative Responding Test (CART), a verbal analogies test that yields associative and nonassociative error scores, was also administered. Factor analysis of the results yielded four primary factors: vocabulary, encoding and retrieval processes, discovery of semantic relations and flexibility, and response evaluation. A higher order general factor was also  found. Further regression analyses showed that only the mapping relations component did not significantly predict CART scores. Despite considerable criterion overlap, vocabulary and discovery of semantic relations were more highly related to nonassociative errors, and working memory and semantic flexibility were more highly related to associative errors.

        "description":"The movement away from a stimulus-response to a constructive view of memory and reading comprehension has had an impact on both reading research and teaching. Viewing memory as not simply the recollection of sensory data, but as the complex interaction of the sensory experience with its immediate context and the perceiver's previous knowledge, contemporary research sees reading comprehension as dependent on the reader's ability to use his or her background knowledge as well as to recognize specific letters and words. According to this theory, reading disorders derive from either lack of appropriate schemata--that is, hypothetical knowledge structures generalized from memories--or undeveloped control strategies for using schemata. Recent research, therefore, concentrates on how  successful readers use schemata to reach an understanding of new material, and how inferencing processes operate and can be improved in poor readers.

Having learned a four-line rhyme through aural coaching, 30 first grade students were asked to point to words as they read the printed poem and identify specific words within the text. The results' high correlation with the scores from an earlier standardized reading readiness test and a follow-up achievement test indicated that being able to relate the spoken with the written word was  necessary for early reading success. Though the study was unable to completely isolate unit discrimination from other word recognition skills, it both offers an effective method for assessing reading readiness in young children and suggests methods for helping children develop awareness of word boundaries.

        "description":"A study sought to describe the nature of teacher and student behaviors related to textbook reading assignments at the secondary school level, and to explore the relationship between the amount of time secondary school teachers devoted to specific assignment-related behaviors and students' subsequent performance on the assignments. The sample included 10 seventh, eighth, and ninth grade social studies teachers who were observed seven or eight times within a 8-week period. The results indicated that the teachers allocated 46% of the total observed time to the following assignment-making behavior: presenting (22%), monitoring (20%), and oral feedback (4%). This represented more than twice the amount of time teachers spent in lecturing/discussing and small group conferences,  combined. Textbook assignments that required students to read and write answers to questions appeared to \"drive\" the lesson. The amount of time teachers spent presenting textbook-related reading assignments correlated positively and significantly with students' performance on the assignments. The amount of time a teacher spent presenting an assignment did not relate to students' attitudes. Finally, neither the time teachers spent in monitoring nor the time spent in giving feedback on assignments related significantly to student performance or attitude. (HTH)",

Subjects were 10 college undergraduates who had scored at the extreme ends of a writer's block measurement instrument. The 10, 6 \"high-blockers\" and 4 \"low-blockers,\" varied in their English experience, class standing, and majors. Each was given a writing topic, allowed time to become familiar with it, and then left alone to write for 1 hour. Two videotape machines recorded the students' behaviors and the writing they were doing. At the end of the hour, each student was shown the tapes and questioned about various behaviors that had been recorded. In addition, the amount of time spent in prewriting, planning, and pausing, and the number of words written and deleted were recorded. Finally,  the final products were evaluated by two independent raters. Results showed that on the average, high-blockers paused longer, produced shorter drafts, and received lower evaluations than low-blockers. Furthermore, in several cases, high-blockers spent one-half to two-thirds of their time prewriting and planning rather than producing text. Both groups expressed roughly the same number of positive and negative evaluations of their work. The expression of negative evaluations was highly related to low English experience.

        "description":"In early 1942, the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier,&quot; the largest black newspaper in the United States, began its Double V campaign stressing the right of black workers to have equality at home when blacks were fighting inequality abroad. An examination of the campaign, however, reveals that it was dead by the end of the year, while substantial gains by black workers did not occur until a year or so later. To discover why the newspaper dropped its campaign before it accomplished its goals, an examination was made of its coverage of black worker issues in 1942. The analysis showed that there was a definite shift in the nature of the articles over the year. In the first half of 1942, the federal government and the military were criticized heavily, but the state and municipal governments and  private businesses became targets of criticisms in the second half of the year. This allayed fears of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the &quot;Courier&quot; was possibly seditious, it left no doubt that the publisher of the paper was supporting the winning side as the war fortunes of the United States changed, and it showed the paper's appreciation for the efforts of the Fair Employment Practice Committee to break down discrimination.

It has been suggested, however, that in many advertising situations, cognitive change can lead directly to behavior change, and that for many products advertising is a &quot;low involvement&quot; situation. In other words, a person need not like a product before he or she purchases it. A study used path analysis to compare the adequacy or ability of both the high- and the low-involvement models to predict advertising effectiveness for a pizza delivery service among a population of college students. Data were gathered from a random sample of 250 students living in undergraduate dormitories. Variables analyzed were (1) advertising exposure, (2)  brand awareness, (3) brand knowledge, (4) attitude toward brand, and (5) brand purchasing behavior. Results indicated that for certain paths--the direct effects of exposure on cognitive and affective change, in particular--both high and low models of involvement provided a fairly good fit to the data. However, when the indirect effects were considered, the low-involvement model apparently provided a much better fit to the data. This was especially apparent when the total effects of product advertising were considered. (FL)",

        "author":["Ede, Lisa"],
        "description":"The Rogerian argument, as described by Young, Baker, and Pike in &quot;Rhetoric: Discovery and Change,&quot; misrepresents Carl Rogers's own principles. Addressing the need for improved interpersonal communication both within and outside of therapy, Rogers describes three conditions for &quot;listening with understanding&quot;: congruence, or nondirective listening; unconditional acceptance of all ideas expressed; and emphatic understanding of the speaker's emotions and experiences. Influenced by Anatol Rapoport, Young, Baker, and Pike have translated these strategies into steps in an argument. After demonstrating an understanding of the opponent's position and stating contexts in which it may be valid, the writer gives his or her own views and describes how adopting them would benefit the opponent.  As the use of the words &quot;opponent&quot; and &quot;argument&quot; suggests, this strategy--far from being nondirective or genuinely accepting--aims at winning the reader over to a definite position. The writer's inability to incorporate empathic understanding into a written argument indicates the antithetical natures of Rogers's nonevaluative language and the rhetorical stance. With its attempt to manipulate rather than to directly confront the reader, Rogerian rhetoric represents an unnecessary and potentially harmful pedagogical strategy. (MM)",

The paper first describes the development of interest in mass communication in the nineteenth century, then explains the empirical research tradition in mass communication inquiry, noting its evolution from stimulus-response to audience-oriented research under Paul Lazarsfeld's influence. The paper then explores the critical research tradition, and analyzes Lee Thayer's four levels of communication in terms of Denis McQuail's seven characteristics of mass communication by using critical literature. It concludes that the critical research tradition in mass communication can provide a  provocative explanation of all levels of communication, thus calling into question the usefulness of such divisions within the communication discipline as interpersonal, organizational, or mass communication.

In the second essay, publisher Don Lacy reviews the history of the publishing industry and comments upon its current problems. In the final essay, former Commissioner of Education, Ernest L.

        "description":"An examination of the ways in which United States postal policies affected the development of the magazine industry before Congress passed the second-class mail category in 1863 reveals how a medium is shaped at least in part by the technology, policy, and politics of its delivery systems. In the nineteenth century, magazines depended on the mails for distribution more than the other print media, but several obstacles kept them from enjoying the postal privileges conferred on newspapers: (1) as a medium distinct from newspapers, the magazine was relatively new and unfamiliar to policymakers; (2) magazines, pamphlets, and books were thought to be heavier and less transportable than newspapers; (3) magazines lacked the vigorous lobby that safeguarded newspapers' interests; and (4)  in a purely subjective judgment, the information purveyed by magazines was deemed less significant and less timely than that contained in papers. The disparity between newspaper and magazine rates prompted publishers to design their publications to resemble newspapers regardless of the content. The postal status of magazines improved by the middle of the nineteenth century because improved modes of transportation accommodated bulkier mails and the post office had grown tired of making fine distinctions among publications.

Their responses were added to females' responses of a 1982 study, and the enlarged sample of women was then compared with the male respondents from that study. Marked differences were found in the background of the male and female assistant professors. The women tended to be younger, have taught for fewer years, and be paid less than the men. These men and women had similar educational backgrounds, belonged to about the same number of professional organizations, and wrote about the same number of refereed publications. They responded similarly to questions about their satisfaction with their department chair, salaries, and the support given them by their institutions. The women  tended to be slightly more satisfied with their colleagues and their students than were the men, but were not as satisfied as the men with the way in which promotions were handled. Men and women associate professors, on the other hand, had remarkably similar backgrounds in terms of age, education, teaching experience, and salaries. However, the women associate professors tended to be somewhat more dissatisfied than were the men with their lives away from work, their department chair, their colleagues, and with promotion and merit pay procedures. Too few responses were received from female professors to merit their analysis. (Questionnaires are appended.) (HTH)",

        "description":"An examination of Dorothy Day's role as chief journalist, editor, and publisher of &quot;The Catholic Worker,&quot; the ideological monthly she cofounded in 1933, reveals that she was the final authority within the organization of the newspaper. Deeply committed to proselytizing for her cause, the Catholic Worker Movement, Day still simultaneously identified with the goals of the professional journalist. This meant that she, like other alternative journalists, was a participant journalist who emphasized &quot;advocacy over neutrality&quot; and &quot;interpretation over speed of transmission.&quot; Unlike the others, however, she did not emphasize &quot;substance over technique,&quot; and, most importantly, her ideological commitments did not overshadow her identity as a professional journalist. Instead, they existed in  tense but effective tandem. One result of this was an outstanding written and edited product, with a carefully crafted dual appeal to workers and scholars. The paper was instrumental in winning the Worker Movement wide support, eventually even that of the Catholic Church, which had initially disapproved of its unprecendented union of secular radicalism with Catholic traditionalism. Dorothy Day's combination of advocacy and professionalism has not often appeared among alternative journalists. (Author/FL)",

Of a random sample of 300 adults selected for interviewing from a northern California county telephone directory, 53% reported having cable television. The 136 cable viewers were then asked in multiple response questions which news programs they watched. All respondents were asked to rate their interest in local issues, how informed they were on local issues, their interest in local politics, how often they voted in local elections, their level of community involvement, whether they volunteered in local activities, and the number of community organizations to which they belonged.  Twenty-two percent of cable subscribers watched only distant-signal local news programs, 50% watched only local station news programs, and 27% watched both. Results supported the view that cable systems are contributing to the emergence of segmented audiences and a falloff in network audience shares. However, they did not provide much supporting evidence for the link between diversion from local news programs and less community involvement and local political participation. (HTH)",

Next, they were asked to rate themselves on the following: interest in local issues, how informed they were on local issues, interest in local politics, how often they voted in local elections, level of community involvement, whether they volunteered in local activities, and the number of local organizations to which they belonged. Results showed that a significant share of  newspaper readers were reading or subscribing to nonlocal newspapers.

        "description":"As part of a statewide campaign to increase both awareness of the problem of littering and illegal dumping, and participation in recycling activities, Humboldt County, California, began a recycling and antilittering education project in 1981. Pre- and postcampaign survey data suggest that the 9-month program, relying largely on television and radio public service messages, had little effect on residents' attitudes toward waste disposal or recycling. This lack of response may be due to the project's failure to supplement its education measures with programs reinforcing recycling behavior. Also, as 74.7% of the residents already recycled material, the community may already have reached its expected level of adoption. Nonrecyclers--generally older than the average resident, inactive  in community affairs, with less education but higher incomes--may have been influenced more by the inconvenience of collecting and transporting recyclable material than by the financial benefits of recycling stressed by the campaign. Though not influencing this group, the project did increase the concern of those already recycling. Moreover, as this period witnessed no drop in recycling behavior despite the community's increased unemployment, discontinued bottle and can pickups, and decrease in the price paid for aluminum cans, the campaign can be considered a limited success.

        "description":"To explore student facility with argumentative writing, 40 persuasive essays of 5th, 7th, and 11th grade students were analyzed for their relative percentage of reporting (narrating), interpreting, generalizing, and speculative sentences. Fifth and seventh graders were found to use significantly more narrative and fewer generalizations than older students. The young writers' reliance on reporting may be due to inexperience with the argumentative mode or a tendancy to model writing on their experience of reality. Thus, they are more skillful with the chronological organization of narrative and less expert with a mode that fails to supply the audience response found in oral argument. That reporting may represent a flight from the heavier cognitive demands of persuasive writing is  suggested in studies showing mature second language learners relying more on narrative when writing in a foreign language than when using their own. While supporting earlier research that younger students write less, and less effectivly, in the argumentative mode, this study does not indicate that children cannot write persuasively. In fact, the large amount of argumentative writing demanded in high school and college suggests that students should be taught to write as effectively in this as in other modes.

        "description":"Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy (RET), which assumes that a person can change an emotional disturbance by discovering and disputing the irrational ideas giving rise to that emotion, has been used effectively in treating public speaking anxiety. To compare RET with other treatments for communication apprehension, 52 high communication apprehensive individuals were placed in three treatment groups. Group 1 supplemented the development of communication skills with RET training; group 2 used skills training and systematic desensitization, the relief of anxiety through relaxation techniques; and group 3 worked only on building students' communication skills. Comparisons of pretests and posttests revealed that while all three groups showed significant decreases in speech  anxiety after the 4-month program, no group's results differed significantly from any of the others. In other words, all methods worked equally well. Further research is needed on the possible impact that the &quot;Pygmalion&quot; effect, achievement rising to meet student or teacher expectations, and the &quot;Hawthorne&quot; effect, productive change following attention to &quot;lonely&quot; students, have on findings.

        "description":"There are two philosophies concerning how teachers might best facilitate their students' acquisition of communication competence. The first, a skills-oriented philosophy, adopts a building-block approach to the acquisition of communication competence. Organizationally, a public speaking course might start with a unit on analyzing audience and occasion and proceed through such units as the selection of topics and purposes, the selection and support of main ideas, and so on. For each unit, students would be taught and evaluated in terms of component skills. Judgments about the success of the total effort would be reserved until the end of the semester. The second philosophy is a function-oriented approach. A public speaking course developed in this fashion would include numerous  holistic public presentations. Within some taxonomy of function, the presentations would be sequenced to move from less difficult to more difficult. Success for each speech would be judged in terms of relative accomplishment of the specific task or function. Of these two approaches, the skills-oriented approach would be most useful if one subscribes to the view of communication as instrument for conveying knowledge, expressing feelings, changing attitudes, or directing action. If, however, communication is viewed as a transactional process by which individuals create and sustain the realities by which they live, a function-oriented approach would possess greater utility.

        "description":"Research efforts to model speech perception in terms of a processing system in which knowledge and processing are distributed over large numbers of highly interactive--but computationally primative--elements are described in this report. After discussing the properties of speech that demand a parallel interactive processing system, the report reviews both psycholinguistic and machine-based attempts to model speech perception. It then presents the results of a computer simulation of one version of an interactive activation model of speech, based loosely on the COHORT model, devised by W. D. Marslen-Wilson and Welsh (1978), which is capable of word recognition and phonemic restoration without depending on preliminary segmentation of the input into phonemes. The report then notes  the deficiences of this model, among them its excessive sensitivity to speech rate and its dependence on accurate information about word beginnings. It also describes the TRACE model, which is designed to address these deficiencies, noting that it allows interactive activation processes to take place within a structure that serves as a dynamic working memory. The report points out that this structure permits the model to capture contextual influence in which the perception of a portion of the input stream is influenced by what follows it as well as by what precedes it in the speech signal.

        "description":"The argument has been advanced that in intimate self-disclosure sex differences occur with males being less intimately disclosive than females--especially to other males. The argument posits that males who have homophobia (a fear of sexual contact with members of the same sex) might view intimate self-disclosure as a homosexual act and thus avoid it. A self-disclosure questionnaire and a homophobia index were completed by 305 college students. Analysis of variance performed on the data collected revealed significant sex differences in self-disclosure scores. These differences occurred for four dimensions: intimacy, amount, honesty, and willingness. For these dimensions, females proved to be more disclosive to best friends of the same sex than did males. For the same dimensions,  males were consistently more disclosive to the opposite sex than to the same sex for both best friends and acquaintances than were females. Little distinction was found in how disclosive females were to the same sex or opposite sex, especially when the target was a best friend. Despite these sex differences, however, homophobia was not found to be significantly related to self-disclosure score. (FL)",

Sixty-nine members responded. Results showed that the legislators did perceive significant differences in broadcast and print media coverage, rating television and radio more favorably than newspapers for both home district and statewide coverage.

        "description":"That competition in broadcasting may not bring about sufficiently heterogeneous programing has long been the subject of debate among policymakers, and nowhere has that debate been more acrimonious than in its application to the diversification of radio formats. While the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prefers to leave questions of diversity to the demands of the marketplace, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has been encouraging the FCC to accommodate exceptions to--and thus exemptions from--its policy of nonintervention. In its 1981 &quot;FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild&quot; decision, the Supreme Court rebuked the Court of Appeals and tacitly endorsed the FCC's desire to rely on marketplace forces to promote diversity in entertainment programing. Consequently, the Court  finds itself supporting a policy that favors competition, not diversity; free enterprise, not consumer welfare; the broadcaster, not the listener. In contract to the &quot;Red Lion&quot; decision of 1969, when the Court upheld a listener's &quot;right to hear,&quot; the WNCN decision fails to require the FCC to look beyond the marketplace for the standards by which it assesses program diversity. In practice, the FCC's format policy confuses variety with diversity, and fails to recognize that competition in the marketplace mitigates against the ideal of pluralistic programing. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the extent of communication apprehension among students in pharmacy schools across the United States. Fifty-one schools submitted usable completed surveys. The self-reported survey measured the level of students' shyness, and the perceived importance of interpersonal, group, and public speaking forms of communication. The results indicated that approximately one in five students in pharmacy schools was highly communication apprehensive, with some schools having as low as 4% communication apprehensive students and others as high as 30%. Approximately one-third of the 10,000 students studied indicated they were shy, but 40% of these did not consider their shyness to be a problem. Perceived importance of communication to the pharmacy profession was  found to be negatively correlated with the level of communication apprehension: the more anxiety that a communication context caused, the less importance a student attached to that type of communication.

        "description":"Given the paucity of evidence accurately characterizing private education, this paper synthesizes and interprets available research on private school enrollments, religious affiliations, tuition levels, characteristics of patrons, and common features of operation. The organization of data on church-affiliated schools is found to be faulty, with too little information currently available on levels of tuition, attributes of fundamentalist schools, or ethnic and community schools. With the exception of fundamentalist schools, there has been no dramatic expansion in private-school enrollment. The recent growth in fundamentalist schools probably stems from sensitivity to court decisions on school prayer and the perceived breakdown of social mores in public schools. Private schools,  moreover, reflect rather than create religious, ethnic, and economic segregation. Whereas parents' motivations for enrolling children in private schools may involve religious and ethnic distinctions, other reasons may include public schools' waning financial support, discipline problems, and large sizes, as well as such issues as the disparity between parents' and teachers' values and government regulation of public schools. Overall, most private schools share a strong social cohesion among parents, who are generally very interested in the ways in which their children are educated. More study is needed to clarify policy issues surrounding private schools. (JW)",

        "description":"An introduction to a projected collection of essays on law and governance, this paper traces the reasons for and issues in increased federal control of education and lays down the format of the forthcoming collection. The author notes that, although the problems of increased bureaucratic involvement have not been so dramatic in education as elsewhere, there are important parallels between problems in other fields of regulation and those of education, including loss of local control, debilitating expense, inflexibility, and inefficiency. However, it is also observed that the problems in deregulation may be as severe as those in overregulation because organized interests may find it easier to influence decisions and because federal regulation of schools is not so autocratic as is  commonly supposed. Choosing the right balance of local and federal control in order to ensure the claim of the poor in public education is presented as the prime issue in the regulation of education. The volume of essays will be divided between issues of regulation, which involve intragovernmental control, and those of legislation, which affect rights and establish whole systems of rulemaking bodies. Each of the two main sections will be further divided into four topics: the origins of governmental involvement in education, the general issues in areas of control, illustrative examples, and future prospects in the era of the New Federalism.

Data--drawn from such major programs as aid for education of the disadvantaged, aid for education of the handicapped, vocational education, and bilingual education--were analyzed according to three topics: the requirement for funding and eligibility in the programs, the distribution roles of federal and state governments, and the formulas for distributing federal funds. The fund allocation formulas and discretionary allocation processes appear to be widely varied, uncoordinated, and, in some cases, vague. Federal and nonfederal programs thus require better coordination, or, as an alternative, an effective  allocation of authority to the states, in order to ensure both federal and state interests in the distribution of funds. The present federal formulas are insensitive because they fail to take account of educational or local needs, local fiscal factors (such as revenue-raising ability or variations in cost), or program goals, nor do they make explicit the discretionary criteria for funding. Future allocation procedures will be affected by the increasing number of state compensatory education programs, and indeed should be changed by more effective intergovernmental cooperation on formulas to fund handicapped, vocational, and bilingual programs.

        "description":"Because public school districts have highly permeable organizational boundaries, analyses of their structures and processes should include consideration of external as well as internal factors. Such analyses have become feasible with the application of general systems theory, which views organizations as functioning units that have continuous interaction across boundaries. The recent application of general systems theory to organizational structures by Pfeffer and Salancik contends that external factors, such as population mobility, external mandates, and religious and cultural conditions, are influential in both the public and private sectors. Two case studies of executive succession in public schools--one in an urban-rural district using a centralized, districtwide approach to  linking testing and evaluation activities with district instructional programs, the other in a large urban district using a decentralized, school-by-school approach--confirm Pfeffer and Salancik's model of environmental effects. In both cases, the selection of superintendents reflected the environmental context, which in turn influenced district power distribution. Findings confirmed Pfeffer and Salancik's perception that external environmental influences exert control on the internal workings of an organization. School administrators should understand such external conditions to attain optimal organizational effectiveness. (JBM)",

The study group consisted of 128 elementary, secondary, and vocational-technical school facilities constructed between 1974 and 1982. These were funded through West Virginia's Better School Buildings Amendment which provided for state funds on a grant basis and additional incentive money to help generate local revenues for school construction and improvement. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the per pupil cost of school construction is significantly affected by the assessed value of the school district, the local  effort of the district in facility construction, the amount of money from the state level, and the type of facility. Variables found to be nonsignificant were total education expenditures, federal funds, size of the district, geographic location, rural- urban factor, the amount of instructional space, and the length of construction time. The authors recommend that new legislation be adopted to continue funding the construction of school facilities with money from the state level, and that a funding formula be developed that addresses the variables found to be significant in this study.

        "description":"The two articles in this bulletin concern an experiment in progress to determine if training teachers in a structured program for mathematics instruction results in higher student achievement and if the effects of the program on teachers and students would be enhanced if the building principal participates in and supports the inservice process. In the first article, \"Using Staff Development to Improve Schools,\" researcher Meredith Gall describes how teachers in five schools are receiving training in a research-validated strategy for managing mathematics instruction without principal involvement. Teachers in another five schools are participating in the same program, but in addition their principals are being trained to support the teachers' implementation of the strategy. As a  control group, teachers and principals in yet another five schools are not being trained. The most intriguing observation so far is that issues such as expectations for student work, enforcement of academic requirements, ability grouping, and voluntary participation in staff development are matters of policy that require the involvement of administrators. In the second article, \"Wednesday Morning Live: Observations on a Staff Development Meeting,\" Wynn De Bevoise shares her perceptions of one three-hour training session involving both teachers and a principal.

        "description":"Research based on followup interviews with some &quot;key actors&quot; at the federal level about the most significant recent events in education identified five topics: the cutbacks in federal education spending, the deregulation and decentralization embodied in provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA), proposed and de facto disestablishment of the Department of Education, and deemphasis of education as a national priority. Telephone interviews with the chief state school officers (CSSOs) of nine states centered on these five topics. State agencies were cutting back on a wide range of activities, and all were decreasing their staffs. Respondents generally viewed unknown or loose regulations as being worse than stringent regulations. Decentralization has led to  maneuvering among state factions for control of block grants. Disestablishment and deemphasis have resulted in a communication breakdown between CSSOs and people in the Department of Education. Finally, the CSSOs predicted a decline in school improvement activities and a decrease in services targeted to the disadvantaged. The researchers conclude that, although the New Federalism will have long-term effects, it is educators' responsibility to minimize the effects of federal disengagement from education policy. (MLF)",

In chapter 3 the author reports on a questionnaire survey of 74 New Hampshire superintendents, board members, and town officials on the estimated effects of foundation and BPT aid levels on district and  municipal spending. Chapters 4 and 5 review the methodology and results of econometric analyses estimating school spending responses to both state aid and municpal overburden and simulating the impact of alternative state aid formulas on wealth neutrality.

        "description":"Recent research by Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore on the effectiveness of public and private schools may be seriously flawed because of its neglect of input-level differences in student performance and its reliance on cross-sectional testing data as the criterion measure. The sample used by Coleman and his colleagues from the High School and Beyond (HSB) data set was limited to seniors and to fewer schools than the more complete data in the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of the High School Class of 1972. Whereas it is true that a comparison of mean scores for public and Catholic schools in both the NLS and HSB consistently favors Catholic schools, such a comparison may be inappropriate because private sector schools tend to attract students who are in an academic tract, but  public schools must take anyone. The differences between public and Catholic test score results become markedly slimmer when academic and general track students are compared separately. When adjusted for differences in enrollment proportions in the two tracks, the figures give only two significant advantages to Catholic schools--in the verbal SAT among academic-track students and in the verbal followup test among general-track students. The differences between public and Catholic schools in achievement scores become insignificant after the variables of student selection and background characteristics are statistically controlled. There is thus little reason to believe that Catholic schools are more effective than public schools in promoting cognitive development. (Author/JW)",

        "description":"Examining a sample of 17 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade language arts and social studies teachers in the Eugene (Oregon) area, this study sought to determine the effects of inservice coaching on teachers' transfer of newly learned classroom strategies into their instructional repertoires, and to identify the problems in transferring skills. All teachers were trained in three models of teaching--Bruner's Concept Attainment, Taba's Inductive Thinking, and Gordon's Synectics. As an aid in applying the strategies in the classroom, nine teachers received coaching for 6 weeks--including repeated observations and technical feedback; eight were observed but uncoached. Scales for model-relevant teaching behaviors were derived from the Teacher Innovator System observation instrument,  with multiple regression used to determine the contribution of coaching to the teachers' transfer of training. Results indicated that coaching was effective in helping teachers include a conceptual level as well as factual level of information processing in the classroom and also in maintaining the models as optional instructional strategies. It was found that among the most serious problems for teachers in transferring training were making instructional objectives suitable to the new models, approaching curricula as sets of concepts rather than as activities, and finding time and encouragement in a school setting to master new strategies. Appendixes include a review of literature on transfer of training and the instruments used in the author's study. (JW)",

        "description":"Because a review of the literature showed little systematic knowledge about effective school-home communication at the secondary level, a survey of parents of secondary-level students was undertaken in a large West Virginia school system that had begun to achieve apparently effective school-home rapport. A stratified, random sample of parents was selected to represent two high schools serving mixes of rural and urban families of varied socioeconomic status. The sample of 120 families was stratified to include equal numbers of 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students and equal numbers of boys and girls within grade levels. Interviews with the parents sought information on actual home-school communication practices in the system, parents' reactions to such practices, and their  suggestions for improvements and possible innovations in communications. Results show that school newsletters were most often mentioned as the contact between home and school, though personal contact with school personnel (albeit infrequent) and interim academic progress reports also proved to be significant contacts between school and home. Parents responded most positively (1) to regular and timely newsletters on school activities and (2) to being notified when their children were having difficulties and needed assistance or correction. Although parents generally lacked information on what they could best do in response to problems at school, an effective communications program should include followup suggestions in its early notification of parents.

The 113 usable questionnaires were ranked according to the percentage of principled reasoning; the upper and lower 36 were included in the remainder of the study. These 72 subjects were randomly assigned to read 1 of 4 vignettes describing identical misbehaviors by males or females. On the basis of questionnaire scores, they were assigned to high, low, or mixed score dyads. Statistical analysis revealed that the level of a student's moral development  did not influence disciplinary decisions; disciplinary decisions were more severe for serious female misbehavior than for male; and disciplinary decisions made by dyads were not different from individual decisions or from each other. Future investigations could control for the sex of the subject and utilize a different sample, revised vignettes, and another model of moral development.

After schools were selected and assessed for needs and climates, workshops provided training for teachers and administrators in those skills needed for continuing organizational reform, such as decision-making, problem-solving, institutional structures, planning, and  leadership. After one year, student performance and school climate were reviewed; the process of diagnosis, workshops, implementation of reforms, and evaluation was repeated several times during the next year. Both schools showed some improvement in objective indicators of school conditions, such as student and faculty attendance. Subjective responses revealed more teacher interest in school improvement after a planned change program was used.

By focusing on students who first enter school below grade level standards and by understanding that student learning is embedded in a system of key elements or variables that, over time, are interrelated in a circular pattern of causality, longitudinal research provides such data on effective schooling. Essential structural differences between effective and ineffective schools are highlighted by causal loop diagrams illustrating both key variables and the concept of circular causality. The variables, which identify areas requiring further empirical research, are teacher effectiveness and expectations, time allocated to  instruction, engaged learning time, and student motivation, behavior, and achievement. The variables identify points of intervention in the system where the principal's leadership role is critical in achieving an effective school. After the problem has been defined, causes understood, and points of intervention identified, a theory of implementation is required.

The recently opened Kennedy and Johnson archives facilitate an internal analysis of the evolution of education policy formulation in the 1960s from the perspective of the executive branch. The central thread of continuity for such an analysis is executive planning through presidential task forces, such as those coordinated in the mid-1960s by Bill Moyers and Joseph Califano. While task forcing was for Kennedy largely a one-shot campaign effort of dubious efficacy, it was crucial for Johnson's construction of the Great Society's programmatic base. Task forces provide both a window into the education policy processes of the 1960s and a point of entry into the  surrounding political context. From the perspective of the 1980s, the escalation of the Vietnam War in 1966 and its budgetary consequences appear to mark a turning point away from Johnson's Great Society programs. Although the Kennedy-Johnson initiatives were overwhelmed by the social tides that flowed around them and did not successfully rescue the poor through education, they contributed to an interest in the quality of education that extends even into the Reagan era.

        "description":"This study analyzes the effectiveness of a &quot;guaranteed tax base&quot; (GTB) as a reform measure designed to reduce the traditional heavy reliance of school financing on local property tax revenues and to help equalize per pupil expenditures across districts. Such measures call for matching locally raised tax dollars with state aid and consequently lowering the price of expenditures to some school districts. Previous studies by Feldstein (1975) and Ladd (1975) estimate school district expenditure equations using cross-sectional data from Massachusetts. Their results indicate a fairly large price effect on expenditures. The author's study of the price effect over a 5-year period of a GTB currently in place in Michigan rejects this approach as inadequate apart from an analysis of  variables over time. Variables considered in the Michigan study include the price effect of the GTB on school districts, representative households, and state and federal aid. Results of a pooling of data for all years for all 451 school districts studied indicate that the effect of the GTB plan on expenditures in Michigan has been so small as to be of no policy significance. These results run counter to the earlier findings of Feldstein and Ladd and suggest that their results should perhaps be rejected. (JBM)",

The procedural steps, instruments, checklists, and worksheets for PCMP implementation are presented in four sections. The first section covers the need for an effective mathematics program. The next section deals with needs assessment questionnaires covering school goals, staff development, and school evaluation. Section three outlines procedures for an administrator, in conjunction with the superintendent, to propose improvements in such matters as activities, costs, personnel, and  schedules. The last section covers the tracking of proposal implementation by means of professional, school, and program evaluations. Three appendixes provide sample documents and forms as well as references. Sample documents include guidelines for long-range planning, a proposal to utilize the Pennsylvania mathematics education information retrieval system, procedures for curriculum development, and a request to conduct a pilot project. Sample forms include transparency masters for PCMP presentations, and needs assessment, budget, and district evaluation forms. (PB)",

        "description":"This study discusses whether two tax programs instituted by local communities in Michigan to generate local economic activity have adversely affected local public elementary and secondary school financing. Analysis of the effects on school funding of The Plant Rehabilitation and Industrial Development Law of 1974 and its expansion in Act 255 of the Public Acts of 1978 is made difficult, according to the author, by inconclusive evidence as to the effectiveness of tax abatements in inducing growth of the tax base, and by the lack of an operational definition of what constitutes &quot;impairment&quot; of financial soundness. A general analysis of the Michigan Operating Aid Formula and of the situation for nine Kalamazoo County school districts indicates that while tax abatements do not appear  at present to have impaired the financial soundness of most school districts, in the long run the question of impairment hinges on the state aid formula reflecting the increasing costs of public services. Continued reliance on the state aid formula to forestall impairment is, the author concludes, a poor substitute for a rational policy on the use of tax exemptions. (JBM)",

The program's main objectives were to develop a knowledge-utilization approach to the improvement of instruction and student achievement in basic skills, and to develop and test strategies for installing and disseminating the approach. Findings indicate that successful implementation varied somewhat according to the commitment and understanding of key concepts of both principals and teachers. Of the eight elementary schools and one middle school participating in the field test, two schools ranked relatively high, four medium, and three low in overall levels of implementation. The moderate level of program implementation districtwide seemed to have  positive results for students. Results indicated a reversal of previous trends, with students attaining around the national average in reading and exceeding the national average in mathematics. Achievement gains showed a direct correspondence to levels of program implementation. Extensive appendixes include results of related analyses in Pennsylvania and Delaware, copies of data collection forms/instruments, summary indexes of program implementation levels, New Jersey district/principal self-assessment results, and implementation checklists for districts and principals.

Two frameworks--a taxonomy and an anatomy of intervention--provide a means of describing and analyzing the interventions of the two principals studied. The taxonomy defines six levels of intervention that distinguish the number of individuals targeted, the duration of the action, and the theme; the anatomy provides six dimensions that provide specific understanding and description of principals' behaviors as they intervene. Data based on the frameworks allow concrete, precise descriptions of the two principals' change facilitating styles. Use of these frameworks by principals could enhance  their change facilitation skills and so enable them more effectively to plan actions to support improvement efforts. Seven figures provide key concepts of the change process and analyses of the two principals' levels of intervention and intervention behaviors. (PB)",

        "description":"An examination of problems inherent to class size concepts suggests possible arrangements, given limited resources, for providing optimal classroom environments. Among the problems in determining class size are ambiguous definitions, measurement problems, and contradictory research findings. Traditional definitions of class size ignore such practices as team teaching, volunteers, and ability grouping. Class size measurement problems arise when researchers use such inconsistent measures as pupil-teacher ratio, averages, teacher contact hours, or teacher load. These measures tend to obscure qualitative differences. Class size research falls into three general categories: academic achievement, process variables (teacher innovation, teaching styles, and teacher load), and financial  dimensions. Academic achievement and process variables research produce contradictory results; research on costs, however, uniformly concurs that smaller classes cost more than larger ones. Given these problems, the study proposes building-level committees composed of the principal, several teachers, and parents who would focus on individual classes and contexts at the start of the academic year rather than on district-wide determinations of class size. Adjustment strategies available to such committees include modifying the distribution of instructional staff, altering instructional methods, altering the distribution of students, and eliminating negative factors such as the presence of disturbed children in large classes.

First, it is noted that there is a trend toward adoption of adjustments in school finance formulas to assist school districts in decline. Several different ways state formulas are adjusted are outlined, including &quot;hold harmless&quot; provisions, funding a percentage of decline, and averaging of prior years' student count. Next, a survey of 60 New Mexico superintendents is discussed, with the findings that 46 percent favored continued study of possible formula alterations, 28 percent felt  that enrollment decline should definitely be addressed in the formula, and 13 percent indicated that the formula should not address decline. Respondents made 43 suggestions about what form adjustments might take. The author concludes with a discussion of why he feels formula adjustments may run counter to efforts to distribute revenues equitably. He recommends that only severely impacted districts should receive assistance, and then only on a short-term basis. (JM)",

The physical deterioration of the schools is the result of a variety of factors--including the rapid increase in energy prices, state tax and expenditure limitation measures, and health and safety requirements--that have reduced spending for maintenance and capital improvements. Participating districts identified 14 major areas in need of immediate repair. The most serious and frequently mentioned (71 percent) involved roof repair and replacement, followed by heating, ventilating, and air conditioning repairs and replacement (27 percent), and interior remodeling and modernization (23 percent). One of the most costly repairs, cited by 19 percent of the responding school  districts, concerned boiler repair and replacement. Other important problems involved meeting requirements for the handicapped, new fire and safety codes, and asbestos removal. Separate tables for each district show budget allocations, deferred expenditures, and the top three priorities for maintenance and repair. (MLF)",

Nevertheless, since the 1977-78 school year, Illinois public schools have experienced 139 teacher strikes. The purpose of this report is to provide information to the State Board of Education for the purpose of considering whether a comprehensive law in Illinois would be helpful in normalizing the relationships between teachers and school boards. The first two sections of the document contain a variety of data: a brief discussion of the status of teacher/board bargaining in the state; legislative principles set forth by the State Board of Education; a  summary of state statutes that directly affect the teacher/board bargaining process; a comparison of two recently defeated comprehensive collective bargaining bills; and the preferences of the Illinois Association of School Boards regarding any bill that might pass in the Illinois General Assembly. The next section of the report explains the methodology and presents the findings from a study of nine states (selected because of their comparability to Illinois) that have collective bargaining laws covering public school teachers. The extent of strikes and the unique features of each state in regard to collective bargaining are described. The text concludes with staff observations gained from the study, and labor and management viewpoints concerning various bargaining statute provisions.

Studies of organizational dynamics have identified important structural variables that can be applied to school settings, including such variables as organizational linkages that affect instruction (particularly those among school specialists, principals, and teachers). These studies have also revealed effectiveness indicators, including staff perception of effectiveness and job satisfaction and student attitudes toward school. A project conducted at 89 schools in a midwestern state--37 schools with new and 52 with continuing principals--sampled the  opinions of teachers on organizational and instructional effectiveness by means of variously derived indexes that measured such institutional variables as intensity of work system interdependence, communication, school discipline, isolation, perceived organizational effectiveness, and indicators of job satisfaction; in addition, students responded to nine items describing their attitudes and the school climate. After the scored responses were averaged, no evidence was found either that principal succession has a significant effect on structural linkages or that succession increases or decreases organizational effectiveness. Further research should examine factors maintaining continuity in structures, possible time-lag effects of turnovers, and the pre- and postarrival phases of principal  succession. (JW)",

A sample of 85 schools was drawn from 16 Massachusetts school districts, half of which had experienced enrollment declines; the other half served as a control group. The analysis is based on the responses of 1,045 teachers, 38 percent of those eligible. Administrators who regularly visit classrooms and discuss work-related questions received more acceptance of their evaluative role. Percent of male teachers was inversely related to contact with supervision, a factor  that is confounded by grade level and sex of the administrator. Senior staff are more accepting of administrative authority and less enthusiastic about peer input. When joint teaching is a factor, teachers show signs of acceptance of peer judgments and less acceptance of administrative evaluations. While only 33 percent of the respondents said colleague evaluations should be very important or essential, in RIF decisions 54 percent would agree to peer observation of, and reports on, their teaching.

Long open-ended interviews were used to discover principals' views of their work, and each principal was observed at work for three full work days over an eight-week period. Researchers also observed classes and talked with teachers and students. The observers particularly looked at seven components of the instructional management model: a principal's personal characteristics, district characteristics, external characteristics,  principals' management behavior, school climate, instructional organization, and student outcomes. Data analysis led to modification of the conceptual framework. The observations produced three modified antecedent categories: principal characteristics, community context, and institutional context.

        "description":"To identify critical postimplementation events and school-related factors that affect the continuation of new classroom practices, qualitative data were collected in 14 elementary and secondary schools representing a mix of settings. Efforts to improve the schools' instructional programs in either basic skills, career education, or citizen education had been aided with formal school improvement activities. After 12 to 24 months, researchers, in a followup study, assessed the practices of teachers and administrators to determine whether the new practices were still being used. The data suggest that the most important factor supporting teachers' continuation of the new practices was support from the building administrator, though in some grades or departments support from other  teachers contributed to the continuation of practices. The revision of curriculum guides facilitated the continuation of practices and helped ease the adjustment of new teachers. Finally, assessment of effectiveness by teachers affected continuation of practices in two districts. Additional analysis examined school organizational factors that affected the likelihood of occurrence of these events. (MLF)",

        "description":"Effective schools are those that successfully impart basic computation and communication skills plus some knowledge of the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. School effectiveness should be measured by looking at the total learning environment and outcomes for all students. This environment consists of three identifiable aspects--ideology, social structure, and instructional practices--that cannot be assessed independently, but only as an interdependent system. Previous research suggests that, while much of the difference in achievement outcomes among urban schools can be explained by the student body's social status and/or racial composition, differing characteristics of the schools themselves greatly contribute to these differences. Ideologically, the more a school  expects from students generally, the more effective it will tend to be for all students. In terms of social structure, evidence suggests that the greater the differences in social status, and consequently in expectations, within the student body, the less effective the schools will be for the full range of students. Effective instructional practices seem to be those in which correct and clearly defined patterns of behavior are consistently reinforced. Although literature on effective schools is extensive, more research is needed to give tested, valid information about methods of improving school learning environments. (JBM)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes the first 18 months of Maryland's School Improvement through Instructional Process (SITIP) program, begun in fall 1980. Four general methods of data collection were used for the project: observation, interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis. Of Maryland's 24 local education agencies (LEAs)--Baltimore City plus 23 counties--19 submitted proposals and implemented plans responding to SITIP. Of 455 teacher-administrators at 58 schools in these 19 LEAs who were invited to respond to the general survey, 329 completed and returned it. The Maryland State Department of Education selected four categories of research-based innovations for improving academic instruction, including more active teaching and student team learning. Implementation strategies were  also limited to four, from districtwide to single school (lighthouse approach). The document provides planning, training, and implementation descriptions for the roles and responsibilities of state education agency staff, local educators, central office staff, school-based administrators, and teachers. Conclusions indicate that while, for example, state education agency staff should initiate and encourage participation, build and maintain commitment, and provide assistance as resource coordinators, teachers should carry out classroom implementation and function as &quot;project directors&quot; if administrators do not take on that responsibility.

This study utilized two images of school identified by Corwin: the rational bureaucracy (formally organized social structure in which activities have clearly defined patterns and are closely related to goals) and the natural system (social structure in which individual actions are not clearly related to organization goals, and there is little interdependence or centralized control). Data were collected from 13 elementary, junior high, and high schools by a questionnaire returned by 638 nonadministrative professionals. Three characteristics were identified that distinguish between  rational bureaucracies and natural systems: goal consensus, centralization of control, and extent of coordination. Contrary to expectation, elementary schools correspond best to the rational bureaucratic image, and high schools conform more to the natural systems image, with junior high schools in between. Further analysis suggested that the rational bureaucracy also correlates with small school or district size, a predominantly female, less educated staff, with high turnover, and substantial central office influence.

This variety of definitions should alert practitioners to the inadequacy of generalizing from these studies and the need to develop their own concept of effectiveness tailored to their particular situations. (2) The studies' lack of agreement on which characteristics most contribute to school effectiveness, and discrepancies between their conclusions and specific findings, should encourage practitioners to develop their own  list of situation-tailored effectiveness characteristics. (3) The reliability of the studies' results is made questionable by the use of standardized, norm-referenced tests as indicators of academic achievement and by other aspects of the studies' research techniques and strategies. (4) Practitioners should be aware that the studies indicate correlations rather than causal relations, and thus refrain from using the studies as a recipe for creating effective schools. They should also heed the studies' emphasis on the importance of characteristics' interaction over any single characteristic. (JBM)",

Interaction characteristics that occur at an early stage between the mother and handicapped child are also reviewed, along with the way parents tend to compensate for their child's language learning impairments. In addition, the research on the mother-child interaction is summarized, and basic implications for future research and remediation efforts are outlined. The six parameters of language development are as follows: (1) pragmatic development; (2) attention, discrimination, and cognitive development; (3) vocabulary; (4) syntactic and semantic development; (5) peer interaction; and (6) rate and frequency of use.  It is concluded that interventions designed to compensate for the dysfunctional nature of early dyadic interaction may have significant remedial potential. It is suggested that if dysfunctional aspects of interactions between handicapped children and their caregivers can be identified, then therapeutic changes might be made early in the parent-child relationship to facilitate communication development. Attention is also directed to the finding that normal and delayed infants behave similarly untl about 12 months, after which lower functioning children show less differentiation between their mothers' vocalizing and not vocalizing than the higher functioning children. A list of approximately 45 references is appended. (SEW)",

The first project examined patterns of social interaction and play behavior among preschool children in an integrated classroom. A longitudinal observation of four mild to moderately retarded Down's syndrome children (5 to 6.5 years old) and four nonhandicapped Ss (4.5 to 5 years old) was conducted. Results indicated that handicapped and nonhandicapped children preferred the same types of activities. Handicapped children most frequently selected handicapped playmates, and nonhandicapped children usually selected nonhandicapped playmates. Handicapped Ss spent more time engaged in solitary play than nonhandicapped Ss. The  second project described the specific social skills and interaction parameters exhibited by 15 normal, at risk, and handicapped preschoolers in a mainstreamed classroom. Handicapped children typically showed delays in social interaction skills commensurate with their general developmental delays; however, there was considerable variability across all types of Ss. Results suggest that altering either the settings or consequences for social interaction will result in increased interactions. Activities that bring the children into physical proximity and play equipment that require more than one child can enhance social interactions. Directly prompting or instructing a child to interact with another child or to enter an activity are also frequently successful. In some cases, teacher praise or  the contingent provision of some desirable activity or object when social interaction occurs are useful strategies. (Author/SEW)",

It is suggested that the myth that parents caused the child to be behaviorally disordered (BD) can interfere with the child's programing and growth and effective interaction with the families, who can be important sources of information. Another frequent myth, that there is someone capable of assessing behavior as good, bad, appropriate, or inappropriate, is linked to the belief of some educators that education is not nearly as important as psychiatric involvement. It is proposed that teachers can establish what a student can do in terms of academic skills and appropriate classroom behavior and that  educational system personnel should gather informal assessment data from parents, teachers, and others directly involved with the student. Additional myths include the following: the behaviors of the BD youngsters are qualitatively different from those of normal students; BD students can control their behavior if they really want to; labeling a youngster as BD causes irreparable harm; and \"normal\" students should be separated from the BD youngster to protect them from \"catching\" the behavior. Advantages and disadvantages of labeling are specified, along with examples of negative reactions by educators to labeling and classification. Finally, some conditions in the school whereby BD students/classes are isolated are noted. (SEW)",

It is suggested that four concerns need to be addressed in the development of an educational program: (1) developing a program philosophy and general program goals for BD students, (2) identifying staff roles, (3) establishing the procedures and structure for accomplishing program goals, and (4) deciding where in the district the BD program should be placed. The following advantages of developing a program description are noted: communication problems can be avoided; the building administrator can more effectively supervise the program; and public relations are enhanced when the school can communicate in clear terms. Role  descriptions for staff members, which can help to clarify individual and team responsibilities and simplify the hiring process, are discussed. The way that disciplinary procedures can be structured in the school setting to include most unacceptable behaviors is examined; and examples of extremely serious behaviors, serious behaviors, and moderately inappropriate behaviors are listed. The following materials developed by Monroe Middle School, Iowa, for a special class with integration for emotionally disabled students are presented: a program description, statements of role responsibilities, a policy for removal of a student from special education, and criteria for less/more restrictive environments.

In addition, five phases of the reintegration process are examined: (1) information on student/environment fit is incorporated into the individual education plan (IEP); (2) classroom selection is made at the time of the IEP staffing; (3) the student is kept involved in the general class environment; (4) the time the student spends in the general education  classroom is gradually increased; and (5) the student achieves the exit criteria, and reintegration becomes total. Questions to ask when gathering information about the teacher-student verbal interaction variable are included. Part II, by R. Werner, Jr., describes procedures and concepts helpful to special education personnel in planning for the re-entry of BD students from a restricted, separate placement into the regular school program. Attention is directed to systematic planning by the special education teacher, preparing the parents, preparing the regular class teacher, and preparing the student. It is emphasized that the special educator should prepare written descriptions of the history and current status of the BD student to aid the general education teacher. Examples of various  formats for reporting this information are included. (SEW)",

Attention is focused on positive strategies teachers can use to manage inappropriate behavior and to teach students alternative appropriate behaviors. The following components of prevention that contribute to a positive classroom atmosphere are considered: routines, rules and rewards; and signal interference, redirection, and humor. It is suggested that affective education courses can also help prevent misbehavior by increasing the student's self-management. The following techniques that can help solve behavior problems are also discussed: behavioral procedures that increase the frequency of target behaviors (positive reinforcement, &quot;token&quot;  systems, the Premack principle); behavioral procedures that decrease the frequency of target behaviors (extinction, time out, reinforcement of an alternative incompatible behavior); and behavioral approaches that teach new behaviors (modeling, demonstration, prompting, cueing, facing, and shaping). Additional approaches are also identified: contingency contracting to allow joint problem solving for teachers and students; and situational interviewing to involve teachers and students in shared resolution of problems. It is proposed that both problem solving and prevention strategies exist along continuums of internal to external control or student centered to teacher directed. Lastly, the importance of matching techniques to students' developmental and behavioral needs and incorporating  them into an overall positive management strategy is noted. (SEW)",

Exclusion is defined as the removal from, or the prohibition of, participating in the public school program in part or entirety, including suspension and explusion. Two overlapping pieces of federal legislation and their regulations are reviewed: Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended by P.L. 94-142, and Section 504 of P.L. 93-112, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The following issues are examined: (1) What is the relationship of a child's behavior to his/her identification as being handicapped, particularly for the seriously emotionally disturbed? (2) Are  there limits to a school's responsibility to provide a free appropriate public education to a handicapped child? (3) How should disciplinary matters related to handicapped children be decided? (4) What procedural safeguards are required if a school elects exclusion as an alternative? Court cases and OCR opinions are discussed that pertain to the concepts of the least restrictive environment for the child, the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE), and due process. Based on directions suggested by the courts and OCR for school districts, it is concluded that any permanent exclusion of a handicapped student probably violates the FAPE requirement. Ten annotations of court cases are appended. (SEW)",

The third section, on solutions to eating problems, presents instructions for 24 techniques, which are organized into  the following main categories (examples of techniques are in parentheses): preparation (of the feeding environment, self, and of the child); direction (establish reasonably achievable goals); measuring progress; resources (persons or media materials); nutrition (provision for nutritious, tasteful food); adaptive equipment (to best position child for functions such as eating); inhibition (use of verbal direction or stimulation); facilitation (use of imitation or aid for more normal jaw movement); and reinforcement. Included are a list of resource organizations, sources of adaptive equipment, and a glossary of about 110 terms. (MC)",

Project activities and accomplishments are discussed in regard to four major categories: needs assessment activities, products and publications, workshops and symposia, and technical assistance. Overviews are presented of the following needs assessment activities: 1980 and 1982  national state of the art studies of state involvement in CSPD activities (e.g., planning, needs assessment, and inservice training); the supply and demand of specific special education personnel; and trends in special education service delivery, training, and attrition within each state. Excerpts are appended of the projects' seven publications relating to CSPD development and implementation. In addition to the 1980 and 1982 CSPD survey reports, the other publications concern the Missouri Symposium on Doctoral Programming in Special Education and the following CSPD considerations: a manpower data management system, needs assessment, evaluation, and inservice education. The focus of the 1980 regional workshops was on the content and strategies involved in updating, establishing,  implementing, and evaluating CSPDs. Objectives of the 1982 workshops included providing technical assistance relative to CSPD components and presenting an example of computerized information sharing. (SEW)",

        "description":"The legitimacy of using the criterion of low reading achievement in the study of learning and memory skills with learning disabled children was assessed, based on a comparison of 35 nondisabled students, 15 low readers, and 10 learning disabled high school students. Learning disabilities were defined as encompassing perceptual and/or processing difficulties and a deficit in scholastic achievement of at least 3 years, while the low reading achievement category was distinguished by being at least 4 years below grade level. A series of 13 memory/learning tests and subtests was administered to each student individually in two or three 45 minute sessions. The findings indicated many similarities in the performance of learning disabled and low reading students, but also identified some  significant differences between these two groups, particularly in tasks involving visual input and/or visual processing. Analyses of tasks where the two groups differed significantly always found the low reading group performing better than the learning disabled group, with no significant differences between the low readers and the nondisabled subject in each of these cases. While there was overlap between the low reading and learning disabled populations, the data suggest that there are enough differences to preclude using these populations interchangeably under the generic title \"learning disabilities.\" It is concluded that there is a need to specify carefully the criteria used in sample selection, and to limit conclusions about research findings to the particular population studied.

The performance of 36 normal readers and 36 disabled readers in grades 4 through 7 was compared. Disabled readers had IQ scores of 87 or above and reading achievement of at least 1.7 years below grade level. The 12 symbol-word correspondneces were differentiated on the dimensions of consistency and conditionality. Differences between normal and disabled reader groups were observed to be specific to the presence of a rule within the set to be learned. When no rule was present and the set was consistent, reader groups performed similarly well. When no rule was present and the set  was inconsistent, reader groups performed similarly poorly. However, when a rule was present, which presumably could facilitate learning of the pairs, disabled readers performed significantly more poorly than normal readers. Disabled readers did not differ from normal readers in their ability to detect the rule within a set, as measured by a later transfer and verbalization task. Performance of normal and disabled readers on the paired associate task was not found to be significantly correlated with IQ score in either the rule or nonrule condition. Limited evidence also suggested that the presence of inconsistency in a task containing a rule more adversely affected the learning of disabled than that of normal readers. (Author/SEW)",

        "description":"Joint teacher and student development of a contingency management plan to help control disruptive behavior was explored with a class of 13 mildly mentally retarded elementary school children after several less extensive teacher directed contingencies were unsuccessful. All students in the self contained classroom had extensive school histories of various types of disruptive behavior, ranging from loud crying to theft and frequent fights. Five behaviors were identified as disruptive: out of seat behavior, off academic task behavior, throwing objects, name calling, and fighting. Attending behaviors, which were rewarded, were also distinguished: ontask behavior, finishing assignment, correcting assignment, ontime behavior, helping behavior, and listening. Group behavioral standards  were applied to individual students, and tokens were dispensed and response costs were collected from the individual students. Through group discussions, students defined the target behaviors, wrote class rules, and planned the token system, with the assistance of the teacher. Baseline observation began 6 days before the intervention was started, and a return to baseline was made after 21 days of intervention. The overall mean number of disruptive incidents fell 60 percent from the first baseline as a result of the intervention, but rose 14 percent upon return to baseline. It is suggested that the role of the intervention should be further clarified by a research design including a longer return to baseline, and possibly a pretest-posttest control group. (SEW)",

A summary is presented of some research evidence favoring special classes for the handicapped. Attention is also briefly directed to the legal basis for inclusion of handicapped students, including the following two issues: the right to education for the handicapped, and the type of placement. It is noted that since implementation of federal laws protecting the right of every child to a free, public education, expert opinion has continued to be a  major force in the decision of inclusion of the handicapped. Teachers' attitudes concerning the mainstreamed handicapped child and cooperative learning procedures designed to promote peer acceptance of the handicapped child are discussed. The resource section provides lists for each handicap on simulation activities, teaching activities, trade books with a story line about the handicap, teacher materials, pamphlets, audiovisuals, and agencies that can provide additional information.

Spontaneous language samples were videotaped and audiotaped in conversation with the experimenter, a peer, and the S's mother. Samples were evaluated in terms of linguistic maturity, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Contrary to the results of previous studies which have been generalized to the entire population of learning disabled children, findings suggested that auditory and visual processing deficits may contribute differentially to the oral language competence of learning disabled children.

Explained are such technological aspects as the characteristics of electronically based devices which permit special students to have access to technological applications in education. Emphasized is reluctance of private firms to develop aids due to the &quot;thin&quot; market, and noted are roles of individuals and organization in developing aids with federal funds. Described to aid communication of four exceptionalities are the following devices (examples are in parentheses): (1) partially sighted (high powered lenses, television cameras and systems), (2) blind (readers, recording, Braille system), (3)  hearing impaired (speech interpretation, voice recognition components), and (4) nonvocal physically handicapped (special menus on the computer display, voice recognition/microcomputer systems). Six organizations which make communication devices are listed. Among factors described as affecting use of communication aids are need for information about availability, need for staff training in local schools, and imaginative funding. The summary both synthesizes information presented and makes such forecasts as that there will be a wider range of communication aids available in the next five years. (MC)",

It was found that the concept of units and levels of analysis is evident in Soviet psycholinguistic research. The development of this and other methodological principles, explicated by Vygotsky in the 1920's is traced and their application to recent Soviet psycholinguistics is discussed. The emphasis is on the interrelationships between the various levels of consciousness, neurophysiological levels, and levels of language ability; the role of memory in speech production; and categories of linguistic utterance. Leontev's theory on the process of generation of utterances is  reviewed and offered as a general model of human language ability. The salient points in Vygotsky's and Leontev's models are then applied to the study of meaning, word, and vocabulary in Soviet psycholinguistics. The focus is on language and thought, meaning and sense, the role of words in language activity, the relationship between grammar and lexis, the search for words in speech production, and types of vocabulary.

To provide a better understanding of the position of English, a brief historical sketch is provided, with emphasis on the development of bilingualism and recommendations regarding instruction in both languages. The discussion of bilingualism includes a discussion of the emergence of language groups; quantitative trends; sociological patterns of bilingualism including education, marriage, and home language; and social institutions and patterns of social interaction. The section on language teaching policy discusses quantitative trends in the study of the official languages as  well as English, German, Russian, and French, and the development of language teaching policy. Finally, the position of English in society and in the educational system is discussed. It is noted that growing contacts between Finland and the other European countries and the United States have meant the growing influence of English and the growing impact of Anglo-American cultural models. Numerous statistical tables are appended. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Stop consonants after initial /s/ are standardly spelled as the unvoiced stops /p/, /t/, and /k/. Phonetically, however, they are similar to the voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /g/. Research suggests that many young children make consistent, reasonable, but unconventional, judgments about sounds and English spelling. This paper considers the case of the classification of stop consonants after initial /s/. The first experiment used a spelling test and a sound test. The spelling test asked 76 kindergarten and first-grade children what letters they used to spell the second sounds of syllables beginning with /s/-stop clusters. The sound test asked children to pronounce the syllables that remained when /s/ was deleted from syllables with initial /s/-stop clusters. This experiment found  that some children consistently classify stops after /s/ as voiced. They spell /spo/ with B rather than P, and they state that /spo/ becomes /bo/ when s is deleted. Such nonstandard responses become less frequent as reading and spelling skills increase. In a second experiment, 24 university students were given spelling and sound tests that used the same lists of stimuli as Experiment 1. Experiment 2 confirmed that literate adults classify stops after /s/ as unvoiced, and that some adults are not very much aware of the phonetic similarity between stops after /s/ and voiced stops.

        "description":"The project studied a critical aspect of school performance, how children know how to display interactional competence during classroom lessons. Using videotapes of classroom lessons and interviews with participants, the study analyzed the language used by teachers and students as well as their physical behaviors to infer the knowledge needed for learners to function successfully. The participants in the study were teachers and students in a kindergarten, a second- and a fifth-grade classroom in which Spanish and English were the language of instruction. The findings were that in order to be interactionally competent, students must be able: (1) to recognize when lessons and episodes begin and end; (2) to know and follow the rules which govern them in order to participate  appropriately by listening, soliciting a turn-at-talk, and/or responding to a teacher initiated turn as well as to initiate the negotiation of new episodes. These findings suggest that teachers facilitate the acquisition of classroom interactional competence and student learning by having consistent and clear instructional practices. These understandings provide an improved basis for establishing appropriate and equitable classroom experiences for monolingual and bilingual students and for recognizing the importance of not assuming that students need no help in learning classroom procedures.

        "description":"A proposal that the English as a second language (ESL) curriculum should initially focus on psycholinguistic reading is discussed. It is claimed that effective reading is difficult to achieve using the present ordering of the ESL curriculum. This is because of the heavy focus on learning active command of grammatical detail during the early, formative period of language training. That is, the focus on grammatical contrasts emphasizes the very structures that will hinder reading. Structural contrasts should be subordinated to pragmatic uses of language (i.e., to content). It is suggested that content is not only the goal of reading but the means by which reading is made efficient. Examples of Hebrew, which is written without most vowels, are provided to illustrate that words can  be understood without them. It is claimed that although normal English does contain vowels, they are not important for reading purposes. Examples are also provided of \"tlgrfx\" in the native language. Reading of tlgrfx-texts can help train the ESL learner to ignore vowels in an appropriately general way. The point is to avoid requiring active command of structures, from phonetics to syntax and lexicon. These psycholinguistic techniques can be used in the beginning in small quantities in an existing curriculum. A strategy for placing vocabulary in reading lessons is suggested. Emphasis is placed on comprehension rather than on the more detailed type that tends to become memory work. Russian language examples are also included. (SW)",

Rights properly considered also carry with them obligations; in this case, minority language speakers would have obligations toward the language of the majority. Two considerations in the area of minority and majority claims and counterclaims relate to economics and to the concept of \"mediating structures.\" Economic considerations relate to the costs and benefits of different policies, as evaluated by the different language groups. These evaluations affect the extent to which formally enunciated rights and obligations are honored in practice. With regard to policy, its aim should be to minimize the  perceived costs of a pluralistic approach and to maximize the perceived benefits to all concerned. The second set of considerations on \"mediating structures\" is shown to be relevant for policies governing the education of language minorities. The controlling aim should be to enable the minority family and its children to negotiate the \"megastructures\" of society. The mediating structures--neighborhoods, churches, voluntary associations, and the like--would assist the families in the negotiation. (Author/AMH)",

Largely due to lack of available information, teachers and administrators have often proceeded under the erroneous assumptions that Franco language and cultural patterns are essentially similar to mainland French language and culture. Consequently, to a large extent the educational and social needs of Franco children have not been met by the public school systems. In many cases, such treatment was due to ignorance of the Franco sociocultural context, but in other instances it was a result of discrimination and ridicule. On the other hand, examples of school systems where Franco children have benefited from  bilingual education programs are also documented. This study also documents the extent of the preservation of French culture in New England. The pull between the maintenance of Franco traditional culture and values and the political realities of American life is felt perhaps most keenly by those of college age. Examples are given of attempts by sociopolitical organizations and action by Franco student groups at the university level and by a small cadre of Franco educators. (AMH)",

It is noted that cooperation and peace may be linked to developing successful programs in the non-Western world. The brief time that students spend in the host country enables the student to describe what the foreign values seem to be, but probably without penetrating deeply into why those structures operate as they do. The students are more likely to gain new perspectives on their own ideas and behavior. It is necessary to travel, experience, and study in these parts of the world in order to gain awareness of the people and life. To make the encounter as insightful as possible an orientation is very important. In addition to the obvious topics such as passports, clothing, and health needs,  other matters are more subtle, such as the appropriate gifts to take, information about travel on site, receiving/sending mail or phone messages, and warnings peculiar to each country. Orientation should also make students more fully aware of themselves as Americans, since they will stand out as Americans and probably as whites, and will discover a host of stereotypes attached to them. Finally, appropriate coursework in preparation for foreign study is important. The student should be familiar with the history and current politics of the host nation, and the daily habit of reading a newspaper from the host coutnry is valuable. The difficulties of encountering the Kenya culture and constraints felt by American students studying in China are briefly addressed. (SW)",

The following arguments are proposed: (1) ethical and legal strategies are insufficient to accomplish the aim of an affirmative action program, and (2) a pragmatic strategy, which appeals to the interests of both the majority and minority, is necessary for the success of an affirmative action program. The following principles of philosophical ethics, which are open to conflicting interpretations, are briefly explained: compensatory justice, distributive justice, and formal equality. There are problems with basing affirmative action on grounds of  legality, since the legal grounds may shift, and the reporting of results is often based on \"good faith\" effort, rather than a showing of substantial results. The pragmatic approach is based on utility, measured in terms of results or consequences. It is suggested that future demographic changes in postsecondary education will likely result in a buyer's market for minority students. Therefore, it is in the self-interest of colleges to recruit and retain minority students, and to increase the number of minority staff. (SW)",

Two specific concerns are the need to provide specific and well-written course descriptions in the general catalog, and to substantiate whether a course requiring a prerequisite is actually sequential. General education, which provides essential subject matter, precedes the selection of specialized courses within a degree program. Each college/university needs to have clearly written statements pertaining to general education. From the philosophy on general education, specific objectives for students need to be developed cooperatively by  faculty members and administrators. Ten criteria are proposed for selecting academic deans and faculty members who will serve on a general education council for the purpose of monitoring required courses. Six criteria for professional education courses are specified, and three descriptions of general education are also presented. (SW)",

In addition, 13 issues pertinent to the program design are addressed, along with the following: perceptions of the program by the deans who attended one or two workshops, the reactions of chairperson participants and the extent to which they were able to make the changes they contemplated at the end of each workshop,  informal benefits of the program, unexpected insights, problems of instituting change, and the contribution of the workshop for solving problems noted by participants. Finally, dean and chairperson questionnaires and response data are included. Additional areas covered by the questionnaires include individual background information, and the time allocation for, and importance of, chairpersons' activities. (SW)",

Attention is also directed to issues related to the responsibilities of the community colleges and secondary schools,  funding of community colleges, and politics and the community college. It is suggested that marketing and strategic planning are essential for community college survival.

Students who received fellowship support believed that the project experience had been most effective in increasing their abilities to engage in an internship, work with a mentor, strengthen network ties, and write a  research report. According to participants, other factors that distinguished this program from a typical doctoral program included interdisciplinary contact, support for research services and travel, and exposure to a range of issues of interest to minorities and women. A majority of participants believed the project experiences enhanced the employability of students. Several measures indicated that both the production and utilization of research increased as a result of the project. (SW)",

Tinto conceived of the attrition/retention process as a series of sociopsychological interactions between the characteristics students bring with them to college and their experiences while enrolled. Usable responses to a questionnaire were received from 1,105 college freshmen at summer orientation, and after the first academic year 723 freshmen were assessed. Attention was directed to the major constructs of Tinto's model: background characteristics, including family background, individual attributes, and pre-college schooling; academic aspiration; commitment to staying at the college; and  academic and social integration. With some few exceptions, the results are consistent with those of the earlier work and with theoretical expectations based on the model. A significant compensatory interaction between levels of goal and institutional commitment were found, indicating that institutional commitment had its greatest positive influence on retention for students with comparatively low levels of commitment to completing a college degree, and vice versa.

The following conditions were involved: a contingency manipulation resembling an aptitude test; an instructor lecture; two levels of student incentive; and an achievement test based on the lecture material. A total of 296 University of Manitoba students participated. Following an incentive manipulation, students wrote an aptitude test providing contingent, noncontingent, or no feedback, and responded to an attribution questionnaire. All students then observed a low or high expressive instructor, and completed an achievement test and an attribution questionnaire. After the contingency manipulation,  noncontingent students reported less perceived control and made less internal attributions to their performance on an aptitude test. Post-lecture results indicated that the highly expressive instructor increased achievement and self-confidence in contingent compared to noncontingent students in low incentive conditions. The findings suggest that exposure to noncontingent outcomes can impair some aspects of a student's academic development. (Author/SW)",

One of the important changes that occurred after the fiscal crisis in 1975 was that entry to CUNY's senior colleges became more difficult. Another change was the implementation in 1977 of a more stringent and precisely defined retention policy. Students were required to earn credits at a specific rate and with a gradually increasing grade point average. In 1976, a new, more far-reaching policy of skills assessment testing was initiated. It was mandated that incoming freshmen take skills assessment tests in the areas of reading, writing, and mathematics, and university-wide minimum competency standards were set. In addition, CUNY's free tuition policy  was affected by the fiscal crisis, and beginning in fall 1976, tuition was changed for the first time. Modifications in fiscal and academic policies have resulted in the following: student enrollments declined from 250,000 to 200,000 between 1975 and 1976; the proportion of minorities has increased sharply, while the proportion of white ethnics has fallen substantially (minorities were more likely to qualify for full state financial aid); the percentages of freshmen taking remedial courses has increased; and the dropout rates have greatly increased.

He proposes the idea that the courts, without constitutional warrant, have struck down actions by legislative bodies and brought about new rights (i.e., government by judicial decree). He suggests that government by judicial decree has promoted the view that the only avenue to justice lies through the courts. An erosion of restraint by the courts has occurred in matters of standing, ripeness, mootness, and political questions. At the same time, there has been an expansion of several doctrines by which state and federal statutes have been declared unconstitutional, in particular, the analyses that have multiplied so-called \"fundamental  rights\" and \"suspect classes.\" In addition, there has been an extravagant use of mandatory injunctions and remedial decrees. The lack of judicial restraint has led to a substitution of judicial judgment for legislative and executive judgment. Lawyers should urge self-restraint upon the courts and nonjudicial routes to justice. Finally, the law school curriculum should include the law and legal institutions of America's founding period.

In &quot;Continuity and Change in the Brothers' Educational Mission,&quot; Lawrence Angus notes that the influence of lay teachers and aging membership of the Christian Brothers is changing CBC. In &quot;Cultural Reproduction of the Labour Market: Work-Experience at CBC,&quot; Peter E. Watkins suggests that at CBC a common cultural function was indicated where family, religion, school, and work experience cultural  traits merged and coalesced. Reproduction occurred through the continual movement of students into complex organizational relationships. In &quot;Reproduction and Contestation: Class, Religion, Gender and Control at Christian Brothers College,&quot; Richard J. Bates notes that control over administration, discipline, and curriculum was contested and a process of transformation was hastened by the increasing lay proportion of the faculty body. (SW)",

        "description":"A 10-year followup was conducted of a study that examined the effectiveness of expert consultation and student feedback provided to college faculty. A 1978 study (Aleamoni) found significant improvement in student ratings for a group of instructors receiving student feedback and expert consultation in comparison to a group of instructors receiving student feedback alone. An assessment was undertaken with 28 of the 33 instructors who participated in the original 1971 study and had voluntarily used the Course/Instructor Evaluation Questionnaire after the termination of the original study. The number of times instructors had engaged in individual consultations or had participated in instructional workshops during the followup period was also assessed. It was found that instructors  who had participated in consultation received higher student ratings and used student ratings and instructional services more throughout the followup interval. Despite methodological difficulties in the research, it is concluded that the usefulness of student rating feedback is ensured only when integrated with a system of instructional support. (SW)",

A sample of 284 private coeducational colleges was drawn from the Council for Financial Aid to Education's (CFAE) annual survey of voluntary support (1976-1977 to 1980-1981). The three variables (expenditures, endowment, and voluntary support) were obtained from the CFAE report and were used to calculate an index for each institution. The sample was segmented into six categories: Carnegie classification, date of founding, size of enrollment, number of alumni solicited for purposes of fund raising, geographic region, and religious affiliation). The index was used to identify characteristics from the six segments,  which are indicators of financial strength and weakness among institutions in the sample. Of the six characteristics, two factors were critical in determining a private college's financial viability: the size of the alumni base and enrollment at the institution. Data analysis identified institutions that are insured of long-term survival and institutions whose future remains doubtful. (Author/SW)",

Following initial calls to 2,922 household phones, a total of 490 families with school-age children at home were identified. Findings indicate that in families with young children, parents view television with their children about half of the time during evening hours; however, family conversations concerning the viewing occur only about 10% of the time. Only about 8% of the families studied watch television programs for educational purposes, and more than half of the parents do not think their  children learn from television programs. Family parameters, home environment, child parameters (e.g., age) appear to influence family usage of television, while the number of parents present in the family does not.

        "description":"The influence of two sources of individual differences in acquiring knowledge from maps was studied: abilities and learning procedures. Twenty-five undergraduate students provided verbal protocols while attempting to learn two maps, and six effective learning procedures were identified: partitioning, imagery, memory-directed sampling, pattern encoding, relation encoding, and evaluation. Visual spatial ability was highly correlated with recall of spatial attributes of the map and with overall learning performance, while associative memory ability was most correlated with verbal attribute recall. Subject-selected procedures for encoding spatial information and assessing learning progress also distinguished the behavior of successful and less successful learners. However, subjects  of high and low ability differed little in the study procedures they chose. Although both ability differences and procedures were important contributors to performance, a direct comparison indicated that abilities are most predictive of map learning. It was concluded that the use of effective study procedures can influence map learning performance and that high-ability subjects benefit more from the use of these procedures than low-ability subjects. This report includes 27 references and an appendix detailing learning procedures observed in the protocols. (LMM)",

        "description":"This 10-section report on the activities of the Open University of the United Kingdom as an innovative institution with a concern for democratization of higher education begins with a discussion of the criteria for an innovative organization. The origins of the University and the intentions of its early planners are then discussed, followed by a description of development of objectives in the advisory and planning committee stages. Both the major academic programs (undergraduate, continuing education/associate student, and higher degree), as they have evolved since 1969, and related programs such as institutional evaluation and research, academic research, international activities and marketing are covered in section 4. Additional sections (1) describe the University's  multimedia, distance teaching approach, including assessment and certification; (2) present information on the student population; (3) provide a resume of published information on the University's cost efficiency in comparison with others in Great Britain; and (4) present an overall evaluation of the institution's success, and the extent to which the system can be generalized elsewhere. A comprehensive bibliographic essay, reviewing the literature on the Open University concludes the report. A 5-page reference list, 10 figures, and 24 tables are included. (LMM)",

Knowledge is orderly and cumulative; information is random and miscellaneous and may be collected simply because it is there. The information industry is flourishing, but knowledge institutions--colleges, universities, and libraries--go begging. The knowledge industry is actually being transformed and to some extent displaced by the information industry. Libraries must make use of computer technology, but they must also remain fortresses of knowledge which is still preserved mainly in books. Similarly, libraries must be repositories of information, but also places of refuge from the tidal waves of information--and misinformation. The autonomous reader, amusing and &quot;knowledging&quot; himself, should be the be-all and  end-all of libraries.

        "description":"The first phase of a three-phase program, this study determined the functions entailed in information work and identified the number of individuals who exercise these functions in a survey of 1,193 establishments in state and local government, industry, and academia. The survey revealed that there were over 1.64 million information professionals employed in 1980. Out of every 10, 7 were in the industrial sector, with another 2 in state and local governments and the remaining 1 in the federal government or in colleges and universities. The survey showed that not only colleges and universities but also industry and government contributed to the education and training of information workers. There were 1,493 unique occupational titles used for classifying individuals who perform  information functions. Six generic groups of information professionals were identified, namely managers of information, information operations coordinators, information systems specialists, information intermediaries, information theorists, and educators of information workers. This final report on the methodology of the study and its findings includes a 163-item bibliography and 79 tables. Appendices comprise a sample questionnaire and cover letter, a description of the Manpower Consortium for the Information Profession (MCIP), and three lists: Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes used in the study, organizations of interest to information workers, and United States and Canadian programs of study in information.

An evaluation form completed by the librarian for each online reference search recorded such information as search date; status of requestor; printed sources consulted and time involved; online databases used with time and cost figures; and a statement as to whether the search was successful. This paper summarizes the information collected on the evaluation forms and identifies at least five major categories of questions that are feasible for online reference, particularly in a large academic library: (1) directory-type information; (2) literature retrieval on a limited scale; (3)  bibliographic verification of specific works; (4) definitions or explanations of concepts or acronyms; and (5) location of book reviews. It is noted that a detailed statistical study showed that the actual nature of a question was what seemed to determine search success or failure. Five tables and seven references are provided.

It was concluded that although the computer-assisted approach utilized at UNO allows for greater efficiency in data analysis, the UIUC manual approach can provide similar results at considerably less cost in libraries without access to data processing equipment. In addition, the UIUC survey form was found to be easy to modify in order to accommodate analysis of reference activity in  general or specific aspects of subjects depending on the need and the environment where the survey is conducted.

The last section outlines the assistance that centralized resource services can provide at the board or district level. An annotated bibliography covers the library resource center, the teacher-librarian's role, the use of media in learning programs, learning skills, and curriculum design. Additional ministry documents and Canadian periodicals are also listed. (LMM)",

This report consolidates, organizes, and interprets the quantitative research evidence concerning the roles, activities, job contexts, and effects of external linking agents and agencies on school improvement outcomes, and examines the role of the external linking agent in terms of a larger set of internal and external factors that affect these outcomes. Five issues are addressed specifically: (1) recent research findings implications concerning linking agents; (2) linking agent roles in actual practice; (3) evidence concerning the effects and  outcomes of linking agents' efforts; (4) implications of recent studies for the selection, training, and support of linking agents; and (5) study implications for the initiation, continuation, or modification of efforts employing linking agents to improve United States schools in the l980's.

To assist library decision-makers when planning for the initial installation of OPAC's or the enhancement of existing systems, this volume evaluates and integrates the findings detailed in the first two. Because the system/patron interaction is central to the study, a conceptual model for online catalog research which illustrates the user interface for an interactive system is presented. A project overview discusses objectives, methodologies, data collection and analysis. Summaries are provided  of findings obtained through self-administered questionnaires for OPAC users and non-users, as well as through focus group interviews and transaction log analysis. Findings are discussed both generally and then specifically in a question-answer format, and areas for additional research are suggested. Six references are listed. Four appendices include pretest and final user and nonuser questionnaires. (Author/LMM)",

To determine whether these functions are served by discrete courses, findings from a survey of science, social science, and science-related technology instructors were analyzed. The analysis revealed: (1) the literature-identified curriculum functions were necessary and  sufficient--all 1,244 course sections studied could be classified by one or more of the four functions; (2) 34% of the courses served one function, 45% served two functions, 20% served three functions, and 1% served all four functions; (3) transfer was the strongest discrete function and general education the weakest; (4) the transfer function was served in 72% of the sections, general education in 53%, preparation for work in 39%, and remediation in 7%; (5) the highest proportion of courses serving a single function was found in Engineering and the lowest proportion in Agriculture; and (6) the function of courses varied within academic areas.

The first section provides background on the functions of the Board from 1968 through 1978, a period characterized by a trend toward centralization and the reduction of university control. Recommendations by the Commission on the Future of Florida's Public Universities, which gave university presidents a potential political power-base through their advisory boards, and the attempt and failure of the Board to achieve constitutional status are highlighted. The second section examines legislative actions that attempted to ensure that Florida public universities had the freedom and governance structure essential to achieving the goal  of educational quality, and the resultant reduction of the Board's authority. In addition, efforts to abolish the Board and the formation and effects of the Joint Legislative and Executive Commission on Postsecondary Education and the Postsecondary Education Planning Commission are reviewed. The third section examines the causes of radical transformation of the governance structure of higher education, which included presidential dissatisfaction with centralized control and the failure of the Board to fulfill one of its key missions and provide leadership in a number of areas. The final section explains the current governance structure, citing the vagueness and probable overlap of the functions of numerous planning and coordinating bodies. (AYC)",

The next section outlines partnership formation, with a discussion of necessary conditions for change; describes program features in the five cities studies; cites the mutual benefits achieved by a particular school and corporation; and discusses other related issues. A management model is  presented for beginning partnerships and the three complementary themes characteristic of successful partnerships are discussed.

The baseline survey, the first part of a program impact analysis, provides a highly descriptive profile of the characteristics and needs of the target population served by Project Redirection in four experimental sites across the country and four other sites matched for comparison. Chief among the findings were that: (1) the young women were educationally disadvantaged; (2) their work experience was considerable and they were positively oriented toward work; (3) contraception was neither effectively nor consistently practiced and many continued to expose  themselves to repeat pregnancies; (4) community services were used but a number of needs remained unmet; (5) informal supports played an important role, especially with regard to child care and emotional support; (6) most girls came from disadvantaged home backgrounds and most continued to live with their mothers. The report concludes that the long-term prospects of the young women for economic self-sufficiency are not promising and that their trajectories need redirecting.

Following an introductory chapter, chapter II examines characteristics of the four sites where programs were set up to recruit teens and to maintain enrollment levels throughout the demonstration, and describes the structure of the program, as defined by staffing levels and service linkage. Chapter III deals with the capacity of the sites to maintain and strengthen the key elements of the program model, and describes how the program attempted to bring about change in teens' behavior. Chapter IV presents the &quot;community woman&quot; component, a volunteer service  described as the most innovative of the program's features. Chapter V examines the effectiveness of sites in scheduling services for teens and how intensively participants utilized these services, and also discusses length of stay and other issues of participation. The chapter concludes with an analysis of program costs, focusing on unit costs and the costs of site operations. Finally, chapter VI summarizes the key implementation lessons and their implications for replicating Project Redirection. Appendices provide an account of the experiences of two of the sites (Boston and Detroit), a sample individual participant plan, and a bibliography. (CMG)",

The study had two purposes: (1) to identify ways of managing urban high schools to produce excellence, and (2) to recommend policy-relevant guidance to existing school and district administrators. The study design focused on the testing of two specific theories for managing schools: school effectiveness theory and organizational excellence theory. On the basis of preliminary results, the report tentatively concludes that schools are more amenable to management initiatives than originally thought. In addition, there are indications that the sources of managerial initiative are much more diverse and complex than the single organization implicit in the school effectiveness or managerial excellence  theories, both of which tend to treat the school as the sole source of managerial control over itself. In contrast, a degree of collaboration has been found which suggests a pattern in which schools and districts &quot;co-manage&quot; the school in specific ways that produce desirable outcomes.

The hearings, dated March 15 and April 9, 1984, were conducted in order to evaluate and reauthorize the special supplemental food program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), due to expire in 1984. Testimony came from staff from the General Accounting Office, state and local family health and nutiriton officals, U. S. Senators, local WIC program directors, professors of nutrition and maternal and child health, the president of the National Association of WIC Directors, and the director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The evaluation focused on, among other matters, the effectiveness of WIC in increasing birth weight, lowering  infant mortality, decreasing the percentage of infants with anemia, improving the nutritional state of women with poor weight gain during pregnancy, and the health program's capacity to function preventively. The document closes with a cost-benefit analysis of the WIC program, prepared by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. (RDN)",

The first part of the monograph concentrates on desegregation as it has been assumed to, as well as it actually appears to, relate to school academic effectiveness. The second part of the monograph addresses what is known about school academic effectiveness and the structural conditions under which it would appear attainable, whether schools are desegregated or not. The concluding recommendations concern: (1) individualizing instruction in desegregated schools; (2) other less expensive methods for initiating change at schools with many low achieving students; (3) an increased emphasis on teaching basic skills; (4) implementation in desegregated schools of grading practices  that minimize the weight given to previous achievement; (5) an emphasis on consistent student grading practices; (6) an emphasis on discipline at both segregated and desegregated schools; (7) individualized approaches to accomodate learning style and linguistic differences; (8) structural changes in both segregated and desegregated secondary schools; (9) revision of inhibiting teacher-contract rules; (10) revised grade-structure arrangements; (11) less emphasis on &quot;gradual&quot; improvement; and (12) the key role of the courts in improving achievement.

Four sample populations were studied: junior high school students, senior high school students, college students, and adult professionals. This report considers: (1) project activities; (2) sampling; (3) data collection; (4) research instrumentation; (5) coding and computer programming; (6) the analysis of the adult professional sample in terms of sample characteristics; family background; extracurricular activities; academic factors; persons influencing selection of high school mathematical courses; math-related activities; self-assessment of math abilities;  attitudes toward math class and math teachers; favorite and least favorite subjects; factors and persons influential in selecting occupations, college majors and math courses; math and society; and personal and psychological variables; and (7) model building. Recommendations are offered in three areas where additional effort is required to overcome the larger problem of black underrepresentation in scientific and technical occupations: (1) black family and community life; (2) school and curricular issues; and (3) personal factors. Attachments to the report present data analyzed from the high school and the junior high school sample populations and are entitled: \"The Quantitative Orientation of Black High School Students\" (Donna Jean Blackwell, 1983 doctoral dissertation) and \"Psychosocial  Influences on the Math Attitudes and Interests of Black Junior High School Students\" (Robert C.

The guide describes instruments used throughout the program and gives advice on implementing the workshops. It then outlines a typical workshop session and enumerates the responsibilities of coordinators and facilitators.

Aides formed the largest employee group, and certified teachers formed the next largest. Most Chapter 1 students received &quot;pullout&quot; instruction. Chapter 1 programs were usually small, with two-thirds of the districts having ten or fewer students  enrolled at each grade level. Over half of all public schools conducted programs, most running for 32 weeks. While elementary students in Chapter 1 programs typically spent 2.5 hours per week in a program class, high school students typically spent 4 hours. The highest percentage of students came from early grades. In 1982-83, Chapter 1 programs were generally effective in improving the achievement level of participating students. Oregon's results compared favorably with those of other states, especially in reading (at most grade levels). (KH)",

(HCOP was a summer program designed to reach academically talented minority or educationally disadvantaged students interested in pursuing careers in the health-care professions and to help them attain their educational goals.) Analysis of pre- and post-test results for 1983 showed that gains were made by all levels of participants. Comparison of 1982 and 1983 results revealed superior student performance levels in 1983, a  phenomenon attributed to the larger pool of applicants in 1983 and to staff awareness of the assessment data for 1982, which facilitated better program focus in 1983.

Data is presented on student characteristics, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and other test scores, high school records, and college plans. For the purpose of comparison, each table contains statistics from previous years, and some tables include national data. Among the significant findings are the following: The Connecticut SAT verbal average of 436 was ten points above the 1983-84 national average and three points above the previous year's average for Connecticut. On the SAT verbal, Connecticut males averaged 443 and females 430 (the greatest difference between the male and female average in the past ten years). The mean SAT mathematical score for  males was 490 and, for females, 447. These differences between scores of males and females were also evident nationally. The mean grade point average was 2.96 for females and 2.82 for males (both were below the national average). With the exception of female participation rates in athletics, the 1983-84 participation rates of Connecticut students in high school activities generally declined from the levels of five and ten years ago. The intended area of college study has shifted from the arts and humanities, the biological sciences, and the social sciences toward business, commerce and communications, and the physical sciences. Finally, the percent of female students intending to study education has dropped from 13% ten years ago to 6.8% and the percent of male students intending to study  education declined from 4% to 1.7%. Among students intending to study education, average SAT scores were lower than the state average of all students. (KH)",

Chapter 1 underscores the growth and importance of union-management cooperation and discusses union and management attitudes toward cooperation. Chapter 2 presents an overview of theories and discusses the models of change and cooperation in unionized settings employed to guide this research and the specific research issues treated. Chapter 3 details research design, measures of study variables, and analytical techniques employed; and summarizes characteristics of the 38 research sites and methodological findings. Chapter 4 describes structural characteristics of the  six types of interventions studied: Scanlon, Rucker, and Improshare Plans; Labor-Management Committees; Quality Circles; and Quality of Worklife Programs. Chapter 5 deals with results of the process leading to cooperation and some of the conditions necessary to implement and maintain a cooperative program. Chapter 6 presents the results of the analysis of performance at the research sites. Some of the time-series data sets on these variables are as long as 8 years. Eleven case studies highlight significant issues involved in the practice of cooperative union-management relations. Chapter 7 summarizes research methodology and findings and offers a future research agenda. Findings, found in chapters 4-6 and summarized in chapter 7, indicate that: (1) the six interventions vary significantly  in philosophy. (2) No intervention is a substitute for competent management, good union-management relations, or responsible union leadership. (3) Bonus formulas are an excellent means of equitably sharing organizational improvements. (4) The cooperative process requires neutrals and consulting expertise. (5) Unions have less confidence in the cooperative process than management. (6) Union-management cooperation can lead to significant improvements in productivity. (7) There is a need to study unsuccessful cases. In addition, through this research, seven areas for future research and investigation have been identified and are listed in the concluding pages.

        "description":"Entrepreneurship education has been of national concern for many years. In the early 1970s, the major thrust of Federal leadership was directed toward the expansion of minority businesses. Following a Presidential Executive Order, a cabinet-level Interagency Council for Minority Business Enterprise was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1971. The issue then, as it is today, was to address the dramatic lag in minority participation in American business ownership. Recognizing that education and training were at the heart of the problem, the Council requested the then-Department of Health, Education and Welfare to establish a task force on education and training for minority business enterprise. That task force, which held hearings and conducted in-depth studies, concluded  that the high failure rate of minority-owned businesses and the critical element in business survival and growth were related to management capabilities. From this task force came many instructional materials for entrepreneurship education, including those developed by the National Center for Vocational Education, that are in wide use today. The present Administration is committed to the further development of minority-owned businesses, with a goal of the formation of at least 60,000 new minority businesses and the expansion of a similar number over the next 10 years. The Department of Education is committed to providing leadership in the field of entrepreneurship education. Plans call for finding a way to document achievement, developing a resource guide, enhancing communications, and  upgrading teacher education for entrepreneurship. (KC)",

It was hypothesized that adult students have needs differing from those of traditional college students. Other hypotheses were that barriers exist that discourage matriculation of adults and higher education can better serve adults by refocusing and modifying its structures. The literature review indicated that adults do differ from the traditional students in age, motivation for attending college, style of learning, family responsibilities, experiential background, and shifting personal circumstances. The literature substantiated that adults face situational and dispositional barriers and that higher  education imposes institutional barriers--all of which frustrate and discourage adults from enrolling. The literature indicated that higher education can enhance adult access by identifying and defining its role in regard to the clientele and by restructuring and redesigning administrative, curricular, and service functions. All hypotheses were accepted. Institutions of higher education were recommended to provide increased and more flexible support services, establish inservice for faculty and administrators, adjust class schedules and locations, and provide creative options for financial aid.

During its deliberations, the commission addressed the following areas of concern: perceptions of vocational education, access, equity, curriculum, vocational education teacher recruitment and preparation, standards and accountability, articulation, leadership in vocational education, partnerships among vocational education, business, labor, and the community, and field-based learning. After more than seven months of site visits and hearings across the country, the commission concluded that all secondary students need a balance of both academic and vocational experiences to prepare themselves for life in a changing world. It was  further recommended that all students--including special population youth and potential dropouts--should be able to choose from a comprehensive set of course offerings across academic and vocational areas and that States should not mandate curricular requirements that restrict students' opportunities to participate in vocational education experiences. A five-part plan for teacher recruitment, preservice education, certification, and inservice education was proposed. It was suggested that the effectiveness of vocational education be judged primarily by before-and-after changes in student knowledge and that policymakers provide for vertical articulation across schools and grade levels and also for lateral articulation among school and nonschool providers of employment-related education and  training.

Employers stressed that students need both functional and adaptive skills for entry-level employment. In the area of functional skills, they stressed communication and persuasion, organizational management, research and investigation, human service, information management, and design and planning. Adaptive skills cited as important by employers were in the areas of aptitude, attitude, self-management, and work habits. Good verbal and written communication skills were often cited by employers as important qualities that many job applicants lack. College faculty who were shown the survey results responded that many of the skills desired by employers are already  being taught in liberal arts courses, but that perhaps they could be made more specific and employment related. The professors saw no need to change the curriculum but thought that necessary skills could be incorporated with a change of attitude. (KC)",

        "description":"An experience-based career education (EBCE) program integrates academic learning, career experiences, and life skill development through direct learning experiences in the community. EBCE enables each student to gain individual attention, both with a teacher and with community members. This increase in individual attention does not mean that EBCE has to cost more than a conventional classroom program. The increase in individual attention can be gained through the assistance of community volunteers, and many programs operate at the same cost as the conventional alternative in the same community. In determining the cost of an EBCE program, the administrator should consider the following factors: (1) staffing--the lower the student load per staff member, the more the program will  cost; staff must follow students; and part-time programs may cost more than full-time, complete model programs; (2) space need not be a significant cost factor; (3) existing forms of transportation should be used as much as possible; (4) insurance should be obtained to protect both the student and the resource site; (5) telephones, reference materials, and copying are necessary expenses, but they still need to be regulated; and (6) though an EBCE program can operate without extra cost, there usually are some start-up costs, and they vary widely among sites. EBEC programs stand more chance of surviving and benefiting students if the per-student cost is in line with regular programs, if broad-based support is promoted, and if expansion plans are made in the beginning. Long-term planning is  best for a successful EBCE program. (KC)",

The primary outcomes desired by Congress in creating NOICC were labor market supply and demand data for planning and occupational information for career and vocational decision making. These outcomes have remained essentially the same, although the participants, roles, and expectations of NOICC and the State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees (SOICCs) were greatly strengthened in 1982 and 1984. NOICC and SOICC accomplishments include SOICCs in every state and territory working with NOICC to develop and use labor market supply and demand information and  access to the occupational information by millions of individuals making career decisions. The NOICC and SOICC network has developed a cooperative endeavor within and between states and among Federal agencies and worked toward standardization of occupational classification. States have become more successful in developing and implementing Career Information Delivery Systems and producing employment projections and/or supply estimates. The guidance and counseling community has the responsibility to guard the freedom of occupational and career choices and to help individuals make informed choices. Professional associations must work together to deliver occupational information effectively. (YLB)",

(Since its inception in 1972, the NNCCVTE has provided a mechanism for state and local education agencies to coordinate curriculum activities and to share curriculum resources.) It was concluded that the original objectives of the network have remained largely unchanged since the program's inception. State liaison representatives are the primary users of the network's services. The six NNCCVTE centers each provide a variety of services in three broad areas: capacity building, information resources, and outreach  activities. In recent years, the NNCCVTE has invested considerable resources in developing electronic communication systems such as the Vocational Education Curriculum Materials System (VECM). In addition, individual centers have developed linkages with a number of other vocational education information-sharing organizations and, overall, the network maintains close ties with the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. The individual centers have not developed uniform guidelines for evaluating the quality of curricula and do not routinely screen curricula; however, they have contributed to a general improvement in the quality of available vocational education curricula and have been active in reducing duplication and in disseminating newly developed materials.  Recommendations were developed concerning the design of an NNCCVTE user study. (Profiles of the six regional NNCCVTE centers are appended.) (MN)",

These student volunteers from Washington, D.C. area universities completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of their 10-week experience. The pretest assessed personal data, the importance of 10 motivation factors for encouraging students to volunteer, and recruitment strategies used to interest them. The posttest included evaluations of the orientation and volunteer program, motivation items from the pretest, discouragement and reasons for it, and assessment of the likelihood of future volunteering. Non-altruistic motives (e.g., useful experience for the future)  were stronger than altruistic motives as indicators of positive overall evaluation, more future volunteering, less discouragement, and higher likelihood of recommending the experience to others. The most frequent and influential recruitment strategies were those that involved face-to-face contact between recruiter and prospective volunteer. Findings suggested that institutions might emphasize self-interest as well as altruism in volunteer recruitment strategies. (YLB)",

        "description":"As this report illustrates, nearly one in four adult workers today has completed college, while in 1970 just one in seven had as much formal schooling. This growth, together with the higher labor force participation rates of college graduates, has generated significant increases in the college-educated work force. Other factors include women's increased share of the college-graduate work force, the ongoing decline in the number of school leavers, and higher proportions of Blacks and Hispanics with college degrees. Data continue to confirm that educational attainment is one of the most important determinants of occupation. Following the four-page report is an explanatory note briefly describing the concepts, definitions, and estimating methods used in the Current Population  Surveys 1983 and 1982 from which the data were taken, and indicators of data reliability. Appendixes contain 27 supplementary tables, including educational attainment of the civilian labor force by sex; employment status by years of school completed and other variables; labor force status by years of school completed and other variables; labor force status of women by marital status, age, and years of school completed; employed civilians by years of school completed and other variables; and unemployed persons by years of school completed and other variables.

        "description":"The high school vocational education curriculum should not be isolated and reformed without considering the experiences of young people leading up to and following high school. At the elementary level a new emphasis needs to be placed on acquisition and application of basic skills. In junior high school, expectations for growth in the basic skills must be raised and student energies directed toward exploration of demands of the real world of adulthood and work. Vocational education in the senior high school should teach work habits and attitudes and provide a well-balanced foundation in technology. Despite criticisms of out-dated equipment in comprehensive schools and no access to advanced academic courses in separate vocational education facilities, vocational education should  not be delayed until the postsecondary level, because of its holding power. Nor should the content of vocational education programs be made too general to be identifiable with a specific job. Practical directions for vocational education program improvement would be to improve its image as being relevant to today's work world, improve efforts to ensure that program graduates can demonstrate mastery of competencies, and increase interaction among instructors, students, and businesses. Relationships between vocational education teachers and academic and general teachers also need to be improved. (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational education research and development (R&amp;D) product evaluations are difficult to conduct for several reasons, such as the many types of R&amp;D products, the multiple users of the products with different goals for evaluation, the limited time available, and the high cost. In order to meet these challenges, an internal evaluation team at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education developed a conceptual framework for evaluating R&amp;D product impact. The conceptual framework was a linear model with five stages: development, distribution, implementation, utilization, and effects. Two different types of impact criteria were presented in the framework: formative and summative. A more specific model was created to measure product impact. The formative criteria that were  addressed in this model were user orientation, support systems, and integrated utilization; and the summative criteria were user satisfaction and individual growth. A modeling approach known as structural equation modeling can be used to determine the degree to which the proposed model actually represents the R&amp;D product impact phenomenon in the population. LISREL, an acronym for linear structural relationships, is a computer program developed to analyze structural equation models. The results of a LISREL analysis will give evidence of the fit of the model in the population and the fit of individual parameters. LISREL possesses a number of features that bring enormous potential for analyzing other vocational education R&amp;D phenomena. (References on LISREL are included in the report.)  (KC)",

A Likert scale ranging from \"very important\" (1.0) to \"very unimportant\" (4.0) was used for each question. Participants were primarily well educated, financially comfortable women who were actively pursuing cultural and social activities. They  ranked content need or interest (1.7) as the primary motivating factor, followed by institutional sponsorship (2.4), social interaction (2.7), and close association with the hospital (3.3). Institutions new to gerontological programming are well advised to develop programs that address the needs and interests of their target audience.

The organizers of the seminars invited knowledgeable experts in the field to discuss ways to improve vocational education and to generate activities that would make vocational education an equal partner with academic education in the education systems as a whole. Concerns were voiced regarding the issues of enhancing excellence in education, strengthening the teaching staff, improving access to vocational education, and strengthening financial support for vocational education. The following were among the strategies identified to deal with these concerns:  required and supported business and industry internships for vocational teachers, establishment of incentives such as career ladders to attract and retain qualified teachers, establishment of state collaboration councils to promote voluntary sharing of resources, establishment of employment insurance as a companion with unemployment insurance, modification of high school graduation requirements from a course basis to a competency basis, and development of tax incentives to business and industry for student and teacher internships.

To examine problem solving in couple relationships from a participatory perspective, 27 married couples discussed a mutually relevant domestic problem, while being videotaped. Subsequently, each partner completed a questionnaire about his or her experience of the process and outcomes. Then each partner separately viewed the videotape and gave a free-flowing commentary about the interaction. An analysis of the results showed significant positive correlations between partners' satisfaction with the discussion of a specific problem and general satisfaction with \"who does what,\" marital satisfaction, and low depression scores. The data also  highlighted the remote connections, both in time and in partners' conceptions, between problem talk and finding or implementing problem solutions. The extent to which the partners felt able to express their point of view and felt understood by their spouse during the discussion were both significantly correlated with higher satisfaction and greater optimism. These findings suggest that working on day-to-day problems takes time, and the form the discussions take may affect partners' feelings about themselves and their marriage. (BL)",

        "description":"The most important problem in psychology and the social sciences today is the failure to produce cumulative knowledge. This situation has led many to conclude that cumulative knowledge and general principles and theories may be impossible to establish in psychology, a conclusion suggesting that psychology can never be a science--only at best a technology producing answers limited in their applicability to specific situations. This notion has contributed to reductions in funding for research. Psychological researchers have relied on a general two-step procedure to produce cumulative knowledge. First, individual scientists conduct numerous studies; second these studies are integrated subjectively and non-quantitatively, published, and reviewed. However, the information processing  task in reviewing a body of studies so that general principles can be drawn from them may be too complex for the unaided human mind. The most important recent development, therefore, is the development of quantitative methods which lift the information processing burden from the reviewer by quantitatively integrating findings across studies, while simultaneously correcting for the effects of statistical and measurement artifacts which distort study findings. Meta-analysis, the term for this process, corrects for the distorting effects of artifacts such as sampling error, measurement unreliability, and range restrictions. The response to these new methods by researchers has been gratifying, as evidenced by meta-analytic studies in journals, books and convention presentations.  (JAC)",

        "description":"A number of researchers have described individual differences in achievement goals and performance standards. To explore similarities and differences in these theories, and to provide an instrument to measure them, 273 female and 88 male college students responded to items designed to measure each of the dimensions defined by these theories. The instrument included a five-page Achievement Booklet and an eight-page Attitudes Booklet, comprised of 24 items of the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) and the Work and Family Orientation Scale (WOFO). Factor analysis of the achievement orientation items revealed four factors: extrinsic standards, affiliative goals, intrinsic standards, and competitive goals. Correlations between responses on the achievement items and responses on  PAQ and WOFO scores provided evidence for the convergent and divergent validity of the scales, e.g., the competitiveness goals scale was positively correlated with the PAQ-masculinity and WOFO-worker and WOFO-competitiveness scales; and the intrinsic standards scale was positively correlated with the PAQ-femininity scale. The findings indicate that the various theoretical dimensions of achievement can be interpreted by examining achievement goals and performance standards. (JAC)",

To investigate the relationships among variables associated with the adjustment of children of alcoholic fathers, 30 offspring of alcoholic fathers and 40 controls, aged 18 to 23 years, completed demographic, environmental, social support, and coping measures. An analysis of the results showed that children of alcoholics reported more distressing situations than did children of non-alcoholics. Children of alcoholics also used emotion-focused coping strategies more often than problem-focused coping. In examining the interaction of variables, it was found that 40% of the variance in the depression pronenesss of offspring of alcoholics could be  accounted for by the degree to which the family encouraged independence, the amount of informational support available, and the degree to which self-blame was used. In addition, 40% of the variance in self-esteem could be accounted for by family cohesion and the degree to which emotion-focused coping was used. These findings support an interactional approach to the examination of offspring adjustment. (BL)",

To compare the reactions of 52 Armenian children who had experienced the 1975-1977 Lebanese Civil War in Beirut with the reactions of 39 Armenian children who did not experience the war, the children participated in structured interviews. The interview content included stress symptoms, personal attribute preferences, dream content, and sentence completions. An analysis of the results showed that the stress group more frequently reported sweaty palms, fatigue, and feelings of loneliness and sadness. However, they less frequently reported bad dreams, quarrels, suspicions of whispers, belief that other children were happier, and being secretive about their fears. The  stress and no-stress groups did not differ in reporting many pathological symptoms such as shortness of breath, sleeplessness, headaches, nervousness, fear of blood, fear of the dark, sense of boredom, helplessness, and being misunderstood. Furthermore, they also did not differ in the mean total endorsement of symptoms. The war stressed group manifested higher incidence of covert &quot;fight&quot; or &quot;flight&quot; reactions. These were taken as possible adaptive coping strategies that may help fend off the debilitating effect of the war stress. (BL)",

Subjects also completed a shortened version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) vocabulary subtest. A preliminary analysis of the results revealed no significant age differences. When the groups were categorized by WAIS  performance and recall condition, verbal ability, not age, was found to be a good predictor of semantic memory performance.

An analysis of the results showed that in the majority of cases, social network variables were modified by the undergraduates.

The discrepancy variable was formed by matching subjects' attributional styles with interpretation content.

Change on the internality dimension of subjects'  problem-related attributions was partly due to interpretation content. Subjects' negative emotions improved in all treatment conditions.

To investigate the impact of recalled behaviors (content) and the ease with which these behaviors came to mind (process) on assessment of one's own assertiveness, 158 West German students were asked to describe either six (easy recall) or twelve (difficult recall) examples of their own assertive or non-assertive behaviors. To manipulate the distinctiveness of the recall, subjects were told the task would or would not be difficult. On the basis of the availability heuristic it was assumed that subjects in the difficult recall conditions would assess themselves as being less assertive (or non-assertive)  than subjects in the easy recall condition, despite the larger number of recalled behaviors. Results clearly supported this prediction, suggesting that the ease with which examples could be brought to mind was used as an informational basis for evaluating personal attributes. Results also supported Bem's (1982) self-perception theory by demonstrating that individuals infer their personality characteristics from the content of behavioral information they recall, as well as the ease with which those behaviors come to mind.

Three individual case studies are presented. Case 1 is a 16 1/2-year-old male, who was placed in a foster home after severe family upheaval. The results of the evaluation showed greater impairments in problem solving than would be expected from psychological and neuropsychological scores. A program focusing more on his emotional than academic needs was recommended. Case 2 is a 10-year-old girl with Turner's Syndrome (a chromosomal abnormality). The neuropsychological evaluation showed higher level  functioning on indicators of brain integrity than would be expected from her psychometric scores. Her inclass program was shifted toward one resembling that of a learning disabilities child with a visual-spatial orientation deficiency. Case 3 is an Arabic adolescent who had spent years in trainable or educable mentally handicapped programs, based on nonverbal assessments. The neuropsychological evaluation showed severe dysfunction on all tests. This led to the premise that his previously measured strengths were not indicators of academic potential but merely unexpected skills. Neuropsychological evaluations, although a time- and material-expensive procedure, can provide another dimension for understanding human potential and planning educational programs. (LLL)",

        "description":"Phenomenology, hermeneutics and experiential psychology form the backbone of an emerging paradigm within psychology known as human science. Human science's use of phenomenology provides a way to set aside the naturalistic presupposition and directly study the irreducible involvement of human existence within a meaningful world, as it is given in immediate experience. Traditional psychology's natural science basis leads to the occlusion of meaning. The genetic perspective holds that human involvement in the world is not related to any intrinsic meaning, but is determined by inherited instincts. According to physiological psychology, emotion is casued by changes occurring in the body. Behaviorist theory assumes psychological life is the effect of random associations of impinging  stimuli. In cognitive psychology, processed bits of information have replaced stimuli as the efficient reality on which psychological reality is founded. For phenomenological psychology, the fundamental psychological reality is human being in-the-world. Phenomenological research aims to discover the significance of psychological phenomena by studying its occurrance in everyday experience. It does this by obtaining naive descriptions from subjects and explicating the essential structure of the experience. The term human science was selected to connote an umbrella-like unity across different disciplines as well as across technical diversities at the level of method. The unifying factor is the recognition that human existence needs to be approached on its own terms, rather than on conceptual  foundations borrowed from natural science. (LLL)",

All students completed the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) on the first and last day of class. A rating scale was also administered to assess student opinions of the value of the courses. Results indicated that the computer and print approaches were equally effective in improving self-reported study habits and attitudes. Both approaches achieved significant gains.

To develop a scale that reflects critical factors in the supervisory relationship, the Supervisor Personal Reaction Scale (SPRS) and the Trainee Personal Reaction Scale (TPRS) were factor analyzed using 140 and 141 questionnaires, respectively. The results indicated that for both the SPRS and TPRS, 12 items of the original 32-item questionnaires defined three relatively independent factors. Since the items within each factor for both the SPRS and TPRS were conceptually parallel, the three subscales were labelled in the same way for each scale. The subscales, each with four  items apiece, were labelled Evaluation of Other, Evaluation of Self, and Level of Comfort. The new 12-item questionnaires were named the SPRS-Revised (SPRS-R) and the TPRS-Revised (TPRS-R). The new scales provide useful measures for research and for the training of supervisors.

Results indicated that, overall, students perceived instructors as encouraging and welcoming comments or questions in class; however, minority students felt less encouraged than caucasians, women less than men, and undergraduates less than graduate students. A pattern emerged in which conscious efforts to affirm and encourage women and minority students were negated by nonconscious behaviors such as rarely calling on them, interrupting,  using the generic he, and addressing the class as if no women or minorities were present. Although instructors were not viewed as being particularly partial to men, men reported being more likely to seek help from an instructor.

Data on helping by the elderly are related to the dependency and autonomy models of social interaction. The potential for altruistic as opposed to extrinsic motivations for helping is considered, challenging the universal applicability of exchange principles to social interactions by older persons.

The descriptions were designed to manipulate subjects' perceptions of the degree to which the disease could be personally controlled through preventive behavior or through treatment. Subjects then completed a scale assessing their attitudes toward the disease and toward a person with the disease. Results generally confirmed that a disease perceived as controllable, through personal or  physician control, is evaluated more favorably. Overall, cancer was described more negatively than the fictitious disease.

Social behavior and the institutional environment are reviewed, focusing on social interactions among residents, between residents and staff, and between residents and non-residents. The role of social factors in institutional outcomes is also discussed, and a model of social factors in institutional life is presented. The second section of the paper presents data from a longitudinal study of the initial year of institutional living of residents (N=253) who were studied from the pre-institutional stage, before entering diverse institutional  environments. They were compared with 35 residents entering a senior citizen housing site. Residents' self-reports, and staff and interviewer observations of their interactions indicated that they not only survived the move and early adjustment period, but generally found life in a congregate facility to be no worse than they expected, or in many cases, better than expected. The primary motivating factors for institutional entry frequently were social in nature, and most residents were willing or eager to move and expected their stay to be permanent. Social interactions remained stable. The elderly received frequent visitors, reported generally pleasant interactions with other residents and staff, and participated in activities at the institution, although there was little increase in  close and meaningful social ties.

        "description":"This paper reviews recent social psychology studies on the influence of message characteristics, issue involvement, and the subject's cognitive response on perceptions of the communicator. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) is used as a framework to discuss various approaches to persuasion, particularly central and peripheral routes to attitude change. Effects associated with the ELM on cognitive responses and subsequent attitude change are described. The counseling literature is reviewed concerning the expertness component of counselor credibility, and its influence on client attitudes and behavior change. The role of verbal and nonverbal behavior cues and issue involvement in predicting the effectiveness of expert or nonexpert counselors is also discussed. Recipient  factors, such as need for cognition, cognitive style, and field dependence/independence are considered. The need for an integration of research from social psychology and counseling in the area of interpersonal influence is discussed. Future directions for additional counseling research and practice are suggested, and the importance of being aware of message quality and client factors in counseling interventions is stressed.

Already research is showing some consequences previously unsuspected. The case for mass literacy must be reappraised to assess what sort of literacy is now required, how it must link with competence in the new technologies, and how it can be taught. The content of children's early reading and writing must be considered in order to see that their psychological needs under new stresses are met, and to aid, not warp, their emotional and intellectual development. Electronic information technology can now be used to develop radically new and fast ways of learning to read in the complementary medium of books. The role of  the reading teacher may develop in new ways, and a new concept, that of an open primary school accessible to all via television, could help counterbalance other forms of television entertainment.

        "description":"A cyclical plan for studying that takes into account information processing strategies and their effective management by students consists of (1) specifying study purposes, (2) previewing the materials, (3) proceeding through the task incrementally, and (4) connecting the content to be learned to other knowledge about the material studied. Setting effective study goals requires that the student know the reasons for undertaking a particular study task and set objectives to be reached when it is completed. In previewing, the student skims the text and actively searches for clues to accomplish the goal of the study activity. On the basis of the preview, the student can mentally segment the text into components smaller than the sections marked by headings or subheadings, and then  deal with the text in parts small enough to recite content relevant to the study task. As the student proceeds through the text, interim review of text segments studied helps pull the material together and fosters a growing sense of the significance of the content. The purpose of global review is to bring closure to the study of a text in a way that will render it memorable and useful for further study. The final consideration in the cyclical framework is preparing for a unit test, at which point students augment their notes with information gained from supplementary materials. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to assess the emphasis that elementary school teachers place on teaching vocabulary. The survey, distributed to 359 teachers in 7 school districts around the country, was completed by 228 teachers of grades one through five. Questions were directed at vocabulary instruction within the reading program as well as within the total curriculum. An important focus of the survey was to determine whether classroom teachers differentiate vocabulary instruction based on the ability levels of their reading groups. The results indicated that the teachers did place a high priority on vocabulary instruction, both prior to having the student read a basal passage and in content area instruction. Direct vocabulary instruction as a separate instructional area, however, was  not a high priority. Of the teachers surveyed, 52% reported that they do not allocate any time specifically to vocabulary instruction as a separate subject. The teachers appeared to take into account the ability level of the reading groups when planning vocabulary instruction for their reading program. Contrary to other research findings, low ability readers were reported as receiving as much (or more) vocabulary instruction prior to reading a passage as average or above average readers.

In the first phase of the study, 23 fourth grade and 48 college students were asked to generate actions that typically occur while buying lunch at the school cafeteria. In the second phase of the study, 30 fifth grade and 30 college students listened to a short passage based on the generated scripts and were later given a recognition task. Each subject was handed a booklet containing 16 sentences, one sentence per page. Each sentence was one of four types: verbatim, unrelated, or one of two types of related foils--changed or new. There  were 8 sentences stated verbatim in the story, 3 sentences unrelated to the lunchroom story, and 5 related foils--2 changed foils and 3 new foils. The changed foils were sentences presented in the story but changed slightly so that the sentence was made to be either congruent with the children's lunchroom script or congruent with the adults' lunchroom script. New related foils were sentences not explicitly stated in the lunchroom story but containing actions consistent with either the adults' or children's lunchroom script. Unrelated foils were sentences having no relation to the story. Findings revealed that children rated foils that were congruent with their representation as more likely to have been stated in the passage than foils that were congruent with the adults' representations.  The adults showed the opposite tendency. (HOD)",

        "author":["Frager, Alan M.",

        "description":"When readers encounter the dissonance of conflicting ideas and are motivated by the psychological discomfort to resolve the dissonance, the effort to alleviate this discomfort may well result in the activation of those cognitive processes termed critical reading and thinking. With this in mind, one approach to teaching critical reading treats reading as a meaning-driven, hypothesis-generating process that involves interactions between the thoughts of readers and authors. The general teaching pattern of the approach is to (1) have students read conflicting accounts of a person, event, or situation; (2) increase cognitive dissonance by eliciting from students explanations and arguments supporting each side of the conflict; (3) demonstrate or model critical reading of the same  accounts; and (4) extend the lesson to a point where dissonance is resolved through further reading (of additional accounts) and through the guided application of those critical reading and thinking skills previously modeled. Evaluation of student learning should focus students' ability to apply critical reading and thinking skills in their encounters with additional accounts on the subject. For example, a test would assess students' ability to discuss the merits of a third author's views in respect to how well those views resolve the conflicting perspectives of a first and second author. (The paper includes a sample critical reading lesson and examples of conflicting accounts from nontestbook sources.) (HOD)",

        "description":"To determine what effect the elimination of all literal questioning would have on students' literal comprehension abilities as well as inferential abilities, a five-month study was conducted with four groups of third and fourth grade students (n=33) who were reading on grade level in their school's adopted basal series. Two different third and fourth grade reading groups were divided into experimental and control groups and were pretested and posttested using the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test, comprehension subtest. The comprehension subtest provides separate scores for literal, inferential, and total comprehension. The control group received regular basal instruction for the duration of the study, and the experimental groups received a variation of typical basal instruction.  The variation consisted of allowing the two teachers with experimental groups to pose only inferential or higher level questions following basal selections. Results showed that in the whole group comparison, the experimental group performed significantly better on the inferential comprehension subtest as compared to the control group. There were no significant differences on literal comprehension between the two groups. However, the experimental group did perform better on literal comprehension and the difference in mean scores approached significance. When compared by grade levels, there was no significant difference between literal and inferential scores, but inferential scores approached significance as indicated by the mean figures. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effects of exposure to the topics included on the comprehension subtest of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (ND), Form F, on college freshmen's performance on the test. In addition, the study investigated whether those students with background information would indicate their awareness of this knowledge on a teacher-made inventory. Students in one section of an introductory college reading course served as the experimental group, and those in another section served as the control. Both groups received supplementary readings, with the experimental group using articles based on topics found in the ND. At the end of the semester, immediately before administration of the ND, students in both groups completed a teacher-made Prior Knowledge Inventory  (PKI) designed to measure their perceived knowledge of the topics included in the test. Students were asked to check one of four categories--&quot;great deal,&quot;&quot;moderate,&quot;&quot;minimum,&quot; or &quot;none&quot;--to describe the amount of knowledge they had about each of 12 topics. Posttest ND results suggest that if students are provided with background information about topics included on the comprehension section of a standardized test, those students will score higher on the test than will those not exposed to the material. PKI results showed that students' awareness of their knowledge was not as important to test performance as the knowledge itself. (A list of materials used in the study is appended). (FL)",

Data were collected from five sources--interviews, writing samples, questionnaires, school records, and over 300 full-period classroom observations. Results indicated that writing episodes in all classes averaged 16 minutes and consumed one-third of the total class time. Five kinds of assignments were observed: those based on reading, those based on ideas, skill assignments, rhetorical assignments that provided an audience emphasis or an explicit form, and multiple focus assignments that emphasized more than one of  the other four types. In all classes, skill assignments were the most frequently made, and idea assignments took up the largest proportion of total class time. Teachers, however, tended to vary assignments to fit the needs of particular students. (FL)",

Reading and writing resources were defined as physical resources (pencils, pens, paper, books, and erasers) and linguistic task framework resources (the set of constraints on what and how something is read or written). Findings were reported in five major areas: the locus of reading and writing resources; reading and linguistic task framework resources; economic philosophies underlying gaining access to the resources; sex differences in the use of, control of, and  access to those resources; and nonclassroom reading and writing resources. Among the findings were the following: (1) as students progressed from kindergarten to grade 8, the location of physical resources increasingly became the individual student, whereas the location of linguistic task framework resources remained with the teacher and the curriculum materials; (2) linguistic task framework resources were characterized by text reproduction, short text-based answers, and cataloging; (3) the economic philosophies inherent in the distribution of the resources were derived from school district policies and influenced by classroom management issues; (4) in the middle school grades, female students brought more supplies to school than male students; and (5) relatives and friends were the  major sources of books.

In addition, student writing samples were collected. In all, the tape recordings of 48 writing conferences were transcribed and prepared for analysis. Each idea unit was transcribed on a separate line, and conversational turns were marked by an indication of a change in speaker. The topics of conversation were grouped into six clusters: (1) logistics and procedures; (2) general talk and talk about attitudes; (3) oral language, reading, writing relationships; (4) talk about text at the discourse level; (5) talk about text at the level of syntax or mechanics; and (6) talk about  cognitive processes. The analysis revealed that, most often, students seemed to direct the differences that occurred in the conference conversations. The female and nonwhite students focused more of their talk on logistics and on the micro levels of the discourse; the male students focused more on the macro levels of discourse. The teachers, on the whole, were very even in their differences in topic focus. They individualized on one variable, cognitive processes and they did not individualize according to ability level, gender, or ethnicity; rather it seemed that they individualized according to student need.

        "description":"Intended for high school composition instructors, this book resolves the seeming contradiction between creative, expressive writing and formal exposition and argumentation by presenting a teaching method that treats creative writing as a necessary--if not sufficient--cause for exposition. The first two chapters describe a sequence of short fiction writing assignments based on James Moffett's spectrum of discourse (recording/drama, reporting/narrative, generalizing/exposition, theorizing/argument), then discuss the progression from fiction writing to increasingly abstract exposition and argumentation. The third chapter discusses building this four-step sequence around the themes of a literature work being studied, while the fourth chapter describes assignments for taking students  from &quot;recording&quot; present events to &quot;theorizing&quot; or developing an argument. A concluding chapter explores the use of this sequence in content area classes. Appendixes include a discussion of the importance of composition theory, a course outline, and notes from &quot;Teaching the Universe of Discourse&quot; by James Moffett, the book which provided the framework for this instructional sequence.

The first essay, on sentence modelling, describes an instructional approach during which students examine variations of the cumulative sentences in scores of sentences written by a number of professional writers, imitating the methods of modification introduced to them. The second essay deals with paragraph modelling and uses Christensen's theory of the paragraph as the basis for an instructional approach during which students learn how to talk about the paragraph, discovering  how its thoughts are put together.

Parts two and three comprise the heart of the book and deal with the different, but overlapping, facets of language development described by M. A. K. Halliday. Chapters in both parts contain sections on observing oral language and written language. Specifically, chapters in part two concentrate on  what children learn as they construct the symbol system, the strategies they use, and how their behavior reveals their developing awareness of language. Chapters in part three focus on school age children by looking at ways in which they use language. Chapters in part four highlight the importance of continually monitoring the effect of curriculum and instruction on children's language use and learning. (HOD)",

The intent was to learn more about the socially negotiated nature of school writing and to identify ways in which the teacher supported the acquisition process. Data were obtained through (1) field notes of classroom participant observation; (2) journals kept by the teacher containing his thoughts on the teaching of writing; (3) samples of naturally occuring student writing in the creative writing class; and (4) dialogue journals in which six student volunteers wrote with a researcher about their perceptions of the creative writing  class. The data revealed that the teacher was not the sole audience for student writing or its formal evaluator. Using the writing contest as an &quot;occasion for writing,&quot; the teacher helped students to write for audiences other than the teacher and for purposes beyond academic performance. As a teacher he enacted his role in several ways, including foreshadowing or providing context for the writing act, modeling the role of writer, motivating and providing resources to the student writer, creating the space within which writing can happen, and coaching by offering rhetorical strategies and encouraging responses to student efforts.

Subjects, 102 freshman speech students, completed the Human Communication Functional Dominance instrument, which measures linking (social) and regulation (verbal control of others) functions of leadership behavior. They also completed the Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire (from the Ohio State Leadership Scales), which measures the consideration (mutual trust) and initiating structure (directing subordinates) dimensions of leadership. It was hypothesized that subjects scoring high in one or the other of the functional dominance  characteristics would also score high on the parallel function of the leadership behavior questionnaire. The total number of linking and regulation responses was recorded from the functional dominance instrument and the number of initiating and consideration responses was recorded from the leadership behavior questionnaire. The subjects were then rank ordered on the four characteristics. The correlation coefficients found between the variables were extremely low and did not support the hypothesis.

While these claims are usually based on probabilities, they are often resolved with the accepted claim treated as though it were &quot;true,&quot; while the rejected claim is treated as though it were &quot;false.&quot; Scenario testing is the label applied to a set of procedures by which competing claims are evaluated as &quot;probabilistic&quot; scenarios. Resolution of a proposition by scenario testing requires that an accounting of each substantiated scenario be made. Scenario testing begins with the assumption that conflicting claims should not be resolved by disjunctive choices. Rather, it assumes that descriptions and predictions provided by the debaters in a round are, by their nature, probabilistic. As a consequence, evaluation  of a policy, whether the single policy offered by the Affirmative or the combined policies offered by the Affirmative and Negative are most reasonably evaluated when the probabilities of their descriptions and predictions are taken into account. An optimum policy choice, therefore, represents the efficacy of a policy (or policies) across the range of scenarios it must address. This procedure equalizes the burdens of the advocate and counter-advocate and provides a set of guidelines for evaluating their conflicting claims. (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"Data gathered from 42 secondary school speech communication teachers and their students formed the foundation for a study that examined the relationship between: (1) differential use of Behavior Alteration Techniques (BATs) by teachers trained or untrained in communication in instruction and (2) learning of students of varying quality levels. Twenty-two of the teachers had recently completed master's degrees in speech communication with an emphasis in communication in instruction, and 20 teachers had no communication training. Each teacher was provided with instruments to be given to five of their best students, five average students, and five of their worst students. The students were asked to rate on a one-to-five scale how frequently their teacher used statements of varying  types to attempt to change student behavior in the classroom. The teachers were asked to complete the instrument three times, indicating how frequently they used each message with good, average, and poor students. Results indicated that immediate reward from behavior, deferred reward from behavior, self-esteem, and teacher feedback contributed to positive affective learning. Punishment from teacher, legitimate-teacher authority, debt, responsibility to class, and peer modeling were negatively associated with affective learning. Results also indicated that appropriate training in communication in instruction may have led to more appropriate choices of BAT usage and increased student learning.

The Personal Report of Communication Apprehension was administered to the subjects during freshmen orientation. For each semester during the two years, the official grade point averages and retention/drop-out behavior of the students were analyzed. It was hypothesized that students with high communication apprehension would have lower grade point averages than those with lower apprehension, and that the drop-out rate among students with high communication apprehension would be higher than that among students with lower apprehension. The results of the analyses  supported both hypotheses. High apprehensives were approximately 29% more likely to leave school before the end of their first semester and 37% more likely to leave in the first two years than were those with low apprehension. High communication apprehensives achieved lower grade-point averages and earned slightly fewer credits than did those with low apprehension, for each of the semesters studied. (HTH)",

        "description":"Noting that the television movie &quot;The Day After&quot; (aired November 20, 1983) is probably the most important of the films generating discussion about the issue of nuclear war, this paper describes a study that examined the rhetorical vision of nuclear war depicted in the film and the ways in which that vision corresponds to the images held by individuals. The paper first discusses statements made in a survey of 79 subjects attending the 1984 summer session at a California State University campus. An open-ended request for written statements resulted in brief essays giving subjects' depictions of a nuclear war and emerging themes. It then examines the fantasy themes that emerged in an analysis of the film, pointing out the ways in which the film depicts the fantasy themes and the  ways those depictions differ from the images given by the survey subjects. Next, the paper examines the deep structure of the vision or the underlying frame in which the entire drama is placed, focusing on irony as the most suitable framework. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the similar vision shared by the film and the individual subjects. (HTH)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to describe male and female participation and success in both debate and individual events national competition and to identify areas of gender-based inequity. Data from three 1984 national tournaments (National Debate Tournament, American Forensic Association's National Individual Events Tournament, and the National Forensic Association's Individual Events Nationals) were analyzed to determine male/female distribution ratios for both preliminary rounds and elimination rounds of competition. Using these ratios, male/female participant and team comparisons were made in debate, while male/female participant comparison by event and event groupings were made in individual events. Exploratory gender research on forensics suggests that debate is perceived to be a  male-dominated activity, and actual examination of the male/female participation level at the National Debate Tournament indicated that participation was in fact largely dominated by males. Exploratory research also suggests that individual events is perceived to be a more gender-balanced forensic activity. While descriptive data from the preliminary rounds of competition from the two individual events tournaments suggest a general balance in male/female participation ratios, analysis of the elimination rounds reflects a gender-based imbalance favoring male participants. Males also tended to dominate interpretive events, contrary to perceptions that these activities are more &quot;feminine&quot; and the most likely to provide barriers to male participation because of conflicting sex-role  expectations. (Participation data are presented individually for each of the three tournaments.) (HTH)",

The second study, involving 24 students, focused specifically on the purposes and responses in a teasing episode, while the third, a survey of more than 250 students, examined how often individuals experienced each of the purposes and responses to teasing found in the initial studies. Results indicated the following: (1) teasing occurs primarily among friends and family members, (2) individuals attribute more positive than negative motives for teasers, (3) most responses to  teasing are positive emotions, and (4) teasing is a daily communication activity.

It was hypothesized that print media coverage would be similar across publications regardless of editorial slant, because of the dominance of the race factor in American society. Analysis of the tendencies or patterns of news coverage of the Jackson campaign included three newspapers (&quot;USA Today,&quot; the &quot;Wall Street Journal,&quot; the &quot;New York Times,&quot;) and four magazines (&quot;Time,&quot;&quot;New Republic,&quot; the &quot;Nation,&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot;). Assertions produced by the different news sources were screened sentence-by-sentence to develop a list containing all basic propositions advanced by  each publication in the series of articles appearing between October 10, 1983, and April 10, 1984. The resulting data, indicating differences across publications, did not support the hypothesis. Coverage of the Jackson campaign appeared to have followed the dictates of tradition in that publishers did not allow considerations of race to alter significantly their traditional roles as liberal, conservative, or moderate publications.

        "description":"For those analyzing oral interpretation performance, the theory of Symbolic Interactionism can be used to explain two interrelated phenomena that occur during the performance: expanded understanding of the text (emergent meaning) and expanded understanding of oneself (development of the self-concept). George Herbert Mead, a founder of Symbolic Interactionism, felt that the full meaning of communication emerged in the act of communication itself, and that communication was significant when the speaker was affected in the same way as the listener. Meaning in communication emerged from the gesture initiating the act, the responding gesture, and the completed social act. Both the activities of emergent meaning and development of self-concept can be seen to occur during oral  interpretation preparation and performance. For the reader, the first stage in the emergence of meaning occurs in textual analysis. The interpreter uses his or her ability to decenter in seeking the perspective of the speaker of the literature rather than relying on his or her personal point of view. The speaker in the literature becomes the significant other with whom the interpreter is first involved. In rehearsals the reader extends this experience into an interaction with a prospective audience, while in performance the emergence of meaning is completed with a real audience. That completes the conversation of gestures, and the real audience becomes the final significant other. Furthermore, for active rather than passive audiences, that same emergence of meaning comes about. They also  experience the perspective of another and in so doing expand their own sense of self.

New Hampshire when it declared one classificaton of language as outside the bounds of constitutional guarantees. Since then the Court has continually redrawn the line defining which speech is constitutionally protected, narrowing the nature of fighting words in the process. At various times the Court has equated fighting words with language that inflicts injury, incites a breach of the peace, provokes retaliation or violent action, or is calculated to offend sensibilities. The Court has also found it necessary to consider other contextual factors, such as the cultural milieu and geographical location, in rendering its decisions concerning fighting words.  The problem appears to be the vagueness of the doctrine. Given this vagueness, and the resulting inability of authorities to agree on where to draw the line, continuing revision of the doctrine seems inevitable. (RBW)",

        "description":"Speech communication workers have been reluctant to use physiological variables in their work. The arguments against their use have ranged from a fear of invading the realm of the psychologist or physiologist, thereby damaging the uniqueness and disciplinary identity of speech communication, to a feeling by certain scholars that the appropriate level of analysis and theorizing in communication research is that of physical behavior, cognition, and emotion. No research method or approach, however, is the exclusive property of any discipline. Similarly, theory and methodology are inexorably intertwined. It is logical to limit the methods used to inquire into a process, but only after gaining an understanding of that phenomenon. Precipitous selections of methodologies may hinder the  discovery of important variables. The area of physiological variables has great potential for communcation research. Many of the problems with data collection encountered in the past are being eased by using computers to monitor physiological measuring instruments. Many speech communication theories derive from or involve physiological variables, and these require testing. Physiological variables can be measured with a degree of precision and accuracy usually unattainable with more common forms of communication measurement, and they can provide hard data with which to link communication research more firmly to the real world. Physiological measurement, however, should not be a communication researcher's only approach to a problem. It has value only when used in concert with other  strategies. (RBW)",

Technical assisters can best maintain and build their collective capacity to help bring about school improvement by encouraging collaborative problem solving, promising no more than they can deliver, and striving for continuity of services despite cutbacks.

The following directives for technical assistants may be derived from Section 2's major currents or themes: (1) communicate to district personnel the importance of management for the overall instructional program, (2) be aware of possible discrepancies between the planning and management skill levels assumed by LRPSI and the actual skill levels of district personnel; (3) help implement the degree and quality of the LRPSI process the district chooses according to its specific needs;  (4) develop skills in managing declining resources; (5) help the district plan so that implementation can continue beyond LRPSI's 5-year term; (6) help the district fit existing skill levels in the technical assistance system to its own needs. Technical assistance agencies, LRPSI school districts, and Pennsylvania Department of Education planners must all work together in good faith on the management planning emphases contained in SEction 2 if LRPSI is to be successful.

        "description":"School administrators in the 1980's must learn to provide stronger instructional leadership to improve student achievement and restore public confidence in education. School improvement will occur, however, only as a result of changes in attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors. Only when teachers have worked out their own concerns regarding a given improvement strategy will they be able to effectively implement that strategy in the classroom. The school improvement planning process requires identifying the general problem, delineating goals and objectives, generating and evaluating alternative solutions, preparing activities to achieve the desired school improvement, designating staff to carry out the plan, and monitoring the plan's effectiveness. Amid the current climate for  public education, school improvement activities will have to focus on the devlopment of an &quot;older teaching staff&quot; that may not include the most effective professionals. For the immediate future, staff development activities are likely to center on the need for more effective schooling, increased student achievement, more effective discipline, and more stringent demands on pupils to learn. To become more diagnostic, prescriptive, and reflective in their instructional planning, teachers need formal instruction under simulated conditions provided through the cooperation of school boards, state departments of education, state education agencies, and institutions of higher education.

        "description":"PRISM, the Pittsburgh Research-Based Instructional Supervisory Model, was initiated when the superintendent convened an Instructional Leadership Committee (ILC) to develop a plan for improving instruction and instructional leadership within the district. The Pittsburgh Public Schools' Learning Research Development Center then conducted a districtwide needs assessment on which the ILC based its 3- to 5-year implementation program. On the basis of this program, the four assistant directors for staff development prepared a plan of action. In consultation with selected administrators and teachers, the Staff Development Team (SDT) established a training program applicable to all Pittsburgh public schools and at all grade levels. Following several 1-day administrator inservice  meetings, a total of 200 administrators were trained in 5-day inservice sessions conducted by the SDT for groups of no more than 40. Following sets of recommendations developed by the ILC and the SDT, PRISM is working toward a personnel evaluation plan for wider school-based implementation. The PRISM training process has followup components for every phase and is built on a sequence of five components essential to any staff program: (1) presentation of theory, (2) modeling or demonstration, (3) practice under simulated conditions, (4) structured feedback, and (5) coaching for application.

Following a review of long-range planning model assumptions and alternatives and their implications for the evaluative phase of LRPSI (called &quot;registration&quot;), the author examines this phase in detail and suggests that LRPSI stipulations tend to promote reporting over evaluation. The author offers an alternative implementation, evaluation, and registration proposal for school improvement  processes that addresses the following: (1) public confidence in schools, (2) action plan implementation and mutual adaptation, (3) school improvement and the role orientation of key participants, (4) organization of relevant information about change processes, (5) dissemination of evaluation information both to inform citizens and to advise decision-making, and (6) project development documentation and the unrestricted review of improvements. The proposal argues for a more open analysis of school efforts to change than the LRPSI registration process' present tendency toward mere state validation of existing behavior. (JBM)",

Pennsylvania's Long Range Planning for School Improvement identifies six reasons for desiring community involvement, including providing citizens the opportunity to understand school board operating plans and giving the board the opportunity to inform citizens about those plans. Although the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) leaves school districts free to pursue community involvement as they see fit, it encourages the development of (1) a clear definition and understanding of the role of each community group created, (2) appropriate recruitment and selection procedures, (3) clearly defined interrelationships among and between community groups  functioning in the district, (4) appropriate means of receiving and reporting information, and (5) appropriate evaluation procedures to determine community group participation effectiveness. Under PDE guidelines, technical assistance partners can provide help regarding community involvement in information and clarification, training, and monitoring. The key to effective community involvement and effective technical assistance is ongoing participatory planning that extends beyond mere consultation. (JBM)",

In the next 5 years, the Northern Area of Allegheny County will lose the equivalent of one of the larger school districts. Substantial cuts in teaching and administrative positions have already taken effect. Over the last 25 years, Northern Area school districts have been involved in a number of cooperative efforts, including the establishment of a special education center, a technical school, and a joint purchasing program. Recent enrollment data have led to the suggestion that additional cooperative programs be instituted in such areas as energy management, maintenance supervision, and transportation management. Northern Area superintendents have already endorsed workshops  on child abuse, and a January 1982 meeting of the committee selected to discuss Long Range Plans for School Improvement has isolated curriculum and instruction, instructional concerns relative to management, management issues, and staff development as four major areas of concern for a meaningful and lasting program of school improvement. The current financial situation dictates an increasing need for cooperative ventures among school districts.

Focusing on the program's registration phase, Charles Gorman offers an alternative proposal, linking registration and evaluation, that would contribute to improving schools and increasing public confidence. Examining the context of declining student enrollment affecting most schools, James Burk proposes areas of collaboration through which school districts could lessen the constraints declining enrollment otherwise imposes. John DeFlaminis and Robert Nicely emphasize the interdependent nature of LRPSI processes and the importance of instructional improvement as well as curriculum change. Like DeFlaminis and Nicely, Richard Wallace  recognizes the need for an ongoing relationship between technical assistants and the school district. Wallace also suggests the need for strong instructional leadership by administrators and for greater sensitivity to people and developmental processes in attempting to effect change. All the participants' papers indicate to what extent knowledge is mediated by frames of reference. School board members and teachers, for example, are likely to assess the same situation from very different points of view. Being sensitive to such differences is critical to school improvement planning and to efforts to restore public confidence in the schools. (JBM)",

A total of 128 elementary, secondary, and vocational-technical school buildings constructed between 1974 and 1982 were investigated using multiple regression analysis. The 11 independent variables, drawn from facility planning and finance literature, included local fiscal effort, state and federal aid, school district enrollment, urban or rural location, space allocated to instruction, construction time, and building type. Surprisingly, only  the district's assessed value and local effort, the amount of state funding, and the facility type significantly affected construction costs; the other variables, contrary to common assumptions, had little effect. The importance of fiscal variables implies that West Virginia schools are of unequal quality. Therefore, a state funding formula--using the variables found significant in this study--should be devised to fund needed school construction with equal local efforts.

Five of the citations are literature reviews. Among these is a meta-analysis, drawn from 217 studies, about the effects of cooperative learning on student achievement and interpersonal attraction; the analysis also identifies ways to improve and diversify future research. Another literature review cited is a monograph that integrates research findings, based on over 200 items, concerned with student achievement and intergroup relations as two of the major outcomes of cooperative learning. Techniques for implementing small-group instruction are provided in four annotations. A handbook for teachers provides step-by-step procedures  for setting up cooperative learning situations; another annotation provides guidelines that teachers and students must follow if they expect small-group instruction to be successful. Finally, three research studies are described, one of which is a long-term study of cooperative learning strategies in elementary grades. (MLF)",

This paper provides a general overview of the interrelation among these factors, with illustrative diagrams. Particular attention is paid to innovations requiring major changes in teacher behavior, involving 88 teachers at 48 sites. To develop an individually-focused model, researchers tested perceived benefits, degree of change, the level of use of the innovation, and fidelity to the original innovation concept. Possible predictors included elapsed time, hiring of additional staff, demands of the innovation affecting practice, and readiness to implement the innovation. Potential factors affecting these variables included the  teacher's use of time, the teacher's commitment, teacher characteristics, staff cohesiveness, group opinion of the practice, and financial and material support. Also considered were the sources of assistance available to teachers responsible for implementing changed. Results of the study showed teacher commitment and use of time as key factors. Researchers also developed a school-focused model, considering such additional factors as institutionalization of the innovation, plans for continuation, organizational change, the principal's role, teacher control of the innovation, and the institutional environment. Results stressed the principal's importance. (PGD)",

Research contributions include a survey of  278 teachers concerning their opinions and practices regarding the teaching of problem-solving skills, and a finding that brainstorming-like sessions significantly enriched biology students' ability to inquire into scientific problems. Accounts of programs include an analysis of the kinds of thinking taught in current programs and a description of a program to teach thinking skills that identifies 34 mental activities.

        "description":"A study of the implementation of six major federal education policies in four urban school districts (Baltimore, Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; San Diego, California; and Dade County, Florida) generally supported a new theory of federalism. Research data were drawn from statistical reports and from interviews with over 150 persons at local, state, and federal levels between 1981 and 1983. A secondary study of federal policies in health and housing tested the primary study's findings. The study concluded that the pattern of intergovernmental relations depends on whether the policies concerned are developmental or redistributive, whether the programs are new or well-established, and whether political constituencies are mobilized. Developmental programs tend to generate less  intergovernmental friction and are best directed by politicians, while redistributive policies can counter local political interests, particularly in less prosperous locales, and are best administered by professionals. While inter-governmental systems appear to develop consensual decision-making processes over time, the image of unworkable federalism may persist because research often focuses on new programs and controversial policies. The study also considers the political and legislative contexts affecting enactment of educational programs, and the economic, fiscal, and political characteristics of the school districts studied.

For faculty members in professional schools, the responsibilities of teaching, research, and service should be integrated activities for which inquiry serves as the guiding force. Colleges of education in major research universities can provide the most favorable conditions for developing this professional approach among teacher educators. Practicing teachers can be helped to become more professional in their approach to teaching if research concepts and methods are redesigned to account more fully for real world practice, if an effort is made to incorporate new knowledge into practice more  rapidly, and if research activities can be conducted more collegially, involving practitioners in the process of inquiry.

Early childhood education,  the second initiative, faces such issues as providing equal access at an earlier age, determining when early education should begin, and reducing development of educational handicaps. A third initiative, improving educational assessment and assistance, requires knowing how to determine skill mastery after primary education, assisting students needing extra help, and helping districts reach goals. The fourth initiative, setting higher standards, involves ensuring depth and breadth in education and promoting policies that support learning. The final three initiatives focus on using time effectively for education, improving the delivery of vocational education, and improving educational opportunities for adults. (PGD)",

Goldwyn Emerson urges those in educational administration to borrow knowledge and methods from related fields and suggests that administrators may gain more by applying concepts and theories rather than skills gained through experience. James T. Sanders suggests that the concerns facing administrators might be divided into two groups--soluble problems and insoluble, permanent difficulties. He adds that misdiagnosis of these problems and difficulties might impede recognition of the appropriate ways to study educational administration. John E. McPeck observes that  principals are required to exercise leadership but are usually selected for exhibiting conformity or followership. He finds a tendency in the literature to assume, mistakenly, that the application of theory eliminates the need to make value judgments. He argues that decision-making cannot occur without the application of values and urges the exposure of administrators to educational philosophy as an important aspect of their leadership training. A bibliography of articles read and discussed in preparing for the symposium is appended, including citations on state-of-the-art surveys, historical reviews, and major statements in the developing debate over epistemology in the field.

The State of Nebraska Information Center for Educational Resources (SNICER) was established for the purpose of improving education through effective information dissemination. The activities of the system are described in terms of information resources, linkage, and leadership. This publication summarizes the history of SNICER and provides a chronological list of its accomplishments. An analysis of the information searches conducted by SNICER during the period of February 1978 through May 1983 summarizes characteristics of users, areas of information, grade level information requested, and purposes of requests.  The appendix contains the design and analysis of a study conducted before the center was established to determine the educational information needs in the state. (MLF)",

The correlation study makes use of S. Kerr's theory that the effect of the leader's behavior on subordinate motivation or performance will be less in the presence of conditions that may substitute for, or neutralize, the leader's effectiveness. The study tested Kerr's 13 proposed conditions by surveying teachers and principals from a sample of elementary schools in Oregon and Washington. The results provided little support for Kerr's substitute theory in the setting of public elementary schools, but questionnaire weaknesses were  thought to contribute to these adverse results. In an alternative approach, nine teachers were interviewed to detect the operation of substituting or neutralizing conditions as respondents recounted their teaching experiences. It is concluded that there are potential substitute conditions in elementary schools, but the question remains whether or not there is variation and if the conditions act as substitutes. Although this theory is worthy of further study, the instruments must be refined. Appendixes include related questionnaires. (DCS)",

This study investigated the effects of the act on 12 school districts, in an effort to obtain a better general understanding of how school districts operate, to assess the significance of a specific federal policy for them, and to share this information with the state education agency (SEA) officials charged with administering Chapter 2. This final report argues that three fundamental processes link external policies, the community, and internal initiatives to school district operations: (1) rational-bureaucratic (direct supervision, monitoring, and  standardization); (2) political (informal communication, delegation of authority, negotiation, and persuasion); and (3) economic (resource allocations, trade-offs, and consumer decisions). After describing the study's research methods, the paper examines local perceptions about several influences on their systems: federal policies, state legislation, demographic trends, the local community, and central office directives. Next, influence sources are compared according to the processes that link them with local operations. Finally, the paper describes contextual conditions that affect district responses to the influence attempts. (TE)",

The primary purposes of the basic curriculum are (1) to help students become responsible, productive citizens and (2) to help students achieve a sense of personal fulfillment. Following an introduction, part 2 describes the  curriculum of each of four grade spans--K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12. For each grade span, the purpose of each curriculum area is described, and the content sequence and learning outcomes are outlined.

        "description":"Age grading, the differentiation of social groups by members' age judgments, is widely regarded to be a universal aspect of social life. Most studies have examined age structurally (demographically), rather than normatively (modally). This study presents survey data measuring employees' age judgments of managerial careers collected from an electric utility company. The study found there was a wide agreement on age boundaries for each level; however, employees' age judgments differ systematically from the company's actual age distribution. The significance of this difference is emphasized by performance differences between managers who deviate from shared age judgments and those who deviate from the age distribution. The results suggest not only that age grading occurs in work  organizations, but that when judgments differ from structural reality, a normative perspective is necessary to study age as a social phenomenon. An extensive reference list, three graphs, and three tables conclude the document. (Author/MD)",

Next, the steps that lead to a successful annual fund are discussed: research and identification, evaluation, cultivation, involvement, asking for the investment, acknowledgement, and recognition. The second paper, &quot;Estate Planning: A New Resource,&quot; by Jerry A.

In the first study (Salt Lake City), pertinent information is also provided about the cultural context (the Mormons) and its relationship to the system of shared governance in the district. Despite differences in form, the four districts follow certain common practices in teacher evaluation: (1) providing top-level leadership and institutional resources for the evaluation process; (2) ensuring that evaluators have the necessary expertise; (3) faciltating collaboration between administrators and teachers; and (4) making evaluation and support systems compatible with each other and with the district's overall goals.

States have to develop a formula to distribute 80 percent of their block grant funds to local education agencies, which have virtually complete discretion in deciding the use of funds. States have wide latitude in using the remaining 20 percent. Enrollment was a key factor for distributing funds to local agencies, but the formulas developed by the 13 states visited by the Government Accounting Office (GAO) varied greatly. Local education agencies spent over half of their school year 1982-83 funds on instructional materials and equipment. Of funds retained by the states, over 55 percent were reportedly used  for education improvement and support services--essentially the same areas that were supported by the prior categorical programs. States made limited changes to organizational structures and procedures for managing the block grant. Overall, local education officials viewed the block grant as a more desirable way of funding education programs, while most interest groups that provided GAO information viewed it as less desirable. State officials were divided concerning the desirability of the block grant concept. (MLF)",

        "description":"To study the actions that can be used to manage and support change in high schools, two researchers made two-day visits to two high schools in each of nine districts in various geographic areas of the nation, where they interviewed students, staff, and central office personnel. In each district, researchers selected one school they judged to be changing a great deal and another school they considered to be typical. The focus of the visits was to explore the following questions: What are the types, sources, and purposes of change? What are the key units of change? What are the key situational factors that influence the change process? and, How is the change process managed? The purpose of two-thirds of the interventions was found to be developing supportive or organizational  arrangements and resources, and an analysis of these actions suggested that much initiating of change occurred in the schools, but little facilitation was provided to support change. Several of the current high school change myths were challenged by the examples of effective interventions reported, leading to a set of tentative guidelines for change managers. These guidelines include: (1) seek forgiveness rather than prior approval; (2) ignore the disenfranchised department status and forge ahead; (3) use staff development to cure terminal stagnation of instructional practice; (4) create a new policy or position and rally the troops around; and (5) sneak up on the blind side and employ persuasive incrementalism. A review of current literature indicates that more investigation is needed to  provide illumination about the management of high school change and improvement efforts. (DCS)",

Whatever technical changes are made in a school district's formal system for selecting, training, appraising, compensating, and certifying principals, there are predictable consequences for the political and cultural dimensions of that district (that is, the decision-making process by the one hiring, and the introduction of new types of principals with different values and skills). It is hoped that statewide efforts and local school district efforts to improve the principal will pay careful attention to all the technical, political, and cultural dimensions involved in any strategic focus on the principalship.

An ethnographic investigation of schools or departments of education at six universities and six school systems in two southeastern states used document analysis, on-site observation, and interviewing to collect data for analysis of labor market variables. Five categories of inquiry guided the study: (1) background and contextual variables; (2) position availability, need, and turnover; (3) paths to education and teaching; (4) identification, recruitment, and  selection of teachers; and (5) employment conditions and teacher alternatives. Following a review of the related literature and a description of the methodology, findings in each of these areas of inquiry are reported for the 12 sites studied. Then an overall synthesis of the findings is provided, along with a discussion of the implications for teacher labor market policies in the Southeast.

A stratified random selection procedure was employed to select a sample of public school teachers (kindergarten through 12th grade) in a large midwestern state. The survey was mailed to a total of 305 teachers, 60 percent of whom responded to the questionnaire. Results indicated that teachers are rarely involved in the selection of teachers or principals. Teachers in rural districts reported the highest levels of participation. Teacher satisfaction with teacher selection is reported, as well as teacher satisfaction with principal selections. In response to questions about interest in participating in the selection of teachers and principals, teachers  indicated a strong tendency for participation. Six conclusions that have important implications for personnel selection practices and for further research areas are presented. A model for meaningfully involving teachers in personnel selection practices is included, showing how both teachers and administrators can contribute to the process.

In Sweden virtually all schools are government schools funded by local and national grants; only a handful of private schools exist and they receive no government funds. The United States directly funds only government-operated elementary and secondary schools. Australia's constitution contains a clause forbidding the government from establishing a religion, but in recent years the courts have approved government funding for private schools. Recently in Hong Kong government support has been extended to private schools that must abide by the Code of Aid (no discrimination on the basis of religion in hiring or  dismissal of staff). The Netherlands shifted from a government system of public schools before 1920 to a system of predominantly private schools that are fully government funded. In France and Malta the government recently made demands that could have placed private schools under government control. Massive demonstration in France forced withdrawal of the plan; in Malta it is still unresolved and private schools have closed in protest. Ontario and other provinces of Canada are unusual in that private schools are operated by the government. (MD)",

Four main beliefs foster district collaboration with the PTA: (1) the PTA can provide valuable human resources to public schools, (2) the PTA can participate in the decision-making process, (3) the PTA can make a difference in quality education, and (4) the PTA can positively influence the lives of children. These beliefs have allowed the PTA groups within the district to develop innovative school improvement programs at the elementary and secondary levels. The most difficult element in developing these active PTA programs was overcoming traditional beliefs that educators are experts and parents have little to  offer schools. Four things are necessary to revise these traditional attitudes. First, a philosophy of cooperation must be communicated by the district. Second, the district must provide structures for the reform of these attitudes. Third, training in new skills must be provided, and finally, success must be rewarded. Once the benefits of active parental and community involvement in the schools become apparent, the barriers break down. (MD)",

        "description":"The computer phenomenon has made rapid inroads into school curricula, often without proper board guidance or approval. Accordingly, this pamphlet discusses why and how computer education should be provided in schools and sets forth guidelines for school board policy regarding computers. An umbrella policy is proposed, defining \"computer literacy\" in a manner that links the basic components of computer instruction: computer-assisted instruction, applications, programing, and social ethics. From such a policy, regulations can be derived that govern curricular emphases, required skills, and equal access for students. Related topics covered by the pamphlet include the effect of a computer education policy on other policy areas (e.g., instructional materials, staff development,  purchasing, and program evaluation), its effect on the school budget, and the importance of flexibility in the policy framework. Purchasing tips and suggestions for software standards follow, and the pamphlet ends by emphasing the importance of retaining board control of computerization. (TE)",

In study I, eighth graders who viewed an episode of a television series--an episode featuring a blind character--did not reveal significant changes in attitudes when compared to a control group, composed of eighth graders who viewed another episode of the series--an episode with no depiction of disability. It was found, however, that Ss who viewed a professional film designed to educate regarding disability did have significantly altered attitudes. In study II, college males revealed similar patterns of attitude change after viewing the educational film. It was suggested that the film was effective because it provided information that would  facilitate better interaction, thus reducing anxiety in nondisabled persons. Passive participation and the subtle nature of the information provided were thought to have been factors in the lack of attitude change produced by the portrayal of disability in the television program episode.

Two strengths, the extended family or kinship network and the religious orientation, are examined in an analysis of how black families cope with retardation. Ethnographic studies focusing on child-rearing practices associated with black families of mentally retarded persons are reviewed, and results point to identifiable structural characteristics,  including the role of the mother and support of the grandparents as essential elements of the social support network and the importance of the church as a source of respite care and mainstreamed experiences.

Additional findings revealed that almost 30% of the adults were in the severe or profound range of mental retardation; that the adults varied from extreme dependence in self-care to high levels of competence; and that maladaptive behavior was not  an overwhelming problem.

The majority of special education students were classified as learning disabled. As expected, the special education Ss scored substantially below regular education Ss on all academic competence indices (including the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test). The magnitude and pattern of differences among special and regular education students were quite similar for black and white Ss. Special education Ss obtained substantially lower scores on all social  competence indices (including classroom sociometrics and the Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children). The magnitude of differences among regular and special education students suggested relatively little overlap of distributions for white and black students. Discriminant function analysis suggested relatively strong convergent and discriminant validity using the criterion of handicapped child vs. regular education placement. A multitrait-multimethod analysis of the academic and social competence measures yielded less positive results, suggesting relatively high method variance and relatively low trait variance for the social competence measures. Among implications noted are that social competence measures, particularly with minority students, are likely to be valuable adjuncts to  traditional assessment practices. (Author/CL)",

Four issues were addressed: (1) the popular conception of bilingual education; (2) how informed the American public is about the bilingual education issue; (3) the level of public support or opposition to bilingual education; and (4) the underlying reasons for current public opinion, analyzed by comparing a symbolic politics approach with self-interest explanations. It was found that the public supports bilingual education, expresses definite attitudes about it, and thinks about it in many ways. A small minority saw it as an issue of cultural and linguistic maintenance, and when it was described in this way reactions were much less favorable, suggesting  that public support is for programs that simply teach English to language minority children. Expressed attitudes were only minimally based on direct personal experiences, indicating the issue is more a symbolic one, with public reactions based on feelings toward Hispanics and government assistance to minorities generally. Attitudes toward bilingual education were more strongly linked to respondents' attitudes about language teaching in the schools than to stances on spending or general bilingualism. It is proposed that the symbolism of the issue may be crucial to its future in public educational policy. (MSE)",

        "description":"The emergence of a subfield of linguistics, linguistic pragmatics, whose goal is to discover the principles by which a hearer or reader understands a text or can construct a model based on the text, given the sentence-level competence to parse the text's sentences and assign logical forms to them, is discussed in the context of a court case in which a man sued a company for rescinding an insurance policy because it claimed he had answered several application questions falsely. The theories of linguistic pragmatics were used to analyze the application questions in an effort to determine whether or not the applicant, as a cooperative reader, could answer the questions in good faith without giving the information the application sought. The analysis of the four application questions  is outlined in some detail, and problems facing the linguist serving as an expert witness in such a situation are examined. These include the fact that the domain of linguists, language, is explicitly taken to be the domain of the court; the appropriateness of the testimony, varying according to who hears it (whether lawyers alone or with a jury present); and lexical and conceptual differences between lawyers and linguists, as in the use of key terms such as \"meaning\" and \"ambiguous.\" (MSE)",

        "description":"Court trials are formalized disputes in which the parties are denied confrontation and have restrictions placed on their rights to tell the story. The rights of telling are part of discourse rights, and in the courtroom they are circumscribed by attorneys' objections to either the other attorneys' questions or the witnesses' answers. This can be seen in the record of conduct of a three-hour misdemeanor trial in which 32 objections were voiced. The record indicates that most witnesses are not prepared for the degree to which their discourse rights will be abrogated in a courtroom, and the orderliness of a witness' story can be disrupted, restricted, or halted by any of three managers of his story: his own attorney, the opposing attorney, or the Court. In this trial, the witness  whose testimony was the longest and was disrupted the least was a newly graduated law student prepared for the manner in which her discourse rights were to be abrogated. If a trial is a conflict between two narratives, each vying for ratification as true, it is the business of each attorney to make his storytellers as believable as possible. Witnesses who know the rules of courtroom talk can say the same set of facts in a very different way and be much more persuasive in court. (MSE)",

        "description":"Analysis of the role of paraphrase in the cohesion of everyday oral discourse suggests that combining two methodological approaches to discourse analysis, using distribution of specific discourse elements and sequential relationships within discourse, creates a more empirical foundation for analysis, leading to a more accurate formulation of the process of producing a cohesive discourse, and eventually to resolution of more general and abstract questions. The discussion is based on 255 paraphrase sequences, discourses in which a speaker paraphrases an already presented proposition after some other discourse material. It is suggested that paraphrases have four functions (intensification, subordination, transition marking, and conversational indexing), and the functions concern  very different levels of discourse organization. It is also proposed that a single paraphrase may be used in more than one way, and that the functions cannot always be defined as mutually exclusive, suggesting that the customary practice of separating different sources of cohesion in discourse may not reflect speakers' own methods for producing and understanding orderly discourse, and hence that there is a need to focus more on the relationships between sources of cohesion.

The rules generally given for them are not entirely correct, and counterexamples to the ideal have been found previously. A subset of those counterexamples in Central Yupik Eskimo support the claim that there are two systems, partially overlapping and partially unique, that organize discourse. One of these is a system of inflectional categories and the surface syntactic analysis it presents, and the other is a system of rhetorical structure, the structural analysis of the surface utterance that is evident from intonation, external sandhi, and sentence adverbial particle choice and placement. Neither system's syntactic analysis can be fully predicted from the other's. The switch reference that is entirely determined by  the inflectional system is considered to be the ideal switch reference by both speakers and grammarians.

        "author":["Bachnik, Jane"],
        "description":"The communication of &quot;person&quot; has been a particularly elusive area of Japanese discourse. The elusive status of the person term (as distinguished from the Indo-European personal pronoun) raises the question of whether such terms, along with titles, kin terms, proper names, age-status terms, and zero forms, may all be part of a single system for differentiating self and other. Approaching the definition of person in the context of discourse eliminates some of the complexity of defining the entire system of terms, by shifting the emphasis from terms for person to communication of person. The continuum of person in Japanese is deictic, and the deictic zero point of Japanese discourse is the speaker's primary group rather than the individual speaker. The question of variability of  self by which the Japanese have been defined is more a matter of focus than real difference in self/other relationships. In Japanese the focus is on the continuum itself while in English it is on the poles. An organization of discourse that seems enormously contradictory can be resolved by a multiple perspective that includes the relationships between discourse utterances, the social participants producing them, and the relationships they are negotiating in discourse. The point along the continuum between speaker and addressee that an utterance defines is generated only by participants in a particular discourse. This opens further questions as to whether Japanese social life is organized deictically and can be analyzed from a similar perspective. (MSE)",

        "description":"An examination of the play situations in which children are successful in learning second languages was undertaken based on observations that children in foreign language settings learn languages quickly in the process of daily play activities. A wide variety of activities were examined, including play phone conversations, soccer, elastic rope jumping, card and board games, role playing, and object-based fantasy. Structural elements examined include play with minimal language, contextualized formulae, turn exchanges, gestural support, imitation, explicit instruction, role assignment, and arguments. It was found that: (1) in different types of games children appear to routinely use their activity knowledge as if there were no language barrier; (2) language use differs considerably  in various activities; (3) factors seeming to facilitate learning were redundancy with action that made words meaningful, availability of simple models to copy, and cooperative attitudes by the partner that led to instruction or willingness to interpret the learner's tries; (4) the foundation for children's language learning through play is their prior knowledge of the activity structure of the general game type, or in complex games, the specific game; and (5) the language learned in games varies in complexity, with the easiest to learn consisting of syntactically simple, highly repetitive formulae, and with the social success and sense of participation through the language acting as other benefits.

        "description":"Kindergarten-aged children's use of parallel constructions in their peer storytelling, while not common, reflect children's interest in the organizational principle of theme and variation. Semantic and syntactic parallelism represent two of many ways in which some youngsters employ theme and variation in their storytelling. The constructions give a sense of cohesiveness to narrative efforts and provide a mechanism for organizing descriptions of the fictive world. Semantic parallelism, the more common form, emphasizes cataloging skills. In these constructions the children hold constant the stated and then implied syntactic frame as well as the central idea of the meaning set, and variation develops as they consider the range of phenomena that can be appropriately described within  that central idea. This cataloging gives narrators a resource for fleshing out their stories, augmenting the storyteller role. Audience members can capitalize on the central idea of a meaning set in attempting to co-narrate and to comment. In responding to audience contributions, narrators deal with the issues of speaking rights and the boundaries of the narrative itself. (Author/MSE)",

        "author":["Urban, Greg"],
        "description":"Two speech styles, origin-myth telling and ritual wailing, found among the Shokleng Indians of south Brazil are analyzed from the perspective of two specific functions of speech style: (1) for indexing or highlighting the subject matter in certain contexts, and (2) for relating the contexts and subject matters to other contexts and subject matters based the iconicity of its signals (pronunciation differences, distinct intonational patterns, etc.) with other linguistic and nonlinguistic signals employed in the culture. It is argued that there are certain formal-functional regularities in the relation between the special speech style and the everyday code, characterized as expressive restriction and formal amplification, and that the Shokleng speech styles use pragmatic  (nonsemantic) features, taking the marked value of some pragmatic variable in everyday code and fixing it in the speech style. Formal amplification, an alternative form of marking, is found in the alternating use of semantically equivalent forms. The indexing function of the speech styles, which is stated as a hypothesis about the Shokleng styles, is seen to have a more general relevance in that speech styles tend to occur in connection with contexts or subject matters that are areas of cultural emphasis. The second speech style function considered, the iconic function, works both to lead to meanings in various directions and to pull together or bring into focus those diverse regions of the system to which it leads.

        "description":"Aboriginal discourse in central Australia is characterized by a refusal to impose a way of thinking on others, and correct discourse either carries a consensus or is abandoned. In addition, participants avoid being exposed personally in public settings, and good interactional style forbids speakers from forcing themselves on fellow participants in a manner leading to such exposure. Embarrassment occurs when public attention becomes focused on a person in a way that individualizes his participation. This discourse structure conflicts with Anglo-Australian behavior in many kinds of intercultural interactions. Government representatives are impatient to reach decisive resolutions, and hesitation in Aboriginal assemblies may result in loss of beneficial agreements. Aboriginal  children in Australian schools often fail to respond to questions when singled out in class, and answers are often single words and highly repetitive of what has already been said. In addition, Aboriginal children speak when not addressed and often fail to \"take turns\", a hallmark of Aboriginal speech collaboration that generally goes unrecognized. Australian eductors have viewed the secondary socialization of Aboriginal children in Australian schools as an effort to individualize their collective modes of self-perception and social interaction. Such interactional asymmetries are repeated throughout Australian society in all ordinary intercultural contacts, and the Anglo-Australians' relative assertiveness assists their dominance over Aboriginal people.

These claims are supported with evidence derived from a comparison of the social development of children in three societies: Anglo-American white middle class, Kaluli (Papua New Guinea), and Samoan. Specific theoretical arguments and methodological procedures for an ethnological approach to language development are  presented, focusing on developmental research with interests and roots in language development rather than anthropological studies of socialization. Five specific aspects of the ethnological model of language acquisition are addressed: (1) the cultural organization of intentionality in language use; (2) the integration of sociocultural knowledge and code knowledge; (3) the unevenness of language development and the priority contexts for language acquisition; (4) the relationship between child language and caregiver language, specifically the lack of match between them; and (5) the role of biology in language acquisition.

Terminology currently in use includes references to students as raw materials and teachers as cooks, teaching as a cultivating or nurturing activity, the teacher as alchemist, the teacher as marksman with language or group as a \"target,\" the teacher as fisherman \"casting a net\" or \"streaming\" students, teaching as production, the teacher as caretaker, the teacher as clinician and the student as client, and teaching as performing arts. In most cases,  the teacher is seen as active and the student as passive. If these metaphors and images represent the language teaching profession's collective values and typical attitudes, examination of them may also help to understand the conditioned teacher-student relationship, to see the factors that shape productive or unproductive attitudes, and to contribute to greater teacher freedom and creativity in choosing appropriate self-images for the classroom. As long as the profession continues to think and feel in terms of the current metalanguage of language teaching, it will not be able to promote the kind of language-using activities in which there is as much student involvement and as little teacher direction as possible.

Some are specifically designed for particular aspects of oral proficiency. In  each language there are also multiple levels of conversation courses. Some courses whose primary emphasis is the development of reading and writing skills also include consistent listening and/or speaking practice opportunities. Also, in direct response to the state mandate, two new courses each in French, German, and Spanish have been developed.

Intonational features provide the most striking differences in style. Phonological differences seem to be related to differences in speech tempo. The griot style uses syntactic devices that lengthen the total utterance but add little or nothing to its meaning, while the  noble style uses shorter, blander forms and intentional errors as a sign of high rank. The variants can also signal high and low rank within a caste. The use of intentional error can create confusion between a high-ranking individual and a linguistically incompetent foreigner. The linguistic system as a whole may have shifted in the direction of the high-status variant, and the reduction in surface elaboration is consistent with high-rank restraint and nonfluency, possibly arising from the general population's desire to appear more high-ranking. Thus the cultural valuation of speech can influence both the form and the direction of language change. (MSE)",

        "description":"In the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in northern India the speech styles of men and women differ markedly in a number of ways. One mode of communication, tuneful weeping, is exclusive to women. This behavior is distinguished from spontaneous crying caused by pain, and is used only in certain prescribed social situations, and not necessarily in sorrow. It is accompanied by a well-organized set of statements on certain topics and themes, &quot;wept statements,&quot; that are used only with weeping. Vocal embellishments to wept statements enrich their emotional charge, and the degree of affection in the situation can affect the length of the weeping. It is often done with a weeping partner, and the usual topics are memories of the past lived with the weeping partner, the fear of an  unknown future in an unknown place, apologies for not being as dutiful or respectful as possible, and appeals for forgiveness and requests not to be forgotten. Male response to female weeping is in a normal conversational tone. Typical weeping situations include a woman's leaving her home for her husband's, visits from kinsmen, reunions of women long separated, a period after initial mourning in which the women sit around the dead body and weep, or in a quarrel when grievances are being aired. Under the given conditions, women are obliged to weep or be considered antisocial. However, many modern young women are refusing to weep and this mode of communication may become obsolete. (MSE)",

        "description":"The pragmatic use of nicknames as clarifiers separates the Maltese usage from those so common throughout the world where the nickname is used as a means of hiding identity. The familial character of most nicknames in Malta suggests they are the vestiges of a pre-Christian naming system. The major peculiarity in Malta is in the intermingling of seven naming devices in an evaluative system. The study of evaluative methods reveals a stable set of principles and fluid usage. People are mobile in the system according to their relative ability and the Maltese play with the system and express their personal feelings about others through it, regardless of the correctness of their opinions. In the case of musicians, nicknames are applied based on the musician's competence, and factions  develop based on these evaluations and change over time. Personal evaluations used as insults evoke responses that have become institutionalized in the song duel, which creates various interpretations of the evaluation system. The purpose of the duelling is to create a set of situations in which speech is used indirectly in a way that allows for several possible interpretations, representative of some aspects of Maltese society.

        "description":"Hospitality patterns of the Bororo Indians are illustrated in two examples: the etiquette due to a visiting chief from another Bororo village, and the etiquette due any common visitor from another Bororo village. Formal hospitality differs greatly from the usual etiquette. At a visiting chief's arrival, he enters as the last of his group and waits in a central location until the village chief arrives to have an oral duel with him, which establishes their wisdom and rights; the last to speak is the winner. In this duel the importance of names, titles, ornaments, and other social codes of ownership symbolic of survival is expressed. A common visitor goes to the central plaza and shouts out all his personal names and waits to be invited into the meetingplace of the men's council for  a long and detailed interview, focusing on his family's names, in order to be placed properly for eating and sleeping in a home of his name-category (&quot;mother,&quot;&quot;father,&quot;&quot;godmother,&quot;&quot;godfather&quot;). Name categories also determine seating. Every person a Bororo may call by a kinship term is inserted into a system of food, shelter, and gift reciprocity. The origin of the kinship ties is in the tradition that a Bororo is not just a descendant of an ancestor but a representative of a mythological hero associated with the name-category. In naming a child the Bororo attempt not to &quot;lose names.&quot; A hierarchy of social prestige is expressed in kin terms. However, naming practices do not reflect any formal kinship system--kinship is a secondary effect of naming practices. (MSE)",

Enrollment was limited to 15, and the courses were designed to suit the schedules of children and families. The emphasis was on listening comprehension and basic speech production. The materials development included production of&quot;parent papers&quot; to inform parents of each unit's content, and cassette tapes for students to take home. Spanish was the first language offered, and French and German were added within a few years. After 5 years, courses for junior high school students were added in all languages, and a course for students of a local private school and a conversational French practice course for high school students were also developed. The most difficult problem in the program's 10 years has been finding good teachers, and most of the instruction has been by part-time faculty. Other major considerations are scheduling and coordination of classes, providing materials and equipment, design of publicity, and student recruitment. (MSE)",

In the first, dialogue journal interaction is placed within the classroom context, as a multilingual classroom management tool, and each student is profiled. The second section contains studies of the journal text, focusing on various aspects of discourse, including teacher strategies to promote  student participation, teacher's questions, characteristics of the language input students receive in the teacher's entries, and patterns in the language functions used by the teacher and students. The third section documents the students' use of English grammatical morphemes, compares it with patterns found in previous studies of ESL morphology, and analyzes it across the ten months of writing in the journals. In addition, the linguistic factors influencing the use of the morphemes and the importance of individual learner strategies and language background in patterns of morpheme use are examined, and analytical issues are discussed.

Data were obtained  on the number of licensed physicians living in Ohio, arrayed by age, practice specialty, county, and for selected counties, by zip codes. Primary care physician-to-population ratios were used to assess the presence of underserved counties. The numbers of physicians needed in Ohio by 1990 and 2000 were projected. To assess current and future physician supply, calculations were made of medical school enrollments, residencies, and in-migration of foreign and out-of-state physicians.

Student characteristics and resource and expenditure patterns were  dramatically similar across the different student groups and states. Students in all four aid recipient categories paid proportionately similar amounts to attend college. Overall the data indicate that the costs of college attendance are similar for all students, given the characteristics of their colleges.

Most of the colleges have offered master's degree programs in addition to junior- and senior-level studies. Planners intended that most of the upper-level colleges be placed in geographical areas where no public baccalaureate institutions existed, but where junior colleges were present. By spring 1983, there was a high level of disenchantment with this type of college. Problems concerned enrollments, transfer courses, curriculum planning, degree programs, student life activities, and community service courses. Enrollments in these colleges fell far short of expectations, and the lack of freshman and sophomore courses posed difficulties for  many transfer students. Upper-level colleges concentrated the student's study on the major program rather than general education courses. Some requirements at the upper-level colleges are restrictive to many adult students, and these colleges tend to lack student life activities. There is also a tendency for the brightest high school graduates to go away to college rather than attend the nearby upper-level college. Information on specific upper-level institutions is included.

        "description":"Issues concerning the college as a community of inquiry, scholarship, and learning are considered, based on a 1982 conference at Colgate University. The conference addressed the problem of non-community in the academy, along with different conceptions of solving this problem. Conference participants described both typical experiences of academic malaise and their views of the structural deficiencies that contribute to the malaise. Participants noted that a sense of shared commitment among colleagues, which was once experienced, is now absent. The following perceptions were expressed: that students and teachers operated as independent agents, without a shared purpose or shared educational vocabulary; that there was no common language of discourse to mediate among private  perceptions; and that expectations of administrators, teachers, and students differed. For students, the problem was seen to be curricular confusions. The conference also addressed the following: problems addressed by the general education movement, causes and effects of professionalization of the faculty, the option of pursuing classic liberalism, the option represented by core curriculum programs, and the ideology and history of liberal humanism.

Third- and fourth-year medical students spend 3 half-days per week for 1 month in the Ambulatory Care Family Practice Center of Wayne State University. They also spend time in hospitalized patient care, a long-term geriatric facility, and community agencies.  Directed study is also provided, and students are expected to participate in departmental activities (grand rounds, interdisciplinary rounds, and seminars). An additional component is the student projects that are outgrowths of experiences in the Family Practice Center or the hospital. Program evaluations have indicated that students find the clerkship a valuable alternative learning experience to established preceptorship rotation. An average schedule for a typical four-week clerkship is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Efforts to monitor the financial condition of colleges and universities have arisen from concerns about the effects of economic and demographic pressures. Researchers have attempted to monitor financial condition through two types of research: subjective studies and objective financial indicator studies. Subjective analyses can be useful for gauging constituent satisfaction with financial performance and priorities. Efforts to create objective indicators reflect a desire to monitor measurable changes in financial condition and to maintain financial strength through the effective use of available resources. An example of a commonly used financial indicator is the ratio of instructional expenditures to total educational and general expenditures. Some financial indicators may entail  nonfinancial data (e.g., the ratios of new freshmen to total applicants accepted). The interpretation of a financial indicator rests on an assumption of what constitutes &quot;sound&quot; financial condition. For example, overreliance on tuition income is frequently cited as evidence of weak financial condition. The assessment of institutions can be undertaken by experts or based on a theoretical framework. Applications and limitations of financial indicators have been discussed in the literature. (SW)",

A managerial competence model was developed, and over 500 behavioral examples of managerial abilities were identified based on particular job contexts. Using the Behavioral Event Interview, managers identified behaviors they judged to be critical to their job performance. Competencies demonstrated by the managers were coded for frequency, and the developmental sequence of the skills was determined. The Behavioral Event Interview Writeup was used  to translate the information from the oral interview to a form for coding competencies. The Management Performance Characteristics Inventory was used to rate abilities descriptive of outstanding managers and average managers. In addition, the Management Careering Questionnaire was administered to obtain information on the managers' position, experience and advancement, success/satisfaction, education, personal roles and socialization. The results of the study, methodological information, and the study questionnaires and forms are presented. (SW)",

Public universities are more heavily dependent on federal aid and contracts than are private universities. State governments play a significant role in supporting public higher education and, to a lesser degree, private institutions. In the early 1980s, the private sector derived a larger percentage of revenues from private gifts and endowment funds than did public institutions. Educational activities and auxiliary enterprises sell goods and services to faculty, staff,  students, and the public. Object categories of college expenditures could be examined for ways to reduce costs and as a potential source for capital renewal and replacement funds. Additional sources of funds are foundations, corporations, and individual donors. Ways of soliciting gifts from private and corporate donors are identified, along with recommendations for obtaining government financial support for renewal and replacement. Debt financing and innovative techniques, such as land development and tax benefits, are also considered. (SW)",

The findings showed that diet and exercise are relatively independent activities for men, but for women, they seem to be linked together as a means toward the common end of obtaining the ideal body type. White females were more concerned with diet and weight control than were black women or men of either race. Black men were most likely to exercise regularly, and white men were most likely to eat the same foods each day. This study, which was done on a general population  of students, suggests that problems relating to diet, exercise, and body image may be widespread for women, and are an important part of their adjustment to college life. The findings may be useful to counselors and advisers. (Author/SW)",

The professor of each class also completed the survey. In addition, students completed the university's regular evaluation form, the NCS Student Survey of Course/Instructor. A significant relationship between learning style and student evaluation of faculty was found. Seven of the 21 PEPS elements significantly contributed to the relationship between learning style and  faculty evaluation: light, design, persistence, self-orientation, kinesthetic perceptual preference, and time of day (late morning or afternoon). The element ranked as most important by student and faculty was kinesthetic preferences. Persistence was another highly-rated variable: both students and faculty saw themselves as preferring to work on long-term assignments. The most significant of the variables was desire for light; students and faculty expressed high need for light. Both students and faculty expressed less perference for afternoon learning. (SW)",

Findings include the following: persons with less than 12 years of formal education took humanities courses more often than did college graduates; humanities  courses represented 7.7 percent of all courses in the study; about 38 percent of all humanities courses were taken for job-related reasons; an estimated 13 percent of all Americans participated in adult education and training in 1981; and over half of all humanities courses were taken at two- and four-year colleges and one-third were taken for college credit. Appended are the questionnaire, data on courses taken by adult students, and information on the variables used in regression equations. (SW)",

In addition to developing position descriptions, competencies that distinguish effective performers were also identified. Based on results of interviews with 24 secretaries, a competency-based model was developed. Fourteen competencies were categorized into four clusters: intellectual, entrepreneurial, interpersonal, and maturational. The data were analyzed in three ways: superior versus average secretaries, basic versus advanced, and academic versus nonacademic. Eight of the competencies distinguished the outstanding secretaries: diagnostic skills, divergent thinking, values quality and efficiency, initiative, influence, interpersonal sensitivity, job commitment, and assertiveness. The  advanced secretaries (executive or administrative secretary, office manager, research aide, and administrative assistant) demonstrated the competencies of &quot;values quality and efficiency and job commitment&quot; significantly more often than did the basic secretaries (i.e., clerk typist, secretary, and library clerk). A chart identifying the 14 competencies and their behavioral indicators is included, along with a schemata of the competency-based model. (SW)",

Attention is directed to developments in the law relating to sex discrimination against employees and against students in colleges and universities, and practical and cost-efficient strategies for complying with the law. The pertinent laws on sex discrimination against employees, job applicants, and students are cited. The employee-related laws address hiring, retention, promotion, tenure, salary and fringe benefits, sexual harassment, and affirmative action practices for government contracts. Judicial decisions are based on the prima facie case, rebuttal, pretext, and the discovery of confidential faculty evaluations. The laws on sex discrimination against students  address practices in admissions, tuition rates, financial aid, sexual harassment, student organizations, student services, housing and parietal rules, and athletics. Three strategies for compliance are: (1) carefully selecting and training key academic and administrative personnel, including faculty who serve on review and search committees; (2) implementing a management control system; and (3) securing indemnification against losses suffered as a result of unintentional discrimination.

After reviewing the evolution of academic freedom and tenure, attention is directed to issues prompting greater accountability by institutions and individuals, and the compatibilities and conflicts arising from the emerging requirements. Recommendations are offered to avoid unnecessary problems between faculty and administrators while preserving the concepts of academic freedom and tenure. Colleges have faced increasing requirements to account for funds they receive and to respond to inquiries about efficiency and effectiveness. As a result, colleges have had to enact and enforce limitations on faculty that address: permissible levels of outside consulting, consulting for  business/industry and conflicts of interest, ownership of patents and copyrights, and proper conduct with students. Violations of new rules become valid cause for faculty discipline or dismissal. Although increased regulation of faculty conduct may not be inconsistent with academic freedom, it does seriously affect faculty morale and job satisfaction. One mechanism to offset the negative effects on faculty is to involve faculty in studying and implementing regulations for professional conduct. (SW)",

Citing the 1983 report, &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; it argues that there may be a disparity between the actual value of the school library media program and its perceived value by people outside the library profession. The implications of this dilemma are pointed out and an evaluation study conducted in a rural school system in North Carolina is detailed to illustrate the points made. Twenty fourth-grade students were randomly selected from each of four schools (as determined by school administrative staff and ranked according to their compliance with school library media program guidelines); two of  the schools had the highest ranked media programs and two schools had the lowest ranked programs. Standardized achievement test data in the areas of reference skills and reading were then gathered for each student and T-tests were conducted to test hypotheses of group differences. Students in schools with good library media programs scored significantly higher on both reference and reading skills, suggesting that the quality of the library media program may be related to student achievement. Statistical results of the study and a 10-item bibliography are included. (THC)",

The survey identified machine-readable records in several state agencies; evaluated existing records management, disposition, and retention policies governing machine-readable records; and developed a set of recommendations for improving records management and archival control of these materials. This final report summarizes the survey project. In Part One the history of the project and the strategies employed to inventory, appraise, and accession machine-readable records in the state of Wisconsin are  described. Part Two describes the findings of the records survey. Part Three contains recommendations for state agency administrators, legislators, and archivists for establishing a machine-readable records program for state archives, dealing with pre-archival control, legislative support, documentation standards, data base management systems design, and administrative expertise.

        "description":"Drawing from a literature review and experiences at Moraine Valley Community College, this paper examines the role of the community college honors program in meeting the special needs of superior students; analyzes the characteristics of effective and innovative programs and curricula; and discusses how an honors program can become institutionalized to insure its success. First, the paper considers the egalitarian philosophy of the community college and the recent recognition of the needs of its high-achieving students. Following a delineation of the goals of honors programs, the paper reviews research findings focusing on the needs and characteristics of gifted students. The next sections look at some of the educational experiences that are typically provided in honors programs,  including special honors sections, interdisciplinary courses, seminars, and independent study; and examine some innovative curricular approaches being used, such as internships, field projects, study abroad, and core colloquia. Next, the paper discusses the keys to a successful honors program; i.e., establishing an advisory committee to help design and govern the program; naming a program director; gaining institutional support; choosing a good honors faculty; and recruiting, retaining, and rewarding talented students. Methods and outcomes of honors programs evaluation are considered next, followed by conclusions and recommendations for further research. (LAL)",

The first paper considers three questions related to charges in the California community colleges: (1) Who should be charged? (2) How should charges be structured? and (3) How should the level of charges be determined? For each question, a number of possible options and alternative structures are discussed. The second paper examines existing financial aid programs that may be necessary, given the imposition of a general student charge in the California community colleges. The final paper reviews policies and structures for student  charges and student financial aid in community colleges in six states, and discusses differences among the states as they relate to possible options for California. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges' statement on contingency fees and the California Community Colleges Resolution on Matriculated Students are appended. (LAL)",

Questionnaires were mailed to the chief academic officer at each of the 52 community colleges in the state. Study findings, based on a 75% response rate, included the following: (1) 94% of the colleges held an orientation activity for new contractual faculty, 89% provided orientation for part-time  faculty, 100% conducted inservice activities, 92% provided some degree of funding for attendance at professional meetings, and 86% offered sabbatical leaves; (2) the majority of the respondents perceived orientation activities to be useful for the improvement of instruction, though orientation for part-time faculty was not perceived as positively as that for full-time faculty; (3) professional activities were perceived as being somewhat more useful than traditional inservice activities for the improvement of instruction; (4) with some qualifications, group activities were considered more useful than individual activities; and (5) evaluation efforts were found to be sporadic and somewhat unsophisticated.

        "author":["Ogbu, John U."],
        "description":"Social scientists have adopted two different views on the influence of the community and home on academic achievement of lower-class and minority students. The first is the deficit perspective, or the failure-of-socialization hypothesis. The second is the difference perspective, or the cultural-discontinuity/failure-of-communication hypothesis. Both deficit and difference perspectives on oppressed minorities reflect external definitions of community and home influences on ghetto children's school learning. In contrast, an ecological perspective enables the specification of important community and home influences affecting the ability of young members of caste-like minority groups to benefit from schooling. Various responses black people have made to the job ceiling and inferior  education historically imposed on them affect their children's ability to learn in school. Because blacks continually fight against the schools, they have grown suspicious of the schools; their resulting alienation makes commitment to and perseverance at academic tasks difficult. Black people's disillusionment over the job ceiling imposes similar liabilities. Various survival strategies blacks have developed to cope with their economic and social problems often demand attitudes, competencies, and behaviors that are apparently incompatible with those required for school success. For example, collective struggle teaches blacks that they are not responsible as individuals for their failures, including school failure, and that failure is the fault of &quot;the system&quot;; clientship teaches them that  reward does not depend so much on personal efforts at an assigned task as on one's ability to manipulate the powers that be; and hustling emphasizes the virtues of exploiting and manipulating others to achieve desired material success and/or prestige. A 14-page bibliography concludes the document. (RH)",

Children who attended some type of kindergarten in 1979-80 reached higher levels of achievement by the end of first grade than children who did not attend. These levels persisted in spite of the provision of compensatory services to the less-ready students during first grade. First graders were assessed in 1981-82; correlations of readiness scores at the beginning of first grade with achievement scores at the end of first grade were .656 for reading achievement and .577 for mathematics achievement. In addition, children who attended some type of kindergarten in 1979-80 were significantly less likely to  repeat first grade than children who did not attend. Findings bear a relationship to those of long term experimental studies whose initial results demonstrate that good early childhood programs give children from low income families a better chance of succeeding in school and of later avoiding delinquency and holding a job.

Chapter 1 summarizes rapid changes in the work force that have produced employer involvement in child care arrangements. The major findings of the report are highlighted in Chapter 2, including the following: (1) the number of employers offering some child care services has doubled to 1,000 since 1982; (2) employers have misgivings about the cost of child care (especially on-site care) and are looking for other means of support such as benefits, flextime, and paternity leave; (3) labor unions generally have not pushed for child care benefits in contract negotiation because of the cost and relatively small number of members who  would benefit; and (4) less than 4% of an employer's workforce would tend to use employer-assisted child care. In Chapter 3, an overview of developments in employer-supported care is presented, including a summary of studies that have measured benefits to employers. Labor union officials discuss their initiatives in the area in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 explores relevant tax issues, including an examination of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) press releases on standards for flexible benefit programs. Chapter 6 considers models of child care used by employers (i.e., on-site and off-site child care, information and referral services, parent seminars, family home care, and flexible benefit plans). Chapter 7 presents case studies of 10 employers' child care benefits, while chapter 8 deals with  corporate officials' concerns about potential corporate liability. The development of personnel policies that can help employees with children is considered in chapter 9. Finally, appendices present a directory of child care resources and documentary materials such as IRS rulings, state tax laws, union bargaining proposals, and employer policies. (CB)",

To be eligible for funds, states must conduct an inventory of all children in foster care, operate a statewide information system on each child, and have a case review system that meets certain requirements. This report from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) discusses the guidance the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has given to states and reports how HHS has determined whether states have complied with requirements. Besides  obtaining information from HHS, in 1982 the GAO investigated implementation of the Act in seven states. The GAO concluded that confusion as to state eligibility for funds occurred because HHS neglected to provide specific guidelines for interpreting the law and because it failed to require implementation of all the Act's requirements. The GAO recommends that HHS revise the program regulations and undertake new compliance reviews. Appendices include results of the GAO review of seven states' implementation of the Act and letters from four of the seven states and from HHS commenting on the preliminary version of this report.

        "description":"If professionals are to learn how to maximize the positive effects and minimize the negative effects of day care, they must focus their efforts on the ways caregivers interact with children. This research provides a detailed and intimate look at the conditions under which caregivers interact with low income toddlers. Fifty subjects, ages 24 to 30 months, were observed in seven urban day care centers. Half were boys and 35 were black. APPROACH, an ecological technique for coding child interactions with peers, objects and caregivers, was used to record 80 minutes of each child's behavior equally across five settings over several days. Caregiver interactions with toddlers were subsequently coded for activity setting, toddler circumstance, type of teacher interaction, and the outcome  of the interaction. Results indicated that teachers initiate little communication during eating or gross motor play, and that very few teacher bids were ego boosting, although children responded positively to this behavior. Negative controlling bids had much lower rates of compliance. While most interaction involved teaching or questioning, very few questions were open-ended. Also, teacher bids to boys were more likely to follow misbehavior and were more likely to be negatively controlling than bids to girls. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of increasing teacher sensitivity and skills in interaction situations so that day care can become a truly positive intervention experience.

        "description":"Sexism in math books for juveniles has created much discussion and controversy. In particular, sexist examples in arithmetic books suggest that math is a \"masculine\" subject and foster traditional, male-dominated sex roles. Just as with math texts, many adults read the words of counting books, and from these words alone, draw their conclusions as to whether or not sexism is apparent. They may neglect the illustrations, which most interest young children. Many modern counting books fall into three broad categories: (1) traditionally sexist, male-oriented books; (2) books that avoid the topic of sex roles; and (3) books that face the idea of female/male stereotypes in some way. The first category, traditionally sexist books, contains those books that use overtly sexist  illustrations, historical illustrations of traditional roles, and illustrations of asexual characters in traditionally male roles. Such books may also deal with some other problem (such as racism) and present traditional sex roles. The second category, books that avoid sex roles, use nonsense drawings, totally asexual animals, or realistic objects in their illustrations. One example in the relatively small third category of books that deal positively with the issue of sex roles involves a boy who trades his toys for his sister's doll.

        "description":"By analogy, research suggests that training Child Development Associate (CDA) candidates to handle the complexity and autonomy of the early childhood teaching job is likely to have long range effects on the teacher and the early childhood education field. That is, a truly competent teacher behaves professionally and will become increasingly professional. Important indicators of competence and &quot;professionalism&quot; (such as self-directedness, playfulness, knowledge, flexibility, adaptability, social and communication skills, self-confidence, and a positive sense of self) are demonstrable within the CDA credentialing system, although the system focuses on lower level specific indicators. However, while CDA behavioral competencies, as observed in the classroom and documented in the CDA  portfolio, have content validity, their concurrent and predictive validity is less clear. Few studies have related the CDA competencies to differences in the performance of CDA and non-CDA trained teachers. Even fewer studies have related the specific CDA functional areas to child outcomes. Findings of a study conducted by Ruopp and others identified four general competency factors based on the original 13 CDA functional areas; these four factors were significantly related to children's test score gains. The study therefore supports the thesis that a more general level and configuration of factors are more important to competency assessment and professionalism than are are the 6 competencies, the 13 functional areas, or their even more specific indicators.

        "description":"Increasing consideration is being given in the the United States to moving away from corporal punishment as a discipline alternative. Therefore, it is important to look at the experiences of countries such as Norway that have abolished corporal punishment. In this study, questionnaires regarding classroom management techniques were completed by 286 primary level teachers from 63 rural and urban schools in Norway. Almost all students were middle class and Norwegian-speaking. Praise, providing an enjoyable activity, and giving extra recess were the most frequently used reward techniques. Verbal reprimands were the most frequently used negative reinforcement. Other frequently used management techniques were moving the disturbing pupil away from the distracting stimulus, making eye  contact, and making physical contact by placing a hand on the pupil's shoulder or arm. Techniques spontaneously suggested by teachers focused on listening, discussing, and communicating expectations. Teachers also indicated good working relationships with parents. Many behavior modification and punishment techniques used in the United States were either not used at all or used by very few. While Norwegian teachers indicated interest in learning more about classroom management techniques, it was concluded from 12 months of observation that this interest was not due to inadequate classroom management. It was suggested that more frequent recesses may help to reduce discipline problems. (CB)",

        "description":"Presenting two views of the single-parent family, this pamphlet includes an article by two researchers (William Feigelman and Arnold R. Silverman) and a short statement by a single adoptive parent (Amanda Richards). The first paper summarizes earlier research on single-parent adoptions and discusses the results of a nationwide survey of 713 adoptive parents made in 1974 to 1976. Respondents to the mailed questionnnaire included 58 single adoptive parents. The adoptive single-parent sample was compared with the adopted couple sample in terms of place of residence, income, occupation, religious and political beliefs, age, and contact with extended family members. Single parents reported more difficulties in adopting children and were more likely to adopt &quot;hard-to-place&quot; children.  Adoptive single parents reported more adjustment problems on the part of their children, but these problems appeared to be related to the fact that single parents tend to adopt older children more frequently than couples do. While the availability of extended families and friends was not important in determining the success of single-parent adoption, the attitudes of these groups toward the adoption were important. It was concluded that the results of this research offer support for the practice of single-parent adoption. In the second paper, a single woman describes her experiences in becoming an adoptive parent. Included are excerpts from her diary during the adoption process and a description of what the adoption has meant in terms of her daily schedule, work, and social life.  (CB)",

        "description":"The families of 10 children enrolled in a class for 2-year-olds at the Mills College Children's School participated in a study of parent attitudes about separation and parental behaviors that minimized separation anxiety and facilitated a smooth transition from home to school environments. The sample included nine mothers who were married and living with their husbands, and one single parent. Two instruments were employed to gather data: The Parent Questionnaire Interview form and the Child Classroom Adjustment Rating Form. Results suggested that separation anxiety is a complex phenomeon experienced by both parent and child. Overall, it was concluded that achieving a smooth transition depends on (1) the quality, consistency, and patterns of interaction between parent and child;  and (2) the elements of program design, staff composition, and general feelings of acceptance conveyed to the child in the new setting. No easy formula exists for sorting out the many influential factors involved in this set of experiences. Any assertion that transition to nursery school encompasses a homogeneous set of experiences would be untenable. (RH)",

An introduction summarizes demographic trends and present policies regarding child care, and gives examples of child care initiatives. Recommendations for Congress include revising current income tax credits and exemptions; improving current training and licensing requirements for child care providers; improving leave and personnel policies of private employers; restoring funds to child care services; developing incentives for private employers to expand child care options; and encouraging the use of public schools  for preschool and school-age day care. The major part of the report details the committee's findings. Part one describes the need for child care for infants, preschool children, school-age children, and children with special needs. Part two describes the current child care effort of the private sector and of local, state, and federal governments. Part three considers important issues in protecting children in out-of-home care, such as caregiver training and certification, disease prevention, child abuse, and parental involvement. Part four includes six appendices giving statistics on child care and listing organizations that helped the committee, 1983-84 hearings and facility site visits, hearing witnesses, and references.

Based on a total of 265 superintendencies and 46 central office administrator positions, the average number of superintendent changes per year was 32.33, with central office changes of 5.5 per year. Change as a percent of total change was 13% for superintendents and 12% for central office. A high of 44 total changes occurred in 1979-1980 with the low of 28 occurring in 1983-1984. A majority of districts maintained a high degree of stability; 113 districts retained the same superintendent all 6 years and 21 central office positions had no changes. Conversely, a minority of districts  exhibited a volatile atmosphere: one district changed superintendents four times in 6 years, three districts changed superintendents every other year, and one changed central office administrators at the same rate. Economic conditions and declining enrollments (Kansas enrollments dropped 18.6% from 1971-1981) may affect the situation. Results are displayed as total changes by year and number of districts with changes from 1978-1984, from 1978-1980, and from 1981-1984. A list of districts included and a list of districts not included in the study are appended. (BRR)",

        "description":"Data from Kansas' 265 rural school districts from 1978-1979 through 1983-1984 revealed that there were 928 principal turnovers during that period. There were 931 possible principalships: 286 high school principals and 36 assistant principals; 72 middle school principals; and 537 elementary school principals. Total principal changes reached a high in 1979-1980 when there were 189 changes; a low of 108 was recorded for 1982-1983. Average turnover within groups ranged from 5.82 changes per year for high school assistant principals to 78.83 changes for elementary school principals. Change as a percent of total change ranged from 15% for elementary school principals to 20% for high school principals. Many districts experienced no change in at least one principal category, while  overall they experienced a large amount of change, especially from 1981-1984. Several conditions may influence position change in rural school systems--the economy, decreasing enrollments, and school closings. Since many small school superintendents act as high school or elementary principals, or both, a change in a superintendency might be recorded as two principal changes. The significant amount of turnovers among rural school principals raises questions that suggest areas of research that could positively affect principal training and educational administration in general.

The futures forecasting technique used was scenario writing, a well-thought story to describe a future state of affairs. Four perspectives on the future were written regarding conservative, humanistic, pessimistic, and optimistic views of the future of organized camping. A random sample of 270 camp directors were invited to respond to questions about the four scenarios. The respondents were asked to read the scenarios and answer several brief questions about their reaction to the stories. The 95 respondents included 42% who were affiliated with agency camps, 16%  affiliated with church camps, and 33% with private independent camps. Sixty-five percent of the respondents represented resident camps with 12% involved in day camping, and 19% involved in both. The scenario which the directors said was most likely to occur was the conservative view to which 44% responded. The optimistic view received 39%, with humanistic and pessimistic receiving 7% and 4% respectively. The optimistic scenario was chosen to be the ideal for the next 10-15 years. The appendix contains the four scenarios. (ERB)",

Study results indicated 88% of the respondents believed that ACA should do research; over 75% believed that research should be reviewed and reported in the Camping Magazine; areas of most research needed were the individual and camping and programming in camp; and broad areas to address were the individual and camping and management. Recommendations made in light of the study findings were:  respondents and other consumers of camping research realize the value of research; value of camping to the individual appears to be the broad question in camping which needs more investigation; camping research is not viewed as the domain of one academic discipline or as the domain of only university students and faculty; and an important goal of ACA should be the dissemination of research findings that will enhance the meaning of research and promote the sharing of findings and methodologies among researchers.

A first analysis identified two groups of students: one (N=62) provided a sequence starting with grade three and going through grade six, and a second (N=45) started with grade four and went through grade seven. A second analysis examined the performance of a given grade level for each of the four consecutive years for grades three, four, five, and six. Analysis of the ITBS scales revealed that the change to a four-day school week had no effect on student  academic achievement, although there was a suggestion that there might be some leveling of performance during the first year the schools were on the four-day schedule. Analysis of the same grade level across the four-year period also provided no clear evidence that the change had any effect on student achievement. The significant differences might be explained by the observation that one year or class of students performs quite differently from another. (BRR)",

There are numerous possible uses or objectives of fiscal impact studies; no one method of analysis is appropriate to all problems. Sensitivity analysis of critical assumptions is an important part of a fiscal impact study. In designing and evaluating fiscal impact studies, the Objectives, Methods, and Assumptions (OMA) should be clearly specified. Community leaders can critically evaluate the information contained in fiscal impact studies by asking questions about how expenditures and nonproperty tax revenues are estimated; how tax bills and tax rates would be affected; and what assumptions were made about time lags in expenditures and  revenues and about the without-development situation. This discussion begins with some possible objectives and uses of fiscal impact analysis and illustrates how fiscal impact studies are commonly done. The reasonableness of some common assumptions about the impact of population on spending and nonproperty tax revenues is examined, and the effect of different assumptions on fiscal impact estimates is shown by example. The discussion concludes with some questions to ask in evaluating both methods used to estimate fiscal impacts and the impact study's underlying design. (NQA)",

Seven factors determine whether new homes and subdivisions generate more revenues than expenditures. Local governments can substantially influence four of these seven factors in order to reduce the public costs of residential growth. Less controllable factors include number of children in new homes, assessed value of new homes, and excess capacity in public facilities. The more controllable factors are the type and level of public services; location, density, and design of residential developments; subdivider-installed improvements; and connection and systems development charges. Communities can reduce public costs of residential development through municipal and county  ordinances and planning. Local governments can influence the location of residential development in a community through comprehensive planning, zoning, capital improvement programming, and urban growth boundaries. However, policy decisions which reduce public costs of residential development directly and indirectly increase land and housing prices in the community, thus generating new taxable assessed valuation. This provides the community with the potential to increase property tax revenues without increasing tax rate. Therefore, in making choices about residential growth and local policies to influence growth, communities must balance these costs and benefits. (NQA)",

Citizen involvement includes four basic functions: provide or obtain  information, interaction with the public, assuring the public, and ritualism. Forms of citizen involvement include public meeting, small workshop, presentation, ad hoc committee, advisory board, key contact, survey, staff report, mass media, and daily contact. Techniques to help encourage citizens to become involved and to make the most of their time and knowledge are to work at building a consensus, reduce the risks of involvement, and develop listening skills.

Interagency coordination is a process in which two or more organizations come together to solve a specific problem or meet a specific need. Coordination means more than just cooperation and ranges from informal information exchanges to formalized, joint relationships. Interagency coordination is particularly needed in times of rapid growth to deal with an increasing number of agencies, an increasing complexity and comprehensiveness of individual and community needs and problems, and an increasing number of special interest groups. Benefits include reducing duplication and overlap, covering gaps and oversights,  minimizing conflicts, and giving smaller agencies a voice. Barriers may arise because of administrator training (to lead, not coordinate), internal agency structure, agency reputation, unequal power among agencies, or unclear goals. Initiating interagency coordination efforts can be facilitated if local organizations: identify the impacted area, key organizations, resource flow; define problems, needs, coordination structure, objectives; get commitment to the problem and to coordination; work toward a consensus; follow an action plan; and make sure agencies are notified of any benefits of their contribution.

Two methods of public policy education are the advocacy model which picks two people with opposing views on a subject and lets them debate the issue, and the public policy education process which provides all relevant information so that alternative solutions can be proposed and their consequences assessed. The public policy education process involves five steps: identifying the problem; developing alternative solutions; analyzing the consequences of the alternatives; choosing an alternative; and evaluating. This process can be entered at any point in the sequence. However, the earlier the process is entered, the more likely a positive contribution  will be, and the more likely that one's participation will be met with more widespread approval. This process can be utilized when formulating decisions pertaining to the distribution of costs and benefits associated with community growth. The process model ignores the notion of gainers versus losers and concentrates on the problem. This publication discusses the public policy process model as it is used in Cooperative Extension and how it relates to CRD work in general and to community growth issues in particular. (NQA)",

The criteria stated for determining the appropriateness of a  multiplier include the basis for the multiplier, i.e., local data, primary or secondary data; aggregate versus disaggregate multipliers; the basis for an employment multiplier, e.g., number of jobs or full-time equivalent; the base year on which the economic model was formulated; the function of a multiplier; the extent of the impact in relation to the size of the affected industry on which the multiplier is based; the calculator of the multiplier; and the inclusion of household income as a sector similar to the business sectors in the local economic model.

Second, because distance and size will never fully explain people's actions, a list of questions about existing community facilities is provided; the answers can be used to modify the model. The guide suggests that applying the assessment procedure to all communities within potential commuting distance from the development  site will result in the expected increase in population in each community, which can be further used to estimate potential growth impacts such as increased public service costs, the demand for new housing, the impact on existing facilities (e.g., water supply and schools), and potential new revenue sources.

After listing questions dealing with the two key variables--the number of new people and where they will be located--the guide propounds questions about education, fire and police protection, roads, and streets, health care, sewage collection and treatment, water, and solid waste collection and disposal. Sample questions include: How many students will be added to the local school system? Will new school buildings be needed, and when? What is the estimated number of new  households in the fire service area and where are they located? Will new residents be a higher crime risk group? How many miles of new roads will be needed and at what cost? What age group dominates the new population? Will the incidence of illness be higher than now? What is the estimated number of new sewage connections? Is expansion of existing water lines necessary? How much additional refuse will be generated by the new population? Suggested information sources conclude the document. (BRR)",

        "description":"Capital improvements programming is one financial managment technique for providing public services within the constraints of limited financial resources--a particular problem for communities experiencing rapid population growth. Long-range planning and improvement of public facilities for water supply, sewage treatment, parks and recreation, transportation, housing, health care, education, and other facilities are of special concern. So that the capital improvements programming process can be better understood, this guide first provides the necessary definitions for capital expenditure, capital program, capital budget, and capital improvements, and contrasts the annual capital budget (short term) and the capital improvements program (long range). After explaining that  responsibility for developing a capital improvements program varies with locale, the guide describes main participants in the process along with their activities: chief executive, planning agency, coordinating body, operating departments, governing body, citizens' advisory committee, and consultants. The seven major steps listed and discussed for programming capital improvements are: submission of project proposals to program coordinator; evaluation and selection of projects for inclusion in the program; financial analysis of the jurisdiction's ability to pay and selection of the means for financing; preparation of a proposed program; consideration and final approval by the governing body; public approval of financing arrangments; and annual review and revision. References conclude the  guide. (BRR)",

Advantages and disadvantages of each method are given plus a list of references. The techniques include use of census and vital statistics records, content analysis, participant observation, case studies, social network analysis, surveys, key informants, life histories, nominal group process, delphi technique, advisory groups and task forces, community  forums, and community impressions. Although a community needs assessment is an excellent means of involving the public in problem solving and developing local goals, the guide stresses the need to use multiple methods when carrying out a needs assessment--or many people and potential problem areas will fall through the slats. A brief, closing example illustrates how needs assessment techniques were used in Creston, Washington. (BRR)",

It is noted that two &quot;population communities&quot; must be considered: the local community of long term residents and the newcomer community. The guide points out some of the ways population information can be used to make informed guesses about social and economic effects of development. Suggestions are included for guiding citizens in responsible public decisionmaking and policymaking so that changes can be systematically managed. The suggested framework for  population analysis poses practical growth questions that any rapidly growing community can apply in analyzing its own circumstances. In order not to overwhelm the citizen or planner who may be collecting population information, the framework focuses on priority needs so that only the most useful information is sought. Definitions are included as well as sources of population data and four references. (BRR)",

The four local indicators are discussed: (1) electric hook-ups which are used to estimate present population; (2) school enrollment which is used to project population trends; (3) sales tax collections which are used to assess present economic activity; and (4) postal delivery service and postal receipts which are used to provide a further estimate of population and economic activity in the community. In addition to these four local  indicators, this publication shows how to access and interpret three important indicators available from the United States Census: (1) population by incorporated community and census districts, including data on number of households and average family size; (2) personal income, including estimates of per capita and median family income; and (3) labor force, including total employment and unemployment, and male and female labor force participation rates.

Four categories of state controls of municipal bonds are discussed: limits on the amount of debt municipalities may incur; restrictions on the amount of revenue that may be committed to service debt; requirements for voter approval; and constraints on the characteristics of the bond itself. The publication reports the results of a survey in which 215 mayors (78 responded) of Washington cities and towns with a population under 10,000 were asked to rank factors which influenced the council and the population to approve or not approve a bond proposal  in the last 5 years. Research results suggest several concrete actions that proponents (or opponents) of bond issues might take, e.g., stress the project's necessity for community well-being; anticipate and counter the tendency to fiscal conservatism among voters and officials; seek times of economic prosperity or low bond interest rates to attempt capital projects; and be sure that the appropriate officials are informed about the procedures for issuing bonds.

Following introductory statements and a keynote address, participants selected attendance at five workshops, where intensive deliberations took place. The workshops examined adequacy of the health care system in meeting needs of the Hispanic population, obstacles to development of Hispanic manpower in the health field, barriers to access and utilization of  health services by Hispanics, Hispanic cultural factors in substance abuse and mental health, and some of the problems that must be solved for a more fruitful interaction between the Hispanic community and the National Institutes of Health. The second day was devoted to an overview of Hispanic culture, past and present. The forum closed with a panel discussion among four Hispanics from different geographical regions and orientations, pointing out differences and commonalities. Recommendations cover the five issue areas plus community and migrant health centers. Keynote addresses for each workshop are included, as well as a supporting bibliography of 345 references. (BRR)",

Findings (which are national estimates based on responses from 143 of 165 major institutions) are presented in these categories: (1) research support; (2) faculty; (3) faculty vacancies; (4) postdoctorates; (5) graduate students (including women, minorities, and foreign students); (6) areas of concentration; (7) personnel supply and demand; (8) organization; (9) contrasts between land-grand and private institutions; (10) comparison of data at  the 20 largest institutions; and (11) plant biology's representation in the life sciences. Among the findings are those indicating that molecular biology was the discipline most frequently cited as having a shortage of personnel, that ecology was the area of concentration that ranked highest for graduate study and faculty research, and that over 900 doctorates were awarded in academic year 1982-83.

Following an introduction, these issues are considered in 6 sections focusing on: (1) energy demand projections (with data on 1982 energy consumption in selected countries); (2) continued industrial efficiency gains (including data on energy use in steel manufacturing and electrical energy use in aluminum smelting in major producing countries, ranked by efficiency); (3) the saving of oil in transportation (with data on 1982 automobile fuel economy in selected countries); (4) improvements in the energy use in buildings and appliances; and (5 and 6) two contrasting views of the world energy future. The first view indicates that global energy demand will double by the  year 2025 while the second, based on an understanding of energy conservation, shows how demand could be held to a much smaller increase, stretching nonrenewable energy supplies and facilitating the use of renewable resources. Governmental policy initiatives designed to achieve the desired conservation potential are addressed. The crucial policies to be implemented include market pricing of energy, elimination of subsidies for energy use, implementation of regulations to overcome market failures, provision of consumer information, research and development, and visible encouragement of conservation by leaders at all levels.

        "description":"The history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Skylab program is provided in this three-part book. Part I (chapters 1 to 5) traces the origins of the Skylab concept from its emergence in the period 1962-65 through its evolution into final form in 1969. Part II (chapters 6 to 13) focuses on the period from 1969-73, considering the development of the spacecraft modules, the experiments they carried, and the preparations to launch and operate them. Chapter 6 focuses on the program leaders, the problems they faced, and the tools they used to manage Skylab. Chapters 7 through 11 deal with the major experimental programs and the spacecraft components. Houston's preparations for directing the missions and the launching of Skylab are treated in chapters 12 and 13  respectively. Part III (chapters 14 to 19) deals with the Skylab launch accident (the meteoroid shield ripped away, leaving the workshop exposed to solar heat and disabling its solar panels), Skylab missions, program results (including medical and solar/earth observation findings), and the end of Skylab. A summary of missions, list of major contractors, list of experiments, and additional documentation are included in appendices. (JN)",

        "description":"The Learning in Science Project (Primary)--LISP(P)--was designed to examine problems and difficulties in primary science and to explore ways of overcoming these problems. Early research led to a proposal that children's questions and explanations could form the basis of an alternative teaching approach. However, several issues were raised which led to the need to reconsider the proposed teaching approach. Following a brief discussion of these issues this paper: (1) considers how any teaching approach is developed from a particular view of learning; (2) analyzes what a teaching model should include to be internally consistent; (3) discusses features of a generative model designed to help children develop ways of exploring and viewing the world around them (reconsidering the set of  learning experiences; identifying the roles of learners, teachers, and students in the learning process; and examining the criteria to be used in the approach); (4) examines several constraints related to the proposed instructional approach; (5) outlines a framework for teaching sequences (consisting of exploration, investigation, and reflection phases); (6) discusses the content of science in the primary school; and (7) offers suggestions to encourage teachers to adopt new ways of teaching.

Both booklets were designed to enable teachers to reconceptualize their teaching task from activity-driven, didactic teaching to conceptual-change teaching. The first booklet was written for more confident teachers, using a less-structured approach, and the second for teachers who might prefer detailed guidance. Each booklet was evaluated during six 25-45 minute lessons over a 2-week period to determine the extent to which the authors of the booklets were able to convey their intentions to the teachers and to gain an idea of the problems encountered by teachers during  the lessons. Data were obtained from student interviews and from a comparison of suggested strategies in the booklets and actual classroom practices. Findings (reported and discussed separately for each booklet) show that actions of the teachers matched the authors' intentions in some respects but departed from them in others and that use of the guide was influenced by the teachers' views of teaching and of how children learn. Implications of these and other findings for teaching science and for developing teaching guides are included. (JN)",

        "description":"The Learning in Science Project (Primary)--LISP(P)--investigated the ideas and interests children have about hot and cold. Data were obtained from 25 children (12 boys and 13 girls), ages 8 to 11, using the &quot;interview-about-instances&quot; (IAI) procedure. Areas investigated included: (1) the meanings of the words &quot;hot,&quot;&quot;cold,&quot;&quot;colder,&quot;&quot;hotter,&quot; and &quot;temperatures&quot;; (2) temperature change when water volumes are changed or mixed (both qualitatively and quantitatively); (3) the temperature of ice in relationship to volume of ice and melting; (4) temperature measurement (using the hands and a thermometer); and (5) the process of heating and cooling. Results are presented, analyzed, and discussed in separate sections representing each of these areas. Findings indicate that children's  intuitive ideas about temperature and temperature change of objects and events within their normal experience seemed fairly sound, that their subjective knowledge may influence what they actually &quot;observe,&quot; and that their understanding of quantitative temperature did not match their understanding of qualitative temperature. In addition, children generally believed there was no difference between heat and temperature and that the greater the volume, the greater the amount of heat (or cold). These results are consistent with the findings reported in other research studies (IAI cards are included in an appendix.) (JN)",

        "description":"In an attempt to specify in some canonical terms what many heuristic programs known as \"expert systems\" do, an analysis was made of ten rule-based systems. It was found that these programs proceed through easily identifiable phases of data abstraction, heuristic mapping onto a hierarchy of pre-enumerated solutions, and refinement within this hierarchy: that is, they do classification. Focusing on content rather than representational technology, this paper proposes a set of terms and relations for describing the knowledge used to solve a problem by classification. Then the model used in analyzing the programs MYCIN, SACON, GRUNDY, and SOPHIE III is described and illustrated. These programs have a characteristic inference structure; moreover, this level of description specifies the  knowledge needed to solve a problem, independent of its representation in a particular computer language. The classification problem-solving model provides a useful framework for recognizing and representing similar problems, for designing representation tools, and for understanding the problem-solving methods used by non-classification programs.

Developmental characteristics of young children are first described; of particular importance is the fact that they have developed many mathematical concepts through informal learning before they come to school. They deal best with concepts through activities involving concrete materials and need opportunities to continue to actively construct their own knowledge through involvement with things in their environment. A six-step guide is then outlined which provides a sequence for  moving from concrete materials to paper and pencil: manipulation of real objects, real objects and pictorial representations used in combination, manipulation of pictorial representations, manipulation of card sets or cut-up workbook pages, laminated workbook pages or other activities, paper-and-pencil activities. A specific example is given to illustrate this procedure. A number of references are included. (MNS)",

        "description":"This booklet consists of five sample lessons integrating population education into mathematics instruction. It is one of four in a series. Materials differ from those in an earlier series (1980) in that lessons are presented at the secondary level only; there is no duplication of lessons from the earlier series in content and teaching strategies. Lessons are not only aimed at developing skills in applying addition, multiplication, their inverse operations, computing rates, arithmetical means, and average, but also are aimed at developing knowledge about various population concepts. Thus, addition, multiplication, and their inverse operations are used for computing sex ratio, population change, fertility rate, rate of natural increase, migration rate, and growth rate. A lesson  teaching the construction of a frequency table using data on family size is followed by a lesson relating dependency ratios to population composition. In a final lesson, percentage is used to solve problems related to population projection and doubling time (the number of years it takes for a population to double itself). Each lesson contains a box which provides the user with information on content, objectives, grade level, and subject into which population education should be integrated. Although the main body of each lesson varies, in most cases lessons contain a narrative of the content and some evaluation questions at the end. Lessons were adapted from materials derived from Malaysia and the Philippines. (LH)",

The primary school years are an ideal time to nurture the basic skills and values so important for constructive social decision making. The principal feature of an effective citizenship learning program for young children is an activist, child-centered instructional environment that permits children to investigate and generate rather than to listen and regurgitate. A second necessary feature for an effective program is the selection of content that is relatively familiar to young students. Youngsters should encounter situations that are recognizable and understandable; but at the same time they should not be totally comfortable in these situations. A third feature of an effective citizenship  program is a strong emphasis on skills development; research, literacy, interpersonal, problem-solving, and process and thinking skills should be taught. With the development of effective citizenship programs, the social studies community will contribute tremendously to the effort to provide the nation with the generation of informed social decision makers needed in the decades ahead.

The five lessons in the second section are intended for students in grades 2 and 3 and deal with rules and civic responsibility. The activities focus on the neighborhood and community.  Students study about traffic rules and signs, the reasons for laws, and the responsibility of citizens to improve public property in their community.

        "description":"The basis for the severe discipline imposed on school children in colonial America, especially in the Puritan colonies, was the belief in original sin. The child was regarded as being born in sin and thus depraved and prone to sin. The purpose of education was to enable children to read the Bible and thus change the behavior which otherwise would lead to damnation. The Puritan teacher was to apply constant discipline so that the ways of the child, characterized by idleness and foolish talking, would give way to the disciplined behavior that was the sign of the elect. Children were expected to act as adults and the rules they were expected to adhere to were strict, leaving little leeway for play or joyfulness. Harsh punishments for minor infractions were common. Beatings and other  forms of corporal punishment occurred regularly; one legislator even suggested capital punishment for children's misbehavior. Religious instruction was an integral part of the curriculum. While the extreme disciplinary measures of the colonial period have disappeared, concepts of thrift, the involvement of government in public education, hard work, moralism, and separation of church and state have remained to influence contemporary society.

        "description":"The assumptions of stage theory and major theories of child art are reviewed in order to develop an explanation of artistic expression that allows for variable endpoints and accounts for relationships between children's drawings and adult art. Numerous studies indicate strong similarities among children's early drawings, which suggests that primarily universal factors of influence are operative. Cross-cultural similarities and differences among adult art suggest that universal factors are still operative although relative factors predominate. A model of artistic selection possibilities is developed based on the premise that art consists of options selected from universal and relative domains, circumscribed by the imperatives of time, place, and level of skill acquisition.  Similarities and differences between child and adult art as well as variable personal and cultural endpoints are accounted for when artistic development can be described as a selection process rather than a step-by-step predefined progression.

        "description":"The major finding of the Law-Related Education Evaluation Project report for Year 1 (1981), that law-related education courses can reduce juvenile delinquency, is of limited use to educational decision makers and could be misleading. The research design leaves much to be desired; however, that fact must be considered in light of the difficulty of structuring educational research to meet the demands of experimental designs. A major disappointment is that the project assessed delinquency only through student self-reports of behavior. That assessment, without supportive indicators of delinquent behavior, vitiates the study's major finding. LRE will, under certain circumstnace, be associated with changes in student reports of delinquent behavior, but it is not clear if the reports  validly represent actual behavior. The failure to deal with the importance of the results other than in terms of statistical significance or to report the information (correlation coefficients, means, and standard deviations) that readers could use in deciphering the results is also a major shortcoming of the report. An analysis of the second year LRE Evaluation Project, which was supposed to provide methodological improvements as well as replication of data relevant to the first year's results, shows that it contains many of the same methodological shortcomings as the first study. Educators are urged to be cautious about relying upon these reports to advocate law-related education. (RM)",

The nuclear war unit introduces students to moral dilemmas related to conflict and nuclear war topics, nuclear war vocabulary, differing views regarding nuclear strength, speculations on the future of the nuclear arms  race, possible effects of nuclear war, and civil defense. Students locate member nations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, learn about the nuclear weapons freeze through debate, express personal opinions related to nuclear war, and brainstorm reasons for pursuing a hopeful future. In addition to lesson plans and student handouts, reproductions of documents related to nuclear war topics are included. In the final unit on future studies, students envision a post-nuclear holocaust world, compare personal futures with futures of the world, recognize the effects of rapid changes, speculate on jobs and skills needed in the future, consider possible future problems, participate in decision making activities and debates, and synthesize previous lessons.

It is organized along a continuum starting with programs involving the most physically capable and mobile persons and moving toward those in which the older person is in increasing need of support and service. The report provides (1) ideas for types of intergenerational programs that might be appropriate responses to local needs, (2) models of sound practice, (3) information about individuals, organizations, and clearinghouses that provide expertise in special program areas, and (4) resources on program development. Programs in the first section describe complementary ways in which the need for suitable child care has been met by older  persons needing stimulation, social contact, and/or added income. Fifteen programs incorporating intergenerational programs into elementary, secondary, and higher education are described in the second and third sections. The fourth section focuses on the supportive role played by many older persons in their relationships with children and youths who are &quot;vulnerable&quot; (e.g., abused and/or neglected children, juvenile delinquents, and runaways). Subsequent sections describe programs involving older persons in political action and community planning; arts, humanities, and enrichment; home sharing; grandparenting; chore services and employment; and informal family and community supports. A final section on the role of state units on aging in stimulating and promoting intergenerational programs  is followed by an index of projects by title. (LH)",

        "description":"The implications of six national reports for social studies are examined. These implications are compared with past and present practices in the social studies and the ways in which the reports fail to give useful guidance to teachers are noted. An introductory chapter presents a broad overview of the six reports: &quot;The Paideia Proposal: An Educational Manifesto&quot; (Adler, 1982), &quot;High School: A Report on Secondary Education in America&quot; (Boyer, 1983), &quot;Academic Preparation for College: What Students Need to Know and Be Able to Do&quot; (The College Board, 1983), &quot;A Place Called School: Prospects for the Future (Goodlad, 1983), &quot;A Nation at Risk: The Imperative of Educational Reform&quot; (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983), and &quot;Horace's Compromise: The Dilemma of the  American High School&quot; (Sizer, 1984). The second section focuses on the effects of these reports on social studies education, specifically regarding the goals of social education, curriculum organization and selection of subject matter, effective forms of teaching, and evaluation of student performance. Implications regarding time alloted for social studies, common core curriculum, specific content to be taught, and the organization of social studies into a meaningful sequence are considered. The final section examines the usefulness of the reports for teachers. While noting that the reports offer little assistance in resolving critical issues on social studies, the document stresses that the calls for quality in education can be used to support continuing work on these issues. A list of  53 references and an annotated list of related resources in ERIC conclude the document. (LH)",

        "description":"A description of a joint class simulation in trade policy undertaken by an international economics class and a political science class at Davidson College (Pennsylvania) is presented in three sections. Section I describes the structure of the simulation. Students were divided into groups of United States auto manufacturers, the United Auto Workers, foreign auto manufacturers, foreign governments, U.S. suppliers, U.S. car dealers, consumers, and politicians. The issue of whether American industries should receive more or less protection from foreign imports than currently exists was argued in front of a student International Trade Commission. Section II describes a survey conducted to measure the impact of the simulation exercise. A questionnaire that measured positions on free  trade in principle and the applications of this idea to the auto industry was administered on the opening day of class and an additional three times over the course of the term. Class averages as well as a constructed &quot;index of change&quot; were tabulated. Initially, students ranked national security as the most valid reason for protection. Over the course of the term, students increasingly supported free trade. Survey findings are presented in a series of charts. Section III summarizes the educational value of such a simulation exercise in light of survey findings, and concludes with a note on the policy implications of this particular simulation. (LP)",

All 24 local education agencies voluntarily implemented one or more of four research-based instructional improvement models: Active Teaching, Mastery Learning, Student Team Learning, and Teaching Variables. They were assisted in their efforts by the Maryland State Department of Education, and both local and state staff were encouraged to design and carry out their tasks in ways suggested by the research on planned change. To facilitate data-based decision-making with respect to SITIP, evaluation was conducted and three major  reports were developed: the first focused on implementation, the second on impact, and the present report focuses on institutionalization.

Most accidents are caused by a combination of unsafe conditions, unsafe acts, and error judgments. The best and only way to minimize critical human error in adventure programs is through conscientious planning and action, including rigorous training, intense supervision, constant practice, and systematic maintenance of equipment. Many accidents are sequential in nature and are caused by some simple, overlooked mistake or perception made early on that increased the overall level of risk. A description is given of three phases of injury countermeasures that, even when accidents cannot be prevented, may reduce the  frequency and severity of injuries caused by those accidents. Injury countermeasures are listed for ski mountaineering, white-water boating, rock climbing or mountaineering, and rope courses. A list is provided of ideas for improving safety in high adventure programs. (JD)",

A validation study was conducted the following year in a similar school using similar research techniques. This report summarizes the validity study findings and compares them with those of the first study. Chapter I is an introduction. Chapter II describes the background of the desegregation process in the school districts. Brief sketches of the teachers in the study and descriptions of the schools are presented in  chapter III. Chapter IV presents summaries of the findings, including instructional practices, classroom management, moral socialization, socioemotional development, efforts to encourage social integration, and administrative issues. Chapter V compares the findings of the exploratory study and the validation study. Findings from a third study, &quot;The Responsive Follow-Up Investigations&quot; are presented in chapter VI.

Yet often these truths are not learned at school because many students do not accept them as truths, because they are not actually included in the curriculum, or because they are mistaught. These truths revolve around eight concepts--truth, literacy, education, knowledge, citizenship, democracy, power, and ideals--and each one is built upon an assertion. They are: (1) There is a difference between scientific and religious truths; (2) Literacy should include not only basics in skills and knowledge, but basics related to making judgments and taking action; (3) Both general and more specialized education are essential for successful coping; (4) Formal, abstract  knowledge and practical knowledge are not incompatible, but are integral to one another; (5) Education for citizenship must encompass world-wide dimensions as well as the local components; (6) A democratic society requires dialogue and respect for others' opinions; (7) Power in a democracy must be exercised to enhance the well-being of all and not of a few; and (8) There are strengths and weaknesses in all systems of social ideals and their implementation. Curriculum development teams need to find ways of integrating these truths into the fabric of the curriculum. (DG)",

Rewards may be based on outstanding performance in the classroom, extra duties, or extended contracts. They may take the form of bonuses, released time to attend meetings, sabbatical leaves,and grants for in-school projects. In many cases, the rewards involve movement up a career ladder with differentiated pay, status, and responsibilities. Some related issues and questions have been raised: (1) Do the programs involve statewide criteria or are they developed locally? (2) Who is included in the programs?  (3) Are the programs tied to certification?

Most of the items were judged by the students to be appropriate; every item was chosen by at least a few as being a most important item; and all but the Workload/Difficulty items clearly differentiated between lecturers whom students indicated to be &quot;good,&quot;&quot;average&quot;, and &quot;poor&quot;. A series of factor analyses clearly identified the factors which the instruments were designed to measure and which have been identified in previous research. Finally, a multitrait-multimethod analysis demonstrated that there was good  agreement between factors from the two instruments which were hypothesized to measure the same components of effective teaching, and provided support for both the convergent and divergent validity of the ratings. The findings illustrate the feasibility of evaluating effective teaching in a Spanish university and the appropriateness of the two American instruments. (Author)",

        "author":["Marsh, Herbert W."],
        "description":"The self-serving effect (SSE), often depicted as a bias, is the tendency to accept responsibility for one's own successes but not one's own failures. Two studies of Australian fifth graders (n=226, n=559) were further analyzed to investigate individual differences in SSE. The Sydney Attribution Scale measured students' perceptions of the causes of their academic successes and failures. The Self Description Questionnaire measured four nonacademic and three academic self-concepts. Mathematics and reading achievement data came from standardized tests and teacher ratings. Results from these studies demonstrate that the size of the SSE for academic attributions varies with the cause being judged, the respondent's achievement level, and the respondent's self-concept. The SSE is larger  for attributions to ability and effort attributions than to external causes, it is larger for more able students, and it is larger for students with higher self-concept. Furthermore, SSEs for outcomes in mathematics and reading, particularly for attributions of ability, are content specific. The logical pattern of relations among the SSEs, academic self-concept and achievement, and the content specificity of the SSE, argue that academic achievement and self-concept are nonmotivational influences on the SSE.

        "description":"Masculinity (M) and Femininity (F) were related to multiple dimensions of self-concept for responses from 962 high school students. Androgyny theory predicts that F, as well as M, will contribute positively and uniquely to self-concept, but previous research has typically found that the contribution of F is nil or even negative after controlling for the contribution of M. However, in the present research, M scores and F scores each contributed positively and uniquely to the prediction of self-concept. In a few areas of self-concept the contribution of F was actually more positive than the contribution of M, and these tended to be the areas in which females had higher self-concepts than males. Surprisingly, the contribution of M to the prediction of self-concept was somewhat  greater for females than for males, while the contribution of F was as large or larger for males as for females. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of M and F to the prediction of self-concept had more to do with the area of self-concept than with the gender of the respondent. The issues of social desirability, the possible bipolarity of MF, and the multidimensionality of both MF and self-concept are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This report provides Minnesota legislators with background information on establishing state educational standards and periodic testing to measure student progress. Scientific management, the accountability movement, and the basic education movement were educational trends of the 1970's providing pressure on states to set standards to improve education. From 1975 through 1982, 39 states enacted some form of minimum competency testing programs. Supported by parents, employers, legislators and boards of education, but often opposed by traditional educational leaders, these programs have been hotly debated. Many states have scaled down or delayed their programs. There are currently a wide variety of minimum competency testing programs in 36 states. Thirteen have testing as a  graduation requirement. Consensus is developing about characteristics of effective competency testing. Legal problems with testing programs revolve around three issues: adequate notice, test content, and impact on special groups. While Minnesota does not set and test state standards for its students, it has three programs to assist local schools in this area: (1) the Planning Evaluation and Reporting Law; (2) curriculum planning documents; and (3) a statewide educational assessment program that uses standardized tests in selected subject areas. Many Minnesota school districts have also initiated their own programs. The appendix is a chart, &quot;Characteristics of Existing State Competency Testing Programs.&quot; (BS)",

        "description":"This investigation examines empirical support for the internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model which describes the relationships between verbal and math self-concepts, and between these academic self-concepts and verbal and math achievement. The empirical tests are based on all studies (n=6,010; ages 7 to 35 years) that have employed any of the three Self Description Questionnaire self-concept instruments. The I/E model posits that a high math self-concept is more likely when math skills are good relative to peers (an external comparison) and when math skills are better than verbal skills (an internal comparison). Consistent with the model and empirical findings: (1) verbal and math self-concepts are nearly uncorrelated with each other even though verbal and math  achievement indicators are substantially correlated with each other and with the matching areas of self-concept; and (2) the direct effect of math achievement on verbal self-concept, and of verbal achievement on math self-concept, is negative. For inferred self-concepts (ratings by external observers), the external process seems to operate, but not the internal process. The findings demonstrate that academic self-concepts are affected by different processes than are the academic achievement areas they reflect and than are the inferred self-concepts. (Author/BS)",

Only data from four observers--at the two Developing Mathematical Processes Schools and the two Wisconsin Design for Reading Skills Development Schools, grades 2 and 5--were used. Interobserver agreements and reliabilities were computed for each of three situations: training session, retraining session, and on-site visits. For each pair of observers and for each category, marginal agreements were computed. For the category sets--General Content, Pacing, Grouping, Materials, Learner Moves, and Interactions--Category Marginal Agreements and Cohen's Kappa were computed.  Generalizability coefficients for estimates of reliability were computed for the training and retraining sessions for groups of three observers observing two or three classes for two days. The results indicated that there was high interobserver agreement at the three different check times on the categories of self-paced, other-paced, individual, large group, paper/pencil, engaged-written, engaged-covert, and non-engaged off task. The low interobserver agreements were explained mainly as a result of a low frequency of occurrence. The generalizability coefficients for total engagement and total non-engagement were acceptable.

Information on instructional methods and pupil outcomes for grades 2 and 5 was collected from achievement monitoring and domain referenced tests, teacher logs, and classroom observations. This report focuses on the procedures used in aggregating the reading skills and mathematics content areas.  Data were grouped for analysis at three progressively more specific levels: content area; general objective; and specific objective. The content areas for reading skills were Word Attack, Comprehension, and Study Skills. The math skills content areas were Place Value and Numeration, Operations Fractions, Decimal Fractions, Measurement, and Problem Solving. Appendix A contains a listing of the reading skills and math content codes in the aggregated form. Each aggregated case contains 12 digits arranged in four three-digit fields.

Numerous economic development models were reviewed and a comprehensive community study was conducted for use in the development of the model initiative--the Pueblo Business Assistance Network (PBAN). PBAN provides a unified network of services from the community and consists of four major assistance groups: (1) an intake and assistance center, which has received 183 requests for assistance and has helped 23 businesses to open or significantly expand;  (2) a non-profit, cooperative, volunteer assistance group, which provides in-depth assistance by practicing professionals; (3) a seed/venture capital assistance fund, which is designed to render financial assistance to any new or existing small business that is based in Pueblo County and will create jobs via the exportation of goods and services; and (4) the Business and Technology Center, an incubation facility providing affordable technical assistance and low overhead costs to new small businesses. PCC's efforts to alleviate the unemployment problem in its service area have also included expanded and innovative programs and services, geared towards the training or retraining of the local labor force.

        "description":"A research project was conducted to develop and implement a model for community college missions. The new model would depart from existing models, which utilize a hierarchy of decreasing levels of generality beginning with institutional missions and culminating in objectives. In contrast, this research defined institutional mission in terms of groups of specific activities that are themselves made up of goals and objectives. These activities are defined in terms of the services provided by an institution, the specific clientele for which these services are provided, and the rationale that is commonly advanced for providing these services. In fall 1981, a research project based on this conceptualization was conducted in Arizona. A list of more than 400 statements representing  activities related to all of the missions suggested for the Arizona community colleges was compiled, refined, and eventually reduced to a 60-item Community College Activities Survey (CCAS) instrument. The CCAS was administered to more than 3,500 state and local community college governing board members, administrators, faculty, legislators, and registered voters. Factor analysis and other statistical techniques were used to identify alternative operational missions and levels of support for them among the community college constituencies. Unlike previous goals research, the results of the CCAS application showed potential for affecting the management processes of higher education institutions. (LAL)",

First, the reasons for the demise are presented, including the rise of vocational institutes, which took over the vocational education function of community colleges; major cutbacks in funding and the inability of the colleges to compete for funds; the inability of the colleges to adapt to emerging technologies; and the rise in the proportion of jobs not requiring higher education. Next, the strategies undertaken by some comprehensive community colleges to preserve their existence are highlighted, including a re-emphasis on the humanities, a focus on excellence and new and emerging  technologies, an acknowledgement of financial limitations, and adaptation to employment changes. Finally, suggestions are provided for ways community colleges can avoid a premature demise, including: (1) rethinking what learning is, equating it less with memorization and more with thinking; (2) emphasizing sharing among institutions and developing a less parochial attitude toward campuses and equipment; and (3) implementing a new style and context for humanities education, looking to ways it can provide the most effective services to students.

Currently, UNICOR provides employment to approximately 8,000, or 26% of the total federal prison population, in emerging fields such as electronics, data graphics, wood, and plastics and in traditional fields such as metals, shoe and brush, and textiles. In support of inmate education and training, UNICOR allocates over $3 million to ongoing vocational education programs, as well as $400,000, annually, to upgrade vocational machinery and equipment. In 1983 and 1984, an additional $3 million was allocated, annually, to support innovative vocational programs, e.g., in petroleum technology, computerized drafting, numerically controlled machine operations, computer programming and maintenance, and water  treatment. Concurrent with the new vocational training initiative, the Bureau of Prisons established a mandatory literacy policy, requiring all inmates with less than 6th grade educational skills to enroll in a literacy program. Another new development in offender education involves the use of computers to assist in all phases of education. Early efforts to introduce computer-assisted instruction were largely abandoned due to high costs, lack of courseware, and hardware problems; however, recent efforts have been more successful with computer-assisted instruction now available in all but eight federal prisons. These new developments in correctional education are able to assist released offenders in finding and retaining jobs. (LAL)",

The next section considers the question of educational reform, focusing on top-down responses in areas such as program evaluation, institutional policies on credit and advisement, increased academic rigor, and revised teacher roles; and bottom-up responses which value college-based efforts, collaboration, and teaching and learning strategies. Following an overview of major trends in  remediation, political questions and complaints about the current state of remedial/developmental education are highlighted.

Data are provided reflecting the overall deemphasis of the transfer function in community colleges, the differential progress of Anglo and Hispanic students throughout the educational system, the participation rates of Hispanic students in community college education, and community college graduation rates. In addition, flaws and gaps in the data on transfer and student success are  highlighted. Then, problems of and barriers to transfer to four-year institutions by Hispanic students are presented, with focus on the characteristics of community college which mitigate successful transfer for all student groups (e.g., lower funding levels, inadequate communication with students regarding transfer, inability to elicit strong student commitment to and involvement with the college, insufficiently demanding academic standards, articulation problems, and underprepared students). Next, improvements in the situation of minority students in the community colleges are discussed, including affirmative action rules, increased interest by philanthropic foundations in minority students, and college-level minority-oriented programs. Finally, ways of improving the transfer process  are suggested, including better articulation with universities, stronger remediation and counseling services, and special activities for Hispanic students.

        "description":"This collection of articles addresses the role of community colleges in serving the specialized interests of organized community groups. After introductory comments on the topic, Seymour Eskow discusses how societal changes necessitate a reexamination of the role of the community college and an increased orientation to community organizations. Next, Lynn H. Willett presents a model utilizing a six-phase process to facilitate college/community collaboration. John Hyland's discussion of communities as centers of organized racial, ethnic, religious, social, and cultural groups is followed by Joseph A. Borgen and William B. Shade's presentation of a case study of the involvement of communities in Terre Haute, Indiana, in human resource and economic development. Next, Edward D.  Goldberg discusses the relationship between federal and state interests and local community interests, and presents a four-step process which can be used by local decision makers in mobilizing institutional resources. Dan E. Moore presents results from a statewide needs assessment conducted to determine adult education priorities in Pennsylvania, and considers the value of these findings for educators working at the local level. S. V. Martorana and William E. Piland pose three basic questions that community colleges must confront if they are to tackle the mission of serving organized community groups. Finally, Jim Palmer presents a review of the literature on community and college relations. (HB)",

These findings contradict the results of a number of studies and challenge the theories developed to account for those results. If 3- and 4-year-olds understand temporal and logical relationships well enough to describe them linguistically, assertions cannot be accepted that claim &quot;preoperational&quot; children necessarily cannot comprehend such relationships. Nor can componential models of lexical acquisition be accepted if  predictions made by the models find no support in production data. While the present data indicate that preschoolers have cognitive abilities they were thought to lack, it is likely that the children's abilities are limited to certain highly meaningful and well-represented contexts. The nature of young children's limitations in these domains, and the processes by which they overcome them, are topics for future research. (Tables provide examples of event descriptions, expressions of options and conditions, self-corrections of temporal sequences, and the production of relational terms.) (RH)",

        "description":"This paper provides a rationale for studies of educational program implementation and offers a causal model for program evaluation emphasizing pupil-related variables that intervene between program implementation and outcome variables. The rationale is followed by a discussion of implementation as an evaluation construct. Process, independent variable, and dependent variable perspectives are considered. Current models for measuring program implementation are described. While none is comprehensive, each model can be adapted to selected aspects of Follow Through. The question of where implementation fits on &quot;the measurement continuum&quot; is explored, and the view is expressed that implementation as a program evaluation construct allows for &quot;weaker&quot; and more global measurement indices.  In contrast, an educational &quot;treatment&quot; construct requires greater measurement precision and more detailed specification of program variables. Both approaches are thought to have analogues relevant to designing a comprehensive evaluation/experimentation plan for future studies in Follow Through. The succeeding discussion emphasizes the need for a systematic and comprehensive description of key program components as a precondition to developing evaluation instruments. Examples of &quot;critical dimensions&quot; of two Follow Through program components, associated performance indicators, and scaled descriptors, capable of being scored, are provided. In conclusion, deficiencies of the comparative, longitudinal approach to evaluating Follow Through are pointed out and the alternate, causal model is  described. (RH)",

If this major deficiency is not addressed immediately, the program probably will end. Because no study to date has recommended the establishment of national expectations and national criterion-referenced measures, this paper attempts to do so by reviewing the history, describing the present accomplishments, and projecting the future of Project Follow Through. Four questions are addressed: (1) What did citizens expect from Follow Through between 1967 and 1979? (2) What has the program accomplished as of 1980? (3) What can  the program hope to accomplish if impediments can be overcome? (4) What recommendations can be offered for designing and implementing new Follow Through approaches? (RH)",

First, professional education focused on inservice training for health practitioners. Second, consumer education provided information to parents in maternity wards and clinics. Project activities to disseminate information on infant and child care included (1) inservice training for health educators, professionals, and pediatric nurse practitioners; (2) videocassette presentations for new parents in  hospitals and clinics; (3) printed information; and (4) local meetings. Through these activities, the project established a link between parents of newborn infants and community child care resources. (The executive summary of the project is appended.) (Author/BJD)",

With Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a theoretical frame of reference, 200 children in kindergarten, second grade, and fourth grade were interviewed about what three wishes they would like to have and why, fears and worries, and what they would like to study. Children's responses were recorded by a concealed tape machine. An open-ended questionnaire was used to ask  teachers to list choices they allow children to make in their classrooms. Findings, supportive of Maslow's framework, indicated that: (1) expressed physiological and love needs decrease with age; and (2) safety, esteem, and self-actualization needs increase with age. Children expressed similar fears despite age, socioeconomic status, and ability level differences. Teachers reported allowing students to make choices primarily in nonacademic areas. Further study of teacher responses is planned. Appended are summaries of children's wishes, expressed according to grade level and socioeconomic status. Children's responses to questions are also categorized and compared. (BJD)",

Subjects were introduced to the computer alphabet game \"My First Alphabet\" for 12 minutes and then reconvened following a short break for a 12-minute book-reading session. Findings indicated that the mothers produced different patterns of verbal events than did the children. In addition, although language complexity was not affected in either case, the amount of verbal interaction was dramatically greater in the book-reading than in the computer session. Because of the computer's novelty, findings were inconclusive in assessing the degree of interest and involvement of parents  and children in book versus computer settings. It was suggested that future researchers discover whether differences exist between computer and reading interactions after subjects are more computer experienced. (BJD)",

Dependent variables were frequency of parental requests and educators' perceived ability to be helpful. Data collected from responses to a questionnaire enabled analysis of the differences between dependent variables and (1) school category; (2) willingness of educator to help; (3) sex of educator; (4) marital status of educator; (5) number of children to which educator is a parent; (6) public or private school; (7) position of school personnel; (8) subject assignment; (9) number of years of educational experience; (10) institution from which degree was received; (11) parenting classes offered by school; (12) parenting classes offered by a  community organization; (13) building enrollment; and (14) district enrollment. A random sample of 21 North Dakota schools was selected; the sample was stratified by accreditation level and by public or private designation. A total of 376 educators (of approximately 440 possible respondents) completed and returned the questionnaire. Results are discussed, numerous conclusions and recommendations are offered, and the questionnaire is appended. (RH)",

        "description":"A 3-year cooperative program between the College of Saint Rose (Albany, New York) and surrounding rural school districts has two main goals: to help rural Chief School Officers (CSOs) design staff development activities to meet educational needs of mainstreamed handicapped students and to improve the college's preservice teacher education program so that graduating students will be better prepared to provide services to rural handicapped students. During the program's first year (1983-84), 13 CSOs responded to a needs assessment survey related to program goals. It is planned that three rural regions, organized from 15 districts, will collaborate with the college through rural teams composed of administrators and faculty and/or school board members. At an orientation meeting in  November 1983, generally-held concerns of CSOs were identified as: attitudes of regular classroom teachers toward mainstreaming, the need for inservice and the need for appropriate materials and instructional strategies for mainstreaming. In March 1984, a meeting between College faculty and Region I CSOs included presentations on rural inservice activities through the Board of Cooperative Education Services, rural inservice using consultants, and strategies and issues for learning disabled in rural areas. A College Task Force has been established, has interacted with the Region I rural team, and has begun to think about curricular changes. Assessment survey results are appended. (MH)",

        "description":"This series of four essays is designed to share practical, workable strategies for quality rural education. The first essay, Ernest Lohman's &quot;It's About Time...,&quot; gives an overview of the effective schooling concept and then looks specifically at ways a classrooom teacher can apply that concept. The essay includes a bibliography. The second essay, Professor Kenneth Heuser's &quot;The Principal's Role and Effectiveness in New Hampshire Schools,&quot; examines both actual and perceived effectiveness, and asserts that schools are judged not only by how well they perform, but by how well they are perceived to be doing their job. Charles Ashley's &quot;Six Points Towards Increased Effectiveness in Rural Schools&quot; draws attention to positive steps that school boards can take to improve the quality of  rural schools, and suggests that educators capitalize on the familiarity of small town environments to foster conviviality and cooperation in developing and carrying out school policy. The last essay, &quot;Managing Our Schools for Effective Learning,&quot; by John Davy and Larry Bramblett, looks to contrasting management styles in the automobile industry--as practiced in Detroit and Japan--as a framework for examining a consensus approach to school management. It invites readers to identify desired results rather than abstract goals for educational systems. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"The Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Restoration Act (1980) restored federal recognition of the tribe after a quarter century of ambiguous political status, and resulted in significant improvements of educational status of tribal members and intensification of the political presence of Southern Paiutes. Following the Paiute Indian Termination Act (1954), 15,000 acres of tribal lands were sold; the Paiutes suffered poverty, decreased education, and health problems. After restoration, a predominantly new Tribal Council was elected and a tribal goal of improving educational quality was set. By 1982, the median grade completed by persons over 18 years had increased, and a cultural enrichment program had been established, featuring Paiute language instruction, arts and crafts, and daily  academic tutoring. The dropout rate decreased from 40% to 3%, and mothers reported that their children were doing better in school and were more interested in learning. College enrollment of tribal members also increased, with an average student age of 25.6 years indicating that a long-accumulated backlog of educational deficiencies was being remedied. The Council also planned to acquire lands equivalent to those lost after termination, and to provide jobs and revenue for community development projects. Traditional Paiute land tenure ideals hold that buying and selling of aboriginal claims are granting and revocation of use rights only. (MH)",

The numerous raised-line images that were produced were assembled along with brailled and large print student instructions, audio cassette tapes describing the lab materials and instructor suggestions into nine laboratory modules that include: microscopy, mitosis, leaf structure, algae, fungi, plant and animal cells, protozoans, stem structure, and root structure. The tactile facsimiles of microscopic views were made through the sequential combination of standard photomicrography, direct stencil photo silkscreening methods, and printing with heat polymerizable ink. Classroom testing under  a variety of settings indicate that the durability, degree of relief and the detail of the raised-line facsimiles as well as the usefulness of the ancillary module materials was very good. Other important features of the tactile diagrams and photos produced using the new method include their low cost and portability. The potential of using the methods in other sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, etc.) as well as non-science areas (geography, history, economics, psychology, etc.) is significant.

The first study investigated whether or not time spent in science with fourth and fifth graders (N=86) detracted from learning in more basic areas. The second study examined reading and mathematics achievement in grades 1 and 3 as related to initial performance and to four classroom processes. These processes were represented by four constructs: opportunity, motivators, instructional events, and structure. Opportunity consisted of two variables, time and curriculum overlap, with time being estimated by attendance, allocation, task rate, enrollment, and transfers. The third study investigated the nature of reading difficulties in learning disabled (LD) classes, type of student  activities which lead to greatest improvement in reading test performance, and what types of instructional situations generate these student activities. Among the basic findings which have emerged from these studies are those indicating that time is overlapping and not mutually exclusive within a student or teacher, even when the focus is primarily on one type of activity; that time on task is not the same as time on the right task; and that allocated time may not be the upper bound for engaged time.

As part of this study, a national survey was conducted to determine: (1) which of 14 objectives (representing eight categories of aims contained in ministry guidelines) science teachers consider to be important for the level at which they teach; (2) science teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness of their teaching in enabling students to achieve these objectives; and (3) obstacles to the achievement of the various aims  of science education. Factors related to physical facilities, institutional arrangements, and support for science teaching were also examined. This volume discusses the survey objectives, methodology, and questionnaire (included in an appendix) used; characteristics of the teachers surveyed; and the findings. Among the findings are those indicating that, at the elementary level, more male than female teachers rated science content objective as fairly or very important and that teachers at all levels considered science-related attitudes important.

To measure science anxiety, a questionnaire (included in an appendix) was developed, pilot-tested on students in grades 5 and 7 in the Bowling Green (Ohio) School District, and administered in final form to 532 fourth, sixth, eighth, and ninth grade students. ANOVA, MANOVA, and ANCOVA statistical analyses were done on the data. Among the major findings are the following: (1) feelings (particularly anxiety) toward science and science-related topics are significantly sex-related; (2) females at grade 4 already display more anxiety toward science than do males; (3) for this study, science anxiety did not increase with grade level; (4) since only 30  percent of fourth and sixth grade teachers compared to 100 percent of junior high school teachers rated science as first choice when asked to rate preferences for five different subject areas, it is speculated that teachers' attitudes may affect feelings toward science; and (5) significant differenes on science achievement in relation to science anxiety were found, with high levels of science anxiety correlating with low science achievement scores.

The first section presents statements of the National Science Teachers Association supporting the right and responsibility of teachers to provide sex education. The second section provides articles which focus on the debate between advocates of sex education and its opponents as well as on the past and future role of sex education in schools. The third section develops the concept that an adequate sex education program can help students to clarify their values and to recognize personally as well as socially acceptable moral and ethical principles. At the same time, this section is  designed to present practical examples of both content and technique to assist in the sensitive teaching task that sex education presents. Each article in this section stresses that adequate sex education consists of more than strictly biological information. The fourth section reinforces the need for teaching specific topics which sometimes are eliminated by censorship. Articles in this section focus on such topics as venereal disease, birth control, premarital sex, abortion, and homosexuality. (JN)",

These areas include: (1) human decision-making; (2) eliciting information from experts; (3) user-computer interaction; (4) supervisory control systems; (5) population group differences; and (6) applied methods (including education in this field). Each area is discussed in a separate chapter designed to be a  self-contained report of the research needs in that area. (JN)",

        "description":"Three studies were conducted in order to determine the source and frequency of children's difficulties in subtraction and to examine different approaches to remediation. In the first study, third-grade children were asked to solve subtraction problems and were observed and questioned about their solution processes. Children who had difficulty either attempted to borrow incorrectly or made inversion errors. The second study examined the efficacy of two minimally intrusive methods of remediation. Third-grade children were given either instructions to borrow, promised rewards for accurate performance or no intervention and were asked to solve a series of subtraction problems requiring borrowing. Neither experimental condition resulted in a significant increase in the number of  problems solved correctly, and error patterns again indicated that children had difficulty with the borrowing process. In the third study, third- and fourth-grade children were assigned to one of three conditions: training in the component skills required for borrowing; feedback in the form of correctly worked solutions; or a regular classroom control condition. Both treatment conditions resulted in a significant increase in the number of problems solved correctly, and these increases were accompanied by a reduction of errors in the borrowing process.

        "description":"This study documented the spontaneously derived strategies that children use which may play a key role in the transition from counting to recall of number facts. For these strategies, the child uses a small set of known number facts to derive the solution to unknown number facts. How training in the use of derived strategies influences the solution strategies used was also studied, with special note of changes in solution strategies from counting to strategies based on relations among facts. A teaching experiment was conducted with one second-grade class (N=23) for eight weeks beginning in early September. Four interviews were conducted with each child, involving a pretest, a mid-instruction interview, a posttest, and a long-range effects test, in addition to short daily  interviews and three group timed tests. The instructional unit and strategies taught are described, as are the interviews, observations, timed test, and student workbooks. Derived fact strategies accounted for about 20 percent of the children's responses on the pretest, and for one-half of the responses to addition combinations and over one-fourth of the answers to subtraction combinations following instruction.

Specific modes of formal reasoning (proportional reasoning, controlling variables, probabilistic, correlational and combinatorial reasoning) were first examined. Findings support the notion of hierarchical relationships which exist among those variables. Further results from factor analysis provide evidence that the variables represent specific cognitive structures that are interdependent with each other and precede operations in development. Finally, significant relationships were found to exist between the different modes of formal reasoning and principled moral reasoning. Combinatorial and correlational reasoning were found to significantly account  for 22 percent of the variance in principled moral reasoning. Theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

Of these trends, the author believes that the one with the greatest potential impact is the trend toward increasing high school  graduation requirements.

How children with different counting schemes differ in their addition and subtraction concepts and how the types of problems children solve correlate with the addition and subtraction concepts were specifically explored. The 3-week study was conducted as a teaching experiment, with children's behavior observed and their mental processes probed in interviews, and in teaching episodes. Eight children in grades 1 and 2 were selected to reflect possible variations in counting, addition, and subtraction schemes. Four representations of addition concepts and six representations of subtraction concepts were found, with  one or more specific schemes identified with each representation. The schemes were classified by developmental levels. Children who constructed higher level schemes also solved all kinds of addition and subtraction problems which involved larger numbers. Children's uses of their schemes reflected awareness of the difficulty of a problem and basic understanding of adding and subtracting. (MNS)",

Particular emphasis was given to analysis and classification of errors made by students solving a variety of mathematical items. The research consisted of analyzing responses from all sixth-grade  students on previously existing data and analyzing children's (N=93) problem-solving behaviors obtained from individual interviews. Among the results reported are those indicating that girls were more likely to make errors leading to illogical responses and errors resulting from guessing strategies and that girls performed better on computation and worse than boys on story problems. Appendices include items used in interviews; children's responses to these items; and manuscripts, prepared for journal or book publication, which contain more technical detail about the research.

The manual (which includes basic text material, audiovisuals, and evaluation exercises as well as detailed instructions for presenting the material and managing sanitary training activities) is divided into 13 units of varying length. Unit topics focus on water regulations, water sources (general, wells, springs, and surface sources), pumps, water treatment, storage  (gravity storage and hydropneumatic tanks), water distribution (distribution systems and cross-connections), monitoring and recordkeeping, management and safety, surveys, communications and public relations, and technical assistance; an orientation unit and concluding information are provided in separate units. Each unit includes a summary, objectives, basic material (in outline format), instructional strategies, unit emphasis, student preparation, and pre-/post-tests.

During the first class of each of five semesters, students enrolled in an American History Since 1865 course were asked to write one paragraph about any president in the time period 1865-1981. Due to time constraints, the report contains summaries of student evaluations of four presidents only: Richard M. Nixon (the most written about president in the study); John F. Kennedy (ranked second in student selection); Harry S. Truman (included to achieve political balance--two Democrats and two Republicans); and Theodore Roosevelt (included because he is not in the students' immediate historical tradition). Students believe that Nixon's  foreign policy achievements will ultimately overshadow his participation in Watergate and that historians will finally judge him as a great president. Kennedy is viewed as a hero and an outstanding leader. Truman is known for his honesty and decision making. Roosevelt is viewed as a forceful leader in foreign and domestic affairs. If the papers were graded on the quality of written English, as a whole they would receive a grade of C- to D+. (RM)",

The process includes selection of content, unit development, internal and external review, revision based on feedback, and the completed unit production. Dissemination strategies include conference presentations, inservice education, general advisory services, and inter-organizational cooperation. Recommendations for improvement of the projects are: (1) setting priorities  for the amount of time spent on project activities, (2) investigating the effect of more group planning during the development process, (3) understanding that formative evaluation data are of limited value as a means of ensuring that the product has overcome problems associated with actual use, and (4) identifying effective methods of dissemination and implementation.

        "description":"This bulletin describes the interplay of demographic and sociopolitical processes in Israel since the state's founding in May 1948 and projects what it might be to 2015. Heavy Jewish immigration, especially during the &quot;mass immigration&quot; of 1948-51, has balanced the high natural increase of Moslems so that the proportion of Jews in Israel's population at the end of 1982 was little changed from June 1948. By 2015 the Jewish proportion could be only 50 percent in a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; if Israel annexes the Occupied Areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip where 1.2 million Arabs now live. &quot;Oriental&quot; Jews from less developed North African and Asian countries, who were only 15 percent of Israel's Jewish population in 1948, outnumbered European American Jews by 1970. This was an important  factor in the 1977 shift of political dominance from the leftwing Labor parties, supported by the better-educated, socialist-leaning European-American Jews, to a rightwing bloc, espousing economic policies based on more private initiative and Israel's historic rights to the West Bank. Western-oriented Jews, although still the country's &quot;establishment,&quot; comprised only 40 percent of Israel's population by 1981. By 2015, their share is likely to be down to 30 percent within Israel's present boundaries. The questions of whether or not Israel will be a Jewish state and remain a Western society will continue salient into the 21st century. (Author)",

        "description":"A values exercise suitable for secondary school students is divided into three sections. The first section, an introduction to students, explains the concepts of and interrelationships between basic human needs, culture, values orientation, and global perspectives. The intent of the exercise, to help students appreciate how a set of value orientations is peculiar to a specific place and time, is also explained. The second section, the student exercise, describes 15 basic human concerns, organized under the headings of the individual, social relations, and nature and the supernatural. For each concern, students indicate where on a continuum they believe the majority of people in their own community stand on the issue. Examples of the concerns considered are belief in fate, sex  roles, decision-making, personal values, friendship, conflict resolution, concern for the past, family ties, and material values. A final section contains a leader's guide for the student exercise. Information on learning objectives, materials, preparation, time and space requirements is provided, as are step-by-step procedures for group discussion. What is assumed to be the general consensus of professional sociologists, anthropologists, and researchers regarding the placement of the United States as a whole on each of the 15 scales is summarized.

        "description":"Exchange programs of a month or less are unlikely to have many of the positive outcomes of more extended intercultural experiences. Worse, very short exchange programs (VSPs) may even have some undesirable outcomes. Positive outcomes not attainable through VSPs are: (1) development of long-lasting positive relationships and attitudes toward the people of the host culture; (2) change, to some extent, in the identity of the reference groups thought of as one's own; and (3) development of an intercultural perspective. One potential undesirable outcome of VSPs is that pre-conceived views and prejudicial attitudes can be strengthened. Another undesirable outcome is that participants are more likely to attribute the behavior of others to personal traits rather than to situational  factors. Thus, participants return home with what they think is a well-founded set of opinions about why their hosts act in the way they do, but actually these opinions are based on incomplete or erroneous information. Because the quality of an intercultural exchange experience is directly related to the quantity of time involved, VSP sponsorship should be avoided. (RM)",

Following an introduction (section 1), analysis is divided into 5 additional sections. Section 2 discusses tools for conceptualizing knowledge systems, including social knowledge systems in simple and complex societies, major functions performed by knowledge-related activities (knowledge production, organization and structuring of knowledge, distribution of knowledge, and storage of knowledge), and the social construction of reality. Section 3 considers linkages between national knowledge systems through international channels. The quantitative increases in students from less developed nations,  increasing numbers of scientific and professional organizations, and the growth of international development assistance have all aided the globalization of interaction and transfer of knowledge. Section 4 outlines four types of linkages: those between research and use within an institutional domain, those from research to use across institutions, those between a central use-oriented region and a peripheral research-oriented region, and those between central research-oriented regions and peripheral use-oriented regions. The diversity of linkage challenges and the roles of different kinds of knowledge syntheses are examined. Sections 5 and 6 assert that certain types of linkages--linkages that cross institutional domains--call predominantly for certain types of knowledge syntheses.  (LP)",

A four-fold table conceptualizes educational interventions and their outcomes as consisting of social and academic interventions and their outcomes. This model characterizes programmatic interventions as a mechanism for changing opportunities and making interaction more or less convenient. The model is applied to evaluation of two nationwide policies that call for social intervention in public education: racial desegregation and the mainstreaming of mildly handicapped children. In the case of desegregation, data include numerical levels of desegregation, the level of effort, and the repeated measures of  social interaction. The outcome noted is the level of integration across various settings. The optimum process for developing data on social outcomes is sociometric testing. (LP)",

        "description":"A major focus of the psychology of instruction is understanding and facilitating the changes in cognition and performance that occur as an individual moves from low to higher competence in a domain of knowledge and skill. A new program of research which examines the initial state of the learner as a component of this transition in competence is described in this 8-part document. Part 1 introduces two previous attempts to relate aptitude to instruction: differential aptitude tests and aptitude treatment interaction. Part 2 provides an overview of the two general research approaches to aptitude analysis, the cognitive correlates approach and the cognitive components approach. The approach taken in the present research effort is described as a task analytic approach that considers  basic processes, executive strategies, and content knowledge in aptitude test performances of skilled and less skilled individuals. Part 3 considers the relationship between inductive reasoning and general ability. Common generic properties of inductive tasks are discussed as are different types of inductive items on aptitude tests. Part 4 outlines earlier theories on analogical reasoning performance. Problem features, processing models, item processing data and theory, item errors, and performance are analyzed for figural, numerical, and verbal analogy solutions in parts 5 through 7. A final part discusses results of research, concluding that a number of interrelated factors differentiate high and low skill individuals. These factors include management of memory load, organization of an  appropriate knowledge base, and procedural knowledge of task constraints. (LP)",

NAEP has indicated that 13- and 17-year-old girls have strong negative attitudes toward science and have little belief that the discipline can be useful to them. Research suggests that social factors (role models and sex stereotypes), educational factors (enrollment patterns, adult expectations, and class activities), and personal factors (spatial visualization) all contribute to this negative attitude. Possible remedies include adaptation of teaching strategies to female student needs, use of experiments that would enhance  girls' spatial abilities, and incorporation of structured lab work. A national study has identified 10 teaching factors that affect retention of girls in science, including attractive classrooms, nonsexist teacher-developed materials, teacher awareness of sexism, and teacher encouragement of extracurricular activities.

First, teachers need to be trained specifically in art criticism questioning formats in which there is an emphasis on complex levels of thinking. To be effective, this training requires that teachers model and practice questioning techniques as well as code their own questions. Some structure for the categorization of questions and for the development of higher level questions is necessary. Art teachers also need training in the formal qualities of question construction. For example, teachers need to allow for ample pause time, to ask probing and  elaborative questions, to involve all students, and to avoid rhetorical questions. Since small group discussions have been correlated with higher cognitive questions, art teachers need to examine the quality of the many one-to-one interactions that normally occur in art classes.

Women are getting divorced more often, but they are also remarrying at a high rate.

A description of the scope and activities of the events includes data on the audience, length of time of activities, workshop sites, presentation methods,  participant evaluation, and intended use of ideas. Interviews conducted about six months after each event provide information on local activities resulting from the state-sponsored inservice, actions taken, reasons for action or inaction, satisfaction as to the usefulness of the events, and individual and organizational impact of the event. A list of 18 conclusions is presented with recommendations for coordinators of state-sponsored inservice. (JD)",

Unlike most traditional health lesson plans which emphasize the lecture method, these Niger lesson plans stimulate and encourage full client participation. Although designed in 1971 for Sahelian countries, these lessons, adapted and modified as appropriate, can potentially serve as a valuable tool for health programs in Francophone Africa today, and perhaps as a guide for materials development in other countries, as well.

Each subject participated in a 10 trial practice session one day prior to the experiment and immediately preceding the pre-test. The pre-test consisted of four trials with 15 seconds between each trial. One minute after the termination of the progressive arm ergometry exercise, post-test, recovery 1, 2, and 3 reaction time treatments were administered. A single group design ANOVA with repeated measures indicated that reaction, movement, and response times were significantly faster during the pre-test than during the post-test, recovery 1, 2, or 3, while there were no significant  differences between mean times for post-test, recovery 1, 2, or 3. The ANOVA for trial effects during the third trial were significantly faster than during the first trial, while there were no significant differences between other trials. It was concluded that heavy physical fatigue produced in the upper extremities transferred to the lower extremities and significantly impaired the whole body reaction time, movement time, and response time and that this deteriorative effect remained during acute recovery.

Students and teachers also respond to a gender-based questionnaire before and after the treatment. Nineteen teachers from five Los Angeles County (California) school districts are participating in the program. Data  collection materials are the GESA classroom observation model; mathematics, reading and language arts achievement tests; and the \"Who Should\" gender bias questionnaire. A discussion is presented on the five areas of gender bias in the classroom: (1) instructional contact; (2) grouping and organization; (3) discipline; (4) self-concept; and (5) evaluation.

This paper places inquiry into field experiences into an historical and critical context, raising questions about assumptions that are generally taken for granted. Field experience in teacher education is explored in the context of the professionalization of teaching. It is argued that the process of professionalization with its emphasis on the development of scientific and neutral skills, methods, and knowledge resulted in an over-emphasis on instruction in technique and method. Field experiences, then, were generally embedded in programs which emphasized the development of technical skills, rather than reflection on theory in practice  and alternative possibilities. It is suggested that most of these experiences were probably not at variance with the technocratic assumptions found in teacher education programs, nor with the expectations of professionalization and the role of the teacher as they have been defined in the 20th century. It is noted that these traditions raise questions about the assumptions that underlie the rhetoric of early field experiences and the effects on current practice should be examined. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes a 1982-83 descriptive evaluation of first year implementation of 15 regional teacher service agencies in California, referred to as Teacher Education and Computer Centers (TECCs). Self-report data and case studies from three regions were used to describe the configuration of the centers, their service delivery, and perceived success and problems. Implementation was powerfully affected by the environment of each agency. On the whole, service delivery was dominated by computer training, with an apparent reduced level of training in curriculum and instructional methodology. Scope of responsibility, governance issues, and relationships with business, industry, colleges, and universities are problematic, due in part to a lack of standard routines for sharing  resources among agencies, and in part to ambiguity in the initial authorizing legislation. This paper includes four sections. Section I discusses the study methodology. Section II provides a summary of reported TECC services including: (1) service delivery; (2) resource brokerage and capacity building; (3) computer use; and (4) relationships with institutions of higher education and other agencies. In section III, three TECC case studies are offered, and section IV contains analysis and discussion. Three lengthy appendices are included: (1) Legislative Language: Budget Act 1982-83; (2) Self-Report Data Collection Instrument; and (3) case studies of the three TECCs. (JMK)",

Participants were teaching elementary school in an urban environment: 23 education students, 32 student teachers, 30 beginning teachers, 12 intermediate teachers, and 15 experienced teachers. The conceptual complexity of subjects was measured by the Paragraph Completion Test (Phares & Schroder). Subjects' career maturity was assessed using Crites' Career Maturity Inventory-Adult Form, Attitudes Scale, and Competence Test. The Teacher Work-Life Inventory measured stress in teachers' work environments. The data  provide support for the view that stress in the work environment of urban elementary school teachers is associated with their cognitive complexity. Results also suggest that elementary school teachers may tend to make better career decisions under less stressful work conditions and that the career maturity of teachers appears to increase with added experience. Issues for further research are considered. (JD)",

In addition, it used the results to identify those training techniques which seemed to be better at changing teachers' behavior in their classrooms. Twenty-nine teachers were trained by five trainers in five weekly training sessions, which were tape recorded. The recordings were analyzed using these observation methods: (1) Trainer Citation of Observation Variables; (2) Flanders Interaction Analysis; (3) B. O. Smith's Analysis of the Logic of Teaching; and (4) Content Analysis. The dependent variable was based upon pre- and post-training observations of the teachers in their own classrooms. The findings of the four observation methods, while consistent, revealed different facets of the  training experience. The most accurate predictor of resulting teacher change was the total number of Trainer Citations of the Observation Variables, but the framework for the model, the structure of the trainer's interactions, relied upon the Flanders Matrix. B. O. Smith's analysis gave a glimpse into the processes that take place between the trainer and teachers, and how a teacher is induced to change. The Content Analysis identified those areas of training that appear to be the most useful to teachers in enabling them to change their teaching behaviors. Fourteen tables are included in the report.

        "description":"A study determined if teachers discriminated among three different types of direct supervisory communication--information only, information with suggestions, and information with directives--in instructional improvement conferences. Thirty inservice teachers were assigned to three experimental groups and viewed videotapes which simulated supervisory conferences. Each conference differed according to degree of informational versus controlling language. Teacher perceptions of the degree to which the supervisor's behavior indicated supportiveness, authenticity, loyalty, trust, and productivity were measured after each conference. Teachers rated highest the conferences in which the supervisor communicated information with suggestions, rated next, conferences in which the supervisor  communicated information only, and lowest the conferences in which the supervisor communicated information with directives. In analyzing these results, it is suggested that information with suggestions provides the teacher with a guide for accepting, revising, or rejecting the supervisor's offered choice, and that there may be a limit to the amount of choice individuals desire. Suggestions are made for further research. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Interactive decision making (IDM) refers to teachers' selection and rejection of alternative courses of action during instruction. Previous research indicates that teachers report making interactive decisions when their plans are disrupted. A study generated hypotheses about teachers' IDM using the grounded theory approach--an inductive system for generating interrelated hypotheses grounded in the empirical. Twelve elementary school teachers conducted lessons in their classrooms and recorded them on audiotape. Within 48 hours of the lesson, these teachers were interviewed using the stimulated-recall technique. These interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Ideational units were compared and contrasted, categories were constructed--all followed by numerous returns to the data  where categories and then hypotheses were revised using the constant comparative technique. Three hypotheses were generated: (1) Teachers' IDM is embedded in classroom learning activities; (2) Teachers' intentions during interactive teaching are to move learning activities forward to completion; and (3) This intention is supported by IDM routines. A concluding discussion points to learning activities as mediators of the structural tension between unlimited subject matter and limited time. Implications for the implementation of curricular innovations are suggested. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"A study sought objective information about inservice activities for teachers and the extent to which these activities incorporated elements identified as effective through research. The focus was on the teachers who were recipients of inservice programs rather than the programs themselves. The interviews involved three school districts and two elementary schools within each district. Participants were a central office administrator from each district, principals of the schools, and six teachers from each school. Four research questions were asked: (1) How much inservice is currently received by teachers and sponsored by administrators? (2) What form do current inservice activities take, and how does this compare with recommended practice? (3) What percentage of activities are in  basic skills? and (4) How effective and satisfactory is current inservice? Results are discussed within the framework of the different roles of teachers and administrators and the priorities those roles imposed upon them. Teachers perceived inservice as relevant when it was tightly coupled to actual school curriculum and instruction. Administrators loosely coupled inservice programs with needs assessment, priority goals, educational research and development, and improvement of school systems. (JD)",

The social contexts and human factors that influenced the development of teacher education in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries are examined. An inquiry is made into the institutionalization of teachers' preparation over the past l00 years with a particular focus on developing conceptions of professionalization. The paper identifies three paradigms of professionalization in the history of teacher preparation: teaching as a \"calling,\" teaching as a \"science,\" and teaching as a \"craft.\" The process by which the second paradigm has come to dominate thinking about teaching and teacher  preparation and the effects of this domination on the practice of teaching and preparing teachers are explored. It is noted that teaching as a \"craft\" is overshadowed by the dominant, technological paradigm, and it is suggested that a more thorough examination of this paradigm by teacher educators is in order.

Comparisons were made between these managers and other women employed in leisure services, but the major focus was in delineating the uniqueness of these women managers and comparing how they are like or unlike female managers in other professions. A portion of the study analyzed the subjects' personality characteristics and how subjects perceived their own personality in contrast to what is culturally defined as stereotypically feminine or masculine. Respondents also provided information on reasons for choosing leisure services as a career, future goals, work satisfaction, and management of personal and professional lives.  They were also asked whether or not they were influenced by female role models. Results indicated that they were not much different from other women employed in leisure services in general, although they tended to possess somewhat more &quot;masculine&quot; traits and were more nontraditional in their sex role views.

        "description":"A study sought to determine the stability of student/teacher interactional gymnasium behavior over one academic year. The design of the study was a single-subject, time-series analysis. The subject was a male elementary school physical education teacher with 14 years of experience. Data were collected using the Cheffers Adaptation of Flanders Interaction Analysis System (CAFIAS) with observations made at equally spaced intervals throughout one school year. A total of 52 useable observations were obtained and analyzed to determine behavioral stability. Only one-quarter of the CAFIAS behavior categories were found stable and these behaviors accounted for less than 30 percent of all behavior. This led to the conclusion that teaching behavior in this physical education setting may  lack the stability necessary for making inferential generalizations common to the natural science paradigm used in research into teacher behavior. It is concluded that teaching may be a social rather than a natural phenomenon. The results of both this study and previous research found that teaching behavior fluctuates in unpredictable patterns, and additional research paradigms, along with natural science methodologies, may depict a more accurate and complete picture of teaching in the gym. The study suggested a need for more long-term investigations of teaching. (JD)",

A primary purpose of the study was to survey service providers as to their actual encounters with elder abuse and neglect. Each provider was asked about warning signs or cues that were indications that something was fundamentally wrong or that a senior could be a possible victim of abuse. Two standard responses were suspicious injuries and inconsistency of behavior. However, seven other general categories emerged: (1) medical manifestations; (2) interpersonal relationships; (3) neglect; (4) home and living environment; (5) finances; (6) depression; and (7) physical disintegration. Three problems were identified: (1) the  need to address legal issues; (2) the lack of protective service by providers; and (3) an undeveloped set of services to address the issue. Recommendations are given for solving various problems in the elder abuse area. Products developed from the findings of the study and intended as aides to providers of services to the elderly include a set of transparencies and slides coordinated with an audio tape as a \"Packaged Program\" for seniors; a general brochure describing elder abuse and its symptoms, and giving information and referral numbers; a general informational booklet based on the audio visual materials; an intake card; and a final report.

It is a phenomenological study of the classroom teacher and a group of seven elementary school teachers who reflected upon, wrote about, and discussed their lives as classroom teachers over a one-year period. Teachers kept written diaries which contained their thoughts and feelings about daily events and circumstances that affected them as teachers. The diaries provided topics for discussion at weekly seminar sessions on teaching and professional development. Biweekly participant observations in each classroom were made by the researcher. In this report, a description of the last third of the project is presented. Methods of analysis in teacher portrait construction are discussed.  Portraits of four teachers constructed from the multiple data sources (diaries, transcriptions of seminar sessions, slides of each classroom and school, observations of participants' teaching and field notes, and informal conferences and interviews with each teacher in each school) are offered.

For a study which set out to explain such variation, pre- and post-workshop questionnaires were completed by 349 staff (three-fourths of whom were teachers) who participated in 36 teacher-initiated, inservice projects. Participants' ratings of five inservice outcomes were regressed on, and correlated with, their background characteristics, their psychological and professional traits, their school and community characteristics, their school climate, and features of their workshops. All variables combined account for 85 percent of the variance in the inservice outcome measures. Approximately half of this variance  is accounted for by the staff and school characteristics, and the remaining half by the climate and workshop features. These results indicate that complex interactions of many staff, contextual, and workshop factors affect the outcomes of staff inservice. Many of these factors can be influenced by workshop designers.

        "description":"In 1981, TDR Associates, a private, independent research organization in Newton, Massachusetts, began a two and one-half year study of &quot;Knowledge Utilization and School Improvement Through Staff Initiated Inservice Programs.&quot; This study was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Education and conducted under an arrangement with the Commonwealth Inservice Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Education. More than an attempt in bridging the gap between research and practice, this effort has resulted in an example of mutual adjustment, where application of practitioners' situational knowledge or social intelligence has improved and informed the research process. The central hypothesis of the study is that participant needs and engaging workshop process are  important, but that alone they comprise an incomplete account of knowledge acquistion/use in staff inservice. In addition to participant and workshop characteristics, this research explores the role of such contextual factors as school and district climate, supervisor support, peer relations, student needs, and job satisfaction in inservice outcomes. The research combines quantitative and qualitative methods and has proceeded according to three interactive and interdependent phases. (JMK)",

        "description":"Current research and past experience indicate the need to examine longitudinal effects of staff development efforts on school improvement and knowledge use. A six-month follow-up study of knowledge use from staff inservice training was undertaken. Questionnaries were completed by 235 staff (94 percent teachers) who had participated in a study of 1982 inservice workshops. Participant follow-up responses were coded, merged and analyzed, along with pre-post inservice questionnaire data, against four inservice outcomes. The outcome variables, one from the post-inservice questionnaire and three from the follow-up survey, measured participants' ratings of predicted, continued, and future knowledge use and knowledge adaptation. These outcomes were regressed on and correlated with  participants' background characteristics, professional and psychological traits, school and community characteristics, their school climate, workshop features, and the immediate effects of their workshop itself. All variables combined account for approximately 90 percent of the variance in the knowledge use measures. Approximately half of this variance is accounted for by staff and school characteristics and the remaining half by school climate and workshop features. The results, reported in this paper, show little evidence of knowledge adaptation. They further suggest that continued knowledge use is the result of a complex interaction of staff, contextual, and workshop factors. (Author/JMK)",

        "description":"Data from a survey of 1269 parents (of whom 24 percent were single parents) were used to study whether single and married parents differ in their interactions with elementary schools and teachers. Results indicate that initial differences between single and married parents' perceptions of teachers and teachers' evaluations of single and married parents are due to other family and school conditions. Race, parent education, grade level, teacher practices of parent involvement, and overall teacher quality significantly influence parent reports of teacher practices. Single parents also felt more pressure than did married parents to be involved with their children in learning activities at home. Married parents spent more time assisting teachers at school. Study results show the  importance of measures of school structures and processes in research on single parents. Single parents had better relations with teachers whose philosophy and practices lead them toward more positive attitudes about parents. Teacher leadership, not parent marital status, influenced parent awareness, appreciation of teachers' efforts, and knowledge about the school program. (Author/CJB)",

        "description":"A study examined, from the perspective of the University of North Carolina and its President Frank Porter Graham, the importance of the Graham Plan, which in the 1930s sought to regulate intercollegiate athletics by disallowing preferential treatment of athletes in the area of financial aid. Graham and his supporters desired to prohibit the use of athletic scholarships and other material benefits in recruiting athletes and urged the selection of varsity players from the student body. Though the plan passed on the strength of its idealism, the institutions of the Southern Conference only supported the Graham Plan for one year because it placed them at a competitive disadvantage with non-conference teams and because of widespread media and alumni opposition. The existence of the  Graham Plan was brief yet visionary of a later National Collegiate Athletic Association attempt, the Sanity Code. Both failed to effect changes in increasingly popular and commercial intercollegiate athletic programs. This paper is based on an examination of President's papers, Board of Trustees minutes, Chancellor's papers, University records, newspaper reports, the background for its adoption by the Southern Conference, and viewpoints from individuals who opposed the changes.

        "description":"In the 1980s females in America are permitted and even encouraged to participate in youth sports. This social phenomenon, however, is of recent vintage since most youth sports programs did not initially welcome girls' participation. Three major factors in girls not having been provided equal opportunities in sport are physiological differences in the sexes, societal norms and attitudes, and organizational rules and support. Although competition for girls was largely restricted until the 1960s, some sport participation did occur. Beginning in the 1960s attitudes began changing, since the existing golf, tennis, and field hockey tournaments had not harmed the participants physically or emotionally. While cultural attitudes have prevented many girls from eagerly pursuing sport, these  too are changing. No longer are sport outcomes such as character development, social interaction skills, and enhanced self-worth thought to be appropriate only for boys. Organizational rules and support have determined what youth sport opportunities have existed for females, and since societal attitudes have traditionally encouraged sports for males, they invariably were the beneficiaries of the best programs. Most national youth sport organizations today no longer have restrictions about girls participating. The three reasons justifying the limitations placed on female participation in youth sport are no longer considered valid. (JMK)",

It is based on the premise that, if individuals are truly accepted for their own worth and more time and resources are placed on human effort, the problems of education in America would most likely decrease.

The primary function performed by the school library media specialist or program was viewed as a mediation function. In this function, the specialist acts as an intermediary between the complex and rapidly expanding information world and the client. This intermediary function is  performed in different ways. The provision of access to materials, equipment, and space is the most clearly perceived group of services provided by school library media programs.

        "description":"The easiest link for libraries to establish in relation to the learning society is the direct managerial link that many have with educational institutions. Libraries in schools, colleges, and universities of all kinds are significant parts of the education enterprise. They become more so when the emphasis of education shifts to independent learning and the need for access to a wide variety of materials. A learning society, however, is made up of learners, with diverse needs, whose access to information and reading materials may be limited to the public library. While libraries have individual missions, there are overlaps in the kinds of collections and other resources they offer. Each library must be small enough to be manageable, and each needs to be linked with other libraries.  Coordination of effort means that some activities and resources may be divided among libraries and agreements reached about what will be borrowed or loaned. Linkages strengthen individual libraries when added to the traditional components of library services. Exchange of information and materials, communications, and cooperative decisions for some libraries in networks or consortia are becoming increasingly common. (JD)",

The primary goal of the project was to explore the possibility of developing new, more appropriate educational assessment strategies. As part of the project, several panels were convened, each focusing on a broad purpose of educational assessment. This document is the report of the first panel, which focused on the role of assessment in classroom instruction. It includes papers by Eva L. Baker, Eugenia Kemble, Philip Jackson, David Hawkins, J. Parker Damon, Asa G. Hilliard III, Howard E. Gruber, Robert T. Keegan, Judah L. Schwartz, Edwin F. Taylor, Nancy  Willie, and Michael S. Garet. The panel concludes with four recommendations: (1) in developing new assessment materials, it is worth starting small; (2) the development of new assessment materials should be carried out by groups with a strong interest in the content areas being assessed; (3) schools interested in adopting new forms of assessment should begin by focusing on a small number of classrooms and subject areas; and (4) making new forms of assessment work in practice will depend on the sensitivity and ingenuity of teachers.

Anthropological ethnography is proposed as a more powerful tool in those evaluations undertaken from a phenomenological perspective. Naturalistic/qualitative evaluation lacks a theoretical perspective on how groups of persons order their social lives. The constitutive ethnographic theory of social organization is explained. This theory is presented to provide a link between the phenomenological perspective and the field method of anthropological ethnography. Ethnographic evaluation inquiry allocates resources such that ethnographic observation takes precedence over interviewing. Interviews are primarily used as guides to observation. Constitutive  ethnographers believe that group members display their sociocultural standards in interaction. They seek patterns of co-occurrence among phenomena. The program's definition and boundaries are studied as problematic. Inquiry is centered on interactional events. (DWH)",

The empirically-derived dimensions of academic self-attribution replicated and extended results of previous research, but failed to support bipolar dimensions (e.g., internal-external, stable-unstable) found when characteristics of the attributional situation are manipulated. Overall, students who attribute academic success to ability (and to a lesser extent to effort) and who do not attribute failure to a lack of ability (and to a lesser extent not to a lack of effort) were found to have better academic self-concepts (based upon self-reports, and self-concepts  inferred by peers and by teachers); and better academic achievement (based on test scores and teacher ratings). The specificity and the predictability of the observed pattern of relationships supports the construct validity of interpretations based upon both the self-attribution and self-concept instruments.

Evaluation and research data have been repeatedly used/misused in the determination and shaping of educational policy and in the resolution of educational funding and political decisions. Evaluation occurs in a political environment. Program objectives must be clearly delineated to enable evaluators to develop appropriate questions for investigation. If evaluations  are to be used in decision making and program improvement, the evaluator has to become more than a mechanic playing with numbers that are often poor proxies for program outcomes.

Initial questionnaire research using the Devereux Elementary School Behavior Rating Scale II was conducted to identify seven behavior clusters: Inattention, Blaming, Negative Aggressive, Poor Peer Cooperation, Need for Direction, Failure Anxiety, and Impatience. The preparation of the videotape of those behavior clusters was conducted in four discrete phases, prior to the editing process: conceptualizing the instrument in terms of the needs of the researchers, developing a working relationship with  the children and teacher, the first shooting, and the final shooting. Field testing revealed that the Impatience and Need for Direction clusters were not perceived as accurately portrayed, and should be deleted from the presentation. In spite of these difficulties, it is likely that this videotaped production will add a much-needed dimension to research in behavioral problems. (BW)",

The High School and Beyond 1980 sophomores data was used to assess the impact of maternal employment on seven latent variables: number of siblings, sex role orientation, mother's influence in academic matters, personal/social self-concept, academic task confidence, educational/occupational aspirations, and achievement. The LISREL causal modeling technique permitted a more sophisticated and complete analysis of these variables than has been previously attempted. The results indicate that for sophomore middle-class females (1) the hypothesized model applied well to both  maternally employed and nonemployed groups; and (2) differences in academic groups were insignificant although some of the other variables do indicate differential trends affected by maternal employment status.

The findings are reported in terms of the Joint Committee's &quot;Standards for Evaluation of Educational Programs, Projects and Materials&quot; (Utility, Accuracy, Feasibility, and Fairness), modified to apply to tests. Decision makers were interested in the information regarding the Utility and Feasibility of the various tests, and did not limit their interest to Accuracy. Comparing the results obtained from the experimental try-out study and the rankings provided by the panel of experts  suggests that testing experts seem to be better in judging a test by some standards than by others. The findings also suggest that testing experts should not limit themselves to the technical aspects of Accuracy, but instead use the wide scope of all four standards to judge the merit of a test.

The internal validity of a model for how effect size estimates should be computed and combined will hinge upon the homogeneity of the effect size variation. Effect size variation may be assessed in the form of a summary fit statistic, and a direct consideration of the extent of individual effect variation from the population estimate. This paper presents some diagnostic techniques that facilitate the analysis of effect size variation. Bivariate plots of effect size residuals can aid in detecting sources of variation inconsistent with the model. Particularly, plotting the standardized residual of each study against the homogeneity of the sample if that study were removed is of interest for  assessing the extent of heterogeneity contributed by individual studies. It is emphasized that the use of diagnostic techniques is useful for revealing why a lack of fit occurred, and is not advocated for the ad hoc purpose of finding a best-fitting subset of studies.

All the BINL test items related to some of the SLEP instructional objectives, but not all of the SLEP objectives are measured by BINL items. The test-retest correlation in terms of BINL raw scores was .88. On the average, the exited students appeared to be doing more  than satisfactorily in the regular classroom in all subject areas. The test use survey indicated that there was a high degree of support and enthusiasm on the part of the SLEP Program staff for the use of the BINL. (BW)",

A path model is developed from a theory of school learning, and the causal connections within the model are validated and cross-validated. Few significant paths are retained.

Tests of English listening comprehension (dictation) and reading (&quot;copytest&quot;) were constructed by modifying the standard dictation testing procedure to create items of text segments which varied widely in both length and difficulty. Both the dictation and copytest were found to be homogeneous, cumulative scales of language proficiency with high reliability and validity. Log ability scores provided by Rasch analyses were found to correlate better with other measures of language proficiency than did the dictation and copytest raw scores. These findings indicate that the two language testing techniques investigated provide a useful  innovative approach to measuring general aspects of language proficiency. The theoretical and practical advantages of this approach over other language proficiency measurement techniques are discussed as well as implications for measuring language proficiency and other cognitive variables.

Three middle schools were studied to assess the relationship between teachers and principals as the administrators worked to get teachers to follow school innovations. Ethnographic methods were shown to be important in examining aspects of this relationship. The studies indicated that a bureaucratic or rational model of organization has currency among organizational theorists as well as legislators, the public, and educational administrators. Subordinates responded to commands passed down the hierarchy of  educational organizations with considerable independence when innovative programs were being implemented. The ways in which ethnographic studies have been important in showing the manner in which actual practice in organizations differs from the rational model are illustrated. (DWH)",

For one group of students the cognitive modeling stressed the importance of using task strategies, for a second group it emphasized the importance of positive achievement beliefs, students in a third condition received modeled importance of both task strategy use and positive achievement beliefs, and those in a fourth condition received cognitive modeling alone. Modeling the importance of using task strategies enhanced students' motivation and skill development, but modeling  the importance of both task strategies and achievement beliefs led to the highest self-efficacy.

That evaluation is based on an examination of empirical data, and the data are drawn from three types of analyses: cases where (1) observational measures were related to alternative measures of the behaviors, (2) observational measures were related to performance indices within correlational designs, and (3) observational measures were related to performance measures in experimental designs. The outcomes of the survey and the evaluation are used to  derive some recommendations relevant to the use of these measures in applied and research settings and some recommendations regarding directions for future research with the measures.

Children deficient in subtraction skills received training on subtraction operations and solved problems over four sessions. During the problem solving, some children periodically received ability feedback whereas others were given effort feedback. Children in a third condition received ability feedback during the first two sessions and effort feedback during the last two; this sequence was reversed in a fourth condition. Childen who initially received ability feedback developed higher levels of self-efficacy and skill and placed greater emphasis on ability as a cause of task success compared with  subjects initially given effort feedback.

Under this Federally funded project, four organizations developed new small businesses where these dual objectives would be pursued. The businesses were a network of eight auto repair shops in California and Connecticut (Open Road/New Enterprises), a solar hot water heater installation business in Phoenix, Arizona (Sunsol), a restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Beginners Luck), and a  novelty boutique store in New York City (Synergy II). Varying emphases were placed on the training components, which included hands-on training, classroom instruction, and employability counseling. Job placement assistance was provided at the conclusion of training. An evaluation of the project by Public/Private Ventures found that (1) enterprise training did not increase youths' employment prospects either at the end of the program or three or eight months later; and (2) the enterprises were not able to pursue, with equal emphasis, training and enterprise objectives. It was concluded that entrepreneurship programming in a new or fledgling small business is not cost effective or otherwise viable approach to the employment and training of disadvantaged youth.

VICI's purposes were (1) to provide young, minority, inner-city, high school dropouts with intensive skills training in the workplace that could serve as a stepping stone to unsubsidized jobs and apprenticeships in the construction trades, and (2) to provide community improvements through rehabilitation of public facilities and repairs of low income housing. Chapters I and II describe the program model and its implementation. Chapter III presents the work valuation methodology that was created to assess the dollar value of the work products and the results of applying this  methodology. Chapter IV provides a detailed summary of various analyses of VICI's impact on the labor market experiences of participating youth; comparisons are drawn with a HUD demonstration and selected Youth Community Conservation and Community Improvement (YCCIP) programs. Chapter V discusses the cost-effectiveness of the VICI program, while the final chapter summarizes major findings and their implications. The evaluation concludes that the project met with success in both of its major objectives. Appendices consist of a compendium of interim ICI reports, a short discussion of the role of the intermediary (Public/Private Ventures) in VICI, and a summary of the program characteristics of VICI, HUD, and construction YCCIPs selected for follow-up study.

Significant differences were found in the amount of learning taking place in different schools and different classrooms, even after taking into account the skill levels and family background each child brought to school. Findings also showed that, in all three samples,  teachers with 3 to 5 years experience were more effective than teachers with less experience. Additional experience beyond the 5 years, however, did not increase effectiveness but reduced it slightly. Further investigation of the topic in a large midwestern city showed this apparent decline to be a research artifact produced by &quot;vintage effects&quot; (i.e., having to do with the lower quality of teacher hired at times of increasing enrollment and the higher quality of those hired at times of declining enrollment.

Two tapped attitudes toward familial division of labor, one addressed perceptions of the consequences of women working, and one addressed attitudes toward motherhood. Eight background variables were included in the analysis: age, education, household income, region of residence, religiosity, and marital, job, and parental status. Findings documented a great deal of support for egalitarianism among black Americans, both men and women. Generally, the data showed support for more modern sex role norms in all areas except one--motherhood, which a large majority of both sexes saw as the most fulfilling role for women. Although  there were sex differences on the other three norms, they were not as large as might be expected. Overall, the correlates and predictors of sex role attitudes of men and women were found to be different. More relationships were found between socioeconomic variables and sex role attitudes for black women than for black men. Except for sex, none of the background variables, either alone or with others, explained more than a very modest proportion of the variance in sex role attitudes. (CMG)",

        "description":"In order to determine the extent of residential segregation among first or second generation Arabs living in and around Paterson, New Jersey, 286 families were located and interviewed. Field data were combined with statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau Population and Housing Summary Tape File 1-A. It was found that residential segregation was not the usual pattern among Arab Americans (which included Syrians, Lebanese, Circassians, Palestinians, and Jordanians). Most of the Arab immigrant families were found to live in working class neighborhoods, either at the city's edge or in one of the adjoining exurbs or small cities (Prospect Park, Haledon, Clifton, Passaic). In these areas, a few families may live fairly close to one another, but several blocks from the next small  grouping. Nevertheless, interviews revealed a shared sense of community and frequent interaction patterns based upon life cycle rituals, homeland concerns, religious affiliations, political activism, or limited social situations. The method used to measure the degree of racial segregation--defined as the overall unevenness in the spatial distribution of two racial/ethnic groups--was the index of dissimilarity. Among all the census tracks examined, the mean level of segregation between Arab Americans and Whites was found to be 26 percent. With wide fluctuations, the mean Arab/Black dissimilarity index was 61 percent. Nonetheless, neighborhood racial composition did not appear to be a factor in Arab Americans' choice of residence or desire to relocate. Finally, the segregated distribution  pattern of this group was not found to be strongly related to cost of housing. (GC)",

This report describes attempts by predominantly Latino proponents of his theories to develop &quot;liberating education&quot; (educacion liberadora) in the United States and in Puerto Rico. Section 1 describes the national, political, and religious context in which Freire developed his theories. Section 2 analyzes the ways in which his philosophy has been romanticized by radicals in the United States to justify Third World revolutionary tactics. Section 3 describes efforts by liberating educators to utilize Freire's theories against racism and exploitation, and discusses Alvin Gouldner's theory of the emerging &quot;cultural bourgeoisie.&quot; Section 4 summarizes activities of  liberating education practitioners in the United States from 1978-83, including a federally funded project to start an Information and Resources Center for Educacion Liberadora (IRCEL). Section 5 is an account of specific problems encountered by these practitioners, and of the theories of two non-Latino proponents of &quot;liberating education.&quot; Section 6 addresses the problem of evaluations required by funding sources and their relationship to ontology and epistemology. The impact of the &quot;new physics&quot; and the transformational movement on proponents of Freire's theories is also considered. Section 7 describes Freire's attempts to develop a literacy campaign in Guinea-Bissau. Finally, section 8 summarizes the content of the report and concludes that it may not be possible to apply Freire's  philosophy of the principles of liberating education.

Five basic aspects of immigration were addressed: (1) legal permanent immigration; (2) refugee admission and resettlement; (3) mass asylum and the related issues of adjudication; (4) illegal immigration, including work authorization, legalization, and temporary worker programs; and (5) nonimmigrants. Following these hearings, further hearings were held on the Simpson-Mazzoli Bill. In this document, the main arguments and issues considered during the hearings on each of the  five basic issues and on the Simpson-Mazzoli Bill are considered; summaries of individual hearings are provided.

The document is organized into four major areas. First, the need for the principal to provide strong curriculum leadership through establishing achievement as a top priority, actively participating in curriculum committees, and establishing nonbiased student evaluations is addressed. Second, suggestions are made as to how a principal can communicate high expectations for student and teacher performance through encouraging and rewarding excellence, monitoring instruction and conducting staff evaluations, and supporting staff development. Next, how to encourage equity and  excellence through administrative procedures such as reviewing scheduling and grouping procedures and establishing an orderly atmosphere is discussed. And finally, ways that a principal can help to maintain a positive school climate through encouraging teachers to communicate with parents and encouraging parent participation are considered. A \"self-assessment\" scale and a \"priority for improvement\" scale for each item in the four areas facilitate use of the material for planning purposes. (CMG)",

The U.S. General Accounting Office analyzed participation and Federal expenditures for the 1979-83 period and found: (1) Student participation declined from 27 million to 23.1 million primarily because fewer students ate full-price lunches. In 1982 for the first time in the history of the program, more free and reduced-price lunches were served than full-price lunches; (2) The drop in participation by schools and students in the program slightly outpaced the drop in the number of schools and student enrollment nationally; and (3) Federal program  expenditures were greater in 1983 than at any time except 1981, the peak year. Since 1979, the number of families with children qualifying for free lunches increased as did the percentage of Federal expenditures for free lunches. Federal expenditures for reduced-price and full-price lunches decreased. (Author/CJM)",

        "description":"Magnet schools are district-wide, open-enrollment institutions that are thematically organized around such subject areas as science and mathematics, the performing arts, or career areas such as engineering. They are largely non-selective; that is, students who apply are evaluated primarily on the basis of their interests and motivation rather than their academic record or test scores. The first such school in this country was Boston Latin, founded in 1635; several others founded later are also well-known. Originally designed to serve the needs of a small intellectual elite, magnet schools now have the twin focus of improving educational quality while increasing racial integration. They also provide a setting for teacher-generated reform initiatives. In 1981-82 there were 1,018  elementary and secondary magnet schools in the United States. Continuing research and analysis to increase our knowledge base about long-term effects of magnet schools should be supported by the Federal government. Furthermore, the Federal government should support a large scale magnet school demonstration program of three magnets for each standard metropolitan statistical area, plus several additional magnets per State based on population; this plan would more than double the existing number of magnets and lay the foundation for long-term incremental change.

        "description":"This report describes a model for equitable schooling as it regards quality schooling experiences and equality of access for all. According to the model, equitable schooling opportunity is provided when two major dimensions of schooling are present: (1) equality of effectiveness, defined on the dimensions of school effectiveness and instructional effectiveness; and (2) equality of structure. The latter is defined in terms of how instructional and social goals inform both activity structures (i.e. how instruction is organized at the classroom level and how other schooling experiences are organized at the school level) and task and institutional demands that are inherent in activity structures and to which students must respond. When these two major dimensions are present in the  organization and delivery of appropriate schooling experiences, and mediation of instruction (the process of adapting instructional methods to accommodate students' cultural and language differences) is added to them, then students are provided with equal access to schooling. Actual participation in schooling experiences can be evaluated (1) by observing the characteristics of competent student participation, or the manner in which students respond to task and institutional demands; and (2) by observing the achievement of instructional and social goals through tests of academic achievement, or observation of prosocial behavior.

        "description":"The Urban Crime Prevention Program (UCPP) was designed to combat urban crime through the establishment of 85 innovative neighborhood-based crime prevention projects across nine cities for 18 months. UCPP's main goals were to increase citizen participation in innovative neighborhood crime prevention efforts, to bolster the capabilities of neighborhood groups, and to forge working partnerships between these groups and related agencies and institutions. A two-year evaluation, summarized here, concluded that the most effective crime prevention approaches, as measured by UCPP goals, involved property crime and arson prevention projects, primarily because they were based on the organization of citizens through neighborhood groups. Many UCPP projects had difficulty with more complex  approaches, particularly if the project was located in a deteriorated neighborhood. In an overall sense, however, it was concluded that the general neighborhood orientation of UCPP, combined with the establishment of working partnerships with other agencies, offers promise for combatting urban crime. It is recommended that (1) community crime prevention programs emphasize the organization of citizens as the basic strategy; (2) strong working partnerships be established between neighborhood efforts and relevant criminal justice agencies; (3) involved neighborhood groups receive substantial training and technical assistance; and (4) neighborhood based crime prevention strategies receive the continued support and attention of officials concerned with urban crime.

Black unemployment remains two to three times higher and black poverty rates up to five times higher than those of whites. Blacks are generally employed in the lowest paying jobs. Both black median family income and the percentage of blacks over 25 who graduated from high school are half that of whites. Industries new in Alabama since 1968 have mostly bypassed the area, particularly the majority-black counties where blacks have political control. Black infant mortality rates have decreased but they are still much higher than white rates. In six counties examined in depth, black education, employment, and health conditions and services have  improved but there has been little change in conditions for blacks relative to whites. Although blacks have been elected to a wide variety of political offices in five of the six counties, they are offices with little power. Furthermore, whites maintain economic control. Whites in the black-majority counties also have withdrawn from the public schools and other black-controlled institutions and have established segregated institutions. A state of &quot;neosegregation&quot; exists in which blacks and whites accept the separation of the races as a way of life. (CMG)",

GAO found that the projects exceeded investment expectations, came close to meeting employment expectations, but fell considerably short of realizing projected increases in local tax revenues. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) information system, however, did not provide complete information on the results. GAO also found that many of the most economically distressed small cities did not participate in the program because they (1) were unfamiliar with the program, (2)  had insufficient city government capacity to plan a UDAG project, and (3) had difficulties in obtaining adequate private sector involvement. In addition, many cities that have received UDAG funds have loaned them to private developers; some of these loans are repaid before a UDAG project is completed. At present, there is no clear policy on whether cities can use these early repayments for additional community and economic development activities. GAO has offered recommendations that would improve the accuracy of HUD's information on completed projects, help small cities to participate in the program, and establish a policy on whether cities should be able to use early UDAG repayments.

Projections are made for males and females, various Hispanic ethnic groups, and age bands within the accession age range of 17-35. Results show that Army accessions in all Hispanic ethnic groups are projected to increase substantially in number from now to the year 2000. Puerto Rican accession rates are more than twice as high as rates for other Hispanic ethnic groups. Current and projected accessions are much lower for Hispanic females than for Hispanic males. Males have much higher rates and levels of limited English proficiency (LEP) than females. Puerto Rican LEP rates  exceed (in some categories by twice the number) the LEP rates of other Hispanic ethnic groups. The general pattern is one of increase in limited English proficiency in the Army to the year 2000.

        "description":"In order to provide high quality specialized instruction and to achieve voluntary integration, a magnet program was developoed in the Fort Worth (Texas) Independent School District. The program is in its third year of implementation and currently is underway in two high schools, two middle schools, and an elementary school. Program features included use of uniform entry criteria for all races, preparation of students prior to entering a minority neighborhood school, business community involvement through adoption, utilization of results from other districts' definition of performance standards, and consistency in abiding by them. Both number and quality of magnet program students have increased each year. In the 1982-83 school year, students scored 2-3.9 years above district  norms, and showed 1.5-2.5 months gain per month of instruction. Black students, whose numbers rise each year, scored lower and showed slightly smaller gains than White students, but scored 3-4.6 years above district Black norms. Overall, ethnic enrollments in the magnet program include 6 percent Asian, 50 percent Black, 9 percent Hispanic, and 35 percent White. Program evaluation findings point toward the effectiveness of the magnet program, both as an environment of enhanced academic achievement and as a means of ethnic integration for the schools involved.

Under the program, students may enter high school, take credit courses, and also receive special support and theme-related remedial reading and math instruction. It was found that (1) poor communication among the Division of High Schools, the high schools, and the feeder schools regarding the program's goals, structure, pupil eligibility, and funding led to confusion on all counts; (2) problems with the new computerized high schools admissions process compounded the confusion; (3) funding was inadequate; (4) the program was not serving thousands of eligible students; (5) some  schools lacked both the funding and the expertise to develop the required theme-centered hands-on experience; some vocational schools had trouble with assigned students who were not interested in their specialized curricula; (6) 5 of the 11 schools did not provide the required two-to-four periods of remedial education; (7) schools were not given adequate guidance or technical assistance to develop PREP programs and in some cases did not take the responsibility or initiative themselves; teachers were given no training in remedial or literacy instruction. In light of the evaluation findings, a number of recommendations for improving PREP are offered. (CMG)",

        "description":"This paper examines high school quality as revealed in the responses of personnel officers to the Johns Hopkins University Survey of American Employers and in their actual recruiting and employment practices. The analyses test the hypothesis, recently proposed by senior executives of Fortune 1300 firms and by the National Commission Report, \"A Nation at Risk,\" that poor quality education of American high school graduates contributes to the declining ability of American companies to compete with foreign businesses. The Johns Hopkins University Survey of American Employers is a set of data that contains information about the recruiting and employment practices of the employers of a sample of National Longitudinal Survey of high school graduates. Several pieces of evidence  contradict the proposed hypothesis. For example, only 5 percent of the personnel officers surveyed report problems with graduates not having basic skills or problems finding qualified high school graduates for the jobs they have available. In analyses that examine employers' practices of recruitment and employment, little evidence is found that employers are concerned about high school graduates' grades or the quality of the high schools that they attend. Instead, more important factors appear to be the dependability and proper attitudes of the graduates. The paper suggests that instead of doing a poor job of teaching students, high schools may, in fact, be doing a good job of teaching more students than ever; however, the schools are facing problems because they now must provide  education for marginal students who in former years would not have completed high school.

        "description":"Alternative curriculum strategies can be used to conduct an effective photography program without the expense usually associated with a darkroom. Three methods can be used to eliminate the need for a darkroom facility: outside vendors, an emulsion that can be user-processed without access to a darkroom (slide or transparency film), and emulsions that self-develop outside the camera (instant print film). All three strategies emphasize the picture-taking rather than the mechanical processes of producing a viewable result. If an outside vendor is used, students need instruction on how to seek out services, how to evaluate services, and how to place orders. Advantages are a wider range of services, lower costs, better quality, and time for other aspects of photography. Disadvantages  may be cost, turn-around time, and loss of control over end result. Advantages of the user-processed emulsion are the need for some darkroom experiences, reduced time, lower costs, and control over end result. Disadvantages are processing errors, variations, and no quality controls. Advantages of instant print film are immediacy, low cost, and good results. A disadvantage is that the cameras using this film are usually automatic for exposure control and sometimes for focusing. (Resources and sources are cited.) (YLB)",

        "description":"In 1983 the National Office of Job Corps conducted a review of Job Corps vocational offerings and outcomes for fiscal year 1982. Based on a review of Job Corps procedures identifying emerging occupations, assessing training needs, developing curricula, and implementing training programs, the project researchers developed a series of recommendations aimed at improving Job Corps vocational education offerings and delivery systems. These recommendations included calls for initiating procedures to implement review findings, for developing and implementing a system for biennial training program review, for developing center contacts with local labor market sources, and for conducting follow-up research studies. In addition, the researchers identified a series of new occupations with  potential for addition to Job Corps vocational training offerings. (MN)",

Data were obtained from 24 career-undecided students seeking vocational counseling through the counseling center of a midwestern state university. Twelve subjects participated in the group counseling approach, and 12 received individual counseling. The level of career indecision was assessed by Osipow's Career Decision Scale; the level of general indecisiveness was assessed by an eight-item scale derived from Salamone. Results of a repeated measures split-plot factorial multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) test and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model found that both treatments led to client gains but that neither  was better than the other on the two process measurements.

        "description":"As postsecondary vocational education turns increasingly to preparation for high technological occupations, the question arises as to whether or not this infatuation with education for high technological occupations is reasonable and justified. Data on technician-level employment seem to contradict the view that high technological manufacturing is bi-modal, with no real middle-level positions. Therefore, some real future exists for high technology vocational education. However, the numbers of these jobs that will be created is, and will continue to be, a small proportion of overall job growth. While high technology programs in community colleges have high growth rates, the numbers involved are still relatively small compared to the larger number of students in more conventional  programs. If enrollments in high technology are higher than the growth rates of openings, the programs may be \"training for unemployment.\" The current developments in vocational education for high technological occupations are remarkably consistent with the history of vocational education. Similarities include the tendency to over-promise, i.e., to claim that educational reform can solve every social and economic problem, the problems of keeping up with changing production methods and techniques and specific versus general training, and the egalitarian claims of community colleges.

The curriculum is designed for low-ability soldiers, and consists largely of instruction in the domain of intellectual skills. An introductory course in the JSEP curriculum contains two major units. The first familiarizes students with the computer system (both Microticcit and Plato versions are being programmed). The second teaches an organizing metastrategy consisting of five general steps that together form an approach for taking each basic skills lesson. The five steps are setting goals and self-pacing, mood management, reading comprehension, developing skilled  memory, and problem solving. Each step is presented in a separate module and is introduced by a cartoon character that represents that step. Characters appear repeatedly throughout the curriculum as prompts to recall and use strategies. A brief review unit presents the metastrategy as a coordinated activity, to teach students to modify the metastrategy as a technique for studying at home and taking tests.

The survey assessed whether the state's two-year, half-day, separate-facility vocational programs were achieving a positive effect upon the social or nontechnical development of their students. Building on the findings of the statewide questionnaire and its companion interviews, the ethnographic study employed classroom observation, indepth interviewing, relevant documents, and inductive analysis to identify those characteristics of a vocational program and its students that, in their interaction, constitute attitude-influencing  events. A vocational course (Food Preparation I and II) was studied. Findings suggested that even though most vocational students find their programs enjoyable and rewarding, many of the developmental effects of these programs are actually the product of an interwoven assemblage of personal, economic, sociocultural, and program factors and work against the goal of increasing participants' opportunities.

Testimony was given and prepared statements submitted at the hearings by representatives of veterans groups, representatives of programs serving veterans, and disabled veterans, among others. In general, witnesses were pleased with the legislation, which provides up to $10,000 to employers to train a veteran to become a permanent  employee and other incentives created to attract employers. Witnesses noted, however, concerns among veterans about eligibility requirements, training provisions, payments from the government to employers, and the relationship between veteran and employer when one or the other does not live up to the terms of the training agreement. Those who testified cited an urgent need to make employers and veterans more aware of the programs available through the legislation, and especially methods of informing employers about the program and convincing them that they would not have to go through layers of bureaucracy.

Some of those who testified predicted a very gradual impact resulting from automation in the workplace, and some estimated enormous change. For example, one expert pointed out that automation in offices is just beginning and may result in worker displacement far greater than has so far occurred in industry. On the other hand, a substantial  portion of the testimony concerned the unreliability of the methods of gathering employment statistics and, therefore, the inaccuracy of the projections derived from them.

The first chapter provides background information about sex role stereotypes in order to make teachers aware of the effects of stereotypes and the reasons that they should attempt to eliminate them in their classrooms. In the second chapter, activities are provided to increase students' awareness of the basic issues in sex bias and stereotyping, while the third chapter includes  additional activities designed to enable students to examine their biases and stereotypes. The fourth chapter presents additional activities that can be used to help students to deepen their knowledge of the many vocational opportunities available to them, especially those nontraditional for their sex. Finally, the last chapter contains additional background materials for teachers and students along with materials that can be used for assessment and visual aids. (KC)",

Following an extensive review of previous ABE impact studies, data were gathered from a specially selected sample of adult ABE students through an open-ended questionnaire administered by telephone interviews. Students were questioned about their reasons for participation, employment-related outcomes, academic outcomes, affective outcomes, principal benefits gained from participation; and cost benefits of the program were analyzed. All outcomes were positive. For example, program participants were more likely than nonparticipants to have found a job, while promotions, improved earnings, and enhanced job performance exhibited similar gains. The great majority of the participants reported that  ABE had helped them to improve their reading, writing, and mathematics skills and said they were applying these skills in their daily lives. In addition, more than 9 of 10 participants reported that they felt better about themselves as a result of participation in the program. In fact, the respondents called increased self-confidence, along with increased academic skill, the principal benefit gained. The study concluded that ABE is cost-effective and prepared a model of procedures for conducting future student follow-up studies. (KC)",

This module provides three learning experiences designed to help teachers-in-training to develop competency in using three techniques--brainstorming, buzz group, and question box--to create interest in learning and to encourage student participation. Each of the learning experiences consists of an enabling objective, student activities, and feedback.

Some of those who testified at the hearing included a professor of economics, a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation, directors of women's groups, directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League, officials of the U.S. Department of Labor, an assistant attorney general for civil rights, congresswomen, and a representative of Mexican American groups. In addition, prepared statements and other materials were given by these persons and others. The focus of the hearing was on the apparent intent of the Reagan administration to curtail severely the Federal Government's  involvement in the enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws. It was also concerned with the administration's apparent inclination to abandon its heretofore substantial use of affirmative action as a tool by which to redress and hopefully eradicate the effects of past discrimination practiced against minorities and women. Witnesses traced the origins and background of discrimination against minorities and women, noted their still unequal share of better jobs, and said that the administration's policy of backing off on enforcement of affirmative action would be unfair to women and minorities. They pushed for the continuing efforts of government to create equal opportunity regulations and enforce those laws. (KC)",

The Council's policy statement entitled &quot;Appraising Employment and Training Research&quot; appears first. In the first paper, Eli Ginzberg reviews the Department of Labor's Research Program, 1963-1978. He examines the research, demonstration, and evaluation contributions to expanding and improving the number and quality of researchers, the database, and the methodology of research. In the second paper, Daniel H. Saks suggests a research agenda for employment and training policy in the 1980s. In the third paper, Howard Rosen offers an administrator's  viewpoint. He argues that development of a successful research, demonstration, and evaluation program is possible within a mission-oriented agency only if it can demonstrate the usefulness of its findings. He claims significant policy changes as a result of the more than 2,000 studies completed. The final paper by Gary Burtless and Robert H. Haveman summarizes lessons learned from three labor market experiments: the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, the National Supported Work Program, and the Employment Opportunity Pilot Project.

        "description":"Drawn from the reports of separate research efforts conducted at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, the four chapters in this volume examine from a variety of perspectives what vocational education should accomplish and is accomplishing. An executive summary begins the volume. In the first chapter, Rupert Evans examines the discrepancy between the public and legislative support for vocational education and benefits demonstrated by evaluation studies. Chapter 2, by Frank Pratzner and Jill Russell, examines the appropriate roles and functions of secondary and postsecondary vocational education. The major issue is whether occupationally specific training should be emphasized at the secondary school level. Floyd McKinney and Patricia Fornash, in chapter 3, draw  upon background papers prepared by specialists in six disciplines to assess support that the basic theories and findings of these disciplines provide for 18 selected outcomes, or intended, positive consequences, of participation in vocational education. The fields represented are history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics, and futures research. In the final chapter, Morgan Lewis focuses on a limited number of labor market outcomes of secondary-level vocational education that have been researched in 10 different studies in recent years.

Through a literature review and contacts with organizations and individuals involved in courseware evaluation and use, project staff identified and acquired for review documents pertaining to courseware evaulation, vocational or technical education courseware products, and evaluation forms. A matrix was developed to aid in producing a preliminary evaluation form. Two panels of consultants refined the evaluation form and assisted in development of a companion guide. Pilot-test participants and supplemental reviewers helped to refine the form and guide further. Following the 30-page narrative, the system for evaluating microcomputer courseware--the evaluation  form and evaluation guide--is provided. The courseware evaluation form contains three parts: descriptive information about the courseware, evaluative criteria, and a summary rating. Written to assist users of the courseware evaluation form, the guide includes a brief description and explanation of the evaluation form, a suggested procedure for using the evaluation system, a glossary of terms, and a brief explanation of every item in the courseware evaluation form. Recommendations are made for continued efforts in courseware evaluation. Project materials--lists of panel members, correspondence, agendas--are appended.

Characteristics of Job Corps enrollees and the occupations in which training was provided were identified. To assess their comparative effectiveness, training occupations were rated on job placement percent, average wage at job entry, cost per training year, cost per job placement, and labor market prospects (absolute employment growth from 1980-1990, and percentage employment growth from 1980-1990). No clear pattern emerged about which types of training occupations were consistently more effective. National contractors had the highest job placement rates and the highest entry wages. Contract centers had  the lowest cost per training year and cost per job placement. Civilian Conservation Centers ranked in the middle of the four variables. Occupations identified as suitable for consideration as new Job Corps training programs encompassed these job clusters: clerical and sales, electrical/appliance repair, industrial production, health occupations, and potential computer-related occupations. These recommendations were made: initiate procedures to implement review findings, develop and implement a system for biennial training program review, develop center contacts with local labor market sources, and conduct followup research studies.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of the ABE student. It explores the strengths and weaknesses adults bring to a formal education program, examines factors influencing the adult student's performance in the classroom, and presents an instructional method for integrating basic skills with higher-level needs. Chapter 2 describes models for teaching the total adult  student. The purpose of chapter 3 is to define motivation, consider motives that trigger motivation, and examine where the keys to motivation lie. Chapter 4 on teaching/learning styles discusses incorporating psychological type and learning style in instructional planning. Part 2, chapter 5, is the student manual. It summarizes part 1 and provides practical suggestions and learning activities to put theory into practice. (YLB)",

Eight of the VA's 58 regional offices were reviewed and the case files of veterans who completed vocational rehabilitation training in April, May, and June l982 were examined. Review objectives were to determine the employment status of veterans who had completed training under the program and whether their jobs were in fields related to training, the type of employment assistance the VA provided, and the extent of the VA's followup to determine the veterans' employment status. Of the 208 veterans who completed vocational rehabilitation training, l02 were employed, 76 of them in fields related to their training, and  47 were unemployed; relevant information was lacking for the remaining 59. All eight regional offices provided indirect employment services to rehabilitated veterans. However, seven of them did not provide direct placement services to those who encountered difficulties finding employment. In some cases, the regional offices did not prepare required individualized employment assistance plans. The regional offices had not adequately performed required preemployment or postemployment followup. Deficiencies in the VA's automated management information system still existed.

Under the Foreign Assistance Act of l96l, as amended, the Congress makes grants available to foreign governments for training through the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. The Arms Export Control Act, as amended, authorizes the Department of Defense to sell training to foreign countries under the foreign military sales (FMS) program. Appropriations for the IMET program and revenues received from the FMS program do not fully reimburse the services for the cost of training foreign students. Indirect training costs are waived for NATO countries, and incremental pricing is allowed for countries receiving IMET grant training. The Reagan administration has proposed  amending the Arms Export Control Act to eliminate the current multitier pricing structure on the sale of training and permit only the recovery of incremental or additional costs for both the IMET and the FMS programs.

        "description":"Little is known about the implications of individual differences in privacy preferences. To explore the relationship between privacy preferences and the style and quality of social interaction in a first encounter, 77 of 320 college students completing the Privacy Preference Scale were grouped according to their low (20 male, 20 female) or high (17 male, 20 female) need for privacy. Subjects were tested for extraversion-introversion and anxiety level; measures of interpersonal attraction and interpersonal behavior were also administered. Situational demands on privacy were varied by means of a self-disclosure task in which subjects discussed relatively intimate or non-intimate topics. The findings showed that for those with high compared to low privacy preference, interaction  with a stranger was rated as significantly more awkward, tense, and unnatural. High privacy individuals used significantly fewer verbal reinforcements when speaking with strangers than did low privacy individuals. The manipulation of situational demands upon privacy did not significantly affect interpersonal attraction or interaction. The results support previous research suggesting that people with high preference for privacy may interact less and be less comfortable with a stranger than people with a low privacy preference. Such individuals may benefit from interpersonal skills training. (JAC)",

        "description":"Church-based programs for caregivers of black elders have emerged from both demographic and cultural factors. To investigate the effectiveness of a training program for caregivers of noninstitutionalized elders, 95 Washington, D.C. adults (99% black, 87% female), who were providing caregiving assistance to an older adult, completed a 12-hour training program. The program was adapted from &quot;As Parents Grow Older: A Manual for Program Replication&quot; (Silverman, et. al., 1981). Subjects also participated in mutual help group meetings. Participants were drawn from eight church sites, with three neighboring churches participating at one site. Two comparison sites received training after the post-test interviews. All subjects and 49 care recipients completed pre- and post-test interviews  assessing caregiver behaviors and attitudes. An analysis of the results showed that, in general, persons who completed the training program did not increase the scope of their caregiving activities or improve their attitudes over time. However, given the pretraining nature of the population (low stress, positive attitudes) this finding was expected. The mutual help groups appeared to be the most successful part of the project. Enthusiasm, commitment, and the ability of the church leaders to organize and motivate church members were important factors in predicting the success of the groups. The three-church cluster was most successful in initiating multiple projects. Future research should focus on the characteristics and organizational frameworks of mutual help groups, and linkages  between informal caregivers and formal service providers. (BL)",

Responses from 869 school psychologists (142 doctoral practitioners and 727 nondoctoral practitioners) were analyzed. Minimal gender differences were noted. Doctoral school psychologists tended to spend more time with junior and senior high school students and students with behavioral problems and less time with mentally retarded students. Doctoral level practitioners, compared to nondoctoral level practitioners, indicated less time in intellectual assessment and more time in personality assessment, parent counseling, and research.  Both groups wanted to reduce the amount of time spent in assessment, report writing, and attending child study meetings and to increase the amount of time spent in student observation, counseling activities, program development, inservice activities, and research and consultation. Doctoral school psychologists rated their competencies in each professional activity at a higher level than nondoctoral school psychologists. Overall the results indicated more similarities than differences in functioning between the two groups. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Measures designed to detect elder abuse lack uniformity as a result of having been designed in isolation. To develop and test a uniform index for the identification of elder abuse victims, an analysis of existing abuse identification instruments was conducted. Initially, seven elder abuse identification measures were content analyzed, resulting in the categorization of seven types of abuse: physical abuse, physical neglect, psychological abuse, psychological neglect, material abuse, violations of rights, and risk indicators. The majority of items collected were risk indicators, suggesting that the measures do not detect the presence of actual abuse but rather the individual's vulnerability to that abuse. Physical neglect was the second highest item on the indices (16 percent). To  expand the range of possible measures for the five remaining types of abuse, 12 child abuse identification measures were content analyzed and categorized according to the seven classes of abuse. Finally, all items in each of the seven abuse categories on all abuse identification measures were qualitatively analyzed for specific types of items and the nature of the data source. Conclusions and recommendations from the analysis revealed that measures of elder abuse need to distinguish types of abuse and to develop greater specificity in techniques for identifying abuse. Clarification of sources of information a service provider should seek, and a more efficient means for collecting data are needed. Finally, methods for distinguishing abuse from the aging process must be developed.  (BL)",

        "description":"General data on suicide among the elderly are available but the trends and levels often have been either ignored or misrepresented. Available data indicate that despite declines, suicide rates in the United States remain highest in old age. Impediments to understanding elderly suicide occur due to omissions in available national data bases. Inadequacies of available, official, national and other data include the omission of: marital status and time in that status; race/ethnicity; socioeconomic status; occupation (e.g., retired); living conditions (e.g., with whom); mental, physical, and chronic conditions; and historical information (e.g., past attempts). This and other information about elderly suicides would be useful to test etiological theories and determine high risk  subgroups for intervention. The unavailability of various population data also produces problems, e.g., annual population data necessary for rate calculations are only available in aggregate from above age 85. Data essential for a more precise comprehension are either not available or are difficult and/or expensive to secure. The quantity and quality of currently available data allow little more than a general impression of elderly suicide. Better, more detailed information is recommended to improve the understanding and prevention of suicide in old age. (Author/BL)",

The subjects were 58 men, 75 women and 93 percent white. Physical and mental health and social functioning were assessed through the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation. Social interaction data were obtained from the Network Analysis Profile. An analysis of the results showed that although all groups met at least four-fifths of their total needs, those in poor health (PH) or  undergoing more stress (HS) had more difficulty in meeting their needs than their low stressed (LS) and healthier (GH) counterparts. For the former groups, inability to meet needs at the first interview was significantly related to failure to meet needs at the second interview. Social networks contributed substantially to explaining ability to meet needs among those in the PH/HS group, with interactional, structural, and environmental attributes showing substantial increases in variance. For the GH/LS groups, significant increments in variance occurred primarily within the interactional sphere. The findings confirm the direct, buffering and non-linear effects of social networks.

To evaluate a group program for families of elderly parents, a pre/postmeasure, experimental/control group design was implemented. Adults participating in two workshops on &quot;Your Aging Parents&quot; were assigned to either an experimental (N=16) or a control (N=16) group. All participants completed pre-test measures, including goal statements and 20 items from the 29-item Burden Interview (Zarit, et al., 1980). Post-test questionnaires on the workshop's effectiveness were administered to the experimental group at the end of a 10-hour workshop; at the start of their workshop control group members again completed the Burden Interview.  Analysis of results showed that significant differences between groups were found on only three items of the Burden Interview; experimental subjects changed in a positive direction in their feelings of usefulness and contribution, and in feelings about parents' manipulation. Program completers showed no significant change for total burden score. However, participants' ratings of program value and quality were high, and most felt they had achieved their main goals. To empirically evaluate program effectiveness, future research must focus more specifically on the development and administration of a valid and reliable instrument to measure change without disrupting the group process.

        "description":"There has been an increasing call for school psychologists to spend time collecting data that are functionally related to the planning of academic interventions. In order to identify the problem and plan for remediation, data must be taken that bear directly on the child's academic problems in the classroom and the curricular sequences actually utilized in instruction. Not all referred problems are a result of skill deficits. The difference between skill and performance deficits lies in the fact that skill deficits may require the acquisition of new behaviors before progress can occur, while performance deficits require changing the level of performance of already acquired skills. If assessment data are to be functionally related to interventions, objective measures should be  established that may be taken repeatedly; environmental events that are related to the problem or may be manipulated to solve the problem should be analyzed. Several variables consistently appear related to academic achievement: time allotted for instruction, academic engaged time, content covered, and direct instruction. It is suggested that information regarding environmental variables should be collected through a specifically structured problem identification interview as well as through standardized classroom observations. There are many published descriptions of successful behavior interventions, some involving detailed alterations of instructional and teaching behaviors. A decision about what type of intervention to employ clearly depends on the analysis of relationships among  assessment data, analysis of available resources, and degree of permissible intrusiveness in classroom structure.

Studies have shown that age differences on measures of depressive symptomatology can be attributed to higher levels of somatic complaints. In order to examine whether the association between somatic and depressive symptoms varies as a function of health status in an older population, a sample of adults aged 50 to 87 (N=111) were surveyed using a self-report health rating, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) to assess psychiatric symptomatology. Factor anaylsis of the BSI yielded high loadings for each of the somatic and depressive symptoms, indicating the independence of the two constructs and providing evidence for the validity of the BSI. Data analysis showed that  respondents endorsed more somatic complaints than depressive complaints. Of the eight symptoms endorsed most often, six were somatic items. These findings indicate that rates of prevalence for depression in the elderly may be overestimated when measures of depressive symptomatology that include somatic complaints are used.

To assess the relationship between outcome measures and client and principal caregiver characteristics, 21 client-caregiver dyads, participating in the Elderly Support Project, completed pre- and post-test measures and three follow-up interviews during a 24-month period.

The program was implemented through a series of intervention steps including assessment, baseline data collection, behaviorally-oriented  treatment, and follow-up. An analysis of the results showed that at the first follow-up, 74 percent of the clients were still living at home (10 percent had died and 16 percent were institutionalized). At second follow-up, 75 percent of the clients were living in the community (25 percent were deceased). The caregivers' ratings of their relationship with the client, their ability to manage the client's behavior, and the client's mental status at program termination were significantly associated with placement. Client diagnosis, caregiver ratings of target problems, and whether or not the client lived with the caregiver were significantly associated with caregivers' subsequent relational satisfaction scale ratings.

Chapter 6 ties the earlier, more didactic, discussion of evaluation content and process into three case studies. Chapter 7, on politics and science in prevention programming, uses case material to focus on the importance of the program's external political context for the success or failure of both the program and its evaluation.

        "description":"Although social gerontologists recognize the heterogeneous nature of elderly populations, they have relied on the use of aggregate data and chronological age rather than sociological variables in their research. The notion of stigma, as developed by Goffman (1963), applied to the elderly focuses on social relationships rather than individual attributes, and can assist in understanding the social meaning of old age in contemporary American society. Social stigma is a discrepancy between virtual and actual social identity; an individual attribute, in this case age, can be stigmatizing when it fails to conform to age-related norms. Once a stigma exists, socially legitimated discrimination results. Social stigma for the elderly has resulted in a classless view of aging which ignores  the differences across sex, and ethnic and class boundaries. It also allows for the use of derogatory terms for old people. In defense against the stigma, elderly individuals tend to deny their old age through physical disguises, the attainment of active mastery in areas traditionally closed to elders, avoidance of social interactions with other age groups, or self-other identification. Because they become stigmatized in later life, the elderly may have difficulty in re-identifying themselves and may experience a special likelihood of self-disapproval. To overcome the stigma, elderly individuals must face their chronological age and refine the meaning of old age for themselves. (BL)",

In the first study, examining the social factors that influenced the use of public transportation, 28 elderly individuals, divided into three groups by transportation styles (users of public transportation, users of public transportation along with rides provided by friends and relatives, and users of informal transportation networks) were interviewed. The findings suggested that the groups did not differ with regard to availability of children, friends, or other people who could provide transportation, but rather in the length of time they had used informal transportation networks. The early use of family networks significantly affected  later use. In the second study, an ethnographic inquiry into the maintenance of the social status of elders in a rural church community, members of elderly families in the church were interviewed. Results showed that elders played significant roles in relationships with one another and maintained a high social status within the community. Factors which contributed to this status included shared commitment, church attendance, a history of participation and leadership, and principle roles in the church. Family relations significantly contributed to the maintenance of status through accumulated social credit across the life span and across generations. (BL)",

        "description":"Previous research has shown that heightened fear of crime in the elderly does not reflect actual crime rates as much as a perceived vulnerability due to diminished physical and economic resources. As part of a larger Los Angeles study on personal emergency response systems, this study examined the relationships among fear of crime, crime rates, leaving one's residence, self-reported health, income, and sense of personal mastery in the elderly. Sixty older adults (11 males, 49 females; mean age, 77.5 years), who were medically vulnerable and living alone, were interviewed and completed numerous paper measures of health, personal mastery, and fear of crime. A supplemental index of actual crime was established through police statistics. An analysis of the results showed that men  tended to report leaving their residences slightly more often than women and endorsed higher levels of functional health, health status, mastery, and income. Women expressed significantly more fear than did men, but residential patterns or crime rates did not differ significantly by sex. Physical inabilities rather than fear of crime affected the frequency with which a frail older adult left his residence. The findings suggest that effective intervention with elderly individuals should focus on physical and mental health services that increase mobility through personal mastery of the environment.

        "description":"Improving the mobility of older adults has been a major goal of transportation programs and policies for the elderly at both the federal and local levels. To examine reasons why eligible elderly individuals in urban areas do not use available special transport services, 140 elderly persons in the Washington, D.C. area were surveyed on the extent of their utilization of services and on demographic characteristics, including socioeconomic status, household composition, education, employment, social contacts, and needs. In addition, a telephone survey of 27 service providers was conducted to determine problems encountered in reaching elderly populations and possible solutions for the problems. An analysis of the results showed that less than 15 percent of the urban elderly who need  special transport services use them. Reasons for nonuse fell four areas: (1) alternative available; (2) lack of knowledge; (3) service characteristics; and (4) pride. Nonusers who needed special transport services were often less active, less independent, and less healthy than the elderly persons who needed and used such services. Providers of special services relied on agency referrals and \"word-of-mouth\" to identify and service elderly populations. The findings suggest that service delivery agencies in urban areas must become more aggressive in exploring alternative methods for reaching elderly persons who need transport services. (Author/BL)",

To compare the types and number of problems resident and commuter students bring to a university counseling center, the intake data of 345 students (152 dormitory residents, 193 commuters; 177 women, 168 men) seeking individual counseling during the 1981-82 academic year were analyzed. Data were categorized according to sex, type and number of problems, resident status, and class. An analysis of the results showed that dormitory residents sought help for personal problems more often than expected, and commuters sought help for more than one problem more often than expected. Fifty-four percent (54%) of the freshmen sought counseling, while only 13% of the juniors and  10% of the seniors sought counseling. Freshmen sought more test feedback, and juniors sought more personal counseling. Although women comprised 40% of the student body, 51% of the counselees were female. Students with personal problems were seen for more sessions than were any other students. Juniors were seen for the largest number of sessions followed by seniors, sophomores, and freshmen. Finally, junior and sophomore dormitory residents were seen for more sessions than were commuters, and senior commuters were seen for more sessions than senior dormitory residents. (BL)",

The philosophy and advantages of the therapeutic camping model are discussed, e.g., structure during the summer, controlled though informal naturalistic environment, and positive orientation. The liaison between community mental health centers and the camp program is presented, with emphasis on the therapeutic benefits to the child of a comprehensive treatment approach. Linkages between family, agency, and campers, such as visits, reports, letters, and family activities are described. Staff training is discussed in a paper focusing on basic principles of the therapeutic model, its  psychological assumptions, and specific skill training in the application of behavior and learning theory and in traditional camping skills. The contigency management program, focusing on specific target categories (self-help, peer relations, compliance, and program participation) and the camp's token economy system and reinforcers are described. Illustrations of innovative treatment applications, both in individual and group modalities, are offered including the case of a borderline psychotic child with deficits in all target categories, and the case of a child with noncompliant, aggressive behavior. Therapeutic applications in specific activities (swimming, camping, and recreation) are also presented. The papers conclude with an evaluation of the program including three case studies.  Results indicate that Camp Logan is an effective intervention for behaviorally disturbed children, with 85% of the campers showing improvement. (BL)",

        "description":"Research has found a strong relationship between aggregate economic indicators and the number of individuals receiving services from mental health facilities. To examine the relationship between macroeconomics and health, the broad utilization patterns and demographic information on the aggregate number of individuals using the mental health center services of 13 community centers in Philadelphia, between July 1973 and May 1982, were analyzed. The six service modalities analyzed were inpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization, emergency social rehabilitation, and vocational rehabilitation. Economic indicators were the monthly, seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, and the month-to-month, seasonally adjusted percent change of the Consumer Price Index, which was used as an  index of inflation. An analysis of the results showed that the unemployment rate was significantly and directly related to use of several services, while the inflation rate was a poor predictor of service use. The services reacted to economic change in the following sequence: emergency, inpatient, partial hospitalization, social rehabilitation, and outpatient. Increased service utilization preceded increases in unemployment, suggesting that anticipation of job loss can be as stressful as the actual layoff. The findings suggest that mental health planners need to address the impact of economic change in the allocation of services and in prevention at both the individual and social policy levels. (BL)",

        "description":"The present research program began as a preliminary attempt to examine the relationship between client and treatment loci of control as a predictor of success in weight control programs. In the first phase of the research, individuals previously attempting weight loss, and the programs they had pursued, were classified as being either primarily internally-oriented or externally-oriented. Retrospective analysis of their experiences revealed more weight loss for those whose locus of control orientation was similar to that of their program. Successive replications, however, generated data suggesting that a more powerful predictive factor may be whether the individual pursued a self-directed weight management program or sought formal treatment. In particular, for the 66 college  students participating in the three phases of the research, it was found that those whose weight control efforts were self-managed lost weight at more than twice the rate (2.47 pounds per week) as those who had entered formal treatment programs (1.22 pounds per week). These findings suggest the potential value of efforts to delineate factors and mechanisms involved in the successful management of habit problems. (Author)",

Two case studies are presented to illustrate the use of the two therapeutic approaches. The first case study presented describes the 18 month treatment of a 19-year-old woman diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. The second case describes the treatment, over a 2-year period, of a 20-year-old man suffering from incapacitating attacks of anxiety, related to fears of homosexuality. The impact of the blending of treatment approaches is discussed from the view point of patient needs and the training of student  therapists.

        "description":"Current social psychological analysis of the self is characterized by three principles: the self is bounded and concrete; the opinions of others are valued for self-definition, self-evaluation and the maintenance of self-esteem; and the road to fame is paved with one's own actions. Attributions of causality for one's actions traditionally have followed one of three philosophical viewpoints, i.e., regularity theory, necessity theory, or activity theory. Under regularity theory, knowledge is assumed to be derived from experience, based on repeated observations of contiguous events. Necessity theory assumes an a priori knowledge of succession in time, as seen in casual chains, process models, and structural equation analyses. Activity theory regards human agency as the paradigmatic  instance of causality. A social psychological analysis of causality must include three themata: (1) human agency; (2) single instances; and (3) true cause as a subset of the events' antecedents. Recent literature proposes an integrative model that places attribution for success and failure in the social context of presenter and audience, in which the presenter assumes more credit for success than blame for failure. However, exclusive concentration on self-presentational effects in attribution presents an incomplete picture of the human condition. In many instances, attribution for success must be shared with impersonal forces outside the self. Some evidence exists for the attribution of positive achievements to superphysical causes. Laboratory research must now demonstrate that the self  will share its accolades with an intangible impersonal force. (BL)",

A description of the design and composition of the parent groups, including membership, organization, and leaders, follows. A detailed description of the five group sessions is given including: (1) reactions of children to divorce; (2) active listening and direct expression of feelings; (3)  limit setting and negotiation; (4) ongoing relationship between divorced parents; and (5) problem solving and future plans. The remainder of the paper elaborates on the clinical issues which emerged in running the groups, including the limitations of the educational format, leader role, structured vs. unstructured groups, working through separation issues while talking about parenting, leader techniques, recruitment and screening of participants, timing of group offerings, and leader preparation and qualifications.

To date, gerontology curricula have been based upon institutional requirements and interests, such as the guidelines provided by the Foundations Project (1980). To expand these guidelines, the needs and interests of the directors of 60 agencies serving the elderly in Santa Clara County, California, were surveyed. The results indicated that few persons working in local programs have gerontology backgrounds, although directors realized the need for this education and would like persons educated in gerontology on their staffs. Knowledge in health and aging, psychology, ethnicity, and social work were needs stressed by respondents. Essential skills included  resource awareness, planning, needs assessment, and evaluation. In comparing these findings with results of the Foundations Project, two of the three core requirements for gerontology education identified in the project (health and psychology) also were supported by the present survey. The third requirement, physiology of aging, was listed by a minority (48%) of the present respondents. In the area of specific skills, planning, counseling, and evaluation were essential to a majority of the present survey respondents, as compared to a minority in the Foundations Project. These findings suggest that gerontology programs should probe their own communities in the development of their academic curriculum. (BL)",

        "description":"The patient-therapist model, the oldest form of mental health treatment, is at the core of reconstructive psychotherapy. Because this therapeutic partnership is subtle and vague, ethical concern is at the heart of the reconstructive therapeutic process. The aims of reconstructive therapy can be defined in terms of an existential, a psychoanalytic or an ego-psychoanalytic framework. In the therapist-patient relationship, usually only the therapist is knowledgeable about how the therapeutic process works to relieve symptoms. The patient has only hope and faith, which provide the groundwork for therapeutic influence. Emotional growth seems related to the patient's cognitive or perceptual response to the healer's curing powers, or the influence of personality. Thus, essential  features of the psychoanalytic process include the therapist's characteristics and competencies, the working alliance, transference and countertransference, submission, and the nature of the therapist's authority. Factors that may lead to unethical practice include a God-like complex the therapist may derive from unrealistic feelings of superiority and power, and a strong narcissistic tendency that may be expressed through a need to control. Preventive measures for the therapist include personal analysis, case supervision with a mentor, and interdisciplinary as well as social relationships. (JAC)",

        "description":"The report discusses speech processes in reading by critically considering recent available evidence and by proposing a general model of speech processes. Stating that much work has been guided by the question of whether speech recoding precedes lexical access, the report proposes that a richer understanding of speech processes in reading must include attention to postlexical processes. Although there is little direct evidence, the report suggests that postlexical demands of reference securing make it reasonable to hypothesize that activation of some phonemic information is automatic and concurrent with lexical activation, and that the phonemic code is not a mere replica of a speech production. The report also proposes that experiments employing speech suppression paradigms are  inadequate to detect the speech processes involved, and suggests both that there is a continuum of speech activation and that suppression operates at a higher level than the relevant speech processes. The report argues that recent research provides at least weak evidence for phonemic processes involving consonants, and also considers whether reading ability is related to the use of speech processes in reading. It is noted that there is considerable evidence to support this; however, there is little evidence presented to show that activation of speech codes fails to occur for less skilled readers. Evidence suggests that activation is slower or less automatic for less skilled readers, and that a speech code, once activated, deactivates more rapidly for such readers. The report concludes by  suggesting that encoding conditions and memory demands may be related and that compensation between them can be arranged. (CRH)",

One such intervention, carried out for two consecutive years, involved giving low and middle income parents packets of several small, easy-to-read books and guidelines for using them with their children when the parents brought their children for preschool screening provided by the school districts in the spring. Children in the first wave (year one) of the study received two additional packets of books by mail during the summer, and children in the second wave (year two) received only the packet at the screening. Children who came to kindergarten the following fall were then tested, and the results were  compared with those of control classmates who had received no materials. The first year students were tested at the beginning and end of the year. Year 2 students were tested only in November. A three-variable model (gender, picture vocabulary test score, and treatment type) was used to predict end-of-kindergarten scores on knowledge of words, letters, spelling, and story. Analyses of the reading knowledge of the first year students indicated reliable and longlasting effects of the treatment. The treatment affected not only story reading but also word reading and spelling. Year 2 students showed a smaller instructional effect when compared with control students. Children's story reading was affected by the treatment, but not word reading or spelling. The diminished effect could be  explained by either the earlier posttesting date or the provision of fewer materials. (HTH)",

This perspective, however, runs contrary to clinical experiences, which have revealed that many repetitions are deliberate and benefit the reader by serving at least one of three distinct purposes. The first is to aid recognition of difficult words. When word difficulties arise, the reader is likely to &quot;back up&quot; to an earlier portion of the sentence in an attempt to trigger recognition or decoding of an unfamiliar word. The second purpose is to confirm or test the suitability of word choices. Once the reader has deciphered a new word, he or she may repeat the surrounding phrase, including the new word  choice, to test its suitability for that particular portion of the context. If the word proves unsuitable, it is likely to be abandoned and additional attempts made. Such repetitions may amplify the readers' confirmation, in which case the reader may simply repeat with new found confidence and eagerness in order to regain control of oral delivery. The third purpose for repetitions is to regain fluency. In the absence of specific word difficulties, readers may back up and reread an entire word group or phrase, adjusting vocal pitch and stress, in an attempt to achieve fluency when the rhythm and intonation of the oral delivery have forced a given word to sound &quot;out of sync&quot; with the natural word group.

At the start of the test, the 184 subjects from two schools (A and B) were told of the examiner's interest in seeing whether they could pronounce made-up words by using their spellings. Pronunciations for each word, as well as explanations offered for how a subject pronounced three of twelve preselected words were recorded. Results indicated a mean score of 12.2 words correctly pronounced. Eighteen of the 29 pseudo words were mispronounced more than 50% of the  time. Third grade students at school A had slightly higher scores than their counterparts at school B, while fourth and sixth grade students at school B had higher scores than their peers at school A. Test scores improved slightly more between third and fourth grades than between fourth and sixth grades. There was little evidence that subjects had been taught to scan the whole word before considering its parts, or that subjects understood the significance of syllabication. There were also problems with blending sounds to produce syllables or words, all of which suggest a need for better (rather than more) phonics instruction. (Descriptions of the two schools, students' explanations for pronunciations, and extensive tables of data are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"Children begin school with some very basic ideas about written language and reading. The first is that of sign and message. That a graphic representation, a &quot;sign,&quot; conveys meaning is an early and easy concept for children that stems from their visually attending to print in their environment. The realization that spoken language can be written down signifies the attainment of the concept of &quot;message.&quot; As children progress, their writing begins to look more like adult representations. They also develop the concept of &quot;directionality,&quot; that letters and print move from left to right, and from top to bottom of the page. Once children begin to combine letter forms into single words and groups of words, it becomes necessary for them to adapt to the requirement that a space  distinguishes between words. Parents and teachers who help children develop these ideas about written language are also helping them develop skills for beginning reading. Parents should provide preschool children with opportunities to enhance their awareness of print in their environment and with a variety of activities that allow practice of print. Teachers can further children's experimentation with written language by providing a school atmosphere that is conducive to spontaneous writing activities. Children who are able to produce a written message that is recognizable as such to an adult have mastered a very important concept in learning to read--they have established the relationship between oral and written modes of language and have acquired the knowledge that what they want to  say can be written down and read by them and by someone else.

The subjects, 103 seventh grade students in an urban school, were identified by scores on the California Achievement Test as either good or poor readers. They were then divided into four groups receiving the following treatments: passages without experimental questions, passages with questions but with instructions not to review the text, passages with questions and instructions to review, and passages with questions, instructions to review, and instructions to write out the responses. Following the reading of four content area passages, subjects took a multiple-choice comprehension test, which they retook two weeks later to determine the effects of the treatments on long term retention. The  positive effects were noted for subjects in the question-review-write (QRW) treatment. The results indicated that interspersing question in text in the manner of QRW is effective for good readers on short term retention and short term and long term retention considered together, but not for long term retention. No significant differences appeared for poor readers in any of the treatment groups. The poor readers were reading materials at their frustration level, so even with the insertion of questions in text to reduce the amount of print encountered at one time, the readability level proved to be too difficult.

The subjects, 224 ninth grade students, were randomly assigned to one of four prereading treatments--structural organizer with outline grid, which consisted of information on the organization of the passage and a skeleton outline depicting the passage organization; structural organizer without outline grid; control condition with notetaking; and control condition without notetaking. Target passages were  organized with adversative, attribution, covariance, or response organizational patterns. Results indicated that the structural organizer with outline grid reliably and markedly facilitated subjects' comprehension and recall, that notetaking alone reliably and markedly facilitated comprehension and recall, and that the structural organizer without outline grid reliably facilitated comprehension but not recall. Additional findings were that the effect was similar across the four organizational patterns and across various hierarchical levels of the passages. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"Recently there has been an increasing interest in the development of children's impressions of stories, partially due to the work of theorists who have proposed formal grammars representing structural characteristics of stories. In order to learn more about children's narrative competence, stories they produced were analyzed in three experiments. The pictorial sequences from the picture arrangement subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) were used as a structural context to elicit stories from the subjects. These were also used to constrain the pragmatic and imaginative aspects of the story telling task so that particular structural aspects could be examined uniformly across different age groups, and to provide a first step in assessment of the  underlying psychological properties related to successful performance. In experiments one and two, 12 students each from second and seventh grade and 12 college students were given the subtest individually and were asked to produce an oral story. In the third experiment, 12 seventh graders and twelve college students were administered the subtest and were asked to produce a written story. Overall, the findings indicated that (1) children dwell on overt characteristics of events, avoid discussion of character motivation, and ignore logical connectivity, while adults embellished these--particularly in the written stories; (2) the inclusion of a goal statement was much higher than the inclusion of a reaction statement for all subjects; and (3) the event structures of the WISC-R picture sets  vary considerably.

Students in the program were taught role playing and storymaking or playwriting, as well as a number of improvisational exercises. Each student completed an attitude scale as a pretest and posttest. Student performance on a standardized achievement test served as achievement pretest scores, while scores on a district-wide  standardized achievement test served as posttest scores. Results showed significant improvement in reading achievement and in attitudes, specifically self-expression, trust, acceptance of others, self-awareness, and awareness of others.

The first section of the monograph covers problematic aspects of the earliest textual materials children encounter, including limited story vocabulary, specific characteristics of illustrations, divisions within a story, previous knowledge assumed by texts, and vocabulary knowledge and instruction before, during,  and after reading. The second section deals with setting the direction for story lesson reading and applying schemata. The third section deals with after-reading questions and the effectiveness of sequential questioning based on plot events. Two studies--(1) an attempt to redesign a story lesson from a basal program and (2) a large vocabulary development program that investigated the relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension--are briefly discussed in the fourth section. The monograph concludes that, in an attempt to be everything to everybody, basals sometimes set too many goals for individual lessons. Specific recommendations are listed for each of the problem areas identified throughout the monograph. (CRH)",

The study further proposed that children's classification outcomes are a function of the knowledge that they have and the representation that the knowledge takes. Two study approaches were used. First, group of seven-year-olds was divided into expert and novice groups based on the children's knowledge about dinosaurs. Both groups were asked to sort 20 dinosaur pictures into as many groups as they wished. Results indicated that when knowledge was available, as was the case  with the expert children, they could classifiy hierarchically at the superordinate level. The novice children tended to classify at the basic level, relying primarily on perceptual features. The results suggested that the expert children's ability to classify at the superordinate level was due to the fact that their knowledge was already organized in such a way as to permit retrieval of this organization. The second study approach involved single, within-subject designs applied to four and five-year-olds. Results of these demonstrations indicated that (1) young children's representations may be hierarchical and consistent but fail to match the canonical form that the experimenter expects and (2) that young children may be inconsistent in their sorting criteria for an unfamiliar set of  objects but be very consistent in their sorting criteria for a familiar set of objects.

        "description":"People in interaction with others organize their perceptions of a social situation in terms of plans even when the others' plans are poorly formulated. They use their models of others' plans in formulating their own. Much of what occurs in discourse centers on a continual communication about and reformulation of one's own plans and one's own models of others' plans. Formal methods for describing and analyzing plans are now available and make it possible to be more explicit in formulating hypotheses about social interaction. Unfortunately, the classical formulations for planning are derived from a robot world model that fails to generalize sufficiently to account for typical human planning situations. By pushing the classical model, it is possible to create a model of planning  that embodies concepts such as \"mutual belief,\"\"social episode,\" and \"goal conflict.\" In applying this model to a simple dialogue, it becomes clear that elements of the model are necessary for modeling such dialogues, but not sufficient. More complex dialogues and texts will undoubtedly require further elaboration of the model. (Author/FL)",

The concern with establishing the epistemic status of discourse is not, however, limited to rhetoric. Similar questions dominate much contemporary theorizing in literary criticism and philosophy. At stake in all three disciplines is nothing less than the potential redefinition of the goals, methods, scope, and validity of these humanistic enterprises. The last 30 years have witnessed a number of efforts to both revive and define the discipline of rhetoric, to create, in effect, a new rhetoric. The proponents of the new rhetoric attempt either to characterize their discipline by opposing it  to classical rhetoric or to clarify its nature, scope, and goals by investigating its epistemic status. Studies in the historical relationship between rhetoric and philosophy, and the nature of philosophical argument--in addition to contemporary strategies--can bring together the new rhetoric, philosophy, literary criticism, linguistics, and other disciplines in a revitalizing, interdisciplinary approach to the study of the nature of language.

        "description":"To identify and help alleviate the apprehensions of returning adult students at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 42 subjects were given the Miller and Daly Writing Apprehension Test (WAT) before and after a composition course, their grades were recorded, and their teachers completed questionnaires regarding student attitudes and performance. In addition, four volunteer case study subjects participated in interviews and submitted written drafts of papers. It was discovered that the level of apprehension determined by the WAT did not necessarily correspond to a student's success in the class, and the initial widespread anxiety reported by teachers and interview data did not indicate dysfunctional anxiety in performance. Factors that promoted anxiety were found to be (1) new  writing tasks, (2) conspicuousness in a class of younger students, (3) uncertainty about class procedures, (4) memories of past difficulties or rigid prescriptions about good writing, and (5) the anticipation of high evaluation. Other factors affecting anxiety levels included higher perception of future ramifications and authority conflict. While anxiety levels were indicated as high, it was shown that a sympathetic teacher can help students achieve success. (CRH)",

        "description":"The West Virginia University Child Development Laboratory has successfully used microcomputers as a complement to their language experience approach to teaching three- and four-year-old children. The computer acts as a motivational tool, and gives children the opportunity to produce perfectly typed pictures or letters. The first encounter a child has with the computer is with the scribbling program. By pushing any key on the keyboard the child can make various lines, curves, and geometric shapes on the monitor that he or she normally cannot draw freehand. Just as a teacher may print a child's dictation when he or she draws freehand, the teacher types the child's verbalizations about the computer picture. The story appears below the picture and then a paper copy of the picture and  story are printed for the child. Next, the child is introduced to a program in which specific keys draw specific objects, such as \"B\" for a boy or \"D\" for a dog. The child arranges the figures and composes pictures, then dictates an accompanying story, which is also printed. Results of a study conducted at the lab indicated that children verbalized significantly more about their computer pictures than about their hand-drawn works. In conjunction with developing language and motor skills, the children are developing a positive attitude toward the microcomputer. (Examples of children's computer scribbles and drawings with accompanying text are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"On December 22, 1983, the Federal Communications Commission formally ended its consideration of rule making for children's television programing. Opponents of government regulation view the FCC's decision as a victory for the First Amendment freedoms of speech and the press; proponents of mandatory children's programing guidelines feel that the FCC has mortgaged the nation's youth in favor of marketplace economics and media lucre. In reaching its decision, the FCC criticized the failure of the children's task force to consider the growth in raw numbers of commercial television stations and the increased receivability of television signals, nonbroadcast sources of children's programing, cable programing, and the availability of &quot;family&quot; entertainment on commercial broadcast  stations. Despite contradictory evidence, the FCC concluded that the task force studies did not support a case for increased regulatory concern or involvement in the area of children's television. Clearly the FCC felt strongly that continuing oversight of individual licensee programing for children was wrongheaded. However, by relying on misrepresentations and questionable legal logic, the Commission has invited a court challenge. (HOD)",

        "description":"Computers can provide four kinds of help to practicing writers: (1) data storage and retrieval, (2) computer-assisted instruction and text feedback, (3) utility or word processing programs, and (4) telecommunications capability. Writing teachers must incorporate certain values into the planning of computer applications in the writing curriculum. The first value is freedom, in light of the limits of composition pedagogy and of the function of computers as enforcers and controllers. Teachers must allow students opportunity to learn for themselves, whether by wrestling with a program thought to be too advanced for them (the way people learn to play computer games without instructions), by using programs that ask open-ended questions, or by not using the computer at all if they so  choose. A second value involves honesty and humaneness in the feedback given by computers. Programs that evaluate style may be counter-productive, whereas feedback such as \"that was my toughest question\" gives the student pride in a right answer or information for evaluating the test in the event of a wrong answer. A third value is playful creativity. For example, a computer \"bulletin board\" is a safe playground for trying out essays on other readers, and word processing programs encourage risk-taking in revision.(HTH)",

        "description":"An appreciation of the religious milieu of the John Peter Zenger libel case of 1735 can help explain the nature of the Zenger defense as prepared by Alexander Hamilton, the meaning of the jury's verdict, and the ambiguous legacy of the trial for freedom of expression in the United States. In essence, the case was a disputation on &quot;truth&quot; and on how truth is revealed to humans. Because this issue lay at the heart of Protestant religion as well as of colonial politics, the Zenger case may be seen as an interesting intersection of the two. Indeed, the case and the jury's verdict were closely associated with the spirit of the Great Awakening of religion. Like the Great Awakening, the Zenger case reflected the skepticism about human authority felt by ordinary people who possessed a  deep faith in the existence of God and of truth. Like the ministers of &quot;awakened&quot; congregations, who were willing to reject the authority of creeds and hierarchies, the Zenger jurors were willing to reject the instructions of the chief justice of New York. Like the revival converts who asserted their right to interpret the law of God, the Zenger jury asserted the right of ordinary people to interpret human law. In both instances, the operative principle was not freedom, but truth. (FL)",

        "author":["Olasky, Marvin N."],
        "description":"An explanation for the general disdain for the practice of public relations may lie in textbooks that attempt to communicate methodology, while insinuating philosophy. In 10 surveyed public relations textbooks, the authors have tried to explain the contempt for public relations, but their common failing has been to blame outside forces, contending that the problems of the trade are caused not by the nature of the profession, but rather by a few unfortunate practices. There was one promising moment during the late 1950s and early 1960s when basic questions about the purpose of public relations were being asked. But judging from articles appearing in &quot;Public Relations Journal&quot; during the past half dozen years, it appears this slightly open door to reevaluation has been slammed  shut. To learn why this debate aborted 20 years ago, one needs to examine a major argument developed by Thomas Kuhn. His basic building block is the paradigm, a particular theory that dominates a scientific or occupational field. Within an established paradigm, practitioners can get on with their work without being forced to spend time defending the basic principles of the paradigm or the world view that is its base. No theory provides a perfect fit with the facts, but when practitioners begin to understand that the most pressing problems they face have no solution within the old paradigm, questioning of that paradigm begins. The debate aborted because practitioners had developed a comfortable paradigm that was unshaken by social suspicion and mistrust of large organizations apparent  since the mid-1960s. A new debate about public relations' purpose is long overdue. (HTH)",

        "description":"Between 1964 and 1968, &quot;U. S. News and World Report&quot; engaged in symbolic discourse with its readership through its coverage of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. &quot;U. S. News&quot; faced a dilemma in the mingling of King's force as a symbol with the power exerted by the egalitarian principles that Gunnar Myrdal identified as components of the American Creed. The magazine first attempted to counter the prevailing definition of King as a symbol of moderate reform by portraying him as a false prophet. Two general themes appeared. The first was that, unwitting or not, King was an agent of communist conspiracy. The second was that the nonviolence and civil disobedience practiced by King threatened the rule of law. King was presented as a threat in both themes to the ordered society &quot;U. S. News&quot;  sought to represent. However, when other less moderate black leaders or organizations appeared to pose greater threats than King, &quot;U. S. News&quot; redefined his role and presented him with his symbolic qualities as a moderate reformer intact or augmented. This process continued through the late reformist and radical phases of his career, and, following his death, &quot;U. S. News&quot; once again redefined King as a prophet who promised peace.

Black Star's founders, Ernest Mayer, Kurt Kornfeld, and Kurt Safranski, had nearly worldwide connections with contract photographers, and were well experienced in the operation of German mass circulation photo magazines, as well as the new techniques of photojournalism. They recognized the value of candid photography and the photo essay in presenting both the famous and the ordinary in routine situations. Mayer, Kornfeld and Safranski shared with the editors of &quot;Life&quot; their experience as business  men and as editors, and encouraged them to use more photo essays produced by individual photographers rather than so many single photographs. The Black Star photographers who produced photographs for &quot;Life,&quot; many of whom were talented Euroupean emigres, applied their knowledge of German photojournalism practices in their work, thus creating another channel through which ideas were carried across cultural boundaries. Eventually, many of the photographers became &quot;Life&quot; staff members or contract photographers for the decades in which the magazine flourished. (CRH)",

Student editors were also questioned about their views toward student press freedom. The results gave no indication that advisers' understanding of student press law affected their attitude toward students' First Amendment rights or their attitudes toward student press function. It was not apparent from the analysis that advisers' experience, education, or attitudes influenced their perception of student press role. Both  objective and subjective data indicated that student newspaper editors tended to have a narrower idea of student press freedom than did their advisers. While both advisers and editors overwhelmingly supported the coverage of controversial topics in the student press, both groups appeared to feel that such items may also be banned if they are &quot;in poor taste&quot; or do not represent &quot;good journalism.&quot; Censorship occurred least where advisers and editors worked closely together to determine material suitability. The results showed a continuing trend toward improved recognition of student journalists' rights. However, it is also apparent that both philosophically and in practice, advisers and editors do not recognize the full measure of First Amendment press freedoms the courts have granted to  student journalists.

        "author":["Denton, Craig L."],
        "description":"For centuries artists have explored the uses of color in their compositions. Believing that colors have innate symbolic, expressive, and aesthetic qualities, artists have been aware that these properties can be magnified or subdued by organization within a compositional space, and artists have suggested that certain positions within a framed field are inherently advantageous or disadvantageous for the placement of color. Recently, investigators in Gestalt psychology have identified a phenomenon called &quot;magnetism of the frame.&quot; The theory suggests that a frame has powers of attraction, and objects placed close to an edge, either inside or outside the frame, will be perceived as drawn toward the frame. Other research has shown that certain sections within any framed space have the  potential to sharpen the visual effects of any object placed within those sections. This paper explores the effects of magnetism of the frame on color. The possible areas of investigation, the variables of color and compositional field that need to be addressed and controlled, and media tools and stimuli that could be used to test hypotheses are outlined. The ramifications for applied mass communication are surveyed. It is theorized that a frame can supercharge colors. This phenomenon could be employed in television news delivery, publication, or packaging design. In addition, the fact that the placement of color within a frame is crucial to effective color photography composition is explored. (Author/CRH)",

        "description":"In an attempt to integrate research on the impact of judicial selection and research on journalist-source interaction, a study considered the method by which judges are selected and retained and how this method influences the exchange relationship between sources and journalists in trial courts. Elected trial court judges in Minnesota and appointed judges in an unnamed northeastern state were surveyed to test three hypotheses: (1) that in states where judges are elected and retained by public vote, they should be more willing to communicate with the public through interaction with journalists; (2) that because they are arguably more directly accountable to the public, elected judges would be more likely to cooperate with journalists in order to achieve publicity, thus enhancing  the journalists' relative power in the exchange; and (3) that elected judges will attend more to the media's coverage of the judiciary, again enhancing the relative power of the journalist. In terms of overall communication behavior, results indicated that in fact judges who were elected cooperated more with journalists than appointed judges, were more likely to cooperate for publicity reasons, and were more likely to read media coverage of courts. Results also seemed to indicate that elected judges inherently have an incentive to seek communication links with the public. (CRH)",

        "description":"Because there is concern with undergraduate writing deficiencies, and because college of education faculties are sometimes unclear as to what specific problems students encounter, a study attempted to determine what specific problems in students' writing are encountered by education professors at the University of Saskatchewan. Another goal of the study was to discover any relationships among the professors' perceptions of student writing problems, their course writing requirements, and their own attitudes towards language. Thirty-three full time faculty members completed a form that elicited information about department, course level taught, and types and number of required exams and assignments. The questionnaire also contained student writing error types that the respondents  checked, ranked, and added to, and a 38-item language attitude survey (Kean and Personke). Finally, respondents were asked to collect and submit for study samples of student writing. Results indicated that student writing in the college of education was reasonably healthy, although recurring errors that need constant attention existed. Other conclusions included: (1) all faculty could assist students by responding to student writing rather than simply assigning grades; (2) faculty and students need to understand the writing process; (3) students need guidelines for writing in the argumentative mode and for understanding the criteria on which their writing is being evaluated; (4) faculty need to be familiar with the distinctions between the various aspects of writing; and (5) faculty need  to evaluate the types of major assignments and examinations that make up course requirements.

        "description":"Course evaluations of a business writing class that used the IBM personal computer with WordStar word processing software revealed students' enthusiasm for the microcomputer's word processing capabilities. A number of students commented on how much the computer simplified the processes of composing, revising, and editing. In addition to the speed and relative effortlessness of making corrections, word processing also made writing seem less messy and more efficient. Several students noted the microcomputer made them feel more relaxed about writing and more willing to take risks. Some students noticed that using the computer had an effect on their writing style. Almost immediately their writing became less stilted and labored and more conversational. Almost all of the students said  they found themselves more willing to revise and edit their compositions on the computer than they had been before the course using conventional writing methods. One of the complaints mentioned involved the extra time required to complete an assignment. Others complained about the time restrictions on the computers--having to use them in the lab and only at certain designated hours. Despite these inconveniences, however, the students clearly felt the experience with word processing was worthwhile and many thought word processing should remain in the course. (HOD)",

        "description":"Writing appears to have originated from a modest system of counters or tokens used to keep track of economic goods and transactions. This system of recording appeared in 8000 B. C. in Mesopotamia, or what is now Iraq. The tokens' consistency in shape and size during the next 4,000 years attests to the stability of the agricultural economy and way of life. When cities began to appear, the number of types of tokens increased, and incised and punched markings proliferated on the face of the tokens in response to the need for a more intricate record keeping system. Around 3300 B. C., simple hollow clay balls were invented. They provided both a means of holding and protecting the tokens of a particular transaction, and a clay surface onto which the parties involved could impress their  personal seals, thereby insuring against any tampering with the contents of the ball, or envelope. Eventually, the tokens were pressed into the clay of the envelope's outer surface and then enclosed in the envelope, so the contents could be read without having to open the envelope and break the seal. These outer impressions then made the presence of the tokens inside superfluous, and in 3100 B. C. the hollow envelopes were replaced by solid tablets into which the shapes of the relevant tokens could be pressed. These signs were later replaced by incised signs illustrating the shape of the tokens and their markings. The repertoire of symbols grew to include those representing other than economic goods, drawn from sources other than the tokens, thus opening writing to all fields of human  endeavor. (HTH)",

By making the connection between books and storytelling and between books and creative drama, the storyteller/teacher introduces literature as a source of pleasure. Storytelling and creative dramatics also give children insight into the motives and patterns of human behavior, and understanding plot and character helps children understand literature. Storytelling allows closer interaction between teacher and children, and the teacher may modify the story to meet the needs of the group or personalize the story to match the children's age and interests, thus insuring comprehension. Storytelling also encourages children to listen to the patterns of language  and variety of vocabulary. When choosing stories, the storyteller/teacher should consider the audience, the story, the purpose for telling the story, and the storyteller's personal preference. The storyteller/teacher can choose from myths, sagas, folktales, narrative poetry, realistic stories, or biographical stories. In creative activities, children become more involved with a story and identify with the characters they have chosen to recreate. Responding to a story by retelling it or by acting it out with creative dramatics helps children internalize the plot, characters, and vocabulary of the story. (HTH)",

        "description":"Recent polls seem to indicate that many Americans rely on television as a credible and primary source of news. To test the accuracy of this news, a study examined three networks' newscasts of science news, the attitudes of the science sources toward reporting in their field, and the factors related to accuracy. The Vanderbilt News Archives Index was examined to locate science stories. When a located item was reported on more than one network, only one version was chosen and selection of a network was made on a rotating basis. Transcriptions were made of the news broadcast audiotapes and mailed with a questionnaire to the attributed source. The original scientists contacted by reporters were asked whether inaccuracies had occurred in the news report, how the reporter had gathered  the data, and what the respondents' attitudes were toward network television. The Charnley method of newspaper accuracy assessment was used, with appropriate variations for its application to television, though it was found that sources were difficult to track down and that transcripts of the broadcasts lacked the visual element that is important in television news coverage. Based on those presumed to have received the questionnaire packets, there was a 56% return rate. Data revealed that nearly half the respondents (48.5%) found the stories completely accurate, while 14% judged them somewhat inaccurate. Among respondent complaints were lack of air time given a subject, omission of essential details, sensationalism, confusing presentation of facts, and misleading editing practices.  Although preliminary findings indicate that television science news is slightly more accurate than newspaper coverage, this finding may be due to factors like the brevity of television stories and printing errors that are beyond a news writer's control.

The results indicated that more jokes were anti-male or biased against neither sex, and fewer jokes were told that were pro-female or pro-male by all subjects across the three audiences. Men tended to tell more anti-male and anti-female jokes than did women. The women were more likely to tell jokes that were discriminatory toward neither sex and were more likely than men to tell pro-male or pro-female jokes.

Dyadic accessibility refers to workers' estimates of their supervisors' accessibility. Normative accessibility is the workers' estimate of supervisor accessibility norms in the organization as a whole. Forty middle-level management personnel in various midwestern organizations completed a questionnaire and were interviewed by organizational communication students. Analysis of the results indicated that task characteristics are related differentially to dyadic and normative supervisor accessibility. The data showed support for the overall relationship  between task characteristics and dyadic accessibility. Variety was significantly related to access in that workers felt they have more opportunity to interact with their supervisors when their job requires many activities. The relationship of autonomy and identity to accessibility was not as clear cut. Autonomy produced significant results, indicating that employees need to have a relationship in which their supervisors are accessible, even though they may not often take advantage of it. Task identity failed to produce a significant correlation. The results failed to indicate a relationship between task characteristics and normative accessibility. (HTH)",

Ethical communication demonstrates a desire for the good of all those involved in the communication process, rather than just the personal gain of the speaker or the good of the listener. One possible method of teaching ethics within the constraints of the workshop requires placing ethics and communication in a broader perspective: instead of separating ethics from communicaton theory, the instructor may merge the two by suggesting that ethical communication achieves more significant goals than audience effect. Ethical communication may then be viewed as a means of maintaining a healthy society,  guaranteeing free speech, and enhancing political pluralism, among other societal goals. Within a personal code of communication ethics, workshop instructors should (1) fully and honestly disclose academic qualifications to participants; (2) specify services, objectives, and the end products of the seminar; (3) cite sources of any work other than their own, never claiming any work other than their own; (4) act in ways consistent with their professional conscience; (5) view the workshop as an opportunity to focus on the participants' needs; (6) reflect understanding and application of speech communication theory; (7) maintain a working understanding of advances in their area of expertise; and (8) request and conduct participant evaluations of the instructors' workshop performance.

        "description":"There are three systems of ethics applicable to forensics programs. The classical conception borrows from Quintilian's reference to a &quot;good man speaking well.&quot; A second approach starts from the context of a democratic society and builds on the principles that should govern a speaker in that setting, among which are the obligation to select and present fact and opinion fairly and a responsibility to reveal the sources of one's information. A third ethical process is the concern with &quot;ghost writing&quot; expressed by Ernest G. Borman, who suggested that the speaker who allows others to provide the content and style of a speech robs the audience of the knowledge of the speaker's character. If one chooses to define a forensics program as an end unto itself--a coaching of 10 individual  events--existing ethical systems will offer little help. If, however, one views participation in forensics as a training program for valuable skills applicable beyond the immediate competitive setting, rather than as an extracurricular coaching situation removed from the regular speech program, then ethics become relevant. This latter attitude raises the following implications: (1) the forensics &quot;coach&quot; must be a communications professional who plays an integral role in the larger communications program, (2) the student must be encouraged to view the contest events as a simulation of an actual speaking situation, and (3) all coaches and judges must also be encouraged to view the events as simulations of real speaking events, rather than as ritualized ceremonial occasions practiced by only  an enlightened few for their own benefit.

Subjects' final course grades, ACT scores, and high school grade-point averages were obtained from college records. When the effects of classroom context (as measured by previous academic evaluation) and the ability or aptitude of the students (as measured by the ACT) were removed, sex differences in grading still remained. Biological sex,  rather than perceived sex type, appeared to be the strongest predictor for discrimination in grading between men and women. Masculine and undifferentiated (low in masculine and feminine traits) women received the highest course grades, followed by androgynous (high in masculine and feminine traits) women, feminine women, feminine men, masculine men, undifferentiated men, and androgynous men. Several explanations that may account for the consistent indication that women receive higher grades in speech courses are discussed. Apart from psychological sex characteristics, covert neurological differences between men and women may be more important than overt anatomical differences in explaining and predicting successful communication.

The roles performed by attorneys, administrators, school law professors, and other professionals are considered, with particular attention to the attorney-client relationship. Advantages cited for preventive legal planning include control of costs, discouragement of litigation, and  better assurance of a good defense if a lawsuit is filed. Through foresight educators can predict legal risks and minimize their scope, or at least evaluate the risks and choose courses of action less risky than others.

        "description":"This chapter reports on legislative activity and court litigation during 1983 on issues relating to school prayer. Eighteen bills and resolutions have been introduced in the 98th Congress on this issue; 7 relate to voluntary prayer, 4 to equal access, and 3 are concurrent resolutions, not legislative in nature, expressing the belief that periods of silence in public school programs do not violate the constitution. A Senate resolution proposing a school prayer amendment has been introduced at the insistence of President Reagan, but stands little chance of passage, owing to strong opposition by most mainline religious groups as well as civil liberties organizations. Equal access measures, allowing students to meet voluntarily for religious purposes, have a better chance of passage.  Initiatives to limit federal court jurisdiction over school prayer have been introduced in both the Senate and the House, but thus far have met with little success. The federal courts, during 1983, overturned several state efforts to establish prayer in schools. In &quot;Jaffree vs. Wallace,&quot; the Eleventh Circuit Court for Appeals ruled against two Alabama statutes permitting teacher-led school prayer. Likewise, in cases in New Mexico and New Jersey, courts ruled against statutes allowing for a &quot;period of silence&quot; on the grounds that they evinced a religious purpose. Other religious practices associated with public schools were prohibited by federal district courts in Georgia and California, though in Pennsylvania, a voluntary religious group was permitted to meet in a semipublic forum. The  equal access issue is likely to become more prominent during 1984. (TE)",

        "description":"This chapter provides an analysis of seniority rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination in employment. Two legal theories have arisen in assessing Title VII claims: discriminatory treatment, in which the burden of proof of discriminatory intent lies with the plaintiff, and discriminatory impact of neutral practices, in which the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the practice in question is a legitimate business necessity. Because Title VI insulates seniority systems from disparate impact suits, Title VII litigation focuses on what constitutes a bona fide seniority system and scope of immunity. The question addressed in the ensuing discussion is therefore as follows: under what circumstances must seniority adjustments be made, and  how much discretion do employers have in modifying operation of seniority systems to give preference to women and minorities? Cases in which the judiciary has addressed these and related Title VII issues are analyzed under the following headings: (1) retroactive seniority (for employees previously denied employment in the same firm for discriminatory reasons); (2) bona fide status (covering legal definitions of bona fide seniority systems); and (3) affirmative action plans (to remedy the adverse effects of seniority systems on victims of prior discriminatory employment practices). The concluding section alludes to counterclaims of reverse discrimination arising from modification of seniority systems to give preference to women and minorities. (TE)",

        "description":"Advocates for minority students charge that special education placement of racially or culturally different students is unfair because the tests, standardized on white, middle-class children, do not accurately reflect the learning rate or potential achievement level of others. For this reason, reliance on IQ tests for placement of minority children in special education has been challenged in the courts. The purpose of this chapter is threefold: (1) to review the court cases that have challenged the use of intelligence or aptitude tests as a basis for special class placement of minority children, especially placement into programs for the educable mentally retarded; (2) to analyze the two best known recent decisions, &quot;Larry P. vs. Riles&quot; and &quot;Parents in Action on Special Education  (PASE) vs. Hannon&quot;; and (3) to indicate which of the cultural and racial bias issues raised in the various cases have been resolved and which continue to elude resolution, awaiting further developments. Although the judges in &quot;Larry P. vs. Riles&quot; and &quot;PASE vs. Hannon&quot; came to conflicting verdicts with respect to cultural bias in IQ testing, the authors conclude that both are important benchmarks in the continuing evolution of court rulings, since both affirm that overreliance on IQ testing without regard for other data is likely to be discriminatory and violative of due process.

Major considerations in developing a reduction-in-force or layoff policy are then specified for several contingencies: when districts have no such policies in collective bargaining agreements; when they must revise their agreements; when a policy is being initiated; and when a policy is made to cover employees not in a bargaining unit. After noting general features necessary to any reduction-in-force or layoff  policy, the specific details of a plan are grouped to determine the need in the district, decide on positions to be eliminated, organize the force reduction, and recall employees.

The key findings of this investigation, highlighted in the first section, are that Chapter 2 has reduced the administrative burden on local school officials due to simplified application procedures, and that it has given them greater discretion.

TIERS Model A contrasts the achievement of Chapter 1 students to publishers' norms for hypothetically comparable groups of students. However, the gains reported by districts using fall-to-spring testing cycles far exceed those of districts on the annual cycle (fall-to-fall or spring-to-spring). Three sources of problems in using Model A may account for this difference: (1) the norm tables of published tests may not be relevant to Chapter 1 students; (2) the publishers' norms may be used inappropriately; (3) local testing practices may bias the outcomes. Findings  supporting each hypothesis are discussed indepth, leading to the conclusion that districts should adopt an annual testing paradigm, since fall-to-spring NCE (Normal Curve Equivalent) gains are unlikely to be accurate reflections of the true impact of Chapter 1.

The first study, involving 14 schools representing a mixture of levels and types of areas served, began in 1979 and spanned 3 school years; the second study, which began in 1981 and is ongoing, involved 12 urban schools representing a mixture of school levels. Following a description of the study's background and methods of inquiry, which included unstructured interviewing, observation, program staff debriefing, and document review yielding approximately 5,000 pages of field notes, the author summarizes the study's findings and discusses in detail its examination of the influences of three major  contextual factors: (1) the availability of time and other resources, (2) local concerns and priorities, and (3) staff perceptions of administrative commitment to change. Having described actions taken by principals in both studies and offered suggestions as to what additional measures might be undertaken, the author concludes that principals can in fact reduce the influence of the contextual factors examined, thereby encouraging teacher participation in the planning and implementation of new educational programs and facilitating progress in bringing about change.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of an Achievement Directed Leadership (ADL) field test conducted at eight elementary schools and a middle school in an urban school district in New Jersey during the 1981-82 school year. The stated purpose of the field test was only secondarily to assess student outcomes; its major objective was to help principals and teachers establish school and classroom conditions facilitating improvement in student learning. Following brief sections on the field test's theoretical framework, study procedures and data sources, the results of ADL implementation and its impact are discussed at each of the five field test levels: (1) external agent; (2) central office staff/district; (3) principal/school; (4) teacher/classroom; and (5) student. Findings  demonstrate a positive correlation between the level of program implementation and student achievement in reading and mathematics. Results showing that achievement gains were greater for those schools with higher levels of implementation lend support to the study's hypothesis that ADL has a considerable positive impact on student achievement and illustrate one way effective schools research can be put into practice. Comprehensive tables covering all field-test levels conclude the document. (JBM)",

As shown by the department's progress reports for 1977-82, this plan has had little effect; unrevised since 1976, it is based on outdated census figures. In 1975 a number of groups, especially Filipinos and whites, were underrepresented in the department staff, while Japanese were overrepresented. Yet, from 1976-77 to 1981-82, the staff composition changed only slightly. Moreover, the department's Affirmative Action Advisory Council (AAAC), as of 1982, had not met for 2 years. The Hawaii Board of Education should  seek advice from the AAAC and other established advisory groups to produce a successful affirmative action program.

Data analyzed in the reprot are from interviews with officials, reviews of performance appraisal and pay statistics, analysis of performance ratings of 475 employees, and questionnaires administered to a sample of merit pay employees. The study also separated out and analyzed the responses of top performers. Several areas  requiring management attention were discovered: (1) factors other than employee performance have influenced the amount of merit pay employees have received; (2) both the performance standards and the procedures used to establish them need to be improved; (3) Office of Personnel Management efforts to evaluate agencies' merit pay programs have been limited in scope, but are improving; and (4) employee perceptions of the merit pay program were low.

Canada's elhi (elementary/high school) publishing is dominated by very large multinational publishers. Learning materials in language arts, social studies, and science reflect the business interests of the multinational publishers in content, book organization, and compensatory action by provincial governments. A general overview of the marketing of learning materials points to many devices that are claimed to be pedagogically valuable but that are, more importantly, promotional and marketing devices. The confluence of emphasis between the business interests of multinationals and both deweyan pedagogy and materials selection processes are discussed. The article  concludes that two factors (the domination of the market by a homogeneous group of publishers and the parallel tenets of multinational business and contemporary pedagogy) have been responsible for the considerable influence the multinationals have on the curriculum.

It tested the widely held belief that school board members are experiencing increased conflict and frustration and explored how these pressures are related to the conflicting expectations on boards to represent their constituents and to make efficient business decisions. Questionnaires were mailed to 100 school board members and 100 superintendents in each of three reasonably similar western, mideastern, and eastern states, in order to get a national sample. The study did not confirm the suggestion that schools are becoming more complex and too demanding, with neither information acquisition nor insufficient time seen as areas  of difficulty by the respondents. Instead, employee negotiations and special interest groups were sources of conflict and frustration. Divergent board expectations also led to conflict, with board members consistently rated less effective when there were strong demands that they be both representatives and experts. (Author/DCS)",

Reviewing the literature on educational politics with a particular concern for recent curriculum reform efforts at the state level, the author follows Campbell and Mazzoni in using a general political systems theory to focus on policy decisions, system actors, and functional relations. The following political systems measures were used to examine state curriculum policy activity: (1) political culture, (2) education centralization, (3) the scope of governemnt, (4) the welfare-education dimension, (5) interparty competition, (6) interest group strength, (7)  legislative professionalism, and (8) the power of governors. After brief discussions of each of these eight measures, the author provides a survey synopsis of state curriculum policy activities and key actors and concludes by calling for additional research into the relationship of state curriculum policy development and public education finance; and (2) state curriculum policy and its implementation on the local level. Also included are three pages of references and five appendixes with data on the extent of involvement of the individual states in various curriculum policy activities. (JBM)",

The increase in Christian school enrollment during the 1970's has been attributed to both white flight from contemporaneous desegregation mandates and dissatisfaction with the secular humanism philosophy of public schools. The increasing minority segment in the 44 evangelical Christian schools in this area has raised the question of whether minority parental expectations are different from white parental expectations. However, the interviews held with a stratified random sample of 147 parents found all three ethnic groups preferred the evangelical Christian school because of  its Christ-centered curriculum, with no apparent significant difference in the expectations of the ethnic groups. Strong academics, a disciplined environment, and a caring staff were also important reasons for enrollment. Since religion was a major factor in attracting parents to the private Christian school, the offering of alternative education approaches by the public school system is not likely to bring them back.

Willower, however, has argued (1982) that legitimization of schools by their communities is not merely ritualistic but is ordinarily problematic. To examine principals' perceptions of the problems posed to their schools' legitimacy by teacher misconduct and the manner in which they learned about and reacted to such misconduct, half-hour to one-hour interviews were conducted in January and February 1983 with 45 senior high school and junior-senior high school principals in a diverse 7-county area of a large northeastern state. The bulk of the incidents principals recalled dealing with teacher  misconduct concerned student-related \"damaging\" teacher behavior. Principals tended to be sensitive to the potential impact of teacher behavior on a school's image and were quick to give attention to any problems that might threaten the legitimacy of their organizations. Findings of the study do not confirm Meyer and Rowan's and other recent accounts emphasizing ritual legitimization; rather, they suggest how problematic legitimization ordinarily is for schools and how tightly bound administrators and teachers are to each other in containing potential threats to school legitimacy.

An outline of the study's methods follows brief discussions of the emergence of multicultural education as a policy issue and the context of multicultural education in Australia. To assess the impact of multicultural education in the state of Western Australia, a federally funded small-scale grants scheme was selected as the study's focus. All grantees receiving such funds between 1979 and 1981 were requested in June 1982 to complete a questionnaire related to multicultural education implementation. Data were then analyzed from the returned questionnaires, documentary material, and interviews conducted with a subsample of questionnaire respondents. The  ensuing discussion of survey results contains five information tables and covers five distinct areas of concern, including contexts for school-site decision-making and grantees' views of multicultural education. Following the subsequent presentation of survey results, field study results at each of the study's nine elementary and secondary school sites, and a synthesis of field study results, the paper concludes by noting four problems connected with the national implementation of multicultural education policy, including the lack of efficacy of schemes relying on local decision-making.

Results show: (1) Rhode Island school systems have experienced little change since the shift from categorical to block grant funding; (2)  desegregation activities funded under the Emergency School Aid Act lost most funding because of this shift; and (3) LEA administrators in charge of Chapter 2 block grant programs felt that the programs involved more ease of administration, less paperwork, and greater programming flexibility than did the categorical programs.

        "description":"Although increased communication between school personnel and parents is now widely held to be beneficial, present knowledge is based principally on nonsystematic studies at the preschool and primary levels that are of questionable validity at the secondary level. To make up for the lack of emphasis in previous research on establishing specific objectives and assessing measurable outcomes with regard to the goal of improved communications, and at the same time to define objectives in terms of promising techniques for improving communications currently being used in the daily operation of schools, researchers should link evaluation activities to the following six aspects of the school-home communications mix: (1) the academic level at which interactions occur, (2) the locus of  communication, (3) whether the school's message is directed to an individual family or to a group or schoolwide audience, (4) whether communications flow from school to home or home to school, (5) topics around which interactions may occur, and (6) the communication methods or vehicles employed. Local school systems should carefully select for study limited sets of communication strategies that meet their local communication needs. Subsequent evaluation of such strategies can contribute to our understanding of the art of improving relations and school effectiveness. (JBM)",

After brief sections on the relations between Chinese society and the educational system and current trends in the areas of economic production and employment, the paper's fourth and longest section discusses the Chinese educational system in terms of its general structure, enrollment patterns in general and in secondary education in particular, and the current state of Chinese higher education. In the paper's final section, which examines the achievements, problems, and future prospects for education in China, it is noted that, although the Chinese  population has doubled since 1949, the illiteracy rate has decreased from 80 percent to 23.5 percent. Since 1983/84, political attitudes seem to have been accorded increased importance in the new criteria for college admittance. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of analyzing the new national school books in China to determine more precisely the current direction of Chinese education. Extensive statistical data as well as bibliographical references are included. (JBM)",

Students who took the SPM while listening to low levels of previously recorded classroom noise performed better than did students in the high-noise-level group. When below-average intelligence students took the STEP III under high-noise conditions, their test scores improved, while above-average intelligence students performed best on STEP III when noise levels were low. Students with above-average intelligence did significantly better on both tests, in both noise  settings. This study supports the contention that the effect classroom noise has on student performance depends on the task involved, but does not support previous findings that suggested sex was a significant variable in determining student performance under various noise-level conditions.

        "description":"This exploratory study provides a foundation for research on socialization in Japanese schools, identifying types of cooperative and competitive student behavior as seen by teachers. The first of two surveys (each using two questionnaires) asked teachers to list examples of cooperative or competitive behavior. The second, designed from the responses to the first, asked a different sample to rank the top 10 of 30 behavior items; through factor and cluster analysis, these items were reduced to composite indexes. Of eight cooperation indexes, six changed ranking between school levels; &quot;harmony&quot; and friendliness were most important overall. Evidently, specific standardized activities foster cooperation, some particular to school level. Though it is unproven that such activities  comprise a grand scheme for teaching cooperation, the Japanese school system clearly states goals for socialization. Of nine competition indexes, all changed ranking between school levels; in contrast to cooperative activities, few were sanctioned or formal. Issues raised include, first, the degree to which cooperative and competitive behavior stem from nonschool factors and from explicit or implicit curricula; and second, the interplay and social meaning of cooperation and competition in schools.

Two types of research activities investigating the nature of family curricula are reviewed: (1) informal descriptions of home schools and their participants' reflections as already published, and (2) several case studies of families at various stages in the home schooling process. Based on this review, first impressions of answers to the following three questions are presented: (1) Why do home schoolers choose to teach their own children? Six categories of reasons are discussed: unsuitability of children for school, desire of parents for control, socialization, conceptualization of the learning process, ideas about content, and personal interest. (2) How do they  conduct their home schools? Brief descriptions by parents are presented, along with field notes from observation and a summary of trends and patterns. (3) What are some of the participating parents' major concerns with this approach to education? Concerns discussed include fear and self-doubt, social isolation, exhaustion, separating home from school, balance between structure and spontaneity, measuring progress, spouse roles, undesirable child behaviors, the teaching of independence, materials, children's socialization, insufficient resources, and apparent lack of progress. The paper concludes with implications for school districts, teachers and administrators, researchers, and legislators. (TE)",

Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss the ways in which schools can regulate the conduct of students without interfering with constitutional rights. Topics covered are student discipline, school sports and clubs (extracurricular activities), and compulsory  attendance. The last three chapters discuss equal educational opportunity and education of handicapped children.

        "description":"Assessing the Reagan Administration's first 3 years in office, this paper evaluates the administration's inability to enact its education agenda, which included reductions of federal regulations, cuts in education spending, tuition tax credits, prayer in the public schools, and abolishing the Department of Education. The consolidation of programs into a single Block Grant called Chapter II and the consolidation of Title I programs in Chapter I eliminated many of the strings that governed state and local use of federal funds. Ironically, reduction of regulatory requirements has moved the government closer to federal support for education. Another legislative change reduced student eligibility under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSL). The administration has successfully  reduced federal education spending. Between 1980-84 educational appropriations (when adjusted for inflation) fell by 14.5 percent over all categories. Reforming education regulations proved difficult, and little has been accomplished. Except for the Chapter I program, consolidation has been unsuccessful. Tuition tax credits were rejected by the Senate. Plans to restructure financial aid were never seriously considered, and the Department of Education remains in existence. Overall, education policy under President Reagan has changed very little, and the federal role in education looks very much as it did under the past four administrations. (Author/MD)",

The study focuses on two departments that chose to use behavior modification techniques. In one department (Radiology) the intervention combined behavior modification techniques with participatory management, while the second (Emergency Room) used only behavior modification techniques. Both interventions focused on the behavior of supervisory staff responsible for assigning overtime. Analysis of the departments suggested that they were generally comparable in staffing and in demands for overtime use. An interrupted time-series analysis was employed to measure trends in overtime  usage before and after the introduction of the interventions. Results indicate that a combination of participatory management and behavior modification techniques led to a more efficient reduction in overtime than did behavior modification techniques used alone.

Two dimensions important to an assessment of future financial demands--the demand for schooling and operational needs--are analyzed.  The inextricably linked facets of price, energy source and/or mix, and availability are discussed in relation to each fuel source. Projected cost comparisons across fuel sources are presented following the treatment by fuel type. Fuels and their relation to schools are then analyzed. The report concludes that energy conservation is the public schools' only alternative to seeking additional revenues or cutting educational services to students. Ways of financing energy conservation are outlined. The report concludes with recommendations to federal, state, and local policymakers. A selected bibliography is appended. (MLF)",

Court cases are analyzed according to the following six principles of the legislation (sample subtopics in parentheses): zero reject--the right of handicapped children to be included in a free, appropriate, publicly supported educational system (expulsion and suspension, residential placement costs, minimum competency testing); nondiscriminatory evaluation; individualized and appropriate education (related services, extended school year); least restrictive educational placement; procedural due process (availability of due process hearings, exhaustion of administrative remedies); and parent participation in  decisionmaking. The principles are described and relevant judicial interpretations noted. A summary section notes that with the courts' insistence, schools are learning to individualize education for exceptional children. The paper concludes with four hypothetical cases in which readers are asked to consider legal implications and the application of P.L. 94-142 as well as of court cases. (CL)",

Background information is briefly summarized for each state in terms of economic, political, and educational trends as well as in terms of the status of special education teacher certification (categorical vs. noncategorical). Supply and demand findings are presented for each state and for the nation as a whole. A subsequent chapter details the effects of those manpower figures and of the economic conditions on quality of services to handicapped children (including information on students with mild to moderate and low  incidence handicaps). The responses of inservice education to issues of quality, quantity, and equity in special education are discussed in terms of target participants, content, and delivery. Concerns voiced about preservice education are also considered. The effects of state budgetary actions on inservice training and of P.L. 94-142, The Education For All Handicapped Children Act, on preservice training are examined via state summaries.

Seven research questions relating to the relationship between teacher or student characteristics and decision behavior were addressed through chi-square analyses or one-way analyses of variance. It was found that the types of information used in making decisions were differentially related to the kinds of decisions made. Except for the finding that teachers who relied on test-based information in ongoing evaluations were more likely to make program changes than were teachers who used observational information, no relationships were found between teacher characteristics and specific decisions or factors influencing decisions. Likewise, specific student  characteristics were not found to be useful predictors of decision behavior. Implications for judging effective teaching and increasing effectiveness are discussed. Appended are a program planning and implementation survey and a section on categorization of data. (Author)",

The first chapter highlights major findings on questions of how many students are referred, student characteristics, reasons for referral, and the nature of the referral process (pre-referral interventions, alternative referral systems). Chapter 2 examines implications for practice, including the need for specified reasons for referral and for training teachers in pre-referral intervention and viewing behavior within its context. Chapter 3 summarizes research on the numbers and types of students referred, and notes that student sex and teachers' tolerance of certain behaviors have impact on referral decisions. Six specific  questions are addressed in a chapter on why teahers refer students for psychoeducational evaluation. Questions touch on such issues as institutional constraints and external pressures, characteristics of referring teachers, and changes students must make to remain in the mainstream setting. Research on the referral process itself reviews procedures in existence and notes such alternatives as the use of local norms and of specific interventions within the class before the student is evaluated. A final chapter summarizes the data sources and research procedures used in the studies, including surveys of special education directors, longitudinal studies of decisionmaking, case study investigation, instructional time observations, and comparative studies of referral and pre-referral  procedures.

Counselors are urged to facilitate parents' understanding of the condition at the time of initial diagnosis. Suggestions for the initial informing session center on the use of interdisciplinary staff, ways to interpret the child's behavior, assurances that parents are not responsible for the child's condition, explanation of the child's cognitive and adaptive functioning level (with information conveyed on the child's relative  strengths and weaknesses), and straightforward answers about long-range expectations (with emphasis on the tentative nature of the projections).

To measure the relative dominance of attributes encoded by the two groups at the two ages, study and test items were manipulated to form visual, acoustic, and semantic distractors. For both second grade and sixth grade LD subjects, visual distractors produced significantly greater numbers of false recognitions than acoustic or semantic distractors. This pattern of encoding preference was also observed with non-LD second graders. However, sixth grade non-LD subjects displayed a shift in encoding preference and were significantly  more distracted by semantic than by acoustic or visual items.

The investigation was intended to analyze the stimulus functions of the presence of a teacher in the task-demand situation. The task employed was a two-choice discrimination that became progressively more difficult, analogous to educational tasks in general. Ss alternated sessions between conditions, but the criteria for advancement was independent between conditions. Measures of task performance and observational behavior data were collected. The results suggested that there was no overall difference in task performance between conditions but that the children as a group did exhibit more deviant behavior in the teacher  condition. Correlational analyses on these dependent measures suggested that different patterns of relationship exist between behavior and performance in the two conditions. In an attempt to identify critical variables for the prediction of individual differences in performance and behavior, the results of regression analyses on diagnoses, developmental measures, and pretest compliance measures are presented. Results are discussed in the context of the task avoidance and inadvertent reinforcement conceptualizations and the implications for computer-assisted instruction in the education and treatment of severely disturbed children.

A nonparametric test was significant for the group when the means for baseline and training were used to represent the data, but not when the slopes were used in the analysis. Because results were not consistent across all  children, it was suggested that future research focus on subject characteristics that may relate to the effectiveness of NDT. Additionally, recommendations were made regarding measurement systems for evaluating change, and strategies for investigating the NDT therapy package. (Author/CL)",

The quantitative portion included examination of pretest-posttest performance of 143 mildly handicapped children on six measures and a social knowledge assessment developed by researchers. A quasi-experimental design was employed for the quantitative section in which data were analyzed with the analysis of covariance. Significant differences favoring experimental children were found on the Matching Familiar Figures Test and the General Information Subtest of the Peabody Individual Achievement Test. Qualitative data were collected with modified participant observation and interview techniques. Strong  support was found for the research expectation that children taught with the Social Learning Curriculum would develop the ability to think critically; qualified support was found for the other three research expectations regarding the development of the ability to act independently, to comprehend the extrinsic value of schooling, and to develop more positive attitudes toward school.

Transcriptions of the interviews revealed parents' feelings towards needs assessment, service delivery, information, attitudinal, and situational factors. In addition, patterns and recurrent themes in parents' experiences were noted. Demographic findings revealed a picture that included strong perceptions of assertiveness and relatively high interest in child advocacy groups and national, state, and local associations. Among informational and situational barriers identified were transportation problems, sense of social isolation, and feelings of helplessness brought on by lack of education and lack of knowledge about available  services. Only 34% believed that there were community organizations successfully helping Black parents of handicapped children. While the majority of parents indicated satisfaction with the school programs of their children, parents were found to be acutely aware of shortcomings in their child's placements. A substantial minority (38.9%) indicated they were unfamiliar with P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and its provisions for handicapped children. Twelve recommendations were made, including emphasis on developing special information to be distributed in urban areas and training human service personnel to encourage parent involvement. (CL)",

Interviews focused on what parents do with their children, how they interact (the social-psychological family environment) as well as status characteristics in relation to their children's academic achievement. Among major findings was that the correlation of the overall family environment and academic achievement was not consistent across levels of status characteristics. Generally a more favorable learning environment predicted high achievement in academic content areas. Demographic variables, in order of the power and accuracy of the solutions, predicted high and low achievement better in reading comprehension than in math concepts.

Interviewers sought to analyze the interactions of medical, educational, and familial social systems regarding diagnosis and treatment of hyperactive children. Three questions were focused on: beliefs and attitudes of physicians, teachers, and parents concerning hyperactive children; role perceptions of teachers, parents, and physicians; and modes of social systems interaction in treatment. Interview schedules were developed, refined, and administered along with questionnaires. Findings are discussed in terms of prevalence of hyperactivity (substantially lower than comparable findings in the literature); parents', teachers', and physicians' perceptions  about the diagnosis and treatment of hyperactive children (including monitoring of children being treated with stimulant medication and the social psychological context); differing beliefs about and attitudes toward hyperactivity and stimulant medication treatment on the part of physicians, parents, and teachers (reflecting differences among social systems); the children's attitudes, perceptions, and experiences (including an overall positive view toward their medication); and parent, teacher, and physician roles in caring for hyperactive children (including disagreement over major responsibility). Analysis of dimensions of inclusion, dominance, and legitimacy in roles of parents, teachers, and physicians reveal areas of tension and incoherence in the three social systems. Policy  implications are noted regarding the controversy over hyperactivity and its treatment and social forces which hamper policy development.

Adaptive behavior of each S was also measured, as was teacher and school support for integration. Additional data were gathered from Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), measures of non-handicapped students' attitudes, state level information requested by the U.S. Department of Education, analysis of state certification practices, and responses to a previously conducted survey of state support for the severely handicapped. Results indicated that integration defined in terms of social behavior occurred in  each of the sites, with the degree of integration statistically related to information about six factors: antecedent factors of the state and local education agency, people present in the environment when integrated, organization of the environment, rate of social input from non-handicapped students, degree of support for interaction from the teacher, and the teacher's educational planning process. The social behavior of severely handicapped Ss differed depending on whether the behavior was directed to other severely handicapped students or to non-handicapped students. The degree of integration was related both to the proportion of objectives achieved on the target students' IEPs and to the attitudes of non-handicapped students. Effects on severely handicapped and non-handicapped students  revealed that integration can be a positive part of the educational program for severely handicapped students. (CL)",

        "description":"Treatment approaches (a behavioral program including both contingency management instruction for parents and self-control training for children, or either drug therapy or contingency management, alone) were compared for effectiveness in dealing with eight hyperactive children (7-10 years old). A self-control curriculum composed of self-direction, motor inhibition, attending (paying attention), and social problem solving was instituted, along with a 20 hour behavior management program for parents. An intensive time-series design was used to assess the effects of the two interventions relative to drug therapy. All Ss who received treatment were simultaneously withdrawn from medication; another two served as delayed treatment control Ss--no attempt was made to alter their usual  dosages of medication. Analysis of classroom observation and home behavior reports revealed that treated Ss displayed several patterns of change in classroom behavior. Two Ss were successful in withdrawing from medication, one S was withdrawn from 75% of original dosage without significant behavior change, another from 66% without change, and two from 50%. Ss displayed different responses to treatment on home behavior reports compared to school measures. Ss for whom behavioral treatment was most successful in controlling hyperactive behavior at school were not necessarily the same Ss showing the greatest improvement at home. Contrary to expectation, there was no evidence that self-control instruction for children added to the effects of child management classes for parents. Results  suggested that behavior therapy is an effective alternative to drug treatment for a significant proportion of hyperactive children. (CL)",

Year 1 focused on identifying and estimating the efficiency and effectiveness of practitioners' judgements regarding the instructional characteristics of materials and the adaptation of those materials to special education classrooms. The data confirmed the belief that &quot;hands-on&quot; activities result in more meaningful learning experiences for the teachers. In Year 2, observation of teachers supported the previous year's finding that participation in actual classroom trials with curriculum materials resulted in greater numbers of and more specific recommendations by teachers than participation in introductory or in-depth work  sessions. In the final year, Year 3, handbooks on adaptability of arts curricula were developed, and classroom trials were conducted in classrooms of students with orthopedic and multiple handicaps. Among findings were that a team approach in the classroom appeared to have a multiplier effect on adaptations and that single adaptations seemed appropriate for many kinds of students.

        "description":"The ability of 64 mildly mentally retarded students (10-17 years old) to judge the structural importance of idea units in prose was measured, and the relationship between the judgment of importance and the patternings of recall was compared. Ss were randomly assigned to one of five groups which were presented with a passage containing units with differing levels of structural importance and stimulus saliency. Treatment conditions differed as a function of whether students were given advance notice of the later recall task, whether importance ratings were required, and whether emphasis was given to the potential usefulness of the ratings in aiding recall. Analysis of variance indicated that Ss were significantly better at identifying low and medium importance units than in  identifying units of high importance. Analysis also revealed a main effect for the treatment condition. Recall was highest for the group which received advance notice of later recall, made importance ratings, and received strong emphasis on the potential usefulness of importance. Units rated as high in importance were recalled significantly better by the mentally retarded learners than medium or low importance units. It was concluded that mentally retarded learners could use differing importance levels in text to aid in recall provided that the learners were repeatedly instructed to differentiate among such levels.

Descriptions of the four students' behavior patterns demonstrate the social adjustments they employed in relations with their classmates. Behaviors presented by the four children included a reluctance to join previously established groups, leading to solitary play for long periods of time; reliance on compliance and helpfulness in ways that may limit the development of other approaches to handling interpersonal situations; preoccupation with dominating others; and excessive use of imagination as a social tool. Four teacher roles are outlined  that provide opportunities to guide children's social development, including: establishing classroom contexts, modeling appropriate behaviors, coaching effective strategies, and teaching social awareness. Applications of the teacher role-set ideas are demonstrated, using the four target children as examples. (JDD)",

        "description":"The manual is designed to help educators effectively integrate language and content instruction in teaching students who are learning through a language other than their native tongue. The manual is targeted at teachers, administrators, and teacher trainers involved in English-as-a-Second-Language or bilingual instruction and content-area instruction for limited-English-proficient students. The manual presents a whole educational approach to be used in elementary and secondary classrooms by both content-area and language teachers, and emphasizes collaboration between those two disciplines. In this approach, curriculum integration takes two general forms: (1) content material is incorporated into language classes, and (2) accommodation is made for students' limited English  proficiency in content classes. The guide provides information on the approach and its rationale, on specific strategies for integrating language and content instruction, and on specific techniques for adapting materials and for developing lesson plans. The guide also discusses key issues in implementation and outlines three major models for implementation: sheltered classes, integrated curricula, and the whole-school approach. A final section presents the agendas for four staff development workshops of varying lengths and focuses. Appended materials include subject-specific instructional strategy outlines, sample material adaptations and lesson plans, a list of further reading, and a glossary. (MSE)",

        "description":"Two-way, or bilingual, immersion education, a major innovation in the integration of language and content instruction, is intended to improve the quality of language education for language minority and language majority students in the United States. The emerging educational practice responds to the increasing proportions of language minority students in many parts of the country and also holds promise for improving the quality of foreign language instruction for language majority children. An introductory section describes the early Canadian experience with language and content integration, which began over 20 years ago, and discusses the benefits of bringing language majority and language minority students together in a single program of instruction (two-way, or bilingual,  immersion). The basic bilingual immersion program model is discussed, and related research is reviewed. Two exemplary programs, Arlington, Virginia's Key Elementary School and California's Edison Elementary School in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, are discussed. The report concludes that bilingual immersion education can be a powerful vehicle for promoting the development of bilingual language proficiency and social competence in elementary school children, and that the success of this approach depends largely on teachers' sensitivity to the children's language abilities and needs. 28 references.

        "description":"Research on second language learning has found similarities between the reading strategies of first and second language readers. These findings are being applied by second language instructors and researchers in reading classrooms through a variety of strategy-use activities. Most foreign language reading specialists view reading as interactive because the reader interacts with the text to create meaning. Both content schemata (background knowledge about the cultural orientation or content of a passage) and formal schemata (reader expectations about how pieces of textual information will relate to each other) influence the reader's comprehension of a passage. The instructor's role is to recognize that all reading strategies will not be equally effective with all students, and to  help the reader identify such effective reader strategies as skimming, scanning, guessing word meanings, summarizing, and taking risks. To encourage students to use effective strategies when reading in a second language, the teacher can develop simple exercises at each of the four stages of reading: (1) prereading; (2) while reading; (3) postreading; and (4) follow-up.

Two assessment models are described, that of the National Center for Research to Improve Postsecondary Teaching and Learning (NCRIPTAL) and that model developed by Conrad, et al. (1987). Existing assessment strategies in six professional schools at a major research university are examined in light of the Conrad model. The schools were found to meet the demands of the model in terms of collecting information about students, the campus environment and student outcomes, but the university was found wanting in the uses to which the assessment is put and in the lack of focus on the institutional environment's  effects on student learning and development. The accreditation process at the six schools is examined in its potential effects of strengthening programs, long-range planning and enhanced teaching and learning. The self-study aspect of accreditation is considered helpful in developing and coordinating assessment and in yielding information useful for assessment. Recommendations for improvements in assessing undergraduate professional education include: assessing general education (\"breadth of knowledge\"); the articulation of general abilities and characteristics common to most professional fields; further research; and more comprehensive assessment.

The first speaker, Harold Hodgkinson, discusses dramatic demographic trends, notably the huge increases in the numbers of minority students now in elementary schools who will soon enter higher education institutions. He emphasizes potential costs to society and education if states and institutions are unprepared. The second speaker, Anthony Carnevale, addresses the changing shape of the national economy and its relation to global economy. He identifies economic, human, and learning issues needing careful state and  institutional response. Panelists emphasize the need for western higher education to be ready to accommodate the economic and demographic realities thus identified. Issues to be addressed include the West's potential for economic diversification and the importance of maintaining the content and quality of the existing curriculum rather than changing it to fit special needs of minorities. The panelists recommended that individual institutions establish special programs to reach and retain minority students in secondary schools, and that the higher education and secondary education communities establish closer relations to ensure better prepared students.

        "author":["Earl, Archie W., Sr."],
        "description":"An examination of the effect of financial aid on college and university enrollment during a period of steady-state and decline is presented with a focus on the student's decision to go or not to go to college, to matriculate at a private or public college, to attend an in-state or out-of-state school, to transfer from a community college to a four-year college, or to go to graduate or professional school. Student financial aid is analyzed in terms of its effect on admissions policies, attrition and retention rates, stop-out rates, transfer rates, and graduate rates. Retrospective analysis is used to determine the effects, and literature related to student financial aid and published between 1970 and 1981 is reviewed. National, statewide, institutional, and districtwide studies  are included. Most studies using a national or statewise base find financial aid significantly affects enrollment in American colleges and universities. Funding for both private and public higher education is ultimately tied to enrollment. Financial aid has been found to be a significant factor in the recruitment and retention processes, and it also helps students decide whether to attend a public or private institution. It will become even more important as institutions of higher education dip deeper into the lower socioeconomic groups in order to compensate for predicted enrollment deficits. With enrollments and financial aid decreasing, many private institutions will be hard pressed to find students unless the trend is reversed. Contains 21 references. (SM)",

Results are presented by: statewide findings (upward trend in elementary algebra); college sectors; recent high school graduates (11-year trends, results by high school program, and high school mathematics and college proficiency); 1988 high school graduates and homework (amount of homework, homework and proficiency, and comparison of NJCBSPT data with National Assessment of Educational Progress findings); non-recent high school  graduates; and demographic information. The methods of disseminating study results are discussed, and outcomes of skills-deficient students in college are noted.

For years, faculty evaluation has carried the cachet of serving a useful purpose, but never before has it carried the make-or-break intensity it does on the campus today. How an institution appraises a professor's performance has assumed new importance since a professional life may depend on it. Significant study findings include the following: classroom teaching is the most important consideration in the evaluation of overall faculty performance; systematic student  ratings are the second most important information source in appraising classroom teaching performance, faculty committees are crucial in evaluating teaching; self-evaluation has picked up considerable support; and classroom visits have gained significantly in importance. Since 1983, only limited change has taken place in the evaluation of overall performance, but considerable change has occurred in the evaluation of classroom teaching. A direct outgrowth of improved evaluation practices will be improvement in teaching performance. Tables are included. (SM)",

        "description":"Information on a study examining the college choice process for academically talented students is presented, focusing on the University of Wisconsin (UW) System's recruitment of All State Academic Scholars. Recognition for academic excellence is the goal of their All State Scholars Program. UW is concerned about a brain drain from the state because nearly half of the 1987 All State Scholars chose to attend college outside Wisconsin. Virtually all researchers of college choice agree institutional characteristics are of primary importance in selecting a college, regardless of student academic ability, and financial constraints are secondary. Other factors include personal considerations, parents, campus qualities, and recruitment tactics. In the UW study, researchers interviewed  the 1987 Scholars about factors that helped determine their college choice, their high school programs and college preparation, and the All State Academic Scholars Program. They were asked to discuss family role, friends and counselors, college contacts, personal factors, high school preparation, Byrd Scholarship, recognition via the Scholars Program, family profiles, early plans and decisions, college reputation, and personal attention. Recommendations of the study include early recruitment, focused and direct marketing efforts, promoting academic reputation, employing a personal touch, stressing career interests, confronting the size issue, demystifying scholarships, assuring excellent high school preparation, and doing further research.

        "description":"A series of explorations of faculty goals drawn from a survey of academic careers is described, providing a view of academic career goals as the faculty see them. The study was conducted at a mid-sized comprehensive state university in the rural midwest. Data were collected as part of a 1984 survey of critical events in faculty careers. Faculty were asked to list their short-term and long-term goals and discuss their educational and career histories and provide such basic demographic data as age, sex, and marital status. Information was gathered on the following goals: educational, professional, curricular, teaching, research, writing and publishing, administrative, professional practice and service, retirement, and life away from work. Results include the following: faculty  share a common core of goals for professional advancement, research, writing and publishing, and teaching; the absence of goal differences on the basis of sex or marital status is notable; faculty of different ages and different stages of disciplinary, academic, and institutional tenure hold significantly different career goals; goals that are not closely linked to a particular career dimension may need to be studied from several perspectives; and a multidimensional approach to the study of academic careers offers a more complete picture of how faculty pursue professional goals. Appended are: statistics from the survey on faculty career goals; a correlation matrix for all variables considered in the analysis; and a table showing the average number of goals listed in each career stage.

        "description":"Data on how teaching effectiveness is affected by faculty incentive grants are presented based on a study of a faculty incentive program at Messiah College in Pennsylvania. Its &quot;Excellence in Teaching&quot; program offers awards of up to $5000 each annually to four faculty members based on student evaluations of teaching performance. Applicants must show evidence of effective advising, submit a course evaluation completed by a peer, and have a letter from the department chair indicating quality teaching and advising. They must also submit a proposal for how the money will be used (travel, research, or professional development project). Data for the statistical analysis were drawn from the faculty evaluation instrument Instructional Development and Effectiveness Assessment (IDEA). Each  faculty member must have two courses each semester evaluated via IDEA. Summary institutional data for 20 instructional categories provided by the IDEA system were interpreted to see if there was a change in teacher effectiveness ratings during the years the grant program had been in effect. Individual teaching effectiveness measures were compared during the grant program time. Qualitative data were drawn from 10 faculty interviews asking for impressions of the grant program. Results indicate the following: the introduction of the incentive program has had no significant impact on teaching effectiveness; informative use of such rewards may increase motivation; and the program reflects an institutional desire to increase publishable works by faculty. Tables and the questionnaire are  included. Contains 11 references. (SM)",

The historical approach provides a sense of continuity and direction, and historical perspectives offer necessary references for future curriculum study. Curriculum evaluation at the turn of this century emphasized the testing and measurement methodology as a kind of product control. Between 1930-1960, curriculum evaluation included a variety of evidence on student performance and program effectiveness. In the 1960s, the terms formative and summative were related to the evaluation process. By the early 1970s, researchers in the field emphasized the lack of balance between theoretical and empirical papers on curriculum evaluation, which led to determining curricular conditions  that affect the nature of evaluation and its limits. The idea of illuminative evaluation was introduced in the late 1970s. At this time, the trend in curriculum evaluation moved away from a formal model or recipe. This trend coincided with the accountability movement of the 1970s when society assigned increased responsibilities and resources to education. The importance of the ongoing process of critical review and revision was stressed in this period. In the 1980s, the search is for a qualitative analysis. One best system for doing curriculum development and evaluation has not proven to be a fruitful goal. Contains 18 references. (SM)",

Six sections focus on full-time student profile, full-time student performance, full-time student retention, part-time student profile, part-time student performance, and part-time student retention. Tables include age by gender, comparison by age, high school average, curriculum choices, grades in remedial courses, and retention 1986 and 1987. Three graphs are overall high school average, grade point average (GPA), and GPA and high school average. Significant findings include the following: 89% of all  full-time freshmen were under 21 years of age, and 90% lived with their parents; 70% of students who left the college were in academic difficulty after 1 year; retention of 1986 full-time freshmen after 2 years increased 4.2% over the previous 4-year period; there was an 8% increase in Technology/Engineering enrollments in 1987; 50% of part-time students attended classes during the day; and 75% of part-time students in remedial mathematics courses failed.

The problem of motivating professors and lecturers to teach effectively is especially acute there. The study focused on patterns of perceptions and behaviors of Nigerian lecturers that are indicators of effective teaching. Participants were 18 Nigerian lecturers and 855 of their students. Comparisons were made between lecturer and student characteristics involving philosophy of teaching, perceived rewards for achievements, professional goals and responsibilities, concepts of effective teaching, classroom teaching strategies, and learning outcomes expected. As a result of the study, identifiable portraits of typical  Nigerian lecturer motivational characteristics can be constructed. Significant differences were found between intentions of the institution, lecturer and student, and actual strategies and behaviors exhibited in the instructional process. In many areas approaches of the instructional participants were directly opposed. Results were consistent with theory or motivational factors leading to effective teaching. One exception involves teaching in very large classes. The results led to a series of decision and planning steps that directly affect the constructive coordination of instructional activities. They provide a model for fostering motivation in similar settings. Contains 25 references and 13 tables. (SM)",

        "description":"Designed to promote the interchange of information and services among the people of the region, the Eastern Caribbean Center Telecommunications Project Network (ECCTP) utilizes a network of both audio and computer-linked nodes connected by telephone lines to deliver instruction to remote sites. This network has been used by ECCTP to conduct experiments in long-distance teaching from the spring of 1986 to the present. Although most of these experimental classes have consisted of computer-oriented content, such as elementary BASIC programming, classes have also been taught in biology, English, and remedial mathematics. Classes are taught simultaneously at a home site and at a distant site, e.g., a class being presented by an instructor in a classroom on the St. Croix campus of the  University of the Virgin Islands is transmitted to a classroom on the St. Thomas campus, and students at both sites participate in the class. A series of four pilot tests encountered various technical problems and identified a need for more careful pre-instructional planning than traditional classroom teaching. Areas that must be considered in planning for the actual provision of instruction include the relationship of teaching to the instructional objectives, the motivation of students, the monitoring of student learning, managing classroom activities, modeling, and technical capabilities. After the class has been taught, post-instruction evaluation must also be addressed. (EW)",

This state of affairs in schooling is due to several factors: (1) efforts to make schooling less stuffy and mechanical and more like life; (2) science as a cultural force, and particularly the influence of child psychology; (3) science as constant innovation or a collection of new methods, new research, and new fads, and in particular, explicit psychology and an emphasis on testing and measurement; and (4) a discontinuity in curriculum, including too many disparate subjects of study. One particular example is the current emphasis on the teaching of  critical thinking, which is not itself a subject. Instead, schooling must be seen as the removal of ignorance without killing curiosity, and a new effort must be made to define a school subject. It is often forgotten that a school subject must be teachable. These subjects must then be given some unity, with a permanent aim to be the increasing of students' attention spans. As William James once noted, schoolwork is hard, and there is no way to make it easy and \"natural.\" School work must be restored so as to recapture minds, with teachers teaching rather than innovating and distracting.

        "description":"Since the early 1980s the evolution of computer mediated communications (CMC) systems designed to support collaborative work has been characterized by two trends. One is the proliferation of new systems to take advantage of technological changes; the second is the incorporation of functionality into highly specialized or tailored application oriented systems. TEIES (Tailorable Electronic Information Exchange System) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology is an example of such a system. It has been designed to be integrated with other computer resources and to allow individuals and groups to tailor the system to their application needs. It is also designed to serve the frequent user who is using CMC for a significant part of his or her daily communications. The TEIES effort  represents a new generation of CMC software that will allow the design, development, and evaluation of tailored collaborative systems. It provides the toolbox to overcome the tremendous programming bottleneck present in the development of collaborative systems. The forms-based interface for TEIES and the open ended concepts of privileges, roles, activities, group sharing, and notifications allow change to the interface or to the basic metaphor of the communications process and associated list processing.

        "description":"A survey of computer usage in 179 randomly selected public elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana was conducted in the spring of 1988. School principals responded to questions about school size, the socioeconomic status of the student population, the number of teachers certified in computer literacy and computer science, and the number of teachers who received inservice training in computer usage. Key computer-using teachers answered more specific questions about resources, personnel, location of computers, funding sources, and access by various student groups. A comparison of the available resources to the national average in 1985 indicated a lag in the acquisition of equipment. The mean number of computers per school was found to be 21.5 with a range of 1 to 99; roughly  half of the computers were Apples or Apple compatible. Most schools owned peripherals such as printers and color monitors, but input devices such as light pens, joysticks, and &quot;mice&quot; were uncommon. The most common computer software resources were word processing, tutorial, and drill and practice packages. The primary sources of funding were vocational education on the secondary level and special education at the elementary level. Most of the computers were located in learning laboratories or in special or vocational education classrooms and departments, with regular students having little access to these computers unless they participated in a computer course offered in the lab. Certified teachers in computer literacy and computer science were scarce in both settings. (4 figures and 8  tables; 4 references) (EW)",

Two major project activities are described. One of the activities consisted of designing expert solutions to computer programming problems in order to communicate the techniques used by experts to solve programming problems. Designed to evaluate the effectiveness of these expert solutions, the other activity consisted of contrasting three educationally defensible  alternatives for using these approaches and assessing the relative effectiveness of these approaches in 14 pre-college classrooms. The findings of this assessment are reported: students either completed all three activities or one of the three; there were significant differences between the three different conditions for using the expert solution; and students learned more about programming when they participated in all activities from writing the program to reading the expert solution. Relationships between performance on the case study and the instructional provisions in the classroom were also assessed, and three factors were found to contribute to student learning: (1) access to computers; (2) feedback on student work; and (3) individual and small group assistance by the teacher. The  project report contains four references, and the annotated bibliography contains 35 references. (EW)",

        "description":"The Computer-Based Memorization System (CBMS), which specifies the facts that students are to know and how well the facts are to be known, uses a compiled form of an associative network for its knowledge database. (An associative network is a knowledge representation that uses associations for its basic representation of knowledge.) The CBMS provides eight computer games which use randomness and scoring to make the memorization more interesting. In addition, the games create and modify a file containing a model of the student's current knowledge of the material in the database. When the data in this file shows that a student knows a particular fact, the games stop asking questions about that fact. Three additions to the use of associative nets have been made in this system: (1)  importance values had to be associated with items and statements to permit authors to emphasize features and support files containing models of students' knowledge; (2) pictures had to be associated with items; and (3) groups of anticipated answers had to be associated with items to allow a range of acceptable student answers. With these changes, computer-based memorization systems appear to be an effective tool for the mastery of factual knowledge. (4 figures and 12 references) (EW)",

Questionnaires were sent to all faculty and academic and administrative departments, and 130 responses were received from faculty, 33 from academic departments, and 47 from administrative departments. The data indicate that at least 120 faculty had access to personal computers, and that there were 116 personal computers in academic departments and 95 in administrative departments. The dominant faculty software packages were MacWrite and Microsoft Word for the MacIntosh and Multimate and Word Perfect for the IBM PC. For the academic departments the prominent software packages were MacWrite, Microsoft World,  and Multimate. Among the administrative departments there was little use of the MacIntosh, and among the IBM PC users the primary package was Multimate. The top priority of the Word Processing Center was grant proposals, and it appeared that there were few problems, if any, with the faculty over the established and publicized priorities. The Center now uses the HP3000 and software TDP (Text and Document Processor). However, this software is not very user friendly, and it is suggested that a major portion of the faculty would be aided significantly by the center's ability to utilize microcomputers in their work in support of the faculty. Eight recommendations are provided, including purchase of microcomputers, standardization of word processing software, and the introduction of some new  services. The text is supplemented by 37 tables, and appendixes provide supporting documents and copies of the survey instruments. (EW)",

        "description":"This report introduces the concept of a &quot;metacourse&quot;--i.e., the provision of mental models, problem solving strategies, key concepts, and other structures--to assist students in learning programming, and examines the effect of the use of such a metacourse on high school programming students. The experimental group consisted of 6 teachers who taught BASIC programming to 132 students at 5 high school laboratory sites, and the control group consisted of 9 teachers who taught 239 students at 8 control sites. The metacourse consisted of a series of eight instructional lessons interspersed throughout the semester. Students were given both pretests and posttests in cognitive skills, and observations of the experimental sites were also made. After examining these data, a second revised  metacourse was developed and used with nine other teachers in seven new sites under conditions that more normally duplicate normal classroom innovations. The results showed that both the laboratory site and classroom site students who were exposed to the metacourse experienced significant improvement in their mastery of the BASIC programming language. However, the modest evidence of &quot;transfer&quot; skills found in the laboratory site was not evident in the second study under more normal classroom conditions. This suggests that transfer from programming is not normally obtained unless special efforts are made to explicitly design such elements into the intervention. Appended materials include the cognitive pretest/posttest, a test on BASIC, and a classroom observation worksheet. (34 references)  (EW)",

        "description":"With videodisc still two to five years away from adoption in mainstream schools, it is now time to step back and assess how this new media can best serve teachers and learners. This assessment begins with informal profiles of videodisc use patterns in a variety of school classrooms and analyses of the key factors underlying these early and often experimental uses. This study shows two interconnected variables at work when schools use videodisc: those related to the disc itself and those related to the classroom or school environment. The design approach embedded in a videodisc influences how adaptable a disc is to a variety of classroom purposes. The ways teachers and students use videodisc is influenced by three major factors: the teaching and learning activity undertaken; the  degree of access to videodisc equipment; and school-wide attitudes toward teaching with technology. It is concluded that videodisc can promote understanding through active inquiry when it offers flexible and open-ended design and opportunities for teachers and students to choose, explore, and manipulate videodisc images. Based on variables related to both videodisc design and educational context, ways for secondary school teachers and students to take best advantage of what is uniquely useful about videodisc technology are suggested.

Eight additional topics are then addressed: (1) information as a commodity; (2) marketing and the trend toward privatization of  information; (3) user needs in a marketing context--how information is made available to the user/consumer; (4) fee-based versus free information services--the public-private sector competition; (5) the new intermediary role--information brokers, consultants, counselors; (6) types of fee-based information services; (7) a brief history of four decades of fee-based information services; and (8) end user online searching versus the intermediary role.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) to determine the comparability of the two tests used in Florida to assess students' entry-level skills, the Florida Multiple Assessment Programs and Services (MAPS) battery and the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The study also sought to determine the effect of altering SAT cutoff scores at MDCC in accordance with state guidelines. The MAPS and SAT scores of students who had taken both tests were analyzed. For the most part, these students' combined math and verbal scores on the SAT were not sufficiently high by MDCC standards to exempt them from taking the MAPS for course placement. Study findings, based on the scores of 4,718 students, included the following: (1) of the 1,976 students whose scores on the verbal  section of the SAT met the minimum state requirement, only 12.6% failed to meet the minimum MAPS reading score required to enter college-level courses; (2) of the 2,742 students identified by the verbal section of the SAT as needing college preparatory courses, 47.3% were not so identified by the MAPS reading subtest; and (3) of the 3,251 students who failed to reach the state cutoff score for college-level skills on the SAT math test, 37.4% were identified as needing remedial math courses by the MAPS and 62.6% were placed by the MAPS in college-level math courses. Based on study findings, it was concluded that it was easier for students to achieve the minimum MAPS scores than the minimum SAT scores, leading to the recommendation that either the SAT minimum scores be lowered or the MAPS  scores raised to reduce the disparity between the two tests.

The study sought to determine the numbers of students who retook the exam and ultimately passed all four parts, those who retook the exam and still did not pass all four parts, and those who did not retake the exam. Data from the MDCC CLAST research file were supplemented with state CLAST data to identify students who retook the CLAST at other institutions. Study findings, which included comparisons with results from a  similar study conducted in 1984, revealed the following: (1) of the 278 students who took the CLAST for the first time in fall 1986 and failed, 67.2% retook the exam at MDCC or another school during the following year and passed, and 16.2% retook it and failed again; (2) considering only MDCC testing data, the number of students who retook the CLAST increased from 66% in 1984 to 77.7% in 1986; and (3) combining the percentages of students who passed the CLAST the first time and those who passed it the second time, the ultimate pass rates were 86% for the 1984 group and 90.8% for the 1986 group.

Part 2 focuses on credit instruction and degree programs, including data on enrollment by program type, cooperative education, programs projected for fall 1990 to fall 1994, and degrees and other formal awards  granted in 1988. Survey findings are presented on students' perceptions of the quality of HCC, graduates' goal achievement, and employers' ratings of HCC graduates. After part 3 presents information on continuing education sites and enrollments, part 4 offers faculty data, including trends in ratios of full- to part-time faculty and student credit hours taken to faculty credit hours taught, and 1989 salary ranges. Finally, part 5 looks at the community's use of HCC facilities and part 6 provides data on the college's proposed operating budget for 1990, sources of revenue, projected changes in revenue sources, unmet needs for student financial aid, and tuition.

        "description":"In response to recent increases in the enrollment of Hispanic students at Rancho Santiago College, a study was conducted to examine the grades and course completion rates of students with Hispanic surnames enrolled in English classes. Three English courses were studied: English 060, which provides a thorough review of English grammar and punctuation and emphasizes short papers; English 061, which provides instruction and practice in writing well-developed paragraphs in a variety of modes; and English 101, Freshman Composition. All students with Hispanic surnames were identified on the spring 1987 rosters for these courses, and their final grades were determined. Study findings included the following: (1) 40% of the 415 students on the rosters for English 060 had Hispanic  surnames; of these 45% withdrew from class, 24% received credit for the class, and 31% received no credit; (2) 34% of the 476 students enrolled in English 061 were Hispanic; of these, 33% withdrew from class, 46% received credit, and 21% received no credit; (3) a section of English 061 with special support services for Hispanic students had a 100% completion rate, with 86% of the students receiving credit; (4) 23% of the 686 students enrolled in Freshman Composition were Hispanic; of these 34% withdrew; and (5) rates of persistence were comparable for Hispanic and non-Hispanic students in English 060 and 061, but success rates were lower for Hispanic students in all three courses.

During fall 1988, a study was conducted to measure the effect of this intervention strategy on grades and persistence. Of the 106 students who received two or more F's, Incompletes, or Y's (abandonment grades) at mid-term, 54 were sent a letter explaining the significance of their grades and encouraging them to consult with their advisor or division chair or to complete the formal withdrawal process if they did not intend to complete the semester. Study findings included the following: (1) half of the students who received the letters and half of those who did  not acted upon their mid-semester grades by exercising the college's course withdrawal option or by improving their grades; (2) the students who received the letters had a higher number and ratio of withdrawal grades than those who were not contacted; (3) among students who did not withdraw, both groups showed similar final grade distributions; (4) both the students who received the letters and those who did not had significantly more Y grades at the end of the semester than at mid-semester; (5) students who received the letters had a 61% fall-to-spring persistence rate, while those who did not had a persistence rate of 44%; and (6) of the 106 students in academic jeopardy at mid-term, 50 received letters of academic censure at the end of the semester.

Study findings included the following: (1) during any particular academic term, occupational/technical students constituted approximately one-third of all curricular students and full-time equivalents at PVCC; however, they made up nearly two-thirds of all PVCC graduates; (2) in 1988, nearly one-third of the occupational/technical students were enrolled in the Business and Management program, with the next largest programs being Nursing and Computer Information Systems; (3) five of the college's nine Associate in Applied Science degree programs fulfilled the state  standard of at least seven graduates per year, with the Nursing program producing an average of 41 per year; and (4) generally, the growth rates and job opportunities in occupations for which PVCC provides occupational/technical training were quite high, though the Respiratory Therapy program appeared to graduate more students than there were available jobs.

        "description":"As the number of working women with young children continues to grow, the demand for affordable, high quality child care increases as well. Existing licensed centers and family day care programs can only accommodate 2.5 million children, while 10.5 million children under the age of 6 have working mothers. The quality of child care programs has a definite and lasting effect on children's academic and social development, and the most important ingredients of that care are affection and respect in the interaction between the child and the child care provider. Many segments of society will need to work together to create a comprehensive system of quality care. Currently, an increasing number of companies are establishing work and family policies such as parental leave and more  flexible time policies. Many assist their employees in paying for child care through flexible spending accounts, while others have initiated on-site child care centers. The Federal Government provides $6 billion in child care assistance and has recently introduced nearly 100 bills (including the Act for Better Child Care) which focus on or include some provisions for child care. State and local governments are also capable of making important contributions by assisting low-income parents and supporting quality centers. Ultimately, all who have a stake in quality child care must become involved. (AYC)",

        "description":"The failure to include scholarship in the community college philosophy is a flaw that diminishes the colleges' status within higher education. A commitment to scholarship by community college professionals requires a broader definition of the term to include not only research that results in published articles, but any systematic pursuit of a topic, objective, or rational inquiry that involves critical analysis. Given this definition, the majority of community college professionals should be engaging in scholarship. Community colleges have given too little attention to scholarship for reasons that include the following: (1) in their zeal to call attention to the community college as a teaching institution, its supporters have failed to acknowledge the vital link between teaching  and scholarship; (2) community colleges have rarely recognized and rewarded scholarly activities; (3) presidents and deans of instruction have generally failed to emphasize scholarship in their own roles; (4) many community college professionals do not realize that their obligation to the profession goes beyond their obligation to the job; and (5) faculty and administrators have rarely engaged in systematic approaches to the evaluation and improvement of teaching that extend beyond individual classrooms. Community colleges must overcome these barriers and demonstrate their ability to critically review and analyze the issues facing them if they are to receive community support, funding, and ultimately, students. Including scholarship as an important part of a college's rewards, tenure,  promotion, and release time is an obvious first step in enhancing scholarship. Faculty and administrators should take the scholarship of teaching seriously. In so doing, they will enhance the standing and respectability of community colleges. (ALB)",

        "author":["Vaughan, George B."],
        "description":"Community colleges have always embraced general education in principle, but have largely failed to deliver a meaningful program of general studies. Definitions of general education stress the importance of teaching the common knowledge, cultural and environmental understanding, skills, values, and attitudes needed by each individual to be an effective family and community member, worker, citizen, and consumer. If these goals continue to be ignored, the majority of the people of this country will find themselves technologically and civically illiterate, while a small cadre of specialists will control knowledge and thus the decision-making processes. Why then, given the importance of general education and the risks inherent in ignoring it, have most community colleges fared so  poorly in providing it? First, most technical curricula require so many credit hours that there is little time to devote to general education. Second, most community colleges have accepted a distribution model of general education that fails to build bridges between the disciplines. Third, most administrators are reluctant to devote the necessary time to restructuring the curriculum. Fourth, the colleges' heavy reliance upon part-time faculty has hurt attempts to bring coherence to the curriculum. And finally, too often general education is confused with the liberal arts, and especially the humanities. Steps that can be taken to develop a meaningful program of general education include the following: (1) campus leaders must believe that general education is critical to the well-being of  the campus, community, nation, and world; (2) every campus should devise its own definition of general education and develop and publish a plan for putting that definition into operation; (3) leaders should involve all segments of the college, including the governing board, in curriculum development; (4) colleges should obtain external funding; and (5) colleges ought to work with four-year institutions to ensure that the general education program articulates with their undergraduate requirements.

Comparisons are drawn with respect to the following: (1) the cognitive and affective scope of developmental education; (2) interdisciplinary and integrated approaches to basic skills instruction; (3) recognition of individual differences among students; (4) use of educational technologies; (5) appropriate criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of developmental education; (6) the number of developmental programs and services; and (7) changing demands of developmental programs. The paper concludes that several aspects of developmental  education have not changed perceptibly in the past 30 years, including the emphasis on the student as a whole, the integration of programs across disciplines, and the individualization of services to specific students. Highlighted changes include advances in educational technology, though the paper notes that the trend toward the use of available technologies was evident in the 1950s; more sophisticated evaluation criteria and methodologies; significant increases in the number of community colleges providing a full range of developmental services; and the modification of the scope of these services in response to fiscal and political conditions.

Students enrolled in English for Effective Communication (EEC I) were divided into three groups: a control group that did not use the computer at all; a group who had access to Apple IIe computers equipped with Bank Street Writer II word processing software; and a computer group using Bank Street and Writer's Helper, software which guides the students through the entire writing process. At the end of Winter 1989, after 7 of the 11 quarters of the study had been completed, 698 students had enrolled in EEC I. Study findings, based on students' essays, freshman English entrance examination  scores, and course evaluations, included the following: (1) the control and Writer's Helper groups had the highest average scores on the first of the four major papers in EEC I, while the Bank Street Writer group had the highest percentage passing the entrance exam; (2) only 27.4% of the students had no prior computer experience; (3) while students felt that using the computer in composition courses was enjoyable, helpful, and increased their self-confidence, they were significantly less willing to grant that computer use contributed to their skill in writing; (4) the two computer groups rated both their instructors and courses more highly than did the control group; and (5) students were reluctant to use the computer for intellectual experimentation, valuing it more for its convenience.  Tentative conclusions suggest that computer use may affect students' attitudes more than their writing performance. (ALB)",

Part 1 focuses on the adaptation of organizational life cycle theory to community colleges. Building upon a broadened definition of human development and the related hierarchy of learning needs, it presents a conceptual framework for renewal that points toward conformed mission; holistic leadership; emphasis on organizational climate; staff development; resource reallocation; curriculum currency; collaboration; enhancing the college's reputation; needs-based marketing; student development; interactive communication; and evaluating value. Seven goals are proposed for an immediate agenda: (1) improving academic  quality and overall mission effectiveness; (2) fostering an environment which supports innovation, risk taking, and superior service; (3) developing the institution's resource base; (4) pursuing partnerships which will expand or improve programs and services; (5) enhancing institutional reputation and credibility; (6) monitoring environmental conditions to assess emerging needs; and (7) evaluating current activities for appropriateness and level of performance. Part 2 presents a model for educational excellence. It cites criteria of excellence used in corporations and educational institutions, offering a model that links the two sets of criteria in three conceptual layers: organizational climate, including leadership, communication, motivation, and recognition; organizational performance,  involving innovation, superior services, and social responsibility; and organizational purpose. A modification of this model to reflect the student viewpoint is presented next. In this model, campus climate, student performance, and student outcomes are defined as criteria for excellence.

The first section considers trends that will affect the county's ability to build a sound economic base, such as the transition from manufacturing toward service industries in a county where more than 40% of the workforce is currently employed in the manufacturing sector. This section also considers the potential use of the county's strong manufacturing infrastructure to create more service sector jobs, such as drafting and design, computer programming, software design, and  financial services. The next section focuses on educational considerations, including: (1) the relationship between educational attainment and earning potential; (2) increasing demands for an educated, rather than skilled, workforce; (3) educational levels in Macomb County; (4) the skill levels of new entrants into the manufacturing workforce; and (5) retraining the existing workforce and all displaced workers. Following a section that describes the demographic make-up of the workforce in the year 2000, the paper closes with a discussion of ways of attracting new business to Macomb County. An appendix lists 30 job training and retraining programs in Macomb County. (AYC)",

        "description":"The Macomb Plan, recently developed by Macomb Community College (MCC), is a delivery system for the final two years of a four-year college degree to be housed in a facility located on a two-year college campus. The plan is designed to meet the unique needs of an adult learner's lifestyle, while approximating most of the elements that make up the college experience. Under the Macomb Plan, the community college acts in partnership with four-year colleges and universities, which are under contract to provide bachelor's degree programming in accordance with community educational needs. A baccalaureate center, operated by the community college but with a distinct appearance and identity, provides many of the academic facilities and offices found at a senior institution (e.g., study  areas, counseling offices, computer and science labs, and classrooms). Students can enroll at MCC and later apply for transfer, enter MCC as freshmen with dual admission to the four-year institition, or enroll directly into a senior institution as juniors or seniors if lower division credits have already been earned. Faculty are employees of the college offering the coursework; that is, MCC faculty teach MCC classes, while senior college faculty teach upper-division courses. The Macomb Plan is unique to the state and possibly the nation in that for the first time, the local citizens voted to create a bachelor's degree granting facility within their own community and authorized the funds to build and operate it through their local community college. Information on the growing numbers of  adult learners, their educational needs, and the development of the Macomb Plan is provided. (AYC)",

They are divided into two sections: (1) a good start for babies and young children; and (2) a fair chance for families. The first section highlights preventive strategies and suggests proposals for medical insurance for uninsured pregnant women to reduce the need for neonatal intensive care, prenatal care to reduce childhood disabilities and infant death, decent preschools to help disadvantaged children  reach first grade on a par with their peers, and adequate funding for Illinois schools. The second section includes recommendations for an economic strategy in addition to tax credit and welfare grant proposals.

Four dimensions are reported: (1) parental beliefs about child development; (2) aspects of the baby's physical and social environment, including number of caretakers, crowding of the dwelling, sleeping arrangement, visits outside the home, available toys, etc.; (3) maternal perception of the infant temperament; and (4) assessment of the infant's development. A total of 22 Haitian, 21 Quebeckers, and 20 Vietnamese 9-month-old first-born babies and their mothers participated in the study and were visited twice at their homes by a research assistant belonging to their cultural group. Results indicated several significant  differences between groups in parental beliefs, in the way the mothers structure the environment and in their perception of infant temperament. Several similarities were found between the Vietnamese and the Haitians, suggesting that at least during the infancy period child care practices and parental beliefs are related more to the economic level of society than the cultural level. Consonance among the different components of the developmental context and their respective relation to some ecological aspects of the immigrant group are discussed. (Author/RH)",

It was hypothesized that if dialectical reasoning were taught directly as a goal-specific strategy, the quality of instructed students' essays would exceed the quality of essays by non-instructed control students assisted by prompts. Participants were 45 middle-school students. The experimental curriculum contained six lessons distributed during social studies classes. Control subjects read and wrote mystery stories. Subjects were told to compose paragraphs stating  their position, giving reasons for the position, giving reasons supporting the opposite position, and coming to a conclusion. Content analysis techniques were used to score the essays. Findings indicated that with minimal scaffolding on the assessment, most 6th-grade students could produce dialectical reasoning on a novel controversy about which they had some general knowledge. Minimal scaffolding at time of assessment had as much impact on production of dialectical reasoning as did explicit instruction designed according to principles generated by recent strategy instruction research.

The day after play attendance 15-minute interviews were conducted with the children. The children: (1) rated the difficulty in understanding the plays; (2) told what they remembered best and what they learned; (3) sequenced central actions of plots; (4) inferred the plays' main ideas and the protagonists' intentions and emotions; (5) recalled specific dialogue; and (6) reported their preference between theatre and television. The findings indicated  that visual cues, primarily dramatic actions, are most easily recalled and assist children in making inferences about main ideas and protagonists' intentions. Moreover, children's attention to dialogue and aural cues further enhances comprehension and ease of understanding plays. In other words, children do listen to plays, as long as the dialogue informs and reinforces visualized dramatic actions throughout the performance. In addition, the findings indicate that the given stimulus determines the nature of how it is processed. (RJC)",

Data suggest that by the time the children are 3-year-olds they have encountered several instances of verbs that alternate between active and absolutive forms, which may supply the evidence needed to formulate a general rule. Lack of errors in children's language production indicates that the children were extremely sensitive to the formal properties of the absolutive antipassive. They do not simply assume that every verb they meet in a transitive context is transitive. Yet, to acquire the absolutive antipassive, K'iche' children face three major hurdles. The first is learning that root transitive verbs can have intransitive  forms, i.e., the absolutive alternation. The second is learning which verbs do not undergo the absolutive alternation. And the third is learning which intransitive verbs are root or derived. The last two problems cannot be solved from positive evidence alone. Nor are conservative acquisition procedures likely to be the explanation, given the propensity of children learning English to generalize beyond verb forms they have already heard. While this report does not explain how K'iche' children formulate a properly restricted rule for the absolutive antipassive, it does show that the absolutive raises learnability problems of the same level as the English dative or causative.

The model posited that family patterns of violent behavior predict general behavioral disturbance in the children and provide behavioral models for children's adoption of aggressive behavior. The model further suggests that the aggressive behavior that the children exhibit to peers largely accounts for the abused children's lowered social status among peers. And finally it suggests that the generally high level of behavioral disturbance found in abused children has far-reaching and pervasive effects on the children's functioning in areas over and  above those having to do with their social status. Results from the study in progress, based on 78 pairs of children, were consistent with the proposed model. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Addressing a common problem in the analysis of social networks, this study describes quantitative techniques for identifying social subgroups using individual perceptions of social affinities within natural groups. Compared are four analytic methods for abstracting composite representations of sub-structures. These methods, formally evaluated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (LISREL IX), are illustrated with a class of 20 seventh-graders enrolled in a regular junior high school. The convergence of the different quantitative techniques towards the same structural representation points to the robustness of the social cognition method for the description of social networks. More than robust, the social cognitive procedure is simple and readily applicable in a wide variety of  settings. The approach has several additional positive features. It permits analysis to systematically address the questions of cluster sizes and composition, cluster coherence, and dual memberships. Such comparative analyses are especially useful for tracing developmental changes in the nature of prosocial ties within stable peer groups. (RH)",

        "description":"A total of 60 infants of 7 weeks of age were tested in a habituation-dishabituation looking procedure to determine if they could discriminate between infant-directed talk (IDT) and adult-directed talk (ADT) uttered by the same speaker. One group of 12 infants was habituated to a female speaker's ADT and dishabituated to the same speaker's IDT, while another group was treated in the reverse order. Two other groups were presented with auditory stimuli, but with a male speaker's voice. One control group was tested with the female IDT in habituation and dishabituation phases. Observers measured the amount of time infants looked at a visual stimulus, a black and white checkerboard pattern, which was presented simultaneously with the auditory stimuli. Results showed that babies of 7  weeks were able to discriminate between speech directed towards adults and that directed towards infants, whether it was delivered by a male or a female. Findings also indicated that 7-week-old infants preferred IDT over ADT, regardless of speaker's sex. Preferences, however, were not as robust as those found among 4-month-old infants. It is concluded that research can now move toward investigation of the effect of differential experiences with IDT on infant preference. Implications are discussed. (RH)",

The sample included 343 white and 181 black youth. Focusing on the comparative contribution of the family as a context for adolescent educational and occupational attainment, results of path analysis for occupational attainment revealed a differential pattern of direct effects for black and white adolescents. For black adolescents, the contribution of the family exerted a more substantial direct effect on occupational attainment than for white adolescents. Comparison of the total effects on occupational attainment also confirmed the stronger influence of the family for black adolescents. The influence of  the family on educational attainment was also found to be substantial for black youth. Comparison of total effects on educational attainment indicated a strong family influence for white adolescents and an even stronger influence for black adolescents. It is concluded that there is no evidence to support the stereotypical view of the black family as inadequate or dysfunctional. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that a dynamic and vital black family unit exists which exerts a substantial influence on the occupational and educational attainment of black children/adolescents.

        "description":"Examined were the development and correlates of children's strategies for resisting maternal control. Subjects were 51 dyads consisting of depressed or nondepressed mothers and their young. Children were 1.5 to 3.5 years of age at first observation and 5 years old during the second. Data on parent and child behaviors were coded from 9 hours of videotapes of spontaneous interactions. Active and passive forms of noncompliance were distinguished; active noncompliance behaviors were also coded in terms of their quality as interpersonal influence strategies. Findings indicated that developmental changes in children's responses to control were consistent with a perspective on noncompliance that emphasizes children's growth as autonomous agents and developing social skills. Aversive  strategies such as passive noncompliance and direct defiance decreased with age while relatively more sophisticated forms of resistance, simple refusal and negotiation, increased with age. Both compliance and quality of noncompliance were predictable over time. Children 5 years of age who used skillful forms of noncompliance tended to use skillful strategies when making requests. At both ages only unskillful forms of noncompliance were related to maternal perceptions of children's maladjustment. During toddlerhood only unskillful forms of noncompliance were associated with observed negative affect in the mother. Overall, boys used more defiance and refusals than girls. Girls were more compliant than boys in families with well mothers. (Author/RH)",

Families were participants in the Michigan State University Longitudinal Study, into which were recruited all drunk drivers convicted in local district courts who had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent or higher and who had a biological 3- to 6-year-old son living with them. Despite meticulous neighborhood searches, findings showed that the socioeconomic status (SES) of control families was significantly higher than alcoholic families, as were Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) inventory ratings. Findings indicated that the overall  developmental quotient and personal social development of control boys was significantly more advanced than that of the high-risk boys when SES and/or HOME scores were not considered. Analyses of developmental data with SES as a covariate resulted in less significant differences between the groups. Most significantly, when HOME scores were considered as a covariate, all differences disappeared. Demonstrating the impact of the quality of the home environment on development, findings indicated that paternal alcohol problems affect the cognitive and motor development of preschoolers only when they are sufficiently disruptive to degrade aspects of the family environment related to early intellectual development.

Findings indicated that gender was not the best predictor of career  or family values. Subjects sex-typed as masculine and androgynous significantly valued a career more than did the undifferentiated type. Females expressed a greater interest in a career and valued a career more than did males. Females sex-typed as masculine were found to value a family significantly less than all other females.

According to the latest figures available from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the United States (NEISS), more than 11,800 stroller injuries in 1987 were serious enough to require treatment in hospital emergency facilities. Approximately 10,300 of these injuries were suffered by children less than 4 years of age. Again, according to NEISS, more than 20,700 walker injuries in 1987 required emergency treatment. Almost all of the victims were children under 2 years of age. Results of research on walker-related injuries suggest that at least 36 percent of all children using walkers experience a fall  while using them. While many of these mostly preventable accidents result in subclinical injuries that are not reported, when injuries do occur, head trauma is the most frequent. Discussion gives emphasis to prevention and recommendations are offered for the safe utilization of these devices. It is concluded that increased caregiver awareness of the need for safety precautions in the child-care environment could reduce the frequency of stroller- and walker-related accidents, and information on the safe use of these products should be incorporated into the standard information regarding accident prevention that might be made available to staff and parents.

        "description":"Three kindergarten children and one first-grade student used computer programs to spell words in isolation and in stories they wrote. Eventually, all of the children, even those who were initially non-readers, were able to write some stories in standard spelling. As the children made progress toward writing words in conventional spelling, they showed evidence of developing phonological spelling strategies similar to those that have previously been reported for children using paper and pencil. At the same time, however, children also showed evidence of developing visual spelling strategies in more detail than has previously been reported. In particular, evidence was found of visual spelling strategies occurring before the transitional stage in which they had previously been seen.  Evident patterns of spelling development were more consistent with multidirectional than with unidirectional views of written language development. Findings suggested that computer programs are a viable option for teachers who wish to develop the visual spelling strategies of young children. Children's visual classifications are discussed in detail, focusing on visual categories, analogical wholes, analogical parts, standard spelling of a significant segment, letter reversals, visual and semiphonetic categories in the same phase, visual and phonetic categories in the same phase, and sequences with visual categories.

The tasks included carrying water without spilling, tracking, nesting cups, handling blocks according to a rule, and pouring a specified amount of water into a funnel. The results indicated that task success increased with age: 2-year-olds were successful on about a quarter of the tasks, the older children on three quarters.

The following assessment instruments were used: Schaefer's (1979) Locus of Control Inventory to measure parental locus of control; Paul's Home Support Inventory to measure interpersonal support; The Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of Learning to measure the child's level of functioning; and the Preschool Version of the Classroom Behavior Inventory to measure the child's social competence as assessed by teachers and parents. One of the major findings of this study was that the child's development of social competence is interrelated with the dimensions of his or her  development and ecology. In addition, locus of control appears to influence the way parents view their children's behavior; for example, externally controlled parents had negative assessments of their child's social competence. Three patterns of efficacy were identified: (1) the clear direction which externality gave to parent and child relationships at home, in school, and in the community; (2) the connection between significant support persons and the child's development of social competence; and (3) the interactional nature of development and the ecology.

The paper specifically examines: (1) children's beliefs about emotion management that contribute to their preinteraction expectancies; (2) the sorts of socializing messages children appear to be responding to; and (3) the kinds of cognitive representations that are available to children as they construct their naive theory of emotion. The children were individually asked a series of standardized questions about the parental reactions likely to occur when a child protagonist revealed his or her genuine emotion in eight hypothetical vignettes, and about what one could do to avoid or promote those parental reactions. Half the vignettes concerned  someone who was at risk for having their feelings hurt by the protagonist's expression of genuine emotion; the other half were about a child protagonist who became vulnerable by displaying genuine emotion. The findings indicate that there were generally no age differences in children's expectations of how controlling or accepting a parent's reaction would be in both vignettes. Children selected relatively more controlling parental reactions when the protagonist's display of emotion could result in another person's becoming vulnerable or getting his or her feelings hurt.

        "description":"Recent studies on parental disciplinary practices focus on children's attributes that influence harshness of discipline. The present study examined the effects of facial babyishness on parents' recommendations regarding the discipline of 4- and 11-year-old children who had perpetrated an act of commission or of omission. It was predicted that the actions of babyfaced children would be perceived as less intentional, and that babyfaced children would be punished less harshly than their maturefaced counterparts. A total of 32 mothers and 32 fathers of 10- to 12-year-old children participated. Each parent read eight vignettes describing either 4- or 11-year-old children's misdeeds. Attached to each vignette was a black-and-white photograph of a child, who had been rated as either  babyfaced or maturefaced by introductory psychology students. As predicted, the misdeeds of babyfaced children were perceived as less intentional than those of maturefaced children. The severity of punishment recommended revealed &quot;an age X facial babyishness interaction.&quot; Less severe punishment was recommended for babyfaced than maturefaced 4-year-olds. However, babyfaced 11-year-olds were punished more harshly than maturefaced ones. It is concluded that the findings have implications for parents and parent education. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The birth of a child represents an important normative transition for the infant's mother and her close social network members that may affect both the mother's personal well-being and the quality of her interpersonal realationships. Participants included 47 mothers of infants treated in neonatal intensive care units, and 36 mothers of healthy newborns. Mothers were interviewed between 2 and 5 weeks after birth. The three types of predictive measurements made were: (1) social support; (2) expectancy confirmation; and (3) stress. Outcome indices included those assessing quality of relationships, maternal affect, and attitudes toward the baby. Although support from the mother's &quot;close person,&quot; usually a husband or mother, was found to relate positively to maternal affect, combined  support from additional persons in the mother's network was unrelated to affect. Close person support was also related to indices of the quality of the mother's relationship with the close individual. Relationship quality and affect were related to the degree to which the mother's expectations for support from the close person had been met following the infant's birth. The results provide preliminary evidence for a proposed model of close relationship processes throughout the life span. (RH)",

The children were audiotaped during an unstructured interaction with both their own mother and an unrelated mother. A total of 40 sibling pairs, each including one sibling who was at relatively greater risk for abuse, were drawn from families involved in counseling. It was predicted that the interactions involving the child at greater risk would be perceived as more stressful by both maternal groups, and the prosodic features of the adult's voice would illustrate the heightened stress they experienced. In 61 of the interactions, the adult spontaneously uttered the target sentence: &quot;I don't know.&quot; Among  related mothers, 20 target utterances were directed to the more difficult child and 18 to the other child. Among unrelated mothers, 10 target utterances were directed to the difficult child and 13 to the other. Sentences were acoustically analyzed in terms of the speaker's mean fundamental frequency (MFF) level, MFF range, and MFF variability. Analysis revealed that for both unrelated and related mothers, speech directed toward children at greater risk for abuse was characterized by higher MFF, wider range, and larger MFF variability.

        "description":"Growth curve models are a useful tool for developmentalists because they can estimate an attribute's developmental function by providing a mathematical description of growth on an attribute over time. However, selection of a growth curve model appropriate for estimating individual developmental functions is problematic. The ideal model is the one that most precisely estimates individual developmental functions from the profile data. But profile data often violate model assumptions. When sample sizes are relatively small, the effects of these violations often are not well understood. For this study, computer simulations were run to identify which types of models provided the most precise descriptions of developmental functions with various types of profile data. Models included:  (1) Population Logistic Growth Curve; (2) Population Polynomial Growth Curve; (3) Individual Logistic Growth Curve; (4) Individual Polynomial Growth Curve; and (5) Prototypic Growth Curve. The goals of three analyses were to identify the best model for estimating growth curves when individual differences and reliability are varied, when profile size and reliability are varied, and when more than one parametric family is sampled. All examined data characteristics affected the ability of the models to estimate the profiles. It is concluded that longitudinal studies must be carefully designed if data are to be used to estimate individual growth curves. (RH)",

A director of research and two American Indian advocates: (1) pointed out the high rate of depression among Indian elderly due to physical impairments and deprived living conditions; (2) described service-related and cultural factors contributing to low use of mental health services by Indian elderly; (3) outlined the specific problems and stresses of urban Indians; and (4) proposed legislative and service delivery strategies. A Colorado state official outlined barriers to delivery of mental health services to Hispanic elderly. An Hispanic advocate emphasized the need for outreach programs with  bilingual, bicultural staff. The panel of witnesses discussed: (1) the need for home health agencies and community-based services for Hispanic and Indian elderly; (2) language and cultural barriers between generations, resulting intergenerational conflict, and mental health consequences for the elderly; and (3) the right of each tribe to its own definition of &quot;Indian.&quot; The Committee Chairman called for Indian organizations to collaborate and draft legislative proposals covering the relevant needs of the Indian community, and asked Hispanic organizations to do likewise. Testimony from four mental health professionals covered funding issues, training to provide culturally sensitive outreach staff, and the particular problems and needs of the rural elderly. (SV)",

Chapters 2-5: (1) describe the links between agriculture and other rural economic areas; (2) assess the outcomes of 25 years of rural industrialization; (3) discuss the effects of global economic restructuring on rural industrialization; and (4) document the recent growth of service industries in rural areas.  Chapters 6-10: (1) question the utility of right-to-work legislation as a strategy of rural job creation; (2) support the argument that passive income (cash transfers and investment earnings) is an efficient instrument for economic development; (3) relate transfer payments to rising local wages in the 1960's but not the 1970's; (4) associate regional convergence of educational levels with convergence of southern and nonsouthern poverty rates; and (5) outline the distribution within the rural community of income gains in the 1960's and 1970's.

It was also intended to quantify the number of U.S. public and private one-room schools. The paper briefly reviews the history of Amish and Old Order Mennonite schools. Recent research has centered on the decline of public one-teacher schools in the United States but has ignored the growth of private one-room schools. In 1988 Amish and Old Order Mennonite schools comprised 41% of the one-room schools in the country and were increasing at the rate of about 15 new schools per year. Information in the study was gathered through literature review and surveys of state departments of education conducted in July and August of  1987. The study found that, as of 1987, there were 674 public and 605 private one-room schools in the United States. Eighty percent of the public one-room schools are located west of the Mississippi River. Data from the study indicate that one-room schools will be around for the foreseeable future, although the rate of reduction in the number of public one-room schools has declined since the 1950's. Tables show the following statistics: the number of one-room schools by state in 1950, 1985, 1986, and 1987; the number of public and private one-room schools by state in 1987; and the total number of one-room schools in 10 different years from 1930 to 1987.

In 1982 there were close to 16 million Hispanics in the United States and, according to U.S. census projections, 16 million more Hispanics are expected to join the U.S. population by 2010, raising the total Hispanic population to 31 million. In addition, legalization provisions contained in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 could eventually grant amnesty to close to two million undocumented immigrants, more than 70% of whom are of Mexican origin. In light of their growing presence, Hispanics have the potential to become a politically powerful and influential force in American politics. This paper focuses on the process of political adaptation by  the U.S. Hispanic population. The paper assumes that it is possible to construct objective indicators to measure the degree of political integration. Much of the available evidence suggests that Hispanics have not been successful in mobilizing a substantial proportion of their population into political activity. For example, data from the 1980 census reveal that the failure to naturalize is most pronounced among Hispanic immigrants. Furthermore, Mexican-Americans are found to register and vote less than Blacks or Whites even after controlling for citizenship and age. The future potential of Hispanics in the American political arena, however, is more difficult to estimate. It is important to know the degree of political activity among Hispanics and which factors have facilitated or  retarded this progress. Additional research could uncover such factors. (TES)",

        "description":"The major towns and cities of the Southern Highlands are sometimes not categorized as &quot;Appalachian,&quot; yet they have considerable impact on the character of the region. This study examines the distribution of selected human activities and quality of life variables in 156 counties in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. In 1980, 17 of these counties had urban population proportions over 50%, 19 had urban proportions of 25-50%, and 57 were totally rural. High concentrations of urban population were generally found in the Piedmont, the Great Valley of Tennessee and Virginia, the Kanawha and Ohio River Valleys, and the Asheville basin. Major urban areas exhibited the highest housing values and per capita income, and highest numbers  of colleges, college graduates, hospitals and medical services, employment opportunities, and other services. Part of the magnitude of these urban differences can be explained simply by population size differences. However, many rural-urban differences are much stronger than expected, mainly because each urban node has its own hinterland of rural areas that it serves. It would be expected that new urban nodes would form with the advent of new and better highways, but this has not been the case. Rather, rural dwellers with greater mobility have increased their interaction with the larger urban service centers. Perhaps the Southern Highlands is becoming a &quot;rurban&quot; region, an area that appears to be rural but depends heavily on its urban infrastructure. Twenty maps illustrate statistical  data.

The project is an outgrowth of the Stanford/Zuni Committee, a unique collaborative effort that is guarded by sensitivity to previous Indian research experiences and a commitment to useful consultation with the tribe. This report presents the epidemiology of Zuni suicide and notes that the suicide rate of Indian youth is three times that of white youth. Treatment programs used in other reservation communities are briefly reviewed. The document describes the Stanford prevention strategy, which uses a social skills training model. The project operates under the belief that favorable outcomes could result from the use of an intervention that focuses  primarily on developing in students the independent use of target skills outside the school context. Although the project is not complete, it is hoped that Zuni students will be able to regulate their own behavior better as they acquire the transactional skills of coping. The project's curriculum and proposed implementation plan are described in detail. (TES)",

Rather than belabor the issues of at-risk youth, dropout rates, and the failure of schools to adequately address Indian students' needs, this study looks at how schools have helped Indian students to succeed. The study focuses on the positive, with the assumption that schools can and do make a difference. Most of the respondents said they &quot;liked school a lot&quot; and were involved in one or more extracurricular activities, sports being the most popular. Students reported that teachers were the strongest influences in their school experiences. Students were asked to name the most helpful characteristics of teachers. The three  highest-ranked responses were &quot;complimented me when I did well,&quot;&quot;respected me,&quot; and &quot;caring.&quot; Graduates were surveyed on the most important things that motivated them toward completing high school. The students' responses to this question were organized into three categories: people, events, and values. The document lists responses under each category. Graduates were asked what advice they would give teachers to encourage Indian students to complete high school. By far the most common advice graduates offered was for teachers to provide encouragement to their Indian students. Other suggestions cited patience, open-mindedness, and academic challenge. (TES)",

        "description":"Soil erosion is the detachment and movement of topsoil or soil material from the upper part of the soil profile. It may occur in the form of rill, gully, sheet, or wind erosion. Agents of erosion may be water, wind, glacial ice, agricultural implements, machinery, and animals. Soil conservation measures require a thorough understanding of the mechanics of erosion processes. Runoff, slope, rain, wind, plant care, and the presence or absence of conservation measures are some of the factors which influence the rate of erosion. Erosion results in a deterioration in the quality of cropping and grazing land in addition to reduced productivity and increased expenditure for fertilizers. It is essential to control erosion in order to maintain productivity of the soil, to reduce  sedimentation in streams and lakes, and to prevent further damage to the land by gullies and ditches. Some common methods of checking erosion are control of overgrazing, construction of barriers, contour trenching, and afforestation. This guide offers a selected bibliography of the literature in the Library of Congress on soil erosion. Organization of listings include: basic texts, handbooks, bibliographics, government publications, conference proceedings, reviews, abstracting and indexing services, technical reports, and other selected materials.

Therefore, effective teachers strive to know which misconceptions students have, and then develop a plan by which these suspected misconceptions can be corrected or averted. This paper reports on an investigation which was designed to determine the misconceptions in the earth and space sciences that appear to be prevalent, and to discover if certain individual characteristics are related to the misconceptions held. A questionnaire of 18 multiple choice items was administered to 1,213 students (5th, 8th, and 11th graders, and adults in college and trade school). Results indicated that the participants held many misconceptions in the  earth sciences. Some subgroups appeared to have more misconceptions than others. Common misconceptions revealed by this survey were grouped into three types: (1) primary, which were misconceptions chosen more often than the scientifically acceptable conception; (2) secondary, in which the scientifically acceptable response was more frequently chosen, yet a particular distracter was still chosen twice as often as the least chosen distracter; and (3) functional, which was the least chosen response for that question. Six primary, 14 secondary, and 1 functional misconceptions were identified. Significant differences were found across genders, races, educational levels, and locations. (RT)",

Thirty-four non-science majors enrolled in a physical science course participated in the study. Those 23 students who did not use formal reasoning schemes to solve ratio problems on a pretest took part in the training phase designed to help them to induce the ratio scheme. The training consisted of balance beam and probability problems at five levels of difficulty corresponding to five levels of development of the ratio scheme.  Most of the students induced strategies that permitted them to solve problems at the formal level during the training phase. The STSS could be a predictor for various aspects in the development of complex problem solving strategies. Factor analysis showed the Figural Intersection Test and the Group Embedded Figures Test as one factor and the Ratio Span and the Backward-digit Span Test as another factor.

Teaching manuals were analyzed because they are thought to be especially influential in elementary classrooms where reading is still not a fully developed skill. Since they are often the source for  process-product/inquiry activities, teacher's manuals often play a central role in determining the quantity and quality of hands-on experiences students have. The instruments were administered to 30 fourth-grade teachers in five states who use the Silver Burdett, Merrill, or Scott Foresman text series. Seventeen teachers returned their answers as well as those of their 360 students. The graphical comparisons of teacher responses show both similarities and differences between the various teacher's manuals. Teacher and student survey forms are appended. (MVL)",

Twenty-two middle-school science teachers from the Detroit Public Schools participated in this project. A \"Resourcebook of Science Process Skills\" was developed for use with middle school students (grades 5-9) and was used with teachers in this inservice course. For each of the 11 process skills a generic science activity was presented as well as one applicable to the subject areas of life science, earth science, and physical science. Application questions were posed in each process chapter. Teachers were taught two strategies for teaching these processes to their students,  namely the learning cycle and a modeling strategy. The following conclusions about middle school science teachers were made: (1) they can make significant gains in the mastery of science process skills from an inservice course emphasizing science process skills; (2) they can make significant gains in their logical thinking from an inservice course emphasizing science process skills; and (3) they may have great difficulty in learning instructional strategies for teaching their process skills to their students.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior for predicting the behavioral intentions of teachers enrolled in the Institute in Physical Science. The study investigated three determinants of teachers' behavioral intentions set forth in the theory of planned behavior, namely attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The behavior of interest in this study was the intention of teachers in grades 5/6 and 9/10 who were enrolled in the institute to use half of the activities and investigations completed in the program with students they would teach during the next school year. Data were collected from 50 elementary and secondary teachers. Results of this study indicated that attitude, subjective norm, and  perceived behavioral control made significant contributions to the prediction of behavioral intention. Examination of the data block on external variable revealed attitude toward the behavior to be the single most important predictor of behavioral intention. Intent to perform the behavior appears to be totally under the control of most teachers, with little need for social support and with ample resources and sufficient opportunities available to perform the behavior.

To identify what was wrong with textbooks, more than 70 teachers, professors, publishers and state and local education agency staff were asked to participate in a survey.

The Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT) was administered to the sample (N=84) during the fall of 1986, the fall of 1987, and the spring of 1988. The GALT measures six reasoning modes: conservation; proportional reasoning; controlling variables; probabilistic reasoning; correlational reasoning; and combinatorial logic. Correlational reasoning was found to be the most difficult for the total sample for the three administrations of the GALT. The results of the two-tailed t-test for gender difference were not significant. An ANOVA (GALT score by grade level) was significant for each test administration. The results seem  to indicate: (1) the majority of this sample was not functioning at the formal operational reasoning level; (2) a significant movement from concrete to transitional operational reasoning occurred at the end of grade seven; and (3) a plateau effect occurred between grades eight and nine.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the quantitative and situational structure of algebra story problems, uses these materials to propose an interpretive framework for written problem soving protocols, and then presents an exploratory study of the episodic structure of algebra story problem solving in a sizable group of mathematically competent subjects. Analyses of written protocols compare the strategic, tactical, and conceptual content of solution attempts, looking within these attempts at the interplay between problem comprehension and solution. Comprehension and solution of algebra story problems are complimentary activities, giving rise to a succession of problem solving episodes. While direct algebraic problem solving is sometimes effective, results suggest that the algebraic formalism  may be of little help in comprehending the quantitative constraints posed in a problem text. Instead, competent problem solvers often reason within the situational context presented by a story problem, using various forms of &quot;model-based reasoning&quot; to identify, pursue, and verify quantitative constraints required for solution. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for acquiring mathematical concepts (e.g., related linear functions) and for supporting their acquisition through instruction.

One criterion of success must be the degree to which teachers effectively implement what they have learned. This study examined the effects of an inservice education program emphasizing problem solving on teacher attitudes toward teaching science and on teaching behaviors. Twenty-two middle school science teachers participated in the program and another 22 served as the control group. Before and after the 10-month project, subjects completed attitude surveys and recorded videotapes of themselves teaching science lessons. No difference was noted between the groups on the attitude measure, \"The Science Teaching Attitude Scales.\" A MANOVA  performed on the observational data showed a significant difference between the groups, with a greater difference noted after the workshop than before. The experimental teachers appeared to be shifting to more student-centered classrooms. Teachers substantially decreased the percentage of time spent on lecture and procedural talk and increased the time spent observing and listening to students. This study provides evidence that an extended inservice education program can affect the teaching behaviors of science teachers in the middle grades. References and tables are included. (MVL)",

Subjects were 26 fifth-grade students enrolled in a university laboratory school. During the 3-week unit on energy, students generated their own examples of 13 energy concepts being studied. Results confirm the hypothesis that elementary school science students recall concepts for which they generate their own examples better than concepts for which they do not. Apparently, the  process of finding and recording examples of concepts, and the attendant thinking about the concepts while seeking adequate examples, strengthens knowledge of the concepts themselves more than simply adding further examples of the concepts to the children's long term memory.

This study provides a descriptive record and interpretation of the words and actions of an elementary school teacher beginning to learn about teaching science as problem solving rather than dispensing content information, and attempting to modify her teaching accordingly. Data collection spanned a period of one year and included classroom observations, interviews, and document analysis. Observations revealed that environmental factors such as administrative support and flexibility, availability of science materials, school philosophy, parental support, and teacher status strongly affected the  teacher's effort to change. Personal or internal factors also influenced the teacher's classroom practice: background in science; ability to see interdisciplinary teaching possibilities; organizational ability; regard for individual student's ideas; need to maintain control over student activities and thinking; regard for other teachers' intelligence and experience; emphasis on success; need to \"cover\" a textbook; view of the relationship between science content and problem solving; and general openness to change.

It has been shown in other studies that poor problem solvers are affected by the surface aspects of the problem in contrast with more efficient problem solvers who are capable of constructing a mental model of the physical situation before the mechanics to solve the problem are begun. It was hypothesized that a neophyte physics problem solver focuses on the technical terminology of physics rather than on the underlying process; the new vocabulary that is introduced confounds the process of problem solving. The treatment in the experimental study was a reading passage in potential and kinetic energy along with examples in solving energy problems. Two treatments  are being developed which are identical except in the use of traditional or non-traditional terms. The non-traditional terms were invented, nonsense terms. A population of 31 high school students ages 15-18 were randomly assigned to two groups. It was found that there was no statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups.

Given the following sentence, \"There are six times as many students (S) as professors (P) at this university,\" 37% of 150 freshmen engineering students in a study conducted in 1981 by Clement, Lockhead, and Monk wrote the following equation: 6S=P, referred to as the reversal error. It is plausible to suggest that in order to overcome the reversal error students need to operate in a hypothetico-deductive manner. The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between student ability to translate sentences into equations, equations into sentences, and student performance in the following variables: formal operational reasoning; proportional  reasoning; and achievement in an introductory freshman level chemistry I course. Selected results show that: (1) as the student ability to translate sentences into equations and equations into sentences increases, their mean scores in chemistry I, formal operational and proportional reasoning increase; and (2) ability to translate an equation into a sentence does correlate with student scores in chemistry I while the reverse translation does not. This study reports support for the hypothesis that students who lack formal operational reasoning (hypothetico-deductive reasoning) may experience more problems in the translation of algebraic equations.

The hypothesis that social comparison processes mediate the relation between ability grouping practices in mathematics and students' achievement expectancies was tested in a longitudinal sample of 862 students making the transition from grade 6 to grade 7. Compared to between-classroom ability grouping, heterogeneous grouping raised the achievement expectancies of high achievers and lowered the achievement expectancies of low achievers. When controls for the direction of students' social comparison choices and for their mathematics grades were introduced, the independent effect of ability grouping on achievement expectancies  was consistently and substantially reduced. It is argued that ability grouping practices constrain the choices available to students and teachers for social comparison of abilities and thereby influence the frame of reference students use for self-assessment and teachers use for assigning grades.

A problem, however, is determining whether one's collection techniques provide a complete picture. In this study three techniques (the repertory grid, draw and describe, and the interview about events) were used to collect information on children's concepts of the seasons. Twenty-four fourth graders were included in this study. Eight children were interviewed using this technique. The relationship of &quot;life-world knowledge&quot; and &quot;scientific knowledge&quot; was critical in this study since seasons can be approached from the direction of scientific explanations or cultural events and celebrations. The results of this study indicated that the repertory  grid technique provided more of a science knowledge view, the draw and describe technique provided more of a cultural view, and the interview about events technique corresponded well with both the cultural and scientific views. The results suggest a relationship between school science and school social studies and may support the current Science-Technology-Society emphasis. (CW)",

Many states have begun to reorganize and evaluate their science curricula for a more coherent and improved educational program. Curricular changes have traditionally included teacher input through a local school district committee. Information gathered for this paper originated from such committees. One problem encountered by most school districts in Illinois is that of developing science objectives from goals which can be assessed with local or standardized instruments. Sample objectives provided by the state board are organized into four goals: (1) knowledge and vocabulary; (2) science, technology, society; (3) scientific enterprise; and (4) science processes. From these goals  local science objectives were developed and in each case more objectives were written for goal 1 than any other goal. Additional analyses and implications are cited. (RT)",

Different critics identify different weaknesses, but there is agreement that students are not learning how scientists make knowledge claims and use this knowledge. This paper assumes that one powerful influence on the development of teachers is the way they have been taught. An examination of conceptions held by scientists teaching university science courses indicates that university science teaching may have adverse influence on the development of secondary science teachers. The difficulty the researchers identify is that university science teachers take most aspects of teaching for granted and lack the theoretical framework to critique teaching practices and develop  alternatives. It is hoped that the illustration of ways in which consideration of education concerns could lead to better university science teaching. Includes 18 references. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study of the relationship between affect and achievement in high school science. The conceptual model for science-related affect proposes that students' enjoyment in, and enthusiasm for science are determined by their perceptions of their past performance in science, their expected future performance in science, and the perceived usefulness to them of science at school. Data were collected from 342 grade 8 students in their first year of high school at two urban middle class schools in Australia. Students studied three topics in each of the three terms of the academic year. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the direction of the relationship between science-related affect and achievement and to apportion variance common  between previous and subsequent achievement and the components of science-related affect. It was found that affect is related more strongly to previous than to subsequent achievement, and that students' perceptions of their past performance in science form the most important component variable of science-related affect associated with both previous and subsequent achievement.

This paper describes a microcomputer based interactive icon processor for use in helping students develop a referent base for the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. The instructional model used in this paper proceeds from the initial use of manipulatives through abstraction via four transitional problem types: manipulatives, sketches, mental pictures, and abstraction. The processor as an anthropomorphic expert is available when help or feedback is needed, and  as currently implemented, possesses a certain degree of responsiveness to individual differences in problem-solving strategy. In addition, the computer keeps a chronological record of the operations a student using the software performs, as well as the number, content, and sequencing of hints given.

Pre-proof geometry includes concepts such as open versus closed paths, angles, lines, polygons, and relations among polygons. Inquiry-based instruction relies upon questions to help a student reflect upon actions. The curriculum is informed by the van Hiele model of thinking in geometry. Logo provides a concrete medium to help children make transitions from visually oriented thought to more descriptively oriented thought. Each instructional session is divided into declarative and procedural interpretations of concepts. Declarative interpretations present the basic facts required to distinguish between instances and  non-instances. In contrast, procedural interpretations specify how to create an instance of the concept. The first three lessons are reviews of essential Logo concepts. Fourteen additional sessions for Logo instruction are included. Questions are provided in each session. (YP)",

Section II presents the teacher's view of the collaborative project as an important mechanism that provides support and direction for the reform of teaching mathematics.

        "description":"This study examined teachers' content knowledge about the nature of science and how this knowledge was expressed in their classrooms. Understandings about science influence not only explicit lessons about the nature of science, but also shape an implicit curriculum concerning scientific knowledge. Consideration was also given to ways in which teachers' understandings about how students learn science in school influence teachers' beliefs and lessons about science. Seven precollege science teachers were interviewed to probe their knowledge about the nature of science. Three were asked to participate in the study based on their diversity of orientations. The teachers' knowledge about the nature of science, their roles as teachers, and their students' roles as learners were probed in  a series of at least four hour-long, audiotaped interviews. Their classrooms were observed and audiotaped for at least 35 hours each over a 4-month period. During the interviews and the classroom observations the researcher was continuously involved in building, validating, and altering hypotheses concerning the teachers' content knowledge about the nature of science. The data from this study illustrates how teachers' views of science may be expressed in their classroom instruction. (MVL)",

With the increase of requirements from two to three years of high school mathematics, there is real concern that this underrepresentation will continue to worsen. The College Readiness Program (CRP) is intended to assist Black and Hispanic students in grades 6-8 achieve competence in higher order cognitive skills, and prepare them for enrollment in a high school college preparatory curriculum in mathematics. The CRP is unique in three respects: (1) supplementary/remedial curriculum; (2) focusing motivation and support; and (3) developing a partnership among middle-grade schools and universities.  The selection method of participating schools and university student tutors, and evaluation method are described. The results going into the third year of implementation have been very promising in terms of enrollment in Algebra I, standardized test scores, and student attitude toward the program.

This paper is concerned with science magnet schools. This study was designed to determine if the implementation of a magnet school would generate more positive attitudes in the magnet school's students. The study group included 358 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders, 177 in the elementary science-magnet and 181 in a neighboring school which served a similar student population. The measuring instrument was derived from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. It was reported that students enrolled in an  elementary science-magnet school were more likely to identify science as their favorite or second favorite subject than their counterparts enrolled in a comparison school. The magnet school students wanted more science in school and were less likely to think that scientists were rich. The comparison school students felt that they would be able to help solve the problems of pollution, food shortages and disease and were more likely to use science in making decisions than their magnet school counterparts.

        "description":"The New Christian Right (NCR) has long wanted to impose fundamentalist Christian virtues and values on the United States. This paper discusses fundamentalist movements since the Scopes trial and assesses their impact on public school education. The NCR holds that traditional God-centered Christianity has been replaced in U.S. society and schools by a humanity-centered secularism, and that this reliance on man instead of God has caused many of our modern ills. NCR has challenged the constitutional separation of church and state and has often won short-term skirmishes. Evolution/creation science controversy, including the Scopes trial of 1925, and the decline and subsequent revival of evolution teaching in the following years is examined. In 1969, California enacted a requirement  that creation science and evolution receive equal teaching time. Textbook censorship in West Virginia and Alabama is outlined and calls for schools to come under church control are presented. The use of &quot;secular humanism&quot; by the religious right is examined, as is the &quot;secular humanist conspiracy.&quot; Finally, the removal of religion from textbooks and its recent re-emergence as an important topic of public school study is explored. The persistent danger of the New Christian Right is in the fundamentalists' absolutism and their pursuit of long-term goals. Eternal vigilance alone can safeguard that delicate constitutional balance which allows any religion to rise and flourish but not to dominate U.S. society and schools. A 37-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

Written for grades 9-12, and adaptable for grades 7-8, the materials bring economic principles to life by presenting case studies of real business activities. Each unit contains all necessary materials for the activities, including overheads and student worksheets. Units are designed for use in one or two class periods, and can be used independently or in conjunction with others. Unit 1 introduces students to the dynamics of exchange in a market economy. Students learn the principles of choice, utility, scarcity, supply, demand,  and exchange in activities featuring barter, currency, and auctions. Unit 2 uses a case study of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo to highlight the consumers role in bringing a product to market. Students conduct a market research study and examine the implications of their findings. Unit 3 helps students understand why businesses must continually assess and respond to consumer's needs and wants. Unit 4 features a simulation activity in which students become board members of a major corporation and deal with market research, product research and development, test markets, product costs, pricing, and profit. Unit 5 offers a variety of activities to help students learn about the role of advertising. For example, they explore and evaluate the advertising methods used to promote Crest toothpaste since  its introduction in 1956. (GEA)",

Neither the strength of those residues, nor the impact of major socialization experiences on attitude strength, has been examined closely in the past. Political socialization proceeds through a series of periodic event-triggered occasions for political communication. The data for this study come from an investigation of preadults (aged 10-17) and their parents at the beginning and at the end of the 1980 presidential campaign, and a follow-up study one year later. By measuring attitude strength, affective intensity, attitudinal power and stability, domain differences, and the effects of family political communication versus political  television exposure, a marked jump in the preadult's political socialization occurs, more so for younger children than older ones or for parents. Parental political socialization of children worked most powerfully on the younger children, while political television strengthened the basic political attitudes of the older children.

Two documents concern the U.S. government's policy toward venereal disease (VD) during World War I and World War II. Examination and discussion of these documents add historical perspective to the choices now faced in coping with AIDS. Questions focus on changes in attitude over time and similarities between AIDS control today and VD control as shown in the documents. The next two documents  concern arguments in the mid-1930s about national health insurance. One is a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the Welfare Council of New York City. They can add historical perspective to contemporary issues of health care for the elderly. Questions focus on the role of the federal government toward individuals, the concept of social engineering, and state control of medicine, and &quot;spreading the burden&quot; of health care. The final document concerns the public debt in the mid-1950s during the first term of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Examination and discussion of the document adds historical perspective to the current public debt controversy. Questions compare current and contemporary thought about reducing public debt and consider how the fear of communism was used to  support balancing the federal budget. (GEA)",

An application of the EXRIB system (Hobbs and Kleinberg, 1978) to film and cartoon depictions of teacher-student behavior may show that meaningful relationships exist between media content and audience behavior. The paper is illustrated with examples and problems of interpretation are discussed. (PPB)",

The result of these medical exchanges is a blending of medical practices that proves to be more effective in the treatment of health problems than either could accomplish singly. These collaborative efforts are encouraged by such publications as the &quot;Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine,&quot; founded in 1981, the first Chinese periodical on TCM published in English, and various symposia held in both the West and China. While many Chinese and Western ideas relating to medicine are fundamentally foreign to each other (Yin and Yang, blood transfusion), the  benefits to be derived from this blending of approaches to health care are well worth the efforts required for mutual understanding.

        "description":"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that relatively field independent students will perform at a significantly higher level than relatively field dependent students in college-level, introductory economics courses. Previous studies focused on comparative pedagogies, or an examination of the student variables of gender, ability, socioeconomic status, and age. The study employed one theory of cognitive style to examine the relationship between field dependence/field independence as a process variable and student achievement in economics. Field dependent students were viewed as being more globally oriented, more accepting of the \"whole\", while field independent students were more analytical in their information processing characteristics, and would be more successful in  applying the basic analytical methodologies employed by introductory economic texts. Students in two introductory microeconomics courses at an urban, midwestern university made up the sample. Data were collected through the use of four instruments: (1) the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT); (2) the Revised Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE); (3) the Attitude Towards Economics (ATE) section of the Survey of Economic Attitudes; and (4) a student questionnaire, as well as SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test), ACT (American College Test and SCAT (School and College Ability Test) scores. Achievement and learning were measured and tested using a linear regression model. Statistical significance of cognitive style occurred when achievement was specified as the change in knowledge  relative to the initial level of understanding. A discussion of the possible implications of the research, tables of statistics from the research, and a 17-item bibliography are included. (PPB)",

        "description":"Despite the well-known potential of computer technology to promote achievement and motivational gains among social studies learners, there is very little reported use of microcomputers in social studies classrooms. Factors contributing to this lack of use include: (a) lack of microcomputers for teacher use, (b) lack of high quality software, (c) ambivalence of research findings on the effectiveness of computer based education, (d) lack of teacher knowledge and skills regarding the instructional use of computers, and (e) lack of software that is integrated into the social studies curriculum. This study surveyed secondary social studies teachers to determine: (a) the degree to which they are integrating microcomputers into their instruction, (b) the nature and extent of this  integration, and (c) the incentives or barriers to integrating microcomputers into social studies. Research methodology is examined and results are discussed and presented in tables. Findings reveal a higher level of computer use in secondary social studies instruction than previously reported, and positive attitudes toward computer integration in the classroom. Computer usage continues to be low, however, and one major barrier to increased use is insufficient teacher preparation. Seventy-four percent of respondents had no computer experience. Another is the lack of available computers for classroom use. The paper presents a profile of computer users and non-users, describes how microcomputers are used in social studies classes, assesses the influence of context variables, such as  geographic location, on microcomputer use, and proposes responses to the study findings designed to improve social studies computer use. A 29-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

The expansion of the census, the establishment of the Census Bureau, and the bureau's current operating procedures are briefly discussed. Changes in the population censuses (1790-present) are examined and a list of principle topics assessed shows how the process grew over 200 years. Likewise, the development of housing censuses (1940-present) is explained. The agricultural censuses (1840-present) give the only complete periodic statistics on agricultural activity for  every county in the nation and for other areas under U.S. jurisdiction. The evolution of agricultural census-taking is presented. The history of the manufactures and mineral industries censuses (1810-present) is presented, as is that of the business censuses (1929-present). The document also addresses censuses of construction industries (1929-present), censuses of state and local governments (1850-present), and statistic-keeping on transportation and foreign trade. A number of programs to provide data that cross economic or demographic sectors are briefly described. The history of census-taking tools and the use of maps and charts is explored.

Drawing upon numerous studies, Branson states that more students are staying in school longer, fewer drop out before earning a diploma, and fewer young girls become premature parents. U.S. citizens of all ages--children, adolescents, and adults--continue to believe that there is no society, no country quite like their own. Patriotism, developing in early childhood and continuing through adulthood, plays an important role in our lives. Young and old, we tend to condemn those who espouse \"extreme\" views or non-centrist tendencies. Increasing numbers of young people are calling themselves independent  in politics. Many political scientists attribute this to the addition of new issues to the political agenda and the inability of the established parties to respond. Youth in particular, exhibit opinions and beliefs about a wide variety of contemporary issues. Several figures detail the attitudes of elementary to college students on issues affecting the United States and the world. As future adults and U.S. leaders, the youth of the 1980s are a determined and pragmatic lot. They aspire to advanced educations, successful careers, material comforts, marriage, families, and friends that they can rely on. While concerned with particular issues, they shrink from identifying with political parties or doctrinaire positions; they have few lofty notions about \"changing the world.\" Data is presented  in numerous graphs and figures, and 20 references are cited in footnotes.

The statistics relate to economic development and the changes it is bringing about in the world. These statistics are measures of social and economic conditions in developing and industrial countries. Five indicators of economic development are presented, including color-coded maps and charts for clarification. Many charts present changes between 1965 and 1986, the year of the most current data. Section 1, &quot;Life Expectancy,&quot; addresses the proportion of deaths by age, the percentage of infants surviving the first year of life, and life expectancy at birth. Section 2, &quot;Primary School Enrollment Rate,&quot; covers primary school enrollment rates (1965 and 1985), male/female enrollment rates in  developing countries (1965 and 1985), and persistence in primary school (1980-1985). Section 3, &quot;Population Growth Rate,&quot; charts growth in developing and industrial countries (1950-1986); population size, average annual growth, and average annual increase in developing countries (1965-1986); and population projections for 1986 and 2000. Section 4, &quot;GNP per Capita,&quot; deals with gross national product, population, and GNP per capita; their growth between 1965-1980 and 1980-1986; and the distribution of world population by GNP per capita (1986). Section 5, &quot;Merchandise Exports,&quot; analyzes the value of merchandise exports from developing and industrial countries (1960, 1981, 1986), the structure of merchandise exports of developing countries (1965 and 1986), and the flow of money into and out  of developing countries (1960s and 1980s).

Evaluations of U.S. 18-24-year-olds reveal that many young people lack the basic geographic and conceptual groundwork for intercultural or global understanding. Whether this educational need is met by adding new curricula or infusing current curricula with a global context, the content of the programs should include the study of human values, global systems, global problems and issues, and the history of global interdependence. Appropriate materials and programs must be  developed that provide instructional support for thoughtful solutions to global issues and encourage students to analyze issues and synthesize possible solutions to global controversies. This process should be linked to civics education to provide the student with a sense of the global reality of American citizenship.

Education, justice, and unity are the building blocks to peace and the necessary conditions for its existence. Achieving a peaceful world depends upon our willingness and efforts to remove those things that lead to war and to replace them with the things that lead to peace. Prejudice is the root cause of war and education is the means of overcoming it. Prejudice is the result of self-centeredness and blind imitation. The aggressive and selfish qualities of our past must be replaced by the more mature qualities of cooperation and reciprocity. Five prejudices deserve special attention and are discussed because of the untold suffering they have inflicted upon the  world and because of their importance in establishing peace. They are racism, nationalism, classism, sexism, and religious prejudice. Education can help to eliminate these prejudices by teaching the truth instead of continuing to propagate them. Educators must teach the fallacies and harmful effects of these prejudices which, like war, are supported by lies, irrationalities, fear, and ignorance. The first step is to eliminate these prejudices from oneself, then one can influence others. Eleven ideas to aid in this process are presented. Models of curriculum and instruction that further the concepts of justice, unity, and peace are necessary. Education, both formal and informal, is the best means for creating the knowledge and attitude needed for peace. The inspiration obtained from the  Baha'i and other writings in the preparation of this paper is acknowledged. (GEA)",

The collection documents life in urban settings and focuses on social behavior that is often neglected in standard historical coverage. The documents provide details about what conditions existed and describe programs designed to move communities forward. A variety of materials is included: local and national needs assessments, quantitative surveys and reports by field observers, case records of social service clients, committee proposals for projects dealing with social problems, board minutes, publications, and correspondence among leaders in  the field of social welfare. Documents can shed light on child-rearing habits and can lead to analysis of the material and ideological components of urban lower class homemaking. They provide examples of citizen groups and agencies struggling over time with the same social concerns troubling the nation today. Reports describe work with neglected children over time and include socio-economic data on these client populations. Travelers' Aid records provide demographics of the transient population from the past. Documents reveal common experiences in U.S. cities throughout the twentieth century. They show the importance of volunteerism in social welfare issues and highlight the role of women in such activities. Urban race relations are addressed as well. This material provides the  opportunity for reaching greater historical accuracy about urban conditions and understanding the values that motivated the design of social welfare programs. (GEA)",

It is a guide to the objectives of the state social studies program, not a prescription for day-to-day lesson plans. United States and New York State History is a chronologically-organized two-year course of study that traces the human experience in the United States from pre-Columbian times to the present, tying major political, economic, and social trends in U.S. history to parallel trends and timeframes in New York State history. References are made to Canada and Mexico where relevant. A social history approach is utilized because of its developmental appropriateness to students in these  grades. The course is organized into 12 units to be developed and explored within the two-year timeframe. It builds on and reinforces the skills, concepts, and content understandings introduced in the K-6 program, highlighting the concepts of change, choice, citizenship, culture, diversity, empathy, environment, human rights, identity, interdependence, justice, political systems, power, scarcity, and technology. Within each theme, several issue-oriented lesson aims have been developed. Each is directly related to major ideas, most of which have been taken from the state syllabus. These aims, where possible, have been posed as problems in order to promote students' maximum involvement in the lesson. There are 230 lesson aims and each one includes several student performance objectives.  (GEA)",

The project was begun in October 1985, and at about the same time, a task force, charged with examining the then current program, issued a report which referred to a research base for teacher education and recommended integrating structured field experiences in the schools with professional education courses and creating six credits of professional education devoted to general methods courses in which research-based teaching and classroom management skills would be taught. The project was designed around these key recommendations. The content goal of the project was to: (1) use research about effective teaching and effective  classroom management as bases for improved training in pedagogy, specifically in secondary methods courses and related professional courses; and (2) link field experiences and student teaching more closely to the classroom-based pedagogical training. The specific instructional skills focused on were drawn from a synthesis of elements of direct instruction, active teaching, mastery teaching and mastery learning. One facet of the project was a series of training workshops for cooperating teachers dealing with research-based instructional practice, classroom management, and coaching of prospective teachers. An evaluation of the project is included as well as a practice profile. Appendices include the 1985 task force report, descriptions of the training workshops, and forms for recording  knowledge gained through the program. (JD)",

The sample of 676 students was from health and biology classes from three rural middle-class communities. Each group of students was given a pre-test prior to an AIDS Education Program. A post-test was administered approximately two weeks after the AEP was completed. Results indicated that the seventh grade group was the most influenced by the AEP on both parts of the test. This, along with the lack of attitude change found in senior high groups, suggested the importance of providing AEPs to students prior to their coming to terms with their own sexuality. The  key may be in forming, rather than changing, attitudes. A copy of the questionnaire on facts about AIDS is appended. (JD)",

While the number of Asians going to college and graduating is much higher than the norm for the whole population, four variables are of particular importance in explaining the shortage of Asians in precollege teaching: cultural and language barriers, occupational orientation, immigration status, and racial discrimination. Higher educational attainment and achievement in science and mathematics help Asian college graduates obtain jobs with higher pay and greater prestige than teaching. This paper discusses those variables in the light of career choices by Asian-Americans, pointing out the differences between the cultural  attitudes among minority groups and explaining why these attitudes influence Asians to enter vocational fields other than teaching. Recommendations are made for attracting minority students to teaching. Data gathered in the study are displayed in tables and graphs. Extensive references are included.(JD)",

Though the primary goal was to improve the preparation of preservice teachers in elementary and secondary education, it was hoped the materials could be used with practicing teachers. Emphasis was placed on developing sensitivity to several fundamental teaching behaviors, first by describing them in research-based monographs, and then by showing them in interactive videotapes. An interactive computer-video teaching assessment program was developed which featured modules providing an encapsulated view of teaching. The modules provided meaningful laboratory work to augment and build upon the  material covered in the lecture portion of the teacher education course. The objective was to build the skill of observation and assessment of teaching behavior. This report describes how the program was developed and implemented and its major outcomes. A practice profile is included as well as a Program Assessment Report, which summarizes the major questions addressed through the project, major features of the program, the target groups, and methods and instruments used in data-gathering.

The narrative study of experience connects autobiography to action and intentional future; it connects these to social history and direction; and it links the pluralistic extremes of formalism to the concreteness of specific actions. This discussion rethinks curriculum and teaching in terms of a narrative inquiry which draws on classroom observation and participant observation of the practical, along with the bringing forward of personal experience in the form of stories, interviews, rules, principles, images, and metaphors. The focus of the paper is on how a narratively understood curriculum for teacher education meshes with a curriculum for  the teacher's students. It is pointed out that practical knowledge is learned through apprenticeship to a master and this form of learning has some advantages over &quot;book&quot; learning. It is in the laboratory, combined with the best of apprenticeship, that practice is learned as a whole and experientially. To illustrate this point, a case study is presented of the experiences of an intern teacher and her cooperating teacher. The implications for teacher education programs are discussed. (JD)",

The distinction is based on an evaluation of information processing theory and a review of process-oriented studies of individual differences. Criteria are presented for determining which abilities are measured by tests of spatial ability and for classifying existing instruments on the basis of these criteria. Non-analog ability is the ability measured by certain tests of general intelligence and verbal processing abilities. Analog ability involves the holistic gestalt-like processing of visuospatial information. Reexamining the literature on individual differences and classifying the results by test  types demonstrates that the commonly accepted belief that sex differences in spatial ability emerge in adolescence is not supported by the literature. The male advantage in analog processing ability is evident well before adolescence. Accumulated evidence also does not support the theory of recessive X-linkage of spatial ability.

        "description":"Four major problem areas inhibit the standardized assessment of critical thinking (CT): (1) content validity; (2) construct validity; (3) technical jargon; and (4) background knowledge. Practical examples of framing multiple-choice items for assessment are suggested. In the area of content validity, new agreement about the definition of CT now allows it to be seen as a combination of personality traits, cognitive affects, and cognitive skills. Construct validity is a more troublesome problem because it presumes that one can write questions focusing on the process of thinking as distinct from other factors. Avoiding jargon is a necessity in framing multiple-choice questions. The background knowledge problem can only be addressed by trying to write CT items that presume only the  most universal social and human experiences. Specific multiple-choice items that might resolve these difficulties also serve as paradigm frames for targeting three core CT abilities--analyzing, drawing, and evaluating inferences. Every aspect of CT may not be amenable to multiple-choice testing, but the question of whether or not multiple-choice assessment tools framed as suggested above might be suitable is an empirical question that can be addressed by research. A 64-item list of references is provided. (SLD)",

        "description":"Two alternatives to retention in grade for secondary school students were evaluated in Austin (Texas). Both were designed to allow students who are potential retainees (PRs) to receive remediation in one semester. The Transitional Academic Program (TAP) allows PRs to enroll in ninth-grade courses while repeating eighth-grade courses they had failed; focus is on skills not mastered the first time. The Academic Incentive Program (AIP) is a program of intense remediation in basic subject areas for PRs in junior high and middle schools. The AIP, compared to the TAP, is for students whose attainment is farther below grade levels. Outcome measures evaluated include: students' attitudes; promotion rates; attendance; achievement; academic credits and grades; and dropout rates. PRs were  compared to those retained in grade 8. The TAP served 148, 127, 144, and 75 students in the fall 1986 through spring 1988 semesters; the AIP served 28, 104, and 310 students in the fall 1986 through fall 1987 semesters. There were 160 retainees in the 1986-87 school year. AIP students and full-year retainees did better than did TAP participants. AIP students did better in dropout rates and grade point average (GPA), and retainees did better in dropout rate, GPA, and number of failing grades. TAP students earned slightly more credits toward graduation. Contrary to expectations, full-year retainees had lower dropout rates and better academic progress than did students in either transitional program. Staying in the same school may help performance; TAP students attended three schools in  three semesters. Moving to high school at the start of a year may also be better than moving after one semester. Thirteen data tables and two bar graphs support the text. (SLD)",

Textbooks were selected as a measure of curriculum content. A representative sample of colleges and universities (n=59) responded to questions about physics courses and textbooks and the existence of a graduate program in physics. Two panels of experts, 16 physics professors in all, rated the extent to which each text taught students what they needed to know to perform well on the GRE Physics Test. Subfields of physics that were evaluated included mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and modern and quantum physics. The panel prepared two indices: (1) R1, how well a text &quot;covered&quot; the GRE; and (2) R2, how  well the GRE &quot;covered&quot; the textbook. The interrater reliability of R1 ratings was good, but the reliability of R2 ratings was not as good. Values from the R1 index indicated that the curriculum generally prepared students well in mathematics. About 60% of the relevant material in electricity and magnetism was covered by the textbooks. For the other subfields, ratings (R1) were higher for schools with graduate programs in physics; this difference was more striking for modern and quantum physics. Many items from commonly used texts were not well represented on the GRE, but it could not be determined whether this is a real mismatch or the result of the random selection process. Five data tables and two figures present the study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"The statewide student assessment programs of the 15 member states of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) in the 1987-88 school year are described. Individual summaries of the testing programs provide information on the types of tests used in the SREB states--Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia--at each grade level. During the 1987-88 school year, every state in the SREB except one administered a criterion-referenced test to its students on a statewide basis. Every state used a norm-referenced test of some kind in 1987-88. No more than 3 of the 15 states used the same &quot;national&quot; test; for nearly half of these states, the test used in 1987  was not the same as that used in 1983. In 10 states, students had to pass a graduation examination to receive a high school diploma. Three states administered tests at every grade level from kindergarten through grade 12, while 3 tested at 10 grade levels, 1 tested at 8 levels, 3 tested at 7 levels, and 2 tested at only 3 levels. While Georgia became the first state in the country to require a norm-referenced test of readiness for the first grade, North Carolina discontinued testing grades 1 and 2, and Mississippi discontinued testing kindergartners. With more testing today than ever before, there are many questions about what kinds of tests and what degree of testing is best for students, schools, and states that the SREB urges member states to study. Twenty-four data tables and one  graph provide the state testing statistics. (SLD)",

The CAAP was pilot tested in fall 1988 and includes a measure of writing proficiency and four objective tests: (1) reading; (2) writing skills; (3) mathematics; and (4) critical thinking. Random samples of 1,000 males and 1,000 females were drawn for each objective test from students from about 100 post-secondary institutions. The students tested were primarily incoming college freshmen. The total number of examinees (n=1,490) was included in the writing analysis. The means, standard deviations, t-statistics, and effect sizes for  each test indicated that females tended to perform better than males on the multiple-choice writing skills test and on the essay test. Males tended to outperform females on the mathematics test. There were no overall performance differences between males and females on the reading and critical thinking tests, but there were differences associated with individual passages. Effect sizes for performance differences were generally small, but were in keeping with results found for other tests and examinee populations. Two data tables are provided. (SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of the paper is to determine whether test forms of the Mathematics Usage Test (AAP Math) of the American College Testing Program are parallel in a multidimensional sense. The AAP Math is an achievement test of mathematics concepts acquired by high school students by the end of their third year. To determine the dimensionality of the multidimensional space, each test form was factor analyzed at content area and item levels, and the number of dimensions needed to define the space was determined. A multidimensional item response theory analysis (MIRT) determined where in space each item provided the most information. A sample of 2,500 individuals for each form was taken from the equating administration in 1988 of five forms of the AAP Math: 29B, 29C, 29D, 29E, and 29F. A  third step was to compare the information provided by each form at 49 points in the space defined by item-person interactions. Factor analysis showed that the tests had a very dominant first factor and a possible weaker second factor. MIRT analysis showed a fairly clear distinction between story-problem items and those only requiring manipulation, but the constructs measured by these item types were highly correlated. The information comparison indicated that the test forms all had the same basic structure. Considering that these test forms were not constructed with multidimensional considerations in mind, they are very similar. Eleven tables and five graphs present study data. (SLD)",

The components were: (1) time-using training; (2) error-avoidance training; (3) guessing training; and (4) deductive-reasoning training. Three parallel forms of a 30-item test were developed to measure the dependent variable--test performance. High school graduates (n=126) in a 6-week college preparatory program participated in the study. All participants (aged 15-20 years) received training in all components in different order, one each week. A control group received no training. Results indicate that although testwiseness does affect test performance, training in only one component is not sufficient to improve  performance. There were no significant differences among the effects of the four components. Members of the training groups started outperforming the control group upon receiving training in at least two components. If only two components can be included in training, one skill should be related to not losing score points and one related to gaining extra points (e.g., error-avoidance and guessing). If three components are chosen, they should be the two skills related to gaining extra points (e.g., guessing and deductive reasoning), and one related to not losing score points (e.g., error-avoidance).

The magnitude of the difference between the expert scores and the scores of ratings users confirmed that users may not know all that they need about using student ratings. Those with a negative attitude were likely to use student ratings less often and less well. Positive attitudes were associated with higher knowledge scores. Many users of ratings appear insufficiently aware of the issues currently set forth in ratings literature to be able to make decisions for summative or formative purposes.

The curriculum is based on three major propositions: (1) preservice teachers must acquire psychologically informed inquiry skills and a general understanding of when and how they are to be used; (2) preservice teachers must be encouraged to learn independently in ways that reinforce critical thinking and increase the strength and range of their intellectual curiosity; and (3) educational psychology is an appropriate place to begin encouraging prospective teachers to be reflective so they can learn from teaching itself. The curriculum is confined to the traditional subfields of motivation, human  development, learning theory, and evaluation. Teaching is primarily interactive, with small-group work, micro teaching, simulation, discussion, and question-and-answer sessions. Weekly field-based or clinical laboratory activities for 90 minutes augment classroom instruction. Among the requirements is that students present a five-lesson mini-course to middle-school students. The grading system transfers some of the evaluative responsibility to the students themselves. Student interest, involvement, and achievement are indicators of the value of this curricular approach.

The case contained information on a district-wide report outlining inconsistencies in teachers' evaluation practices and a parental complaint about the evaluation practices of a staff member. The 15 principals were selected for convenience, and represented a slightly more skilled sample than a true random sample. Response protocols were segmented into thought units for analysis in one of eight areas. With one low outlier and two high outliers, responses clustered closely around segments in the following areas: (1) student; (2) teacher; (3) parental complaint; (4) study; (5) department; (6) school; (7) district; and (8)  methods. Statements were categorized according to type--reasoning, action, reiteration, values, background, summary, and comment. There was little evidence that the statement types and patterns of explanation bore a relationship to the quality of action individuals might take. The study may have been tapping differences in verbalization skills rather than school administration skills. Reasonably consistent desires were found among the principals for grading consistency and some degree of consistency in administrative ability. Finally, only about half of the subjects actually related the case study to the parental complaint. A table and two figures illustrate the data.

This paper explores five areas where evaluators might improve methodological practices. First, evaluation reports should reflect the limited contribution that statistical significance testing can make to the interpretation of results. Second, evaluation reports should also reflect the fact that multivariate statistics are often vital in educational research because multivariate methods best honor the reality to which the researcher is trying to generalize. Third, evaluation reports should reflect the recognition that discarding variance to conduct chi-square or analyses of variance  and covariance and multivariate analyses of variance and covariance (OVA methods) can lead to serious distortions in interpretations. Even when OVA methods are appropriate, the methods should usually be implemented using regression approaches. Fourth, evaluation reports should reflect the recognition that covariance statistical correlations are usually least helpful when corrections are most needed. Finally, evaluation reports should reflect the recognition that stepwise analytic methods can lead to seriously distorted interpretations. Fourteen tables and three figures illustrate these contentions. A 102-item list of references is provided. (SLD)",

Derived estimators were compared according to the criteria of their magnitudes, unbiasedness, and mean-square errors.

        "description":"Random samples of classroom teachers from Wyoming (n=555) and Louisiana (n=253) were drawn to determine teachers' purposes for using standardized tests, attitudes toward standardized testing, differences, if any, with grade level taught, and whether test use differed in two very different geographic locations. In addition, differences in standardized test use and attitudes were examined in relation to differences in training in tests and measurement. Elementary, middle, and high school teachers were included in the samples. A survey form was developed, containing 12 Likert scale items regarding attitudes toward standardized tests and 20 additional questions asking for demographic information and information on the types of standardized tests used and purposes for use. Additional  questions covered the level of training in testing and measurement and the grade level taught. Overall attitude toward standardized tests was assessed by asking about the perceived usefulness of such tests to the teacher. A similar question covered the usefulness of classroom tests. Significant differences in reported test use were found by grade level and by amount of training. Attitude differences were also found for grade level taught. Implications for inservice and teacher education curricula are discussed. (TJH)",

        "description":"In February of 1988, four Ontario school boards in the metropolitan Toronto area, the Faculty of Education at the University of Toronto, and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education formed the Learning Consortium. The Consortium constitutes a partnership to initiate innovative programs in field-based teacher education, with an emphasis on improving the quality of education in Canadian schools. Over a three-year period, each partner will contribute people, time, and money to an expanding and increasingly complex set of activities. This summary formative evaluation briefly reviews, from the evaluator's perspective, the initial activities of the Consortium, conceptualizes and examines the meaning of formative evaluation with reference to the experiences of the first year, and  argues the importance of reflexivity to the formative evaluation process. The basic position forwarded is that both Consortium participants and the evaluator act as formative evaluators. As a whole, the Consortium provides a forum for considering the conceptual and empirical possibilities of formative evaluation. During its first year, the planning group consisting of representatives of each of the six organizations and the full-time consortium coordinator met monthly to develop, manage, and review the program. An approach of methodological and programmatic reflexivity was established for participants and the evaluator in development of the formative evaluation and of the improvement program. (TJH)",

        "description":"The use of three remedies for errors in the measurement of ability that arise from differences in rater stringency is discussed. Models contrasted are: (1) Conventional; (2) Handicap; and (3) deterministic Rater Response Theory (RRT). General model requirements, power, bias of measures, computing cost, and complexity are contrasted. Contrasts are illustrated by application of the models to small and large sets of clinical performance ratings of junior-year medical students in an internal medicine clerkship in 1982. The small sample consisted of the ratings for a cohort of 24 students by 42 raters; 129 ratings were used. The large set included ratings for all of the students of that year; 744 ratings by 93 raters on 163 students were used. The RRT was the most powerful model, with  Handicap a close second, although biased. The RRT obtained any specified interrater reliability with only a third of the independent ratings needed by the Conventional model. Pass/fail decisions are illustrated for the 163 students and a hypothetical individual student whose fate is shown to reflect his ability, the measurement model, the passing score, and the stringency and number of raters. The choice of measurement procedures should reflect balance in improving the accuracy of the measures and the costs of faulty decisions based on the measures. Sixteen tables illustrate the data.

        "description":"Between 1985 and 1988, the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Chapter 1 Technical Assistance Center developed, refined, and disseminated a research-based process for improving local compensatory education programs. Known as the Chapter 1 Improvement Process (CHIP), the effort combined knowledge from five research areas into a year-long, cross-district interactive program improvement effort. This paper provides an in-depth examination of the development and effects of the CHIP model. After a review of the relevant literature, the development of the CHIP model is discussed, followed by a brief description of the CHIP workshop series. The results of a follow-up study in the winter of 1989 using qualitative data obtained from interviews with 35 participants from 33 school  districts in Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico are then presented, along with an analysis of the findings and relevant illustrations. The three-session CHIP workshop program is based on literature associated with teacher effectiveness, school effectiveness, educational change, content area advances, research on Chapter 1 effectiveness, and exemplary Chapter 1 programs. The CHIP model coordinates federal and state law and regulations, parental participation, compensatory programs and instruction, regular class instruction, other school programs, district staff, community members, and student achievement and other student gains.

        "description":"The purpose of the present investigation is to examine the influence of sample size (N) and model complexity on a set of 23 goodness-of-fit (GOF) indices, including those typically used in confirmatory factor analysis. The focus was on two potential problems in assessing GOF: (1) some fit indices are substantially influenced by N so that tests of the same model based on the same variables for a new sample from the same population are not directly comparable unless N is also held constant; and (2) the inclusion of additional parameters may provide an illusory improvement in fit. For data simulated from each of two different population models, values for 17 of the 23 fit indices were at least moderately influenced by N, and many of these indices failed to control sufficiently for  the inclusion of superfluous parameters (i.e., parameters that had zero values in the population model). Four of the indices were relatively independent of N and were not significantly affected by the inclusion of superfluous parameters. The four recommended indices are two measures of fit based on the non-centrality parameter proposed by R. P. McDonald, the widely known incremental (relative) index developed by L. R. Tucker and C. Lewis (1973), and a new incremental index--the McDonald-Marsh Index--that is based on one of McDonald's non-centrality indices. Descriptions of the 23 GOF indices used, 10 graphs, and 5 data tables are provided. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Causal path analysis was used to determine the direct and indirect influences of intellectual ability, quality of instruction, achievement motivation, quantity of academic coursework, and time spent on homework on high school students' learning, as measured by their grade point averages (GPAs). Other relevant influences on grades were controlled. The theoretical models proposed were recursive path models; paths were estimated by the beta weights from multiple regression analysis. The sample population consisted of 13,152 high school sophomores selected from the base year (1980), and first (1982) and second (1984) follow-ups of the High School and Beyond Study. The subjects were high school sophomores in 1980 and high school seniors in 1982. Although only the 1980 and 1982 date  were used in this study, the second follow-up data tape was used to include GPAs and coursework in the &quot;new basics&quot; present in student transcripts rather than simply in student self-reports. The path model included ethnicity, family background, gender, and GPA as well as the variables detailed above. Results indicate that coursework in the new basics, intellectual ability, and academic motivation were the most influential variables affecting grades. Homework had a small, but meaningful, effect. Although quality of instruction did not have a meaningful direct effect on grades, it did affect other variables in the model, such as motivation and coursework. Three data tables and two figures are included. (TJH)",

Ontario French-language students performed poorly in relation to students in the other Canadian provinces. Unlike the earlier study, however, problems with translation and generalizability of results were not apparent. Analysis of the item-by-item data identified mathematics and science achievement differences between the French- and English-language populations in Ontario and between Ontario French-language and Quebec French-language students. The item response theory  scaling procedure made presentation of both the results and the meaning of these results accessible to policymakers, educators, and the public.

        "description":"Project ABC (Advancement Based on Competency) was a 5-year study funded jointly by the Alberta Department of Education and the Calgary Board of Education. Funded at $999,950, the program took place from 1982 to 1987. It explored alternatives to the Carnegie Unit in three senior high schools. Students, teachers, and administrators in the William Aberhart, John Diefenbaker, and Ernest Manning schools were administered questionnaires. Focus was on student achievement, curriculum adherence, removal of time as a credit requirement, competency as a basis for awarding credit, considerations for provincial applications, and budget considerations. Three independent models evolved: (1) the department-based model; (2) the parallel core program model; and (3) the school-wide model. Student  achievement overall was generally comparable to non-project student achievement within Calgary and Alberta. Few significant differences were identified. Provincial curriculum was adhered to in individualized instruction and continuous progress formats, and in some cases was found to be superior. Findings indicated that the criterion of time could be removed and replaced by the criterion of demonstrated competency, and that competency was an appropriate basis for advancement at both unit and course levels. A review of the literature revealed that a similar but far more extensive study had been conducted in the United States from 1932 to 1940. It is concluded that personalized instruction and continuous progress are viable educational alternatives and should no longer be considered  experimental. Eighty data tables, 1 figure, and 24 graphs are presented. The student, teacher, and administrator questionnaires are appended. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"In analyzing exploratory repeated measures data with more than two measures, two competing tests must be administered simultaneously if one is to make an efficient and effective decision regarding the tenability of the null hypothesis of no differences among measurement means. Obviously, such a procedure is not without a cost vis-a-vis Type I error control. This study represents a measure of that cost. The Type I error properties for the simultaneous application of the mixed model test and the multivariate test were estimated. The results of this Monte Carlo robustness study suggest that a single rule of thumb designed to control Type I error (i.e., split the alpha or, alternatively, do not split the alpha) is not practical under all circumstances. A more dynamic method for  satisfactory management of Type I errors, which deals with departures from sphericity and the related effects on correlation of the two tests, is outlined.

        "description":"This study compared the performance of 51 gifted Caucasian children on the Stanford Binet LM and the Stanford Binet Fourth Edition (SB4) to determine whether significantly different scores would be obtained. The 33 male and 18 female subjects were from middle and upper-middle class families in a western urban area. Their developmental histories, derived from parents' reports, indicated precocious early development of cognitive linguistic abilities. When composite scores were compared, the mean difference between the two tests was 10 points. The LM intelligence quotient was significantly higher than that for the SB4, and the Kaufman Achievement Test total score showed insignificant differences. Correlations between the LM total and the SB4 area scores were significant. The results  suggest that the SB4 can be used as part of a system for identifying gifted children, but the composite score cut-off value may have to be adjusted. Further study of the visual abstract reasoning tests is recommended since this sample of gifted children seemed to function quite differently on them than on the verbal and quantitative reasoning tests. Four data tables are included. (TJH)",

The study was undertaken to: (1) determine what alternatives to the idea of the process of internalization and the focus on values used in the taxonomy are suggested by present psychological theories; and (2) assess the implications of these alternatives for educational measurement. Examples are provided of theories that have been used in current research in mathematics teaching and learning. Cognitive, constructivist, and social interaction perspectives are outlined briefly; and domain-specific theories and research falling within the categories of directed cognition and intentionality are reviewed. Theories regarding intentionality include those addressing beliefs,  motivations, and attributions. It is concluded that, at the outset, the idea of a structure underlying the affective domain was essential to the taxonomy. This internalization principle had a simplifying effect, although no single psychological theory can be found to cover the entire affective domain. It is argued that it is best to retain the psychological constructs that appear in active areas of research and incorporate them in subject matter and activity settings to link them to instructional planning.

In light of prior negative findings regarding the application of bootstrapping to this particular problem, a recommendation of an &quot;optimal&quot; approach to resampling was sought. The study used Monte Carlo simulations to test the variance component estimation accuracy under simultaneous resampling of all effect factors in a random model versus resampling a single factor. Results indicate that single-factor was a preferable method of resampling and produced reasonable estimates of both standard errors and confidence intervals (parametric and non-parametric).

        "description":"Values and the process of valuing were studied among college students. A framework for conceptualizing college student values developed over a period of 2 years by a 10-member faculty and staff committee at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond) involved the movement of students from recognition of values, through critical thinking, to commitment to definite values. Values were categorized as values toward: (1) intellectual functioning; (2) others; (3) the role of spirituality in one's life; (4) personal and professional growth; and (5) social and political consciousness and responsibility. Focus group techniques were used to study the values of 21 female and 10 male college juniors. Using this material, the values team developed a 95-item survey, pilot tested with 210  students (65% female). Survey results tend to support the findings of the focus groups, with strong orientation toward occupational preparation. Interest in developing other identified areas was somewhat weaker, but still strong. A writing sample exercise for values assessment developed and tested with nine juniors provided results in line with the other assessments. The procedures developed provide some methodology for studying values and valuing. The focus group approach seemed particularly informative and stimulating. The focus group topic outline, the group screening instrument, the values survey, and the writing assignments are appended. (SLD)",

        "description":"Preliminary findings of the Differential Coursework Patterns (DCP) Project are reported. The Project uses assessment test scores and transcripts from samples of graduating college seniors to determine what coursework patterns were related to gains in the general learned abilities of the students. Random samples of graduating seniors have been examined from: (1) a major private research university (n=105); (2) a state university (n=54); (3) a private college (n=146); and (4) a women's liberal arts college (n=62). Precollege Scholastic Aptitude test scores were an indication of the students' entering levels of learning. The Graduate Record Examination general tests were the post-college exit measure of general learning. Coursework patterns resulting from a cluster analysis  developed for the project did not produce clear distinctions according to academic department or major, but it was concluded that: (1) development of general learned abilities did not have an exact one-to-one relationship with departmental categories; (2) development of general learned abilities was not confined to the lower level of courses; and (3) there was little formal monitoring or description of the curriculum in terms of general learned abilities at an institution-wide level. Standardized test scores and transcripts were useful in the assessment of learned abilities. The relationships between coursework patterns and the general curriculum suggest that new ways are needed to conceptualize general education in college.

Recently, several researchers have approached test construction from a mathematical programming perspective. However, these procedures require formidable computations, particularly as more constraints (i.e., the number of forms and the number of content areas) are added. In the test construction methodology proposed in this study, items are sampled from an ordered domain of item information values according to differences between test information curves of forms that are in the process of being created and a target test information curve. This new heuristic procedure, which uses a  program known as TESTGEN, is being examined by the American College Testing (ACT) Program, which develops six parallel forms for the ACT Assessment Program each year. Research has concentrated on the Mathematics Usage Test. Results appear to be quite promising. Two data tables, one flowchart, and six graphs are presented. (Author/TJH)",

Item response and essay ratings were calibrated together using a graded response model from item response theory. Results suggest that while the essays are measuring a different component of writing ability than the multiple-choice test, their overlap is substantial.

        "description":"Many researchers have suggested that the cause of differential item functioning (DIF) can in part be due to the misspecification of the supporting trait distribution (STD). This paper demonstrates how a unidimensional item response theory (IRT) calibration of response data, generated from a two-dimensional IRT model, results in DIF when the multidimensional STDs are not equal. How DIF can occur when items measure multiple ability dimensions on which groups have different STDs is illustrated. Generating item parameters used to simulate the multidimensional test were based on the American College Testing (ACT) Mathematics Usage Test administered in February 1983. The calibration sample consisted of 2,000 randomly selected students. With these item estimates as parameters, response  data corresponding to three different STD conditions were generated. Results indicate that DIF, created by model misspecification, can be accurately predicted if the multidimensional IRT item parameters and the STD for the groups of interest are known. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. Five tables and four graphs present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The relationship of multiple linear regression to various multivariate statistical techniques is discussed. The importance of the standardized partial regression coefficient (beta weight) in multiple linear regression as it is applied in path, factor, LISREL, and discriminant analyses is emphasized. The multivariate methods discussed in this paper have in common the general linear model and are the same in several other respects: (1) they identify, partition, and control variance; (2) they are based on linear combinations of variables; and (3) the linear weights can be computed based on standardized partial regression coefficients. However, these methods have different applications. While multiple regression seeks to identify and estimate the amount of variance in the dependent  variable attributed to one or more independent variables, path analysis attempts to identify relationships among a set of variables. Factor analysis tries to identify subsets of variables from a much larger set. The LISREL program determines the degree of model specification and measurement error. Discriminant analysis seeks to identify a linear combination of variables that can be used to assign subjects to groups. An understanding of multiple regression and general linear model techniques can greatly facilitate one's understanding of the testing of research questions in multivariate situations. Eight appendices contain computer program examples based on correlational input as illustrations of these methods. A 47-item list of references is provided. (SLD)",

There were 122 elementary and 191 secondary school teachers in the teacher sample. The validity of these perceptions was determined by a direct assessment of teachers' testing proficiencies or skills as demonstrated on teacher-made tests. Perceptual assessments of all three groups differed significantly. These assessments also differed from the demonstrated proficiencies of the teachers, evaluated by two judges from a sample of 175 tests made by these teachers, for a total of 6,529 test items and 455 item exercises. Lack of agreement was especially evident for teachers' test item writing  and test format development skills and for the teachers' writing of items functioning at higher cognitive levels. Moderately high negative correlations were found between perceived and demonstrated proficiency assessments of teachers' test item writing skills, but moderate to high positive correlations were found between the three sets of perceptual assessments, with the highest correlation between assessments of teachers and supervisors. Teachers rated their testing proficiencies higher than did principals, and principals rated proficiencies higher than did supervisors. Results suggest that perceptions of educational staff may not be accurate guides for determining needs for inservice training. Both preservice and inservice teacher educators need to increase attention to test item  writing skills and the writing of items that measure beyond simple knowledge levels.

SPC methodology is a collection of graphical and inferential statistics techniques used to study the progress of phenomena over time. The types of control charts covered are the null X (mean), R (Range), X (individual observations), MR (moving range), p (measure of successes), and U (number of events per unit). Uses of charts in the binomial case and the Poisson case are considered. These charts provide the researcher with a combined graphical and hypothesis testing procedure for assessing the stability of various types of data collected across time. The details of constructing each of these charts and the methods for hypothesis testing are described. Examples drawn from the field  of education illustrate chart construction. SPC procedures described are understandable by researchers who are not mathematically oriented; whereas other procedures often recommended in the statistically-oriented literature on single-subject design are not easily understood by these researchers. All of the SPC techniques introduced can be modified to allow the analysis of data from one-way multiple group designs and factorial designs. Although these charts do not represent all the control charting techniques used in process control, they are the ones most applicable to educational research.

The Department of Education conducted a study to determine the validity of 11 previously unvalidated or extensively revised tests for certification and to make recommendations about the minimum qualifying scores for any of these tests found valid. Some of the tests were National Teacher Examinations specialty area tests developed or revised since 1984--art education; music education; school guidance and counseling; school psychologist; and special education. An additional six tests, developed by a consortium of states in conjunction with the Educational Testing Service (ETS), were tested: earth/space science;  health education; marketing and distributive education; psychology; teaching hearing impaired students; and teaching visually impaired students. A total of 270 personnel from higher education institutions and local school districts reviewed each test as follows: (1) content review by teacher educators; (2) job relevance review by local educators; and (3) knowledge estimation review by members of both groups for 11 of the tests not previously reviewed in Tennessee. Seventeen educational and lay representatives further served as a Standards Committee, using the information from the panels to make decisions on validity and minimum qualifying scores. The Committee recommended minimum qualifying scores for four tests, but did not recommend scores for eight tests lacking normative data. Minimum  scores will be set when data are available. The Committee further recommended that the impact of the tests on special groups of examinees, such as minorities, be monitored carefully.

        "description":"The development, formative evaluation, and potential uses of the &quot;Sixteen Quality Indicators&quot; (16 QI) rating scale are described. The scale was developed as a systematic way to rate the quality of Skill Qualifications Tests (SQTs) in the United States Army. An SQT measures a soldier's knowledge of a military occupational specialty. It is a criterion-referenced test that samples the tasks in a specific specialty area. Several hundred SQTs are developed annually. The 16 QI is a list of critical criterion-referenced test characteristics. Scale drafts were reviewed by army job specialists and civilian testing experts to form a five-point scale. The 16 QI are grouped into characteristics of the total test, the task-measuring part of the test, and the item. The 16 QI rating scale has  not yet been evaluated thoroughly, but would appear to have potential for monitoring SQT quality and diagnosing what needs to be done to improve the quality of a test. As an organized and systematic procedure, the 16 QI may be useful in other applications to evaluate criterion-referenced tests. Four tables present the elements of the 16 QI and the regulations and policies that support its use. (SLD)",

        "description":"Indices were constructed to measure individual differences in the effects of the automated testing format and repeated testing on Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) responses. Two types of instability measures were studied within a data set from the responses of 150 undergraduate students who took a computer-administered and pencil-and-paper MMPI a week apart. Two subject groups included 42 males and 33 females each. One set of indices measured systematic format- and time-related changes in responding, shifting attributable to format or time alone. Two families of six indices each were computed measuring unsystematic changes in responding, or overall tendencies to shift in a particular direction among the responses &quot;true,&quot;&quot;false,&quot; and &quot;cannot say.&quot; These  unsystematic changes were assessed both between formats and across times, although they were partially confounded in the present study. Systematic format shifting was related to a more general and unsystematic tendency to shift between &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; responses. The use of &quot;cannot say&quot; in the computerized testing situation appears distinct from the tendency to use the &quot;cannot say&quot; response on the pencil-and-paper test. Systematic item shifting attributable to time, although not involving an internally consistent set of responses, is distinct from other instability indices derived in this study and is therefore sensitive to the design of the administration software. Personality and other correlates of the item-shifting indices are discussed. Five tables present study data.  (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The introduction of the trial state assessment program into the design of the 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) raises questions about differences across states in sampling and administration practices. In addition, questions about the general approach to comparing state data to national data need discussion. Subject areas covered by the NAEP include reading, mathematics, and science; state programs will only cover mathematics. NAEP samples are selected from both age and grade populations; 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds and fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students will be involved. State assessments will only involve eighth-graders. The NAEP will cover private as well as public schools, while the state component will cover only the latter. NAEP will involve a  deeply stratified, multi-level sampling plan, with oversampling of minority students and private schools. The NAEP sample will allow regional, but not state-by-state, comparisons. The target for the state-level program includes 2,000 eighth-graders selected from about 100 schools in each state. While special staff are provided for the NAEP, state programs will be conducted by local school staff under rigid guidelines. Special subsampling procedures have been developed for both national and state populations. (TJH)",

Demographics, size, and other information about sampling techniques were also  assessed. Randomization and convenience were the most typical sample selection techniques. Means of establishing reliability of the dependent variables and whether surveying was involved for each study were also determined.

FA assesses correlation matrices, while MDS performs an analysis of proximity measures. Seven data sets were generated; each differed from the others with respect to dimensionality. Each set consisted of 28 items and was either one- or two-dimensional, with two-dimensional data sets having interdimensional correlation coefficients of 0.01, 0.10, and 0.60. All sets were generated according to G. Masters' partial credit model (1982)--a Rasch model; 14 item parameters were taken from Masters' article and duplicated to produce the 28-item pool. Assessment of dimensionality through MDS was performed by  stress by dimensionality graphs alone and in conjunction with plots of stress by dimensionality containing varying degrees of error. For the FA of each correlation matrix, the initial determination of dimensionality was performed through an examination of the matrix's scree plot. Results indicate that MDS may be a viable methodology for IRT researchers to use in assessing the dimensionality of ordered test or attitude data. Four data tables and 20 graphs are provided. (TJH)",

This distinction is particularly significant for studies of young children. Data included pre- and post-test scores on the Missouri Kindergarten Inventory of Developmental Skills for 12,917 Hawaiian kindergarten students and on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Revised) for 6,838 students. The two tests are used as part of the Early Provisions for School Success--a statewide kindergarten program. A parallel secondary analysis was conducted for students of limited English proficiency. For the language tests, the use of age-group norms, as  opposed to sole use of cohort norms, resulted in more precise information.

The checklist was to reflect some degree of consensus among experts in survey research and to be used as a general guide by novice questionnaire designers. A second objective was to take a first step toward development of an objective measure of quality of questionnaires. A review of the literature on the design of mail survey questionnaires indicated that seven categories were most essential in influencing response rate and quality of responses to mail questionnaires: (1) general appearance; (2) instructions; (3) choice of items; (4) order of items; (5) item format; (6) choice of response options; and (7) wording. A survey instrument based on the literature review was formulated.  Six authors of books on survey research and six members of the American Educational Research Association's Special Interest Group on Survey Research in Education were surveyed; five of the former and six of the latter responded to the survey. Results are disappointing. The reluctance of the experts to indicate that any but the most fundamental of characteristics were applicable to all mail surveys underscores the often-stated principle that questionnaires should be tailored to the particular population being surveyed. Alternative approaches to future research are enumerated. Eleven data tables are included. The &quot;Desirable Characteristics of Mail Questionnaires&quot; Questionnaire is appended. (TJH)",

Subjects were 100 former students of the University of Tennessee. The second study involved use of: (1) a questionnaire version produced by a laser printer that allowed variation in type size; and (2) a version originally produced by a typewriter and photocopied. Subjects were 297 former students of the same university. In each study, each subject received only one of the two form types. Results of the studies are  consistent with previous findings that when the same questions are used, there is no significant difference between questionnaires of different lengths, between questionnaires with a professional appearance (typeface) and those that are typed, and between booklet and stapled questionnaires. It is noted that, due to the narrowness of the subject scope of the studies, generalizations from these conclusions should be made cautiously. (TJH)",

The project design involves the following phases: (1) a multidisciplinary literature review to develop guiding principles for the design of school-based management information systems; (2) a review of existing district reporting practices; and (3) interviews with the potential user groups--school boards, district administrators, and principals--to refine the picture of the means by which they process and use information on  school quality. The third stage is still in progress. Phases 1 and 2, reported here, covered evaluation utilization, information representation and decision-making, human cognition and computer data display, kinds of data reported, means of presenting reported information, and adherence of reports to data presentation guidelines. Preliminary findings indicate that school planners cannot or will not use the hypothetical-deductive model of problem-solving when using data to answer questions about their schools. This points to the need to provide interpretive information in non-technical language, to key interpretations to answer questions that school planners pose when reading reports, and to educate audiences about data uses.

The subject matter consisted of line drawings of front, side, and top silhouettes of aircraft. Reliabilities for both modes of testing were estimated by deriving internal consistency indices, using an odd/even item split. Prior to testing, subjects learned to recognize the aircraft silhouettes using two media: (1) paper-based form structured as a study guide; and (2) computer-based form using FLASH IVAN in the training mode. A stepwise multiple discriminant analysis was performed to determine how well the two testing modes distinguished among  two groups of subjects expected to differ in their recognition of aircraft silhouettes. Computer-based and paper-based measures were not significantly different in reliability or internal consistency. The paper-based measure of average degree of confidence in recognition judgments was more reliable than the computer-based measure. The average degree of confidence measured by the two modes was more equivalent than the measures of recognition test scores. The discriminative validities of the two measures were about the same for distinguishing groups above or below the mean average curriculum grade. Using the pooled within-groups correlations between the discriminant function and computer-based or paper-based measures, the former had superior discriminative validity than the latter.  Statistics associated with the canonical correlation suggested that the predictive validity of computer-based measures approximates that of paper-based measures. Four tables present study data.

In 1984-85 the New York State Board of Regents initiated the Comprehensive Assessment Report (CAR) as a process of reporting and using education results throughout the state. The conceptual approach of the guide conceives of standardized test data as a limited first step in assessing school effectiveness. In going beyond test data, one must look for convergence of test data and other indicators of school performance and one must separate the data into component parts to gain information about subgroups of students and schools. Although technical statistical considerations are not emphasized in this guide, it is essential  that comparisons between schools, districts, or groups take into account demographic and other salient characteristics of the groups being examined. The introduction establishes the framework for this guide. The second chapter describes the CAR, its purposes and processes, and the data it includes. Chapter 3 discusses the limitations of the data and possible misuses. Chapter 4 generalizes from the New York experience to indicate how a district can prepare and present a comprehensive assessment report. Appendix 1 contains a model assessment report, and Appendix 2 focuses on basic measurement concepts. Appendix 3 presents a directory of school improvement resources, and Appendix 4 includes a 107-item bibliography of research on school effectiveness. Five data tables and 12 graphs are  included.

Seven expert witnesses testified. Few research studies specifically target aged Blacks and Puerto Ricans; however, many minority elderly share the following characteristics of persons who are at-risk of mental illness: (1) low income; (2) unmarried; (3) low education; and (4) poor physical health. Elderly Puerto Ricans have an extremely high level of depressive symptoms, and Puerto Rican women have significantly higher levels than men. Poor English language skills and very low acculturation contribute to the vulnerability of elderly Puerto Ricans. Aged Blacks suffer from the physical and  psychological effects of a lifetime of racial oppression. All witnesses agreed on the need for a comprehensive, interagency approach to mental health service delivery that utilizes the clients' social networks. Service delivery to older Puerto Ricans should include bilingual services. Delivery to older Blacks should include holistic assessment and treatment planning. Other factors to be considered include the following: (1) affordability; (2) improvement of existing day treatment and inpatient services; (3) development of mobile treatment services; and (4) service for elderly mentally disabled homeless.

A panel of experts familiar with urban school systems nominated over 30 candidate urban districts for study. The following districts were chosen for analysis: (1) Atlanta (Georgia); (2) Cincinnati (Ohio); (3) Memphis (Tennessee); (4) Miami (Florida); (5) Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania); and (6) San Diego (California). Data were drawn from intensive interviews conducted with local school and community leaders in the 1987-88 school year. The major findings include the need for a cooperative effort on the part of the school superintendent, the business community, the teachers' union, and the school board to perform the following tasks: (1) reach out and  involve the larger community in educational issues; (2) make information about school needs, resources, and performance widely available; (3) forge communitywide agreement about improvement goals; and (4) subordinate the traditional roles of boards, administrators, and teachers to the larger imperative of systemwide improvement. The roles of the following participants in reform are discussed in detail: (1) school superintendent; (2) school board; (3) business and community leaders; (4) teachers and unions; (5) the media; (6) State and Federal governments; and (7) national foundations.

        "description":"Since 1981, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the United States Department of Education has been accused of failing to enforce the civil rights laws according to its mandate. OCR is responsible for enforcing Federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, handicap, or age in educational programs or activities funded by the Federal government by conducting complaint investigations and compliance reviews. The staff of the Committee on Education and Labor visited six of the ten OCR regional offices in 1988 in order to investigate the agency's policies and practices, including the impact of the Grove City College v. Bell and the Adams v. Bennett decisions. Conclusions include the following: (1) the OCR has been stymied by the Reagan  Administration, which actively opposed the civil rights laws and took efforts to minimize the agency's potential impact; (2) some enforcement occurred, in spite of OCR leadership, by a regional staff; (3) the Adams lawsuit points up the fact that OCR's failures extend backwards to its inception; and (4) the commitment of the Bush Administration to civil rights enforcement will determine whether OCR accepts its responsibilities. The appendices include the following: (1) statistical data on 27 tables and 35 graphs; (2) an organizational chart of the OCR; (3) the mission and function statement of the OCR; (4) copies of important communications cited in the text; (5) the original complaint filed in the case of Adams v. Bennett (1970); and (6) the Adams orders of March 11 and 24, 1983.  (FMW)",

        "description":"Restoring the value of the minimum wage and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by family size could significantly reduce family poverty and &quot;make work pay.&quot; Recent poverty policies have largely ignored those who work but still remain poor. The majority of these working poor are in their prime working years (aged 22 to 64), most are white, and a disproportionately large number live in rural areas. Most of the children living in poverty are members of working poor families. The largest single factor that has contributed to the increase in the number of the working poor since the late 1970s has been the drop in the value of the minimum wage. Restoring the minimum wage and expanding the EITC are complementary policies necessary to guarantee that parents working full-time  and their children will not have to live in poverty. One reform may not substitute for the other. Restoring the minimum wage to its traditional level can bring full-time earnings back to the poverty line for a family of three. Reforms in the EITC can bring most families of more than three people up to, or close to, the poverty line if the family has one full-time worker. Proposed reform legislation is analyzed and compared. Statistical data are included on two graphs. Discussions of the value of the minimum wage, and the relationship between the minimum wage and employment opportunities are included in the appendices. A separate executive summary is also included.

        "description":"Despite claims that benefits for the needy have not been reduced, the Reagan Administration's final budget for fiscal year 1990 is marked by substantial reductions in programs for the poor. Actual spending for low-income programs would be sliced $6.75 billion below current levels. Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for poor families with children and poor elderly and disabled people, would bear the largest reduction of any program, with a cut of $1.66 billion. The reductions would also be substantial in non-entitlement programs for the poor, a group that has already borne some of the deepest reductions of the past eight years. The new proposals would bring the total reduction in appropriations for low-income non-entitlement programs to 61 percent from fiscal year 1981.  The following programs would experience significant reductions: (1) Medicaid; (2) heating and cooling assistance; (3) low-income housing; (4) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and child support enforcement; (5) food assistance; and (6) legal services and community action. The following programs would have their funding terminated, reduced or frozen: (1) refugee assistance; (2) funding for construction of health facilities on Indian reservations; (3) project Head Start; and (4) foster care and child welfare. Although not limited to low-income households, reductions in the following programs have significant impact on them: (1) mass transit; (2) drug abuse; and (3) Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

Funding is provided by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) Chapter 2, and by the State. Goals are the following: (1) provide intensive academic instruction for the educationally disadvantaged; (2) involve parents; (3) provide incentives for academic achievement; (4) operate staff inservice programs; (5) measure academic growth; and (6) prepare students for the general classroom. Data were analyzed from the following sources: (1) a survey of all teachers; (2) interviews with each school principal or assistant principal; and (3) observation of each teacher during  an entire session. Program strengths included the following: (1) small group instruction on the elementary level; (2) individual attention; (3) use of new instructional techniques; and (4) direct instruction. Program weaknesses include the following: (1) program changes disrupted the elementary staff, and secondary A2 lacked prepared materials; (2) focus restricted to the bottom quartile of students; (3) lack of formal communication between compensatory education and regular teachers; (4) low certification standards for elementary compensatory education teachers; and (5) lack of parent participation. Recommendations for improvement are included. Statistical data are included on one table. The appendices include copies of the evaluation instruments and tabulations of responses.  (FMW)",

        "description":"Planned mentoring programs, which purposefully link disadvantaged youth with someone older and more experienced, have become a popular means of providing adolescents with adult contacts, counselors, and role models. Mentoring programs vary widely in their objectives, and in the duration, frequency, and intensity of the planned relationship. The quality of mentoring relationships differs enormously. Mentors help compensate for inadequate or dysfunctional socialization or give psychological support for new attitudes and behaviors, while they at the same time create opportunities to move successfully in new arenas of education, work, and social life. Mentoring includes both psychosocial and instrumental aspects. Successful mentoring generally occurs when the older individual is not  removed from the mentee by a great social distance; but matching mentors and mentees of the same social class and gender is not the only way to close social distance. Sensitive support, timely contacts, and other appropriate resources are the key factors. Trust is a critical aspect of the mentor-mentee relationship. It is likely that the bonds between natural mentors and mentees are stronger. Planned mentoring is a modest intervention: its power to substitute for missing adults in the lives of youth is limited. Nor can it serve all who need it. Still, it can improve the social chances of some adolescents by leading them to new resources and providing them with much-needed support. (BJV)",

        "description":"A school's promotion policy is an integral component of its overall educational policy. In conjunction with achievement goals, it defines the levels of performance that permit students to move through grade levels and to graduate. This digest reviews the various promotion policies and practices in current use by secondary schools, particularly those in urban areas. The following strategies are commonly used by high schools to move students toward graduation: (1) social promotion; (2) tracking; and (3) merit promotion. More than 40 states--and most urban school districts--have implemented minimum competency criteria for high school education. But competency-based promotion, which relies upon a committed and aggressive administration, may have created a new class of dropouts in  school districts where it has been adopted. Grade retention and compulsory summer school appear to be the most common alternatives to promotion. However, grade retention is expensive and may be racially and socioeconomically biased. Many urban school districts require the completion of a minimum number of credits, including certain prescribed courses and sometimes electives, as a condition for the award of a high school diploma. Districts vary in their policies regarding special needs students who are not able to meet the minimum requirements for graduation, including students in special or vocational education. Six issues to be considered while assessing and developing promotional policies are identified. A six-item list of references is included. (BJV)",

        "description":"This digest reviews the issues of identity and adjustment faced by adolescent Southeast Asian refugees in the United States. Most teenagers from all the Southeast Asian ethnic groups have adopted the dress, hairstyles, and manners of American teenagers, yet their ethnic identity remains strong and specific. This is particularly true for refugees who arrived in the United States as adolescents; they rarely make friends with American students, and have few cross-ethnic friendships with other Southeast Asians. Refugee teenagers are operating out of the following often conflicting identity systems: (1) Southeast Asian; (2) American; (3) refugee; and (4) adolescent. Refugees who migrated after the age of 11 have suffered particular stress. Despite their reputation for having positive  attitudes toward education, not all Southeast Asians are excelling academically, because of both school-induced problems and discipline problems. The significant influx of Asian immigrants and refugees over the past decade has led to anti-Asian sentiments, and even acts of violence. Peer pressure on immigrant students is even greater than on the American-born, but school counselors and teachers can help. Parent involvement is also helpful, but it requires bilingual personnel. Refugee adolescents often manifest problems in typically American ways, but the underlying causes of their problems are rooted in their pre-immigration, migration, and post-migration experiences. The stress of their adjustment continues to be great long after their survival needs are met. A 10-item list of references  is included. (BJV)",

Demographic trends indicate that the economy will be dependent on the contributions of minority workers, who will comprise 60 percent of the labor force. Yet, school statistics indicate that 70 percent of Hispanic students and 28 percent of Black students drop out of high school, and that those who do graduate are not prepared for higher education. Solutions include the following: (1) improve high school student retention by increasing the quantity and quality of time that students must spend in an enriched, supervised environment supplemented by college student interns; (2) improve the preparation of high school graduates by creating school-college collaboratives  specifically designed to increase minority student achievement on standardized tests and to encourage them to elect and persist in academic programs; (3) increase the number of minority students in the top ten percent of their high school class by developing special academic and financial incentives; (4) improve retention of minority college students by hiring minority faculty, monitoring the attitudes of white faculty, and developing a system of financial rewards and punishments for colleges based on their minority graduation rates; and (5) encourage social tolerance of cultural diversity by developing a comprehensive long-range strategic plan on each college campus to ensure a diverse and tolerant environment.

Major goals are the following: (1) to re-engage street youth in the process of learning and improving their basic skills; (2) to better prepare them to participate in other forms of educational and employment training of their choosing; and (3) to empower them to live more rewarding, personally fulfilling lives. Objectives are to increase the skills of volunteers who work interactively and appropriately with street youth to gain their confidence and cooperation; and to improve volunteers' preparation for  providing basic skills training specifically designed for these youth. The approach to basic skills training described here is based on a series of premises derived from research on functional literacy and from the experience and insights of youth social service professionals. The manual is comprised of a series of six modules, each of which focuses on a separate topic; they are intended to be used in the order presented. Topics are the following: (1) Working with Street Youth; (2) Literacy Skills of School Non-Completers and Literacy Practices of Street Youth; (3) Basic Skills Training: Approaches for Street Youth; (4) Determining an Agency Site for Your Work; (5) Putting It into Practice: Basic Skills Training Techniques; and (6) Support Services for Volunteers.

        "description":"Hispanic-American dropouts are a population seriously at risk socially and economically in the United States. A recent study by the Hispanic Policy Development Project (HPDP), &quot;Too Late to Patch: Reconsidering Second-Chance Opportunities for Hispanic and Other Dropouts,&quot; suggests a number of programs that can benefit the 1.8 million Hispanic youths between the ages of 18 and 24 who have left school without adequate preparation for entry into the workforce. This digest summarizes that study. The HPDP study finds that Hispanic dropout populations are concentrated in inner cities, where unskilled labor opportunities are declining, and that language problems and preparedness to accept underemployment further complicate the problem. Many second-chance job training programs, such as  the Job Partnership Training Act of 1983, are underfunded and over-restrictive; enriched, long-term employment programs, on the other hand, have been found to succeed. &quot;Too Late to Patch&quot; recommends the following strategies to address the special training needs of Hispanic dropouts: (1) programs for adults with families; (2) youth programs for recent dropouts; (3) work study programs; (4) immigrant programs; and (5) programs for parents. Changes in the kinds of jobs available to Hispanic American youth can be effected through the following initiatives: (1) government programs; (2) job ladder programs; (3) public works programs; (4) entrepreneurship programs; and (5) job improvement.

        "description":"Recent evaluations of Federal compensatory education programs funded by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Title I, and maintained by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, Chapter 1, point to qualified effectiveness in the targeting of services, program structures, and classroom arrangements for increasing the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged students. The poverty status of the school should be considered as the first criterion for targeting services and then students' achievement, although most districts further target resources to elementary school students. The smaller class size used in compensatory education classrooms has been strongly linked to increased achievement, but the effectiveness of the extended periods of  compensatory instructional time are less certain. The homogeneous grouping employed in instructional groups is considered detrimental to low-ability students; cooperative learning techniques can be more effective. Evaluations of both Title I and Chapter 1 services demonstrate that the academic achievement of participants in Title I and Chapter 1 programs improved, but the gap between compensatory education students and regular students widened with grade level. Suggested policy changes in Chapter 1 include the following: (1) concentrate and sustain funding in fewer schools in the poorest neighborhoods; (2) permit school-based allocation of funding; and (3) incorporate services more fully into the overall instructional program and keep students in smaller regular classrooms.

Motives for collaborating include the following: (1) schools with a largely disadvantaged population need powerful, vocal support groups; (2) businesses need a highly educated and skilled workforce; (3) health and social service agencies need to connect with clients; (4) arts and cultural institutions need to widen their audiences; and (5) universities and colleges need students with appropriate skills and knowledge demanded by post-secondary education. Collaboratives can be comprised of entire educational systems or single-schools. Individual organizations or coalitions can represent the community side of the  collaboration. Many are student-focused. The Boston Compact and the Rochester Education Initiative are examples of multi-institutional collaboration with an entire district. Umbrella organizations have also developed to advocate, initiate, coordinate, direct, and evaluate collaboratives. Principles of successful collaboratives include the following: (1) commitment; (2) egalitarian decision-making; (3) clarity about roles; (4) clarity and flexibility about methods and goals; and (5) ability to bridge institutional cultures.

Part 1 is a historical review of compensatory education, identifying strategies, programs and services provided, ways it has been evaluated, and the target population it has served. Part 2 discusses the following instructional strategies used in compensatory education programs: (1) pull-out programs; (2) add-on programs; (3) in-class programs; and (4) replacement programs. Problems of instructional coherence are identified. The history of compensatory education has been essentially one of curriculum differentiation rather than pedagogical differentiation. Part 3  addresses issues pertaining to the curriculum, including the coordination of regular and compensatory education classes, and curricula to improve cognitive development; and reading, mathematics, and thinking skills. Part 4 addresses the following topics pertaining to teachers, teaching, and classroom environment: (1) active instruction; (2) relevance; (3) bilingualism and language instruction; (4) cultural pluralism; (5) classroom organization; (6) nurturing the gifted; (7) student grouping; (8) parent involvement; and (9) accelerated schools for at-risk students. Part 5 is a summary.

An introduction discusses the two-stage research design; this consists of case studies of five colleges and a national survey of 32 colleges. Chapter 2 reports on the range of difficulties new lecturers face. Difficulties are categorized under three main headings: getting to know how the college works, adjusting to the Further Education (FE) culture, and teaching. Chapter 3 describes induction arrangements in FE colleges, such as taught courses; planned activities; and informal, ad hoc help. Chapter 4 reports  national survey data from new lecturers about the kinds of arrangements they have found helpful. Findings suggest that informal assistance from departmental colleagues is the most helpful kind. Chapter 5 reports findings that indicate that respondents emphasized one or more of three purposes of induction: provision of information, making new lecturers feel secure, and socializing new lecturers into the world of FE. Chapter 6 discusses the question of the use of student feedback in evaluation of lecturer performance. Chapter 7 identifies induction costs as administrative and personal. Chapter 8 discusses implications for college induction practice and recommends systemization of informal induction. The five case studies are appended. (YLB)",

Although the project intended to secure this information from adults diagnosed as learning disabled, it had to rely on self-reports and educational history to identify the learning-disabled adults, since fewer than half had been officially diagnosed. The research found that the adult learners used a variety of coping strategies for reading, such as guessing the word from context, sounding it out, and using picture clues. Some asked for help from supportive others. They ordered food in restaurants without difficulty by ordering standard items or asking for suggestions from the server or  companions, and they read medicine bottles by the numbers and by memory of doctors' or pharmacists' instructions. Few strategies were used for spelling, although some students used dictionaries or carried lists of frequently used words. The research found that most of these persons were productive and good workers when tasks did not involve reading or writing. Many were good at building and mechanics. The study recommended that teachers capitalize on learners' interests and strengths to design learning experiences to lead them into more complicated reading, for example, using job-related materials.

It involves simple experimentation with potential solutions to common problems. The presence of a professional trained in informal R & D methodologies can facilitate each step in the informal R & D model. Informal R & D promotes several concepts of prime concern to international educators and development experts, including active participation of the local population, focus of teaching/learning content, respect for indigenous agricultural knowledge and skills, and the possibility of development leading to political empowerment and  to demands for change in the distribution of power within society. The many roles that an agricultural or extension educator must be prepared to play under these circumstances can be grouped within five broad categories. Roles in the initial planning stage include those of the researcher, collaborator, and consultant. During implementation, the educator's roles include facilitator, resource person, consultant, and instructor. A key role during evaluation is to guide the process. Professional educators must also report results and serve as trainers. (25 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Agricultural and extension educators interested in international agricultural development must answer several questions to become oriented within the field before undertaking an international assignment. The questions are as follows: (1) why do you want to work internationally? (2) what do you have to offer as a professional? and (3) what is your personal philosophy concerning agricultural development? Educators who are interested and committed to working internationally must determine which institutions, organizations, and agencies are doing what in agricultural or extension education. They should prepare by studying the culture, language, and history of the region. Perhaps the most important activity is networking with personal, professional, and academic acquaintances. After  getting a job and a destination, the educator should prepare to ease the transition by learning to know the other culture, getting to know the facts about the country, getting to know the subject, learning some basics about the language, involving the family, and preparing for travel. Keys to success on the job are communication, flexibility, adoption of the extension philosophy that efforts should be relevant to the recipient of the aid, and awareness of the inevitability of culture shock. To make the return easier, the educator should keep in touch while overseas and anticipate returning. (22 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes teaching and training in terms of certain basic functions and the typical contingencies that affect those functions in practice. Section 1 shows the interrelationships of teaching, training, and learning. Section 2 explores the kinds of learning problems that the independent learner faces and how a planned course can help to alleviate them. Seven functions of courses are identified: selection, induction, structure, teaching, environment, materials, and assessment. Section 3 discusses how each function is affected by seven main variables or contingencies: rationale, regulations, resources, subject, students, staff, and setting. Section 4 describes the nine functions of teaching and training: motivation, orientation, demonstration, explanation, representation,  activation, transmission, evaluation, and support. Section 5 discusses the nine contingencies that affect the functions of teaching and training: aims, content, level, self, student, group, physical context, institutional context, and social context. The final section explores briefly the implications of the contingent approach first for student learning, then for the training of teachers and trainers, and finally for research in these fields. Appendixes include examples of case material and articles on contingency in the management of organizations, the teaching and training of adults, and continuing learning in the workplace as well as 48 reference notes.

The sample was composed of 575 white, black, and mainstreamed special needs high school students.

Operation Mainstream, which was first funded in 1965, provided jobs for chronically unemployed, poor adults in a wide range of activities to improve the social and physical environment primarily in rural areas. Older adults were one of the target groups to be served by Operation Mainstream. Operation Mainstream's older worker component was converted from a pilot project into a national, ongoing program when the 1973 Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments became law. It was officially designated as the Older Americans Community Service Employment Act (Title IX of  the 1973 Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments). Throughout its history, the SCSEP has served some of the most disadvantaged persons in society, particularly those with poverty incomes, limited education, and minority status. Numerous evaluations of SCSEP and its predecessor--the Mainstream Older Workers pilot project--have shown them to be very effective programs that should be retained and strengthened. (Author/KC)",

        "author":["Beder, Hal"],
        "description":"A study was conducted in Iowa to determine why adults eligible for adult basic education (ABE) frequently fail to participate. The study was conducted on a representative sample of 129 persons who had not completed high school, were aged 18 or older, and had not attended ABE classes, through open-ended questions refined into telephone interview questions. The most important reasons advanced by nonparticipant adults reflected negative perceptions about ABE. These reasons were low perception of need, perceived effort, dislike for school, and situational barriers. Low perception of need is associated with older age. Situational barriers (marriage, children to care for, employment) derive from the role responsibilities of adults in midlife. In general, the factors that inhibit  participation were more potent for older adults than for younger ones. The study concluded that it may be more difficult to recruit older adults who see no need for a high school diploma. Therefore, the ABE population, if refined to include only those who have not completed high school and who want to do so, is being much better served than previously thought. Finally, the study recommended that more thought be given to scheduling to aid in recruiting younger adults who have fewer negative perceptions but have more situational barriers to education.

The trend toward integrated manufacturing is worldwide and irreversible, and is evidenced and reinforced by these activities and characteristics: development of new technologies of flexibility; sophistication of world markets; application of integrated types of work organization; and industry restructuring. As integrated manufacturing is implemented, there will be increased need for people with cross-disciplinary, higher-level, and cognitive skills as well as a wider range of skills. The implications for training adults include the following: (1) there must be a greater emphasis on conceptual learning; (2) courses and  course administration should be more flexible; (3) cross-disciplinary training programs should be developed; (4) generic skills such as computer literacy, process development, and quality improvement should be integrated into existing vocational courses; (5) special programs for managers and supervisors should be developed; (6) efforts to retrain workers already on the job should be increased; and (7) industry's level of commitment to training should be increased.

In this context, nonmetropolitan does not mean rural but refers to all areas outside the six Australian capital cities and outside the following cities/areas: Canberra, Newcastle,  Wollongong, Geelong, and the Gold Coast. The material in the following sections answers the four research questions: (1) an overview of postsecondary education provision; (2) demographic and labor market characteristics; (3) policy for the provision and development of postsecondary education; (4) initiatives taken to expand the provision of postsecondary education; (5) factors limiting an expansion in access to postsecondary education; (6) proposals to expand the provision of postsecondary education; (7) census tables; (8) two maps that show population changes in selected government areas of Victoria from 1976-1986; and (9) a map of Department of Local Government and Administration regions.

Data were gathered through a literature search, interviews with experts in the field, and questionnaires mailed to the managers of a range of automotive reconditioning businesses in each Australian state and territory. The study found that there are not enough skilled people to provide the services demanded by racing teams. Skills most needed included welding and electronics. The project clearly identified a need for a post-apprenticeship course that will provide an advanced level of technological skills for the machining,  building, and operation of high performance engine and mechanical components. The course should include instruction in the areas of machining, engine design, engine assembly, engine testing, and welding and fabrication. Appropriate apprenticeships also were recommended for areas of the country in which they are not available. (KC)",

        "description":"The TAFE (Technical and Further Education) National Centre for Research and Development conducted a survey to determine industry needs for quality training in Australia. Interviews were conducted with managers in manufacturing and tourism/hospitality companies throughout Australia, especially with firms with a high reputation. Interview forms were designed to gather data on background information, quality strategy, current and expected quality profile, and quality training needs. Companies interviewed had fewer than 10 to more than 3,000 employees. The survey found that company goals were most often survival, profit, competitiveness, customer service, and the desire to be the best in its particular industry. &quot;Everyone&quot; was the overwhelming response to questions as to who, within  the company, was involved in quality improvement; as to methods, consultants, Australian standards, total quality control, Deming's 14 steps, quality circles, and total quality management formed the basis of quality strategies for the companies surveyed. The tourism/hospitality industry did not appear to have well-defined quality strategies, although quality improvement is important to the industry. Most strategies had been in place since 1986. Training packages of various types are planned by all of the companies surveyed, and TAFE involvement appears to be required. The information obtained from the industry survey will be considered in sample curricula being prepared in the following areas: basic trade apprentice--sheet metal working, associate diploma--mechanical engineering, and  short course--hospitality. Three figures give a breakdown of survey responses and four charts compare current quality practices with practices two years hence as perceived by the industries surveyed. (KC)",

Consequently, future investment strategies should differ among countries that are at different levels of industrialization. Investments in middle-income countries should emphasize rehabilitation, quality improvement, and further development of institutional efficiency. In lower middle-income and larger lower-income countries, investments should support institutional development and policy issues, including separation of vocational education from other education and development of alternatives to direct  government financing. In small low-income countries, resources should be concentrated in nonformal training centers, training quality, development of management capacity in training institutions, and aggressive marketing of training opportunities and services. These and other recommendations were based on the findings from analysis of questionnaire responses that provided quantitative data and narrative descriptive and evaluative data.

        "description":"Competency-based programming for Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) participants is a powerful tool that can be used by Private Industry Councils (PICs) to train youth in, among other things, the work maturity skills vital to finding and keeping employment. Work maturity skills are involved in the following behaviors: being on time for work, working industriously while on the job, getting along with others, dressing appropriately, following directions, completing the tasks assigned, and assuming responsibility. About 450 Service Delivery Areas across the United States have developed competency-based programs to teach work maturity or other competencies. Each local system is made up of the following key components: (1) PIC-recognized competency statements; (2) instruments to  assess participant need; (3) employability plans; (4) classroom and on-site training; (5) evaluations of participant achievement; (6) certificates of achievement; and (7) documentation of participant activities. Following the narrative overview of the issues involved in developing such programs, the major portion of this report for job training professionals consists of seven descriptions of model programs. The descriptions take the form of National Alliance of Business Bulletins. The following sections follow the bulletins: a selected bibliography, a youth employment competency resource list, and a transcript of U.S. Department of Labor regulations that affect work maturity competencies.

This study was undertaken to develop a readily-accessible, standardized measure of Baumrind's parental prototypes. Forty-eight questionnaire items were constructed based upon Baumrind's descriptions of the permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative prototypes. Items were stated from the perspective of an individual evaluating the patterns of authority exercised by his or her parents. Professionals (N=21) in the fields of psychology, social work, sociology, and education evaluated the accuracy of  the items and accepted 36 of the items for the final pool of items. From this pool, 10 permissive, 10 authoritarian, and 10 authoritative items were retained for the Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ). Two forms of the questionnaire were constructed to evaluate the parental authority of mothers and of fathers. Seven studies were conducted to test the PAQ's reliability, internal consistency, content-related validity, criterion-related validity, discriminant-related validity, and its correlations with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The results of these studies showed the PAQ to have highly respectable measures of reliability and validity. The PAQ should be useful for assessing the parental authority exercised by both mothers and fathers and it is appropriate for both  females and males who are older adolescents or young adults.

        "description":"Research has consistently shown parents' nurturance, acceptance, affection, support, and attention to be positively related to their children's self-esteem. Absent in these investigations of the relationship between parental nurturance and self-esteem, however, has been a consideration of whether the nurturance bases upon which these &quot;reflected appraisals&quot; of self-esteem are evaluated vary with changes in age. This study was conducted to investigate the stability of parental nurturance as a basis for mid-adolescent and late-adolescent judgments of global self-esteem. Data were collected from three samples: 61 15-year-old high school sophomores, 98 17-year-old high school juniors and seniors, and 333 19-year-old college students. All subjects were from intact families; high school  students were living with their parents. All subjects completed a demographic questionnaire, the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, and two forms of the Parental Nurturance Scale to measure mother's nurturance and father's nurturance. The results revealed that the self-esteem scores for the 19-year-olds were significantly higher than the scores for the younger age groups. Self-esteem was found to be strongly related to both mother's and father's nurturance at all three age levels. This high level of stability in the relationship between parental nurturance and adolescent's self-esteem across all three age groups suggests that parental nurturance is an important &quot;arena of comfort&quot; for adolescents during the potentially turbulent adolescent years.

        "description":"Most research on battered women concerns women of working class and middle class backgrounds. This study examined differences between poor and non-poor battered women and ways in which poverty mediates the experience of intimate violence. Subject data were obtained on 57 cases of battered women who killed their abusers between 1978 and 1984. Statistical tests were conducted to compare the 30 poor subjects to the 27 non-poor subjects. The results revealed that, compared to non-poor subjects, poor subjects were more likely to be non-white, undereducated, have violence in their family backgrounds, report that they killed their abuser while an attack was ongoing, and have used knives to kill their abuser. They were less likely to have been legally married to their abuser, to have  used a gun to kill their abuser, and to have had expert testimony at their trials. These findings illustrate the existence of both demographic and experiential differences between the poor and the non-poor battered women who killed their abusers. In spite of the unlikely inclusion of expert testimony at trials of poor women, rates of acquittal at trial were not statistically different, possibly due to the finding that poor women used violence at a time that was easier for the jurors to understand as self-defense.

        "description":"As part of the High School and Beyond study, a large nationally representative sample of students was asked whether they lived with their mother, a stepmother, their father, or a stepfather in their sophomore year and again in their senior year of high school. Family configurations consisting of two-parent, one-parent, and stepparent families were identified. Comparisons were made among these three family configurations when the configuration was stable during the last 2 years of high school and when the family configuration changed during this period. A total of 22 senior year and postsecondary outcomes (achievement test scores, school grades, course selection, absenteeism, self-esteem, aspirations, getting into trouble, attending college) were found to be related to different  family configurations. After controlling for background variables (gender, race, socioeconomic status) and comparable sophomore outcomes, differences in family configurations had remarkably little effect on the senior year and postsecondary outcomes. This lack of effect was reasonably consistent across subgroups based on gender, race, religion, socioeconomic status, and other background variables. The results suggest that for a wide variety of outcome variables, growth and change during the last 2 years of high school are relatively unrelated to different family configurations. (Author)",

The results showed that, although CDC's budet for AIDS education  increased significantly between fiscal years 1985 and 1988, CDC's efforts to focus national attention on AIDS prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key activities aimed at the general public. Mass mailings were delayed, airings of televised public service announcements were limited, and access to the telephone hotline was uneven. This report contains a letter describing the investigation and seven appendices, one for each of the six aspects of AIDS education being investigated and one listing the major contributors to the report.

A Boredom Proneness (BP) Scale was developed and administered to college students in Australia, Hong Kong, Lebanon, and the United States. A principal component analysis of the four samples revealed similar factor loadings and alpha coefficients. An analysis of variance among groups manifested a significant main effect of culture, an effect much larger than that for gender which was also significant. The Australian and American samples were similar in their boredom proneness levels. The Lebanese students, followed by the Hong Kong students  reported the highest amounts of boredom proneness. Within all groups, males scored higher than females and significantly so with Americans and Australians. Fifteen &quot;factorially transcultural&quot; items were identified across samples. The results suggest that although boredom may exhibit many shared elements, culturally specific attitudes also exist. (Author)",

CDC officials were interviewed; documents pertaining to CDC counseling and testing programs were obtained; and public health departments receiving CDC funds in Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York City, and San Francisco were visited. Policies and procedures for performing HIV counseling and testing were reviewed at these locations and records kept on program operations were examined. Sixteen counseling and testing sites funded by the grantees were visited. The literature on counseling and testing programs was reviewed, the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Counseling and Testing Act of 1988  was analyzed, and AIDS advocacy groups were met with to obtain their views. Based on this review and analysis of federal counseling and testing legislation debated during the 100th Congress, five salient issues were identified: (1) oversight and evaluation of grantee performance; (2) outreach to intravenous drug users; (3) follow-up and long-term counseling; (4) implementation of partner notification; and (5) antidiscrimination protection for persons infected with HIV. Preliminary findings on these issues should facilitate Congressional oversight and deliberations on federal HIV policy. (NB)",

Forty-three responses to the survey were returned and reviewed by the group. Eighteen programs met the criteria of providing a description of program activities or interventions, a description of evaluation results or effectiveness measures, congruence between the stated goals and interventions described, inclusion of activities that differed from the regular school curriculum, focus on in-school strategies rather  than programs for youths not currently enrolled, and evidence of program credibility and enthusiasm for the program on the part of the respondents. This document summarizes characteristics of the 18 programs in these topic areas: goals and objectives; major program activities; types and frequency of instruction; staff development; program funding; program staffing; program histories; program plans for the future; measures of program effectiveness; withdrawals from programs; and major program accomplishments.

Open-ended interviews were conducted with principals (N=26) and/or counselors (N=22) from 36 programs identified as effective. When asked about key activities in their programs, 95% of the counselors mentioned individual and small group counseling, 82% cited involvement of teachers and staff, and 82% mentioned high visibility with students. Counselors reported spending almost 30% of their time in counseling activities, over 25% in group guidance activities, and 16% consulting with teachers and parents. Principals of  elementary schools having effective guidance programs called their programs child-oriented, developmental, involving parents and teachers, and able to provide a balance between counseling and classroom guidance activities. Principals reported providing financial resources, appropriate materials and supplies, adequate facilities, and personal support to their guidance programs. Counselors reported that a supportive principal and adequate facilities contributed most to program effectiveness.

The studies were concerned with experiences of adults entering and moving through educational administration, graduate school training, student teaching, nursing, and law enforcement. Empirical evidence was found to support Van Gennep's notion of the three stages of separation, transition, and incorporation occurring as phases within the transition stage when that stage takes place over a prolonged period of time. Using the concept of a three-phase sequence within the transition stage as a structure for deeper analysis of  four of the 10 studies, three distinguishable patterns were found regarding the ways in which individuals locate themselves in the transition stage. The three patterns of self-location were: (1) comparison of one's self with others; (2) comparison of self, especially job related performance with role requirements; and (3) comparison of self with one's self in a temporal sense of past, present, and future.

This study examined the underlying concepts or beliefs people hold about money and the extent to which different needs can be fulfilled by money. Subjects (N=689) were adults in a variety of occupations who responded to a 25-page questionnaire measuring attitudes towards money as well as other variables, including the Money Ethic Scale. The results of a principal components factor analysis identified six clearly interpretable factors: achievement and obsession, good, power, expression, evil, and management of money. Results showed that males tended to have stronger  positive attitudes toward money than did females. The overall value of money was associated with theoretical, economic, and political values and was negatively associated with aesthetic, social, and religious values. People's perception of money as a symbol of achievement and obsession was associated with many aspects of dissatisfaction with the job and life. Compared with previous studies, results supported the validity of the Money Ethic Scale. However, it appears that people's attitudes toward money may be influenced by sex, economic status, experiences, associates, employment situation, and many personality variables. (ABL)",

One important aspect of self-cognition concerns the complexity of self-representations. This study tested the hypothesis that self-complexity, as assessed by Linville's self-trait sorting task, would moderate the effects of positive and negative daily events on the perceived quality of life in undergraduate subjects (N=163). It was expected that as self-complexity increased the positive effect of positive daily events and the negative effect of negative daily events on perceived quality of life would decrease. Results revealed that although both positive and negative daily events influenced perceived quality of life scores, these scores were not influenced by the  interaction between self-complexity and daily events. These findings suggest that, when major life events occur, high self-complexity short-circuits the spread of negative affect through the self-structure, but, on a daily basis, it creates a demand to juggle multiple self-aspects. Future research should investigate whether self-complexity is more likely to interact with major, as opposed to daily, events. (ABL)",

The High School and Beyond data base provides a unique opportunity to explore issues related to dropping out. This study used data from the High School and Beyond 1980 base-year survey, the second follow-up survey in 1984, and the 1986 follow-up survey to investigate the experiences of dropouts and high school graduates having no postsecondary education in 1986, 4 years after the projected date of graduation. Dropouts and graduates were compared on self-esteem, alcohol use, political and social participation variables, work satisfaction, salary of current job, periods of unemployment, and number of jobs. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the  degree to which dropping out explained the variance in these measures when gender, socioeconomic status, and academic achievement were held constant. Dropouts were found to differ little from graduates with no postsecondary education on many personal and social adjustment measures. Distinct differences between dropouts and graduates did emerge in alcohol use, some areas of political participation, number of jobs, and periods of unemployment. The findings reinforce the conclusion that dropouts are less likely than high school graduates to participate in the mainstream of democratic life and in stable employment. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Some researchers have found men to attribute more sexual meaning to heterosexual interactions than do women. This study was conducted to examine factors which may enhance or diminish this gender difference on perceptions of sexual intent by considering the three variables of physical attractiveness of target, similarity of target's personality to his or her partner's personality, and whether the respondent was a high or low self-monitor. Male (N=94) and female (N=94) undergraduates were grouped in mixed-sex pairs and discussed their likes and dislikes about college life. Subjects then rated their partners on a set of sexuality trait adjectives. The results revealed that males perceived their female partners as more seductive, sexy, and promiscuous than females perceived their  male partners. Both males and females perceived highly physically attractive people in more sexual terms than they did those who were of average or below average physical attractiveness. In addition, both genders attributed more sexuality to partners perceived as possessing a personality very similar to their own. While these results do not help predict which individuals are more likely to misperceive others, they do help predict who is most likely to be misperceived. (NB)",

It notes that the AIDS questionnaire was designed to provide baseline estimates of public knowledge and attitudes about AIDS transmission, the prevention of AIDS virus infection, and changes in knowledge and attitudes over time. A section on selected findings reports that over 99% of respondents had heard of AIDS; 89% were certain that AIDS leads to death; 83% were certain there is no cure for AIDS; over 90% were aware of AIDS transmission through sexual contact with a person with AIDS or through sharing a needle for drug use with someone having AIDS; over 70% had heard about blood tests for AIDS; 90% felt  they personally had no chance or a low chance of getting AIDS; and almost 90% realized that both celibacy and restricting sexual activity to a monogamous relationship with a person who did not have AIDS were effective ways to avoid the virus. Table 1 displays provisional estimates of the percentage distributions of persons 18 years of age and over by response categories according to age, gender, race, and marital status. In most cases, the actual question asked of the respondent is reproduced verbatim in table 1, along with the response categories. In a few cases, questions or response categories have been rephrased or combined. Results are discussed concerning respondents' awareness of AIDS, self-perceived knowledge about AIDS, general knowledge about AIDS, transmission of AIDS, blood  tests for AIDS, risk of getting AIDS, AIDS prevention, and AIDS discussion and education.

A project overview describes how the program used counselor education/teacher education/administrator education as a preservice approach for developing attitudes, knowledge, and skills in counselors, teachers, and administrators. It notes that the training focused on maximizing school personnel's career guidance efforts on behalf of the secondary school students they would serve, and that the overriding goal of the project was to refocus preservice education programs upon developing a coordinated role for the delivery of career guidance information and services to students. The project is described as  focusing on developing a model career development center; experiences and materials to be included in teacher, counselor, and administrator courses; and collaborative activities to enhance understanding and working relationships among the three groups. It is concluded that these project goals were accomplished during a 3-year period with an end product of project information available for dissemination to other institutions. A section on project development chronicles activities which took place in each of the 3 years of the project. A list of advisory committee members, sample letters to publishers and a project overview, a list of competencies, and the script for a slide/tape presentation and related project materials are appended.

        "description":"This study examined the connection between persistence behavior and beliefs about one's own likely or potential performance. Undergraduates (N=114) in teacher education were asked to write test items for weekly topics in a one-semester educational psychology course, based on information conveyed in lectures and text. Subjects could write as many or as few items per week as they chose for 10 weeks. Improvements in grades would be given for the number of items written relative to other subjects. Subjects were told how many points they had earned and were never told where they stood relative to others. At the start of each week, subjects estimated how many items they would write that week and how sure they were about their estimate (perceived self-efficacy), and how important it was  and how likely it was that they would earn a bonus in their grade for item-writing (outcome expectations). Responses were used to classify subjects into high, medium, and low self-efficacy groups. Performance on the item-writing task was compared for the three groups over time. The results showed that those who believed they would put in effort and do the work actually did even more than they anticipated doing, while those who expected to do little actually did even less. The findings suggest that there are three distinct groups of performers who differ greatly in their persistence on a self-regulatory task. It was concluded that self-regulated performance is a legitimate motivationally based phenomenon that can be studied, and that students vary greatly in the degree to which they engage  in self-regulated performace.

Estate recovery programs require Medicaid recipients whose primary assets are their homes to contribute toward the cost of their nursing home care in the same manner required of recipients whose assets are in the form of stocks, bonds, and cash. The General Accounting Office studied Medicaid nursing home programs in eight states, focusing particular attention on the estate recovery program operated by Oregon. The objective was to discover the potential financial impact of such programs on Medicaid and whether they provide a mechanism that is acceptable to the elderly for sharing the costs of  nursing home care. Results showed that estate recovery programs provide a cost effective way to offset state and federal costs, while promoting more equitable treatment of Medicaid recipients. Oregon recovers about $10 for every $1 spent administering the program. In the eight states studied, as much as two-thirds of the amount spent for nursing home care for Medicaid recipients who owned a home could be recovered from their estates or the estates of their spouses. If implemented carefully, estate recovery programs can achieve savings, while treating the elderly equitably and humanely. (Charts, graphs, and tables illustrate the document.) (ABL)",

Eight exemplary guidance programs were examined in order to identify effective approaches and strategies that could be replicated. A literature review suggested that counselors should spend less time modifying individual student behaviors and more time improving the learning environment. Interview and observation instruments were designed to collect data specifically pertaining to 10 ideal guidance practices identified in the literature review. Results showed that successful guidance programs operated as integral parts of schools' overall educational functions. These exemplary programs also provided a wide range of guidance services to their students, staff, and parents and served as the fulcrum for a variety of  human resources for at-risk children and their families. Successful guidance programs were supported by faculties that were responsive and willing to share in the planning and implementation of guidance functions. Successful counselors served more children more effectively through active collaboration with community social service professionals and provided leadership and direction in the operation of school pupil personnel committees. Principals should bring counselors into schoolwide programming and decision-making, and greater initiatives should be exercised in building a strong parent constituency. (ABL)",

Further, it was determined how different aspects of the situation interacted with the protege variable and which rules were violated when dealing with proteges verus non-proteges. The second study investigated how personal mentoring history affects decision making style using the same group of managers, 44 of whom responded. Using a modified version of the Vroom-Yetton cases, results showed that participation in decision making was not always a developmental tool and more importantly, participation did not ensure  quality decisions. Managers who had been mentored varied their participation more between proteges and non-proteges than did other managers. They did not, however, make better decisions than other managers. Practical points to make the most of mentoring include remembering it is when one particpates, not that one participates that is important; being careful not to overprotect proteges; and being sensitive to non-proteges.

In order to help caregivers deal with stress effectively and to improve the care in residential care facilities, it is essential to learn more about the particular stressors that managers of such facilities experience. In this study, owners and managers of residential care facilities were surveyed to find out how much stress they experienced and how they coped with it. Data were gathered from 175 National Association of Residential Care Managers members. Lifestyle and personality traits were assessed to see how they affected perceived stress and career satisfaction. High levels of perceived stress as well as high levels of job satisfaction were found. No  differences were found between male and female managers. The most common coping strategies were to bury one's feelings, to concentrate on what to do next, to stand one's ground, and to talk to someone about the problem. The negative correlation between perceived stress and job satisfaction suggests that emotional satisfaction that comes from serving their clients may be an uplift that compensates for the negative aspects of stress experienced by respondents and that other researchers failing to find such compensation should consider measures of job satisfaction as well as measures of health.

No significant gender differences were found on any of the tacit knowledge measures, although men did score slightly higher than women. The only significant correlation for the entire sample was the number of times married, with those married fewer times scoring higher on tacit knowledge. This suggests that the general skills necessary to maintain a long-term marriage are related to those necessary for managerial success. Someone who felt competent on the job and was more interpersonally  competent was more likely to mentor than others. Older women were less satisfied with their jobs than were younger women.

Because selection cases are the most common, they have set the standards for how adverse impact is typically determined. The most common way to demonstrate adverse impact is to show that the proportion of minorities hired is less than what is expected based on their availability. Further, it may mask the positive effects of strong affirmative action policies. Selection and termination ought not to be separated in evaluating a company's affirmative action policy. Who is hired affects who gets fired. To judge a company's termination practices, one must first ask questions about the company's hiring practices. If the company gives more minorities a chance by having separate  cut-offs for minorities, it is inevitable that a larger percentage will fail. The more valid the selection procedure, the more dramatic this effect. An employer might be able to mitigate this result somewhat by better training and support for hired minorities, but the link between giving people a chance and their likelihood of failure is a statistical fact.

Various explanations have been put forth, including gender discrimination, biological and/or socialization differences between the sexes and differential demands of parenthood. However, none of these explanations seems to account for the magnitude of the differences. One overlooked explanation for women's lower success rate is the difference between the task facing women and the task facing men. It may be that women's tasks are inherently more complex than men's. There are differences between men and women in the following: (1) the task of becoming an expert; (2) learning from experience; (3) heuristics; (4) pattern recognition; (5) good experiences; (6) importance of the task;  (7) managers' tasks; (8) sample size of role models; (9) feedback; (10) base rate information; and (11) judgment under uncertainty.

        "description":"In light of the fact that students at risk of dropping out of school have become the focus of national attention, this paper examines one alternative program designed to work with a population considered to be at very high risk for dropping out. The population served by the School-Community Guidance Center (SCGC) in the Austin (Texas) Independent School District is described as consisting of those students who present with poor attendance patterns, minimal skills, problems with behavior, and some contact with juvenile court authorities. This paper is divided into five segments. The first part looks at the nature of Rice Secondary School which houses the School-Community Guidance Center. The second part looks at services provided by SCGC in 1987-88. The characteristics of the SCGC  are the focus of the third section. In the fourth part, the focus is on what happened to students when they left the SCGC. The last section presents results of a dropout study of former Rice students. (ABL)",

The objectives of the study included estimating the distribution of global professional satisfaction among practicing counselors; examining the relationships between counselors' global professional satisfaction and demographics and experiential/situational factors; and examining the validity and applicability of Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory of job satisfaction to the role of professional counselor. Data were collected in a nationwide sample survey of 742 practicing counselors. Findings revealed that: (1) global professional satisfaction among counselors was substantially higher than among employed persons generally; (2) far  more school counselors prepared in counseling graduate programs or psychology graduate programs were highly satisfied with their profession than were school counselors prepared in other graduate programs (such as social work or education); (3) far more male counselors who worked in specialties other than school counseling were highly satisfied with their profession than were male school counselors or female counselors, regardless of work setting; and (4) Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory did not explain the dimensions of professional satisfaction and dissatisfaction of practicing counselors. Results imply that effective preparation of professional counselors requires that they be realistically informed about the contexts and major tasks their jobs are likely to impose.

        "description":"It has been suggested that current measures used in investigating religion are a mixture of questions concerning values, beliefs, and behaviors and are mixed in their factorial purity. Another difficulty is that there is a relative lack of research on different religions and their specific beliefs. The present study utilized a scale of homogeneous focus in order to delineate the beliefs and religious activities of a group of fundamentalistic Christians as compared to a control sample of college students. The subjects included students (N=44) enrolled in a fundamentalistic Christian bible study group and students (N=73) enrolled in undergraduate psychology courses. The two groups were administered the revised, Likert version of the Walker and Wrobel (1987) Scale of Theistic  Beliefs, a modified form of the Brown and Lowe (1951) Religious Participation Scale, and a demographic information questionnaire. On the Scale of Theistic Beliefs, the bible study group scored significantly higher than the college sample in the keyed theisitic direction, and on the total scale score. On the Religious Participation Scale, the bible study group scored significantly higher on all seven dimensions assessed in the direction of more frequent participation, placing greater importance on their church, and reporting a stronger faith. Results may reflect the greater homogeneity of the bible study group with less emphasis on individual interpretation of the college group. This points to a most interesting difference between the nature of the religious experience of the two samples.  References and four tables are included. (ABL)",

        "description":"Results of the 1985-86 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey of American students' knowledge of computers suggest that American schools have a long way to go before computers can be said to have made a significant impact. The survey covered the 3rd, 7th, and 11th grade levels and assessed competence in knowledge of computers, computer applications, and computer programming. Results indicated a widespread lack of familiarity with computer applications and programming as well as an emphasis on teaching programming rather than using computers in subject areas such as reading and English. Results also showed that roughly 30% of students had access to computers at home, but that socioeconomic factors played a disturbing role in limiting mminority students' access  to computers. Despite the overall poor results, the rumored stall in the &quot;computer revolution&quot; disappears upon close examination. The NAEP results are 2 years old, based on generally unreliable self-report information, derived from a multiple choice test in a field which is primarily &quot;hands on.&quot; The report's general conclusions are also heavily weighted by the computer programming section, but general computer literacy is unrelated to knowledge of computer programming. The computer revolution may be a growing surge rather than an explosion. (RS)",

To achieve a better understanding of narrative prose, yet still keep the benefits of semantic mapping, the traditional approach can be modified into a technique called &quot;episodic mapping.&quot; Episodic mapping is based on the idea that most stories contain several major ideas and follow a particular structure, typically called story grammar. While the grammar of individual stories may vary, the structures of most stories focus around setting, plot, and resolution. The five elements in episodic mapping include: setting, problem/goal, major episodes, theme, and resolution. After episodic mapping is understood, the next step is to teach it to the students. In a classroom application, students  grades 3 through 6 were very responsive to episodic mapping, with &quot;low&quot; students benefitting the most. Episodic mapping has potential for the reading teacher who is trying to teach and encourage interest in narrative prose. (MM)",

The listener tells the experts the problem and the experts offer solutions to the problem. The leader records the solutions so that the listener is free to focus on the solutions. When everyone has had a chance to offer a solution to the problem, the leader gives the list of solutions to  the listener and the group disperses before there is a chance to confuse the situation with more solutions. Using this technique, a number of solutions to classroom problems can be quickly obtained. (MM)",

After Monday's pretest, the children worked with an adult for about five minutes on one of the computer programs for presenting the words. They continued working on the same words in the same programs from Monday through Thursday and were given printouts of the pictures and words they produced. Spelling strategies included preliterate &quot;random&quot; sequences, immediate responses in direct copying, delayed responses in studying a word before it  vanished, oral and manual rehearsal, and visual and phonological spelling strategies. These three case studies showed several examples of stronger visual influences on spellings at an earlier stage of spelling development than has been reported with paper and pencil spellings. Overall, results suggested that serious consideration should be given to having children do their spelling on the computer. (One table of data and two figures are included.) (MM)",

Students use the basals on Mondays and retell the texts on paper. They spend the rest of the week writing stories, reading them, and sharing them with other students. Every week they have a real radio show where they read and tell their own stories, sing songs, and ask their listeners to write them letters. By the end of the year they have written 11 different kinds of stories, as well as articles, letters, plays, books, and puppet shows. All the stories are collected in a storybook which is retained as an example for next year's  students. Students keep track of their own progress by referring to a list of essential reading skills inside their individual reading folders. The most important benefit of this approach is that student motivation to read is high, unlike the low motivation which accompanied the purely basal reader approach. Every student in the teacher's class is reading avidly, none is failing, and absenteeism is down. (RS)",

Several hypothetical structural models were tested for \"goodness of fit.\" Time spent reading out of class was found to have little relationship with any of the other variables, and no significant differences were found relative to these variables with respect to gender. The best fit model suggested that spelling achievement results from  knowledge of letter-sound correspondences, which in turn results from verbal IQ and the extent to which reading is carried on using full graphemic cues. Verbal IQ also heavily determined the full graphemic cues tendency and reading comprehension. (One table of data, one figure, and 17 references are attached.) (MM)",

Virtually all methods of assessing reading are indirect, even those that claim to directly assess reading processes. The product of reading should, however, reflect the process the test-taker uses to generate the responses that produce a reading comprehension  test score. A reader's awareness of thought processes involved in reading has recently been called &quot;metacognition,&quot; and test designers are now including items that supposedly measure this. The as yet limited research on the metacognitive aspects of reading has indicated that multiple-choice tests and written retellings have construct validity. While the scores (products) of these tests may not reveal direct information about the processes students use to complete them, the tasks do appear to involve mental processes that have long been associated with reading.

But the representation of rhetoric offered by these theorists is often partial and incomplete. Those calling for an epistemological revolution or interpretive turn have played an important role in enabling rhetoric to &quot;get out from under&quot; its historical domination by philosophy, but they deny rhetoric's own traditional commitment to a fully situated understanding of discourse when they downplay all other features  except textuality. Those in composition studies, grounded as they are in rhetorical theory yet engaged with the tough day-to-day concerns of literacy, are well situated to contribute to this theoretical effort.

        "description":"To bridge the gap between literature and composition, and between tradition and individual talent, teachers of literature and composition should consider how Roman rhetoricians integrated many arts into their instruction on oratory. With the perspectives of Cicero and Quintilian in hand, teachers would be inclined to stress rhetorical argumentation, which incorporates both narrative and logical reasoning. Characterizing the interrelationship between narrative and logical discourse is crucial for understanding the nature of rhetorical argumentation. Both Cicero and Quintilian emphasized the place of narration in preparing and arranging orations. Argumentation was understood as the blending of several arts into a complex whole. Viewed as a whole, classical oration had two  faces--logical and narrative proof. Proof (confirmatio) was the decontextualized, explicit, logical version of the narrative; and the narrative (narratio) was the contextualized, personalized, implicit version of the proof. One way to provide a structure for teaching rhetorical argumentation in introductory courses is to provide students with questions which raise rhetorical consciousness and to require students to ask these questions of both the texts they read and the texts they produce. Through a rhetorical perspective, teachers can help provide students with guidelines for evaluating texts as well as for writing their own texts.

Classes on the writing of research papers can be made more realistic by: (1) having students find some problem in their professional, personal, or academic life that needs to be solved by research; (2) making sure that students already know quite a bit about the topic on which they will be doing research; and (3) having students choose a topic that is practical rather than theoretical, and technical rather than academic.

Three models and their metaphorical foundations are currently at work in pedagogical stances attempting to empower students: (1) the conflict metaphor; (2) the midwife metaphor; and (3) the web metaphor. A metaphor of conflict is built through a rhetoric of aggression that is exclusionary and defeating; in spite of the beneficial side to this model of struggle, the negative can outweigh the positive. The metaphorical construct of teacher as midwife leads to &quot;connected&quot; teaching and learning. The midwife image views the teacher as a conductor of knowledge. This model may be difficult for the male to internalize, and it appears to view teachers as passive.  Yet, teachers must be actively present to help students grapple with positive aspects of the struggle inherent in this model: conflicting voices, challenges, difficult ideas, and strenuous reading and writing tasks. Finally, the metaphor of the web may be more easily internalized by male teachers and students, and it implies more structure than that of the midwife metaphor. The web metaphor suggests that students already have the authority and voice with which to spin their own interpretations and conversations about texts. When connected to a model of writing, the metaphor both suggests a final product and views writing as a process. English educators need to choose the best metaphors to empower students. (MM)",

Few studies assess how or how well students acquire the skills necessary for using computers effectively as writing tools. Studies that do reveal the complexity of the teaching/learning situation. Teaching and assessing electronic technology needs a place in the writing curriculum. For example, a writing teacher could teach the writing component and  a desktop publishing instructor could teach a lab on the technology.

Research was organized into two phases, the exploratory study (report 2) and the teaching study (reports 3-10). The teaching study involved four sections of a freshman course called Reading-to-Write, with a total of 72 students. Procedures are described in terms of five questions the research hoped to answer. The introduction also traces the history  of the collaborative research project, reflecting on the process of research itself and sharing some of the problems and issues that arise in attempting to study cognition in context. The introduction concludes with a preview of six key observations that emerged from the study.

Subjects, 57 students enrolled in freshman composition, wrote an essay on time management and had their think-aloud protocols recorded as they composed their first drafts. The subjects' essays were then examined and the subjects were interviewed. The report first examines the methodologies involved in reading students' papers and listening to their remarks, explores some students' and educators' positions on the nature of reading and writing,  and explains some of the ways in which ideology functions in a society and in educational systems in general. The report then explores three interrelated culturally-based assumptions which seem to have guided many of the students' determinations of their task definition: the desire for closure; a belief in objectivity; and a refusal to write about perceived contradictions.

Subjects, 17 freshmen (of a total of 72 participating either as controls or as experimental subjects), had their think-aloud protocols recorded and were interviewed concerning their approaches to writing. The report presents a conceptual framework for understanding how freshmen deal with academic writing as a cognitive and social process, but explicitly rejects the &quot;deficit model&quot; (in which students are presumed to lack basic writing skills) and the more traditional staged developmental model in favor of  a more contextualized, more strategic picture. The report also examines one set of strategies students used to construct an organizing idea. Implications are that cognitive and social forces may be working together against students adapting and extending the processes they already use in order to enter the more sophisticated academic discourse community.

At the same time, a recent survey of the most widely assigned literary works in high schools found that the high school canon changed very little between 1963 and 1989. The ERIC database provides several resources for administrators and teachers who wish to offer their students varied literary and cultural experiences. The classroom teacher is undoubtedly the most important element in any literature program that encompasses cultural themes. An interested teacher can learn much about the cultural characteristics (and negative stereotypes) of the cultural groups  represented in the classroom. The general theme of multi-ethnic literature can be simple: diversity. The study of diversity of cultures offers schools a richer potential than does uniformity or monoculture. (MM)",

The study of task representation reported here explores how students and teachers perceive the same writing assignment by comparing the reported representations of a reading-to-write task from freshman writers with the essay evaluations from trained judges. Subjects, 72 students enrolled in four sections of a freshman composition course, received a follow-up assignment to revise their first draft of a time management essay. The experimental group received instruction in &quot;organizing plans&quot; and an introduction to writing issues in task representation, and completed a Self-Analysis  Checklist (S-AC). The control group received the lecture (minus the revision assignment) and an introduction to the self-analysis procedure. Trained judges then rated the essays produced by both groups. Comparison of the judges' and the students' representation of the task indicated that judges and students disagreed far more than they agreed on features in the final product, but that these rival perceptions could be tempered by prompting and instructing students to &quot;interpret with a purpose&quot; when they revised a first draft. Results also indicated that the bases for the different perceptions and expectations are the more interesting and practical findings from this study.

        "description":"To examine perspectives of change in individual-organizational socialization, a study used the retrospective interview technique (RIT) to reconstruct the history and process of individuals' socialization experiences over an 8-month period. Using the RIT, researchers asked subjects, 28 entering graduate students enrolled in three communication departments, to identify and plot all turning points in their departmental relationships since first meeting their relational partners. Two interviews were conducted with each participant, the first approximately 4 months after the beginning of the academic year, and the second approximately 4 months after the first interview. Both interviews were identical and focused on turning points which occurred during the 4 months preceding the  interview. Participants plotted and explained their identification levels at the time of the interviews and at the beginning of the 4-month period, then plotted points in between, when identification increased or decreased. As each point was identified and plotted, interviewers probed for details regarding the change in identification. Level of identification with the academic department was assessed with a shortened version of the Organizational Identification Questionnaire (OIQ). Results revealed 15 turning point types including: moving in; settling in; socializing; sense of community; receiving informal recognition; gaining formal recognition; jumping informal hurdles; representing the organization; and alienation. Results indicated that several turning point types were associated with  immediate change in organizational identification while others were associated with levels of identification at the end of the 8-month period.

        "description":"Successful speech should rest not on prepared notes and outlines but on genuine oral discourse based on &quot;data&quot; fed into the &quot;software&quot; in the computer which already exists within each person. Writing cannot speak for itself, nor can it continually adjust itself to accommodate diverse response. Moreover, no matter how skillfully performed, as though it were spontaneous and interactive, the predetermined speech can never in fact be either. Basic communication classes, particularly for scientists and engineers, should primarily address the restoration of an oral experience of the shared and sounded word. The categories of data that the mental software of the orator needs to draw on are: (1) thorough knowledge of the subject; (2) audience awareness; (3) the speaker's own oral style;  and (4) an understanding of the theory behind the communication process. Perhaps the greatest evidence that can be offered to stress the virtue of orality is that the computer only works well in consort with its human belief system. The contemporary human computer possesses the capacity to evolve and act on an infinite body of potential intentions. (Seventeen footnotes are attached.) (RS)",

        "description":"Arguments on topicality have the potential of becoming an infinite regress both as they are articulated in debate theory as well as how they are developed by debaters in rounds. An &quot;Equal Ground&quot; criterion is proposed as an effective means of assessing topicality. This criterion assumes the reasonability standard of topicality. Additionally, it assumes that the function of debate is to facilitate clash over substantive issues embodied by the resolution. Further, it is argued that topicality, as a procedural issue, should be evaluated by its relationship to eliciting the substantive issues of the debate. Topicality is the means by which substantive issues are defined and emerge. Current standards for resolving topicality, particularly the &quot;reasonable&quot; definition standard, are  deficient in promoting this function. Finally, the Equal Ground criterion accepts the premise that the effect of the topicality issue should be to apportion approximately equal ground to the Affirmative and Negative teams. Equal Ground represents an additional warrant in the debate arsenal which may increase the likelihood of the debate focusing on the substantive rather than the procedural issues. (MM)",

Results of the interviews showed that (1) candidates regarded debates as strategy--how to show a favorable aspect of themselves or their record while trying to expose some negative aspect about their opponent; (2) candidates were  not uniform in their opinions of what is a desirable debate format although the majority agreed that some time for head-to-head confrontation between candidates is reasonable; (3) televised debates were a very important part in solidifying in the voters' minds which candidate to vote for; (4) candidates were not opposed to debating under most circumstances and cited only extreme examples when asked when would they not debate; and (5) candidates generally liked debating because they wanted to prove to themselves that they were good debaters, it built their self-confidence as a candidate, and it could spark a trend in post-debate coverage that could last for weeks.

A questionnaire distributed to all reporters and news managers at the three stations probed various attitudes and skills behind the generation of story ideas. Return rate was 74%. Results indicated that while 84% of the reporters and news managers said reporters should be responsible for their own story ideas on a daily basis, the bulk of the story ideas were generated by such middle management employees as the assignment editor  or executive producer, with the assignment editor shouldering the largest share.

Subjects, 344 adults in a large midwestern city, were interviewed by telephone. People's  perceptions of what would increase their own productivity were divided into several categories: (1) personal control; (2) external help with individual initiative; and (3) external control in the workplace.

Subjects, 140 students enrolled in communication courses at a large southeastern university, randomly placed in one of six experimental groups or in the control group, were asked to evaluate the public relations release reportedly written by either a male or female &quot;J. Smith&quot; exhibiting one of three predetermined levels of attractiveness. The experimental groups read the press release and saw a photograph of &quot;J. Smith&quot;; the control group read  the same release but did not see a photo. Subjects then rated the spokesperson, &quot;J. Smith,&quot; on scales measuring source attraction, credibility, and distraction. Additionally, they responded to a 10-item questionnaire concerning perceptions of the organization sponsoring the press release. Results indicated that (1) the PR spokesperson's level of attraction did make differences in readers' perceptions of source credibility, but that such effects were a product of the interaction of spokesperson sex and the sex of the reader; and (2) where sex of reader and sex of spokesperson were concerned, cross-sex pairings yielded more positive reactions than did same-sex pairing.

        "description":"As part of its school restructuring work with states, the National Governors' Association commissioned the Center for Policy Research on Education to conduct case studies of several local school districts experimenting with new structural arrangements. This case study is based on visits to four such districts: Jefferson County Schools (Louisville, Kentucky); Dade County Public Schools (Miami, Florida); Poway Unified School District (Poway, California); and New Orleans Public Schools (Louisiana). The first chapter describes how each district is restructuring its system. The Jefferson system exemplifies a change approach in an urban setting centered about professional development and increased resources for school staff. Poway exemplifies a suburban system that has empowered  teachers by decentralizing most district functions to its schools. Dade County represents a district shifting to school-based management and shared decision-making in the nation's fourth largest school system. The New Orleans system demonstrates how a creative partnership with an advocacy group can facilitate new roles and models for structural change. The chapter closes by summarizing pioneering efforts of five other districts in California, Ohio, Indiana, New York State and New York City. The second chapter analyzes some common problems in approaching structural change and explains how some districts have overcome barriers. The final chapter summarizes district initiatives and discusses implications for state actions. If states do not act to support and reinforce district goals and  actions, schools will be trapped by conflicting expectations and be unable to change. Included are 12 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"As part of its school restructuring work with states, the National Governors' Association sponsored a March 1988 working meeting of experts to define common issues confronting educators and policymakers. Besides initiating dialogue between these groups, the meeting concentrated discussion on early state and district efforts. This essay summarizes the session's major themes, identifies school restructuring obstacles, outlines emergent strategies in use, and offers guidance to state-level policymakers. Challenges to schools include student performance, the crisis in the supply of teaching talent, and accountability. According to participants, many internal obstacles to change exist, including an unwarranted sense of safety and security in the present structure, educators' hesitancy  to become responsible for standards and success criteria, treatment of the teaching and learning task as less important than one's role in the system, unwillingness to take risks, and the difficulty of connecting reform proposals to everyday school life. External constraints against school-level change are an already crowded policy agenda, competing and conflicting reform messages, and unrealistic implementation schedules. Next, ways to promote public awareness, fit &quot;little tries&quot; into comprehensive plans, and cope with middle-management behavior are discussed. Finally, examples of state strategies from Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, and Washington are presented. States have generally chosen a project-grant-and-waiver strategy relying heavily on school-level initiative. Challenges facing  states are also summarized. An appendix contains a list of participants. (MLH)",

The issues identified in this report indicate the need to: reduce the cost and preserve the integrity of higher education student loan and grant programs; enhance the federal role in monitoring lenders, agencies, and schools involved in grant programs; and strengthen departmental management of data on individual student loans. The complexity of the federal student loan and grant program, coupled with default costs, demands greater departmental control. To enable the system to function effectively, the Secretary of Education should (1) encourage better collection practices by lenders and guaranty agencies; (2) increase incentives for lenders,  agencies, and schools to protect federal financial interests; (3) enhance program monitoring of lending participants; and (4) improve the quality of data the Department of Education maintains on individual student loans. To enhance the federal role in elementary and secondary education programs, the Department of Education should (1) provide better guidance for program implementation of Chapter 1 and 2 legislation; and (2) work with states to ensure the availability of nationwide data needed to gauge program success. Finally, the Secretary of Education must strengthen departmental management by increased secretarial involvement and an improved financial management system that prevents waste of resources and generates reliable financial reports.

        "author":["Odden, Allan"],
        "description":"Despite pessimism concerning school funding prospects and the deep recession of the early 1980s, this article shows that real school revenues during 1980-1988 continued to increase at substantial rates. The first section discusses school revenues in the context of the country's gross national product and personal income from 1960 to 1980. While fiscal support for schools was strong during this period, teachers' real salaries declined by 19 percent between 1970-1980. The second section briefly describes the funding increases needed to finance the education reforms proposed during the 1980s--both the high standards, expectations, and requirements recommended in \"A Nation at Risk\" and programs to upgrade the teaching profession proposed in \"A Nation Prepared.\" The final section  provides national, regional, and state detail on educational finance changes in relation to funds needed for reforms. This section also discusses changes in total education revenues from all sources and on a per pupil basis, focusing on the 1980, 1983, and 1988 periods and comparing changes in the 1980s to those in the 1970s. During the 1980s, education funding moved upward, but consumed a smaller percentage of gross national product and personal income. The 1988 figure (3.57 percent) is higher than the 1983 figure (3.54 percent), but less than the 1980 figure (3.61 percent). However, funding per pupil rose 33 percent in an era of continued tax and expenditure limitation. This effect is partly due to small enrollment increases between 1980 and 1988. Average teacher salaries are also  rising in real terms (22 percent), though lagging behind total real funding growth (26 percent) and per pupil growth (31 percent). Most significantly, fiscal increases during the 1980s have exceeded those of the 1970s. States are now the lead fiscal agents for school funding. Included are nine tables. (MLH)",

        "description":"The historical, political, and legal evolution of Canada and its traditions has differed from that of the United States' uncritical adoption of U.S. case law. Canada's 1982 Charter, the counterpart of the United States Bill of Rights, is discussed. This paper examines the fundamental differences between Canadian and U.S. value patterns and legal norms; the argument is then tested by applying discussion conclusions to two areas of school law--due process and student rights. Whereas the United States was conceived in a revolution against an authoritarian and paternalistic government, Canada was formed out of a compromise among four colonies, based on common interest in building a railway and willingness to remain under imperial rule for another 100 years. Canadian political culture  espouses traditional values and an &quot;elite accommodation&quot; governance style in which policymaking and political leadership are delegated to elites representing major subcultural groups. The greater respect for authority and lesser concern for equality (compared to the United States egalitarian ethos) means that Canadians have not used the courts to the same extent. Because basic civil rights have not been entrenched in a constitution, this legal tradition is weaker than in the United States. The elite accommodation philosophy, which emphasizes deference to school authorities and the need for order, carries over to schools. Canadian courts have granted broad powers to school authorities, both to make and enforce rules based on &quot;in loco parentis&quot; and &quot;parens patriae.&quot; As a result, the  Canadian school administrator has traditionally counted on a predictable socio-legal environment posing few challenges on substantive educational grounds. Specific due process and student rights applications are discussed, comparing Canadian and U.S. approaches. Implications for administrative practice are also discussed.

Formative evaluation is a nonjudgmental process, and summative evaluation provides for judgment with performance improvement recommendations. Next, six anxiety-reducing steps are outlined: (1) have a preobservation conference stressing the improvement needed; (2) permit teachers to refuse unannounced class visits; (3) always find something positive to say; (4) offer specific suggestions on how to solve the problem; (5) ensure that the evaluation discussion extends beyond one minor point; and (6) be consistent with staff members so that everyone understands uniform evaluative criteria.

        "description":"Although many teachers have had an enduring and positive influence on their students, some teachers' behavior is unprofessional, contributing to youngsters' alienation and reinforcing negative public opinion about the teaching profession. This field study describes various defensive maneuvers, strategies, and pranks that teachers devised and relied on to get through the school year at a midwestern high school. Using a natural history/direct observation approach, a 7-month field study targeting the social studies department of &quot;Roosevelt High School&quot; (a fictitious name for a real school in the midwest) was conducted during 1980-81. This report summarizes study results and focuses on two primary informants representative of the 14 real teachers whose teaching concepts, jokes,  likes, and dislikes were sought out continuously. Field workers participated in many out-of-class activities with these teachers and made notes when appropriate. The study disclosed two rival cliques of teachers who treated subject matter, classrooms, the gym, and the professional library as territories to be defended. Each informal group developed strategies for protecting whatever subject matter territory they possessed and laid plans for looting this territory from the other clique. Teachers also devised bulwarks against looting, &quot;raping,&quot; and raising general havoc by others within and outside the department. Results are inconsistent with other research findings about teacher collegiality. The informal groups were teachers' response to fatigue, frustration, and distrust resulting from  their lowly position in the school hierarchy. Unfortunately, this conduct is unbefitting a professional. Included are 14 references. (MLH)",

Student achievement scores are down, unemployment and dropout rates are up, social and welfare costs are up, economic productivity has declined, and shortages of qualified teachers are imminent. After Chapter 1 of this paper provides background and history for school reform, Chapter 2 reviews the literature, highlighting the national educational crisis and developments concerning test scores, curriculum reform, the return to basics movement, course and text book content, and the teacher-preparation-versus-curriculum controversy. Chapter 3 discusses educational reform objectives advanced by professional educators, such as a continuing need for the basics, economics, and vocational education. This chapter also rebuts three of Robert J.  Samuelson's educational reform pronouncements concerning community college access, academic requirements for guaranteed student loans, and teacher certification. In closing, this chapter stresses education's purpose (to provide today's youth with survival skills needed for tomorrow) and calls privatization of education good in theory, but impossible in practice. A summary suggests that educational reform decisions should be based on a variety of criteria, not on one statistic or opinion. Proclamations based on isolated test results are especially suspect. Serious reformers must compare reports and analyze their validity. From this base, educators can judge the merits of proposed reforms and devise appropriate plans for improvement.

Research findings are reviewed and discussed in the areas of socialization of women and sex-role stereotyping, mentoring, and networking. A 37-item questionnaire addressed background information, graduate school experiences, first employment, current status, and job satisfaction. A five-point Likert scale was used to record perceptions of career and personal-related qualities and characteristics. Four open-ended questions asked for a list of discriminatory practices in hiring and promotion, and perceptions of additional thrusts needed in preparation programs for K-12 administrators that relate to equity issues. Of the identified 190 women professors of K-12 educational  administration in colleges and universities, 130 (70 percent) returned questionnaires. The study findings suggest several implications relative to encouraging more women graduate students to enter the professoriate: (1) women graduate students should be given greater opportunities to further develop research skills; (2) women students must begin networking in graduate school; (3) the lack of women mentors from the professor ranks is highlighted by this study; and (4) women professors of K-12 administration provide models for school districts and the public-at-large, contributing to the positive image of women as educational administrators and leaders.

Specifically, it: defines the difference between academic and practial interests in educational administration; traces the evolution of academic study in educational administration; discusses how each major stage in this evolution has led to increased sophistication and complexity within the academic realm but, at the same time, has tended to further distance study from practice; examines recently proposed reforms in academic educational administration; and considers an alternative that would accommodate the current press for greater practical and experiential training in administrator preparation programs without sacrificing the future promise of academic study. The paper concludes by advocating the  preservation and extension of academic study of educational administration in the following ways: (1) the history and philosophy of academic and practical educational administration should be taught; (2) wider attempts to understand schools as unique social phenomena within the literature of organizational theory should be considered; (3) closer and more penetrating treatments of the nature of power and authority in organizational settings must be reviewed; and (4) specific attention should be given to the subjective reality of organizational life.

Case study data were provided to illustrate meaning management at the school district level. Framing this analysis is the application of the categories of critical theory to the study of educational organizations. Critical theory of organizations involves the three tasks of understanding, critique, and praxis. For the purpose of discussing how meaning was managed, data were gathered from 66 interviews; 28 school board, principal, and central office meeting observations; and the analyses of 30 documents. The goal of the study was to obtain perceptions of selected critical events in order to define the elementary reading  program in Fairlawn, an affluent suburban school district. What emerged from the study is that program legitimacy is a scarce resource. It must constantly be won and defined by administrators who are aware of the school's sociocultural constructions, which include its language, rituals, and myths. (JAM)",

The paper reports the research findings of a study that examined state reform strategies nationally. The study identified three distinct strategies: (1) rational planning; (2) free market; and (3) political interaction. These strategies are represented by Texas, California, and South Carolina, respectively. School reform in Texas shows that rational planning and regulation are inappropriate policy instruments for achieving educational excellence. California illustrates the impotence of a permissive, decentralized strategy. School reform in South  Carolina, in contrast, aims at improving the organizational competence of schools. (Author/SI)",

The school district was composed of 12 high schools, 15 middle schools, and 48 elementary schools, and served approximately 40,000 students. Data findings are divided by topic headings in the following manner: (1) information needs of the administrator/pilot facilitator and others responsible for making decisions regarding the implementation of an intervention program; (2) changes in the information needs of decision-makers; (3) data collection strategies that were used by decision-makers; (4) key decisions and factors that affected the implementation; and (5) use of data that were  generated. Factors, events, and situations that affected the implementation of this pilot program are identified. This study revealed that once the school year began and a modified pilot program was in place, the flow of information from one level of decision-makers to the next rarely took place. The study also suggested that, once the superintendent has made the decision to implement a pilot program, a set of specific questions should be developed to provide a standardized method of collecting data. A sample question design is included. Recommendations on planning and implementation are discussed. Appended are 13 references. (SI)",

An attempt was made to determine if the burden of extraordinary, nonreimbursed costs for special education programs was divided equally or unequally among school districts in Illinois. However, two problems with the data source were discovered. Illinois does not require school districts to report financial information with an accrual accounting system. Also, there is enough freedom of definition between and among expenditure categories that transactional data are reported in accounts that were not assigned for special education. With the reported data that were available, this study was not able to determine the revenue and expense totals by fiscal periods for special education. The study  concludes with recommendations that have policy implications.

There were an estimated 45.4 million students enrolled in 1988. Enrollment in kindergarten through grade 8 is expected to increase from 32.4 million in 1988 to 32.9 million in 1989, an increase of 1.5 percent. In contrast, enrollment in grades 9-12 will continue to decline. This number is expected to decrease from 13.0 million in 1988 to 12.7 million in 1989, a drop of 2.6 percent. During the 1989 to 1993 period, elementary enrollment is expected to rise steadily, while secondary enrollment is expected to reverse its decline midway through the period. Increases are projected for both public and private schools.

Each chapter elaborates on the interplay in each type of plan within the framework of finance equity, and school improvement. Six sections describe what the plan is, how it works, how finance and equity are played out, what the advocates and critics say, and how the plans are linked to school improvement. Each chapter concludes with a list of policy questions that must be answered as a community designs its own choice plan.

The parallel development of residential programs and special education programs for individuals with mental retardation is described; and movements toward deinstitutionalization, normalization, and mainstreaming are examined. Excessive concern with the physical settings of services is cited, with the recommendation that the actual social and psychological characteristics within each individual setting be considered. The paper proposes that: (1) services should be matched to each person's needs, regardless of setting which might include  the large institutions; (2) such large institutions should train new generations of professionals to work with retarded persons; and (3) large institutions which continue to be used should be humanized. Following the speech is a transcript of a question-and-answer period. It deals with the phenomenon of the decreasing numbers of children labeled as mildly mentally retarded, the state of the existing knowledge base in mental retardation research, and the need for regular education teachers to receive special training before mainstreaming occurs.

Five axioms comprising the existing paradigm of logical positivism are outlined (reality, subject-object dualism, generalization, causality, and values), and these axioms are contrasted with a naturalist view. The set of trustworthiness techniques developed to handle questions of rigor are then compared, with credibility, plausibility, dependability, and confirmability taking the place of the conventional paradigm's terminology of internal validity, external validity, reliability, and objectivity. The naturalistic model emphasizes  qualitative research methods in an open system of inquiry. Implications of naturalistic inquiry for special education researchers include the need to look for counter-evidence as well as evidence, determine formally what comprises the field of special education, and treat respondents as persons with rights and decision-making power. Political implications include the extraordinary justification that researchers must make for such work, the difficulty in finding outlets to publish research, and the disadvantage in competing for research funding.

        "description":"Two papers are presented from a panel discussion moderated by Naomi Zigmond, who introduces the papers with a note on definitions and measures of intervention effectiveness. \"Some Thoughts on Effective Intervention for Handicapped Preschoolers,\" by Phillip Strain, notes that special education researchers attempt to be efficient, economical, politically compatible, and consistent with values, and later consider effectiveness only in a belated fashion. Researchers should consider how consumers evaluate effectiveness, because interventions will not be used if people cannot see a difference in child outcomes attributable to these interventions. Researchers should also recognize the importance of longitudinal studies. The second paper, \"Markers of Effectiveness at the Secondary Level  in Special Education\" by Eugene Edgar, contends that the important aspect of secondary special education is to prepare students with skills and attitudes that will enable them to experience some quality of life, and to offer them the opportunity to practice their skills in the natural environment. Measurement of student outcomes is very difficult and involves issues of how to obtain data, when to obtain data, and from whom. The paper examines follow-up studies of special education school leavers and offers guidelines for conducting future effectiveness research. (JDD)",

        "description":"The report summarizes recent and ongoing research on processes involved in the development of antisocial behavior disorders in children and adolescents. Studies address both the applied problem of preventing aggressive behavior and the overall relation of cognition to social behavior. A social information processing model of social competence is described, and the results of several studies emanating from this model are noted. Aggressive children are seen as deficient in processing at all five stages of the social information processing model: encoding, representation, response search, response decision, and enactment. A stage model for assessing processing patterns in aggressive children in clinical settings is proposed as a guide to focus intervention efforts. Current research  efforts include a longitudinal study on the origins of aggressive behavior which explores whether patterns of deviant information processing are predictive of later aggressive behavior, and whether early family experiences predispose a child to develop deviant patterns of information processing.

        "description":"The revised curriculum addresses systematic social skills instruction of mentally retarded students, particularly those with behavioral difficulties. An introductory chapter presents a broad perspective on social competence and the rationale, methods, and content for teaching social skills. Procedures for direct instruction of social skills are also described: establishing need, identifying skills components, modeling, role playing, practice, generalization, and transfer. The bulk of the document consists of 100 lesson plans arranged by level of instruction (primary, intermediate, junior high, senior high) and focused on seven skill areas: classroom, school building, personal, interaction initiative, interaction response, community, and work. At the elementary level, lessons are  directed toward skills performed in the school environment. For junior high students, instruction emphasizes social skills used in school and community environments. Peer-, community-, and work-related social skills are addressed at the high school level. The lesson format includes objectives, performance criteria, materials, and detailed procedures. Lessons teach such skills as gaining teacher attention, boarding the school bus, taking turns in games and activities, asking another child to play, staying out of fights, responding to public authority, dealing with an accusation in school, asking for a date, and negotiating on the job. Concluding the monograph are references, a social skills rating checklist, and homework report forms. (JW)",

The project's purpose was to conduct an analysis of the efficacy of current practices in student-teacher ratios for providing special education services to mildly handicapped students. Results of current research on student-teacher ratios within regular education remain inconclusive. The first of four studies revealed great variability in current special education student-teacher ratios, which were examined through an analysis of state guidelines and a national survey. In a second study, observations of 139 mildly handicapped elementary students under different student-teacher ratios (1:1, 3:1, 6:1, 9:1, 12:1)  revealed differences in the qualitative nature of instruction and student academic response time, but no significant differences for task completion and task success. Next, a case study analysis revealed that the special education categorical label assigned to the student was unrelated to the effectiveness of different student-teacher ratios. A fourth study examined opinions about optimal student-teacher ratios for both student learning and teacher instruction. Results indicated that parents and teachers tended to prefer smaller group sizes, while administrators preferred larger group sizes.

A supportive school organization requires a positive interpersonal climate, placement of exceptional learners in the least restrictive environment, alternatives to normative testing and grading procedures, and a sound school-wide discipline code. Creation of an appropriate classroom management system requires establishment of positive interpersonal relationships between the teacher and students and among pupils. Also useful are attractive structured learning environments, behavior modification systems, and parent  involvement. Ten active teaching strategies are: (1) clearly explain instructional objectives and tasks; (2) model and demonstrate assignments appropriately; (3) use \"special\" instructional materials and equipment; (4) ask questions and encourage responses; (5) present appropriate aids, prompts, and cues; (6) direct pupils in self-mediation and self-management; (7) praise pupil achievement; (8) provide correction and feedback; (9) record pupil performance using systematic token reinforcers and credits; and (10) show enthusiasm and interest in the lesson.

        "description":"Prereferral intervention is designed to reduce referrals for special education placement, by modifying teacher instruction or management of difficult-to-teach (DTT) pupils prior to formal referral. A 3-year project is described in which Mainstream Assistance Teams offer consultation services to teachers in elementary and middle schools. The consultation results in interventions that are prescriptive, student-directed, and designed to transfer to additional school settings. Step-by-step procedures in designing and implementing prereferral intervention involve: identifying the problem, observing classroom behavior, validating the behavior, setting the goal, planning the intervention, and conducting a teacher-student meeting to develop a contract. The intervention activity is then  implemented, involving recording, charting, self-monitoring, and feedback. Self-monitoring steps are gradually phased out, and observations take place in the original classroom and a transfer classroom. A post-intervention meeting takes place in which teacher and consultant determine goal achievement. To evaluate effectiveness of the approach, observation data were gathered in Year 2 and 3 on 103 DTT students, from a large urban school district and rating scales were administered to their teachers. Results showed that the intervention reduced the frequency of most DTT students' problem behavior and caused teachers to become more positive toward these pupils. The DTT students were less likely to be referred to special education than similar students in control groups. (JDD)",

The curriculum stresses parent involvement, vocational training beginning at the 7th or 8th grade levels, a cyclical approach with initial activities later repeated in more advanced or complex forms, hands-on and real life experiences, and remediation of social deficits. The curriculum is organized by broad goals. Goals 1 and 2 involve collecting and summarizing information about students' functional life skills and their vocational interests and experiences. Goals 3 and 4 are designed to help students explore individual vocational  preferences by gathering information. Goal 5 gives students experience in observing work, determining skills required, and analyzing their ability to do specific jobs. Students also develop basic skills essential for obtaining employment including using the telephone, scheduling appointments, and participating in an information interview.

The STEP social skills program requires: (1) identifying those skills which are considered important or socially useful by significant others; (2) clearly defining the cognitive and performance components of each skills; (3) accurately assessing skill competence; (4) developing intervention strategies which maximize skill generalization and maintenance. Chapter 1 discusses social competence on the job, while chapter 2 identifies critical vocational social skills including social perception and problem solving skills, generic work-related skills, and job-specific social skills. The third chapter looks at the  assessment of vocational social skills and details the 7-step assessment process including obtaining teacher, employer, parent, and student assessment. A community validation checklist of 22 job-related social skills is provided. An assessment videotape is also available. Chapter 4 focuses on intervention strategies and offers a model for teaching generic social skills which is illustrated in sample lesson plans for the skills of asking for help and controlling anger and stress. Appended is an article entitled \"Teaching Community-Validated Job-Related Social Skills to Secondary Students with Mild Handicaps: Assessment Strategies.\" Also appended is a sample job skill inventory.

A questionnaire, sent to 1,000 members of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), achieved only a 17.5% response rate but was felt to represent adequately the entire group. Respondents were asked their opinions regarding the amount of content coverage on ethnic/multicultural issues in &quot;Exceptional Children,&quot;&quot;Teaching Exceptional Children,&quot; and specialty-area periodicals. Specific ethnic groups of focus included: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and bilingual/English as a second language students. For most of the publications, coverage was felt to be between &quot;too little&quot; and &quot;about right.&quot; Generally, respondents felt that there  was too little coverage of issues dealing with Native Americans but acceptable coverage for Blacks. When the actual amount of content material contained within certain CEC publications was analyzed and compared to the content of one non-CEC publication, &quot;Kappan,&quot; none of the three publications met standards of &quot;adequacy&quot; suggested for multicultural content. Respondents welcomed the inclusion of additional information on ethnic/multicultural concerns in CEC publications. Appendices contain the survey instrument, comments made by the respondents, and 24 graphs illustrating demographics and characteristics of respondents and participants' opinions about publications.

The first involved 48 parents of special needs children, aged 3.6 to 14.5 years. On a coping instrument, a mood scale, and a difficulties and expectations scale, parents indicated that important concerns for their children included: ability for independent life in adulthood, vocational opportunities, learning difficulties, and leisure activities. Health difficulties, discipline problems, and social difficulties were less emphasized. Parents viewed the computer as a source of help in learning, leisure activities, and widening future vocational possibilities. Compared to mothers, fathers expressed higher levels of concern regarding their children's difficulties and higher  expectations from use of technology. In a second study, 14 fathers and 10 mothers, representing 18 families, participated in group meetings which involved a study of information processing and problem solving; and training in use of Niflaot software, a Hebrew software which enhances keyboard and writing skills of special education children. Observations revealed that parents initially had overenthusiastic expectations, and subsequently reduced their active involvement due to parental role overload and fatigue. Fathers were more involved than mothers and slowly developed a new ground for parent-child interactions, but also experienced fatigue and role overload. (JDD)",

The training employed a stress and coping model to address infant, family, and staff stress. Sixteen nurses were trained, and observation of their subsequent clinical behaviors supported the efficacy of the training. Compared to 10 nurses on a training wait list and 10 nurses who did not wish to undergo training, trained nurses showed  more caring behaviors during medical interventions and showed more effective supportive behaviors following medical interventions.

Programs vary in the types of services offered, goals, and number of families served. The most promising approaches to family support provide services that are flexible and individualized, build on informal sources of support and existing social networks, maximize community participation, provide children with permanent homes, and place control in the hands of families themselves. Barriers that hinder the development of family support services include funding mechanisms that favor institutional care, administrative confusion, role of public agencies versus private responsibilities, traditional service models that substitute for rather than  support the family, pressure to maintain the status quo, unequal access to services, and lack of federal policy. Family services can be supported on the grounds that they are based on current service ideology and research-based literature, are consistent with existing legislation, save money, and reflect traditional American family values. To fully implement family support services requires adoption of social change in three spheres: the sphere of ideology, the sphere of practice, and the sphere of legal initiative. (JDD)",

        "description":"This paper challenges the traditional view that, in families of children with disabilities, mothers have the primary responsibility for child care because they are the \"natural\" caregivers. Family support services are an emerging way of delivering services to families of children with disabilities, and they seem to operate within a framework that accepts the traditional view of women as the \"natural\" caregivers. The rationale for family support programs focuses on the cost savings of providing care at home and the support of traditional family values. Caring, in its three identified forms (taking care of the child, caring about or loving the child, and caring about what happens to people with disabilities in general), is considered women's responsibility. Cultural stereotypes of  men and women have significant influence on the way family support services are provided, and on the way that service providers view mothers and fathers of children with disabilities. The paper concludes that the disability rights movement and the women's movement may be in serious conflict, and that the disability field needs to develop a more sensitive perspective on women's issues to further efforts to achieve full community integration of people with disabilities.

This monograph is a compilation of the competencies for transition specialists identified by the 13 programs. The monograph was prepared to assist institutions of higher education in the development of curricula for the preparation of transition specialists, and to enhance the quality of future applications for federal support of personnel preparation programs. In preparing the monograph, over 600 competencies were identified from the 13 programs. Content analysis was used to aggregate competencies under 14 major headings: philosophical and  historical considerations; transitional concerns; professionalism; advocacy; knowledge of agencies; knowledge of systems change; legal aspects of transition; working with others (communication, consultation, interdisciplinary teamwork, parents); development and management of individualized plans; planning and organizing instruction; assessment, delivery, and evaluation of instruction for community living; assessment, delivery, and evaluation of job training; administrative functions; and research.

Project RESPECT sought to address the problems of vocational training for mentally handicapped secondary students and the coordination of services between secondary education and postsecondary rehabilitation. Project RESPECT's vocational training program combines classroom training and school-based vocational exploration with community-based occupational skills training. The problem of &quot;linkages&quot; or interagency coordination was attacked by forming three separate transition teams: administrative, mid-management, and direct service. These three teams are known as the Advisory Committee, the Coordinating Committee, and  the Implementing Committee. This guide does not present a step-by-step process for program development but outlines key elements essential to successful transition programming. Section I of the guide, &quot;Planning and Developing a Vocational Training and Transition Program,&quot; covers development of effective transition teams and activities that transition teams should undertake. Section II, covering program implementation, focuses on the individual transition plan, the vocational training program, and the transitional training program. Section III contains blank forms to assist in program development. (JDD)",

The survey questions were presented in five areas: (1) numbers of students and native language/culture backgrounds; (2) admissions requirements; (3) academic needs; (4) follow-up information on graduates; and (5) attitudes of faculty toward the presence of foreign students. While admissions and degree requirements are generally the same for native-speakers (NSs) and NNSs, most programs require some evidence of English proficiency from the NNSs. Problems reported for NNSs relate primarily to English proficiency and financial limitations. However, while many programs reported that their NNSs were weak  in English proficiency, most did not want to add an additional English course for the NNSs. It is concluded that concerns about creating double standards have been raised, and that institutional resources, financial and staff, are too limited to allow for an additional course. Most programs appear to see little or no difference in practical training required of NSs and NNSs. Faculty seem to feel some ambivalence about NNSs in the Master's programs; while nearly all faculty members felt NNSs were an asset, not all faculty were eager to attract more NNSs to such programs. Additional research is planned. (MSE)",

Types of student contributions recommended include student interviews, essays done as class writing assignments, art and photography, cartoons, editorial comments, and reviews. The mechanical aspects of publication construction addressed include photocopying, typewriting, word processing, the inclusion of artwork, and binding. The process of preparing for publication an essay about Amsterdam is discussed, and  a layout problem is offered as an example of specific issues that have had to be resolved. It is concluded that this type of communicative writing project provides a public purpose for writing to a wide audience, provides opportunities for task- and content-based discussions, provides a product in which students take great satisfaction, and can be used as a public relations tool to both promote the program and to inform the larger community.

Corrections and indications of uncertainty were analyzed, and results showed relatively little miscorrection. These results parallel the findings in previous research on peer oral correction. The second study required 81 students at three proficiency levels to write compare-and-contrast essays on  selected topics. The essays were evaluated by teachers, peer readers, or the student writers themselves. Students were surveyed concerning their feelings about the feedback types. Results indicate that the type of corrective feedback did not affect informational or rhetorical accuracy, but teacher and peer feedback was found to be more effective for grammatical accuracy.

        "description":"The Computer Focused Russian Bilingual Instructional Program was a federally-funded program providing instructional and support activities for 321 Russian-speaking students of limited English proficiency at four public and two private high schools in Brooklyn, New York. The main goals of the program were to develop English proficiency and provide content area instruction and computer literacy. Instructional content varied across sites. Public school students took courses in English as a second language, Russian culture and literature, content areas, business, and vocational courses taught in English. Private school students had tutorials and small-group classes in English and academic subject areas. Career awareness was developed by the grade advisor at each site, and additional  components included personal counseling, tutoring, parental advisement, curriculum development, and staff training. Analysis of student achievement indicated that program objectives were met in content-area courses and computer literacy/keyboarding but not in English language development. The native language literature and culture courses were found to have unrealistically high objectives. Recommendations for program improvement include additional guest speakers in high technology fields, program-wide activities to promote student contact across sites, more appropriate assessment of English language skills, and more realistic native language goals.

Individuals proved to use equivalent higher-order problem-solving strategies while writing and reading in both languages. Strategies varied with the individuals' levels of literate expertise in their native language, correlating with the qualities of written summaries they produced in both languages. Uses of these problem-solving strategies appeared unrelated to levels of second language proficiency (beginning and intermediate). Analyses of the verbal reports reveal thinking processes which are common to reading and summary-writing in first and second languages but which appear to vary with literate expertise and  relevant knowledge. Findings are interpreted in relation to theories of the cross-linguistic interdependence of cognitive-academic skills and to a model of discourse comprehension. Implications are drawn for bilingual cognition, further research, and introduction of second language reading and writing. (Author/MSE)",

While these innovations are practical, they are also grounded in theory and justifiable on sound principles of language learning. Computers make possible classroom activities maximizing the benefit drawn from complex and otherwise unmanageable communicative interactions. Depending on its capabilities, a computer network can provide for interaction between a user and databases, bibliographic sources, or information sources; between user and other users; between user and various experts; and through word processing, between user and text. Local area networks which usually consist of a number of computers linked together in one room, provide the potential for a variety of student activities, including  manipulating text, sharing work, creating text, and conferencing. The Georgia Institute of Technology English and Political Science departments have set up a system on the Wide Area Network that serves as an adjunct to class instruction by providing accessible services such as electronic mail and electronic bulletin boards. The software for a University of Southern California freshman composition program uses a notebook metaphor allowing students to sit at a microcomputer to plan, organize, research, and write a paper on an assigned topic.

        "description":"A study identifying the relationships between quantitative academic characteristics--specifically, grade point average (GPA) and MCAT scores--and admission into medical school for minorities is presented. Explanations are proposed for contradictory findings related to this question that have appeared in literature. Data from 58 minority student participants in the University of Virginia School of Medicine summer academic enrichment programs who went on to apply to medical school were analyzed. The 49 students who were offered medical school acceptance ultimately enrolled in 17 different medical schools. The major study findings are as follows: the variables that together best explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance in medical school admissions decisions  for minority students were performance on the MCAT quantitative subtest, on the MCAT reading subtest, and on the MCAT physics subtest; the three variables with the strongest simple correlations with admission into medical school were performance on the MCAT quantitative subtest, on the MCAT science subtest, and on the MCAT physics subtest; overall GPA did not explain a significant proportion of the variance in the medical school admissions decisions, either alone or in combination with other variables; and the study findings conflict in several ways with the reported results of two previous studies. The conclusions of the current study should be considered preliminary because of the relatively small sample size and the need for comparison data on non-minority students. Tables are  included.

Eleven recommendations are made by the Task Force staff, including: (1) intervals between reviews should be reduced from 10 years to a period of from 5 to 7 years; (2) ABOR should more closely monitor reviews to ensure they are responsive to the stated  requirements of their review policy; (3) each university should develop procedures and guidelines for meaningful program review; (4) procedures for the use of consultants should include greater objectivity in their selection; (5) procedures for the reviews should encourage active participation of department faculty; and (6) the reviews should be used by department chairs, deans, and vice presidents for planning and resource allocation.

Observations are discussed on the basis of the following: administrative support, leadership, and commitment; institutional assessment programs; organization of assessment; and implementation status and prognosis. Some of the broad recommendations for consideration by the Task Force are: current decennial review processes required by the board should include a more explicit outcomes component; requests for additional  funding through decision packages should be explicitly supported; the decennial review cycle should include a comprehensive review of undergraduate education; institutional assessment plans should clearly identify the means by which students are initially tested for basic skills at appropriate levels to engage in college level work; and the information function at the institutional and board level needs attention. Though campus-based efforts to assess the effectiveness of Arizona's undergraduate education are proceeding adequately, they can only be successful in the long run if they have continuing, sincere support from top administration and faculty, and if the results are taken seriously by the board.

        "description":"This paper argues that current practices in total communication classrooms have basically assigned the responsibility of communication to hearing-impaired students who must adapt to the variation in communication behaviors displayed by each of their teachers. The paper advocates use of a model communication and language policy designed to implement consistent linguistic input in the instruction of hearing-impaired students in total communication programs. The consistent use of a modified form of Signed English as the primary sign system and the use of American Sign Language as an intervention tool form the basis for establishing consistent linguistic input in the classroom. Following a rationale for adoption of such a policy, an appendix contains the communication and language  policy that was developed for the Lansing (Michigan) School District's hearing-impaired programs. Two other appendixes describe the characteristics of modified signed English and provide a brief perspective of pidgin signs. (JDD)",

Elementary and secondary level teachers completed a 2-page survey which explored the use of other adults in the classroom, size of instructional groups, primary method of instruction used, and degree of classroom structure. Number of adults used in the classroom differed from what it typically would be for only 26 percent of respondents. Sixty percent reported direct instruction as the preferred method for handicapped students. More than half reported that the degree of classroom structure (typically described as \"highly structured\") would not change if handicapped students were  not present. Adaptive instructional techniques were almost unanimously viewed as desirable, with teachers at both elementary and secondary levels indicating that the most desirable approach is holding the student accountable for performance and quality of work. It is concluded that regular education teachers either do not see a way to make the classroom environment different from what it would be without a handicapped student, or are unable to implement potential changes.

Subjects were 139 mainstreamed elementary students (grades 1-6), most of whom were categorically labeled as learning disabled (n=114). Students were observed during their special education time, within student-teacher ratios that varied from less than 1:1 (one student with two teachers) to over 15:1. Using grouped ratios represented by 1:1, 3:1, 6:1, 9:1, and 12:1, students' academic engaged time, task completion, and task success, as well as the qualitative nature of their instruction were compared. Targeted student behaviors were recorded by trained observers using  rating scales and observational instruments. Data from structured interviews with students and teachers were also used. Significant differences were found in measures of both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of instruction, with nearly all favoring the lower student-teacher ratios. Lack of observed differences in task completion and task success rates (which were very high for all students in all student-teacher ratio groupings) was attributed to task content during special education instructional time.

Information was collected on each student in the areas of aptitude, achievement gains during a one-year period, behavior, the nature of home, school, and community learning environments, methods of instruction, and the student's academic engaged time (and other times) under different student-teacher ratios. Results indicated considerable inter-individual and intra-individual variability  in all factors examined, but few consistent trends. Among conclusions discussed is that ART changes in relation to several variables, particularly the content area of instruction, the nature of the task, and environmental distractions. The data also seemed to indicate that the special education categorical label assigned to a student does not determine the effectiveness of different student-teacher ratios.

The first study, \"State Graduation Policies and Program Practices Related to High School Special Education Programs\" by Joanne Records Bodner et al., surveyed state special education directors or their designees in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The study found that 36 states have increased academic requirements for high school graduation since 1975; most states allow either modified content or modified instruction within regular classes as a means of meeting the requirements. In addition, 21 states require a minimum competency test for graduation, and of these, 15 determine students' exit documents on the basis of test scores. The second survey, \"Do  We Know Enough to Plan for Transition?\" by John McDonnell et al., involved administrators of 44 state education agencies, 34 administrators of state vocational programs, and 35 administrators of residential programs for adults with severe handicaps. This survey found that projected need for services for severely handicapped students exceeded projected service increases. Policy recommendations are made based on the results of these studies.

        "description":"A summary is presented of a 2-year ethnographic study of the intake process (involving assessment, placement, and educational programming) of 12 Hispanic deaf and hearing-impaired children, aged 3-8. The study, titled \"Schooling the Different: Ethnographic Case Studies of Hispanic Deaf Children's Initiation into Formal Schooling\" by Adrian Bennett, collected data from formal assessments, case conferences, teacher/parent meetings, written reports, and home and classroom interactions. The study revealed gaps between policy guidelines and actual practice, especially concerning the measurement of the needs and abilities of the children and the active participation of parents. The study found that the source of \"problems\" was attributed to the child or home environment rather than to  the interaction between the child and classroom milieu. In general, Hispanic parents demonstrated skill in providing strong supportive relationships within the family for their deaf or hearing-impaired children, but lacked the knowledge needed to make their voices heard in institutional systems. Implications of these findings are outlined. (JDD)",

Three general curricular orientations are examined: (1) remedial models, including programs focused on basic academic skill development/remediation and social skills training; (2) maintenance models, including tutorial approaches, learning strategies, and compensatory techniques; and (3) functional models, including vocational training and approaches which relate to adult outcomes. The  particular appropriateness of each approach is a function of a number of variables, including student variables (cognitive-intellectual level, academic achievement, grade placement, motivation/degree of responsibility, and social skills); parent variables (expectations, degree of support provided, value orientation, and cultural factors); regular education/mainstream variables (teacher and nonhandicapped student acceptance of diversity, accommodative capacity of the classroom, options for vocational education, amount of cooperation between regular educators and special educators, etc.); and special education variables (size of caseload, access to curricular materials, focus of teacher's training, and support available to special educators).

Issues in the conception of adaptive behavior include its relationship to other constructs such as cognitive competence and emotional competence, the nearly universal use of certain domains, different purposes for which the conception was established, the degree to which cognitive competencies are included, and the relative emphasis on different settings. Issues in the assessment of adaptive behavior include the purpose of the assessment procedure, methods used to collect the information, and the setting in which the information is gathered. For assessment purposes, four domains were identified: independent functioning, social  functioning, functional academic competencies, and vocational/occupational competencies. Recently developed instruments have improved the resources available for assessment of adaptive behavior. It is concluded that adaptive behavior should be prominent in decisions at all levels with students classified as mentally disabled, including the initial comprehensive evaluation, choice of placement option, determination of individualized education program goals, determination of instructional objectives, selection of instructional routines, annual evaluation of progress, and reevaluation. Described are 10 principles reflecting recommendations for best practices in the use of adaptive behavior. Six tables and four figures are included. (JDD)",

The educator's role is perceived as: (1) an &quot;expert&quot; on the needs of individuals with mental disabilities and the barriers they face when they move from the educational environment to the adult environment, and (2) an active member of a team facilitating movement of students. As students end their school programming, they and their parents find a confusing and often duplicative array of services, which in some cases meet none of the individual student's needs. Effective transition programming calls for broad levels of cooperation, which can be achieved through joint agreements, development of models of service delivery,  legislative mandates, and state transition initiatives. The Iowa Transition Initiative serves as an example of such cooperative programs. Additional components of transition that impact on educators more directly include curriculum, adult services, parent involvement, cooperative efforts guided by the joint agreements, and provision of information about available adult services.

Arithmetic computation should not dominate educational programming, but should be included in ways that are functionally relevant and meaningfully presented within a framework of problem-solving and applied experiences. The teaching of counting depends on an understanding of two basic concepts, one-to-one and many-to-one relationships. Instruction in these areas can take place in the forms of arrangements, patterns, and sets. A scheme referred to as the Interactive Unit makes instruction both systematic and flexible by organizing instruction, with four instructor inputs (manipulate, display, say, write) and four  learner behavior changes (manipulate, identify, say, write). Within the schemata of the Interactive Unit, the teacher can develop an unlimited number of instructional activities and accompanying materials. In the use of arithmetic algorithms, it is important that the teacher become familiar with a variety of algorithms and correct only errors rather than the student's performance style. Other recommended practices include presenting addition as a process of joining sets, and using expanded notation to numerically represent each place value position. Examples are provided to illustrate how these methods can be used in the classroom. Eight figures are included. (JDD)",

        "description":"This research-based review discusses effective computer applications for students with mental disabilities. Most computer-based instruction currently in use is of a drill-and-practice variety, which is needed to develop fluency in basic academic skills. Studies conducted on math fluency indicate that when students are using counting strategies to solve basic math facts, computer-based drill-and-practice activities do not lead to fluent recall of math facts, but tutorial plus drill activities can lead to fluency. In the area of reading, the scope of existing research is too narrow to draw conclusions about the utility of computer-based practice in remediating overall reading deficiencies, but microcomputers are well-suited for providing extended practice that can lead to increased  fluency in decoding skills. Spelling research shows that improved spelling (with an accuracy level of over 90 percent) can result if the computer-based program requires students to use long-term memory, limits the size of the practice set to 20 spelling words, spaces practice over three weeks, and emphasizes speed and accuracy. Use of computers in teaching of writing should include instruction in keyboarding, word processing and idea processing software, and task-specific strategies. Also examined are the use of computers to teach thinking and problem-solving skills, through use of LOGO and simulations. A discussion of computer-managed instruction and monitoring concludes the paper. (JDD)",

Four sources of qualitative assessment items include: \"Project I CAN,\"\"Michigan Essential Performance Objectives,\"\"Data Based Gymnasium,\" and \"Project Transition.\" Instruction should be implemented to maximize student success, time on task, and repetition of desired behaviors. Demonstrations and physical manipulation should be used to communicate both correct and incorrect performances. Non-competitive games and activities should be carefully selected to match specific instructional objectives.

Children at risk for learning problems were observed in classrooms performing analyzed tasks in five content areas: perceptual-motor, auditory, visual, cognitive, and social-emotional. Small-group instruction was then directed to the 37 at-risk kindergarten students, focusing on four categories of learning strategies: (1) attending to increasing numbers of items and sets, both visual and auditory; (2) remembering increasing numbers of items, both visual and auditory; (3) demonstrating knowledge of the meaning of the type of question asked (what, when, where, whom); and (4) sorting and categorizing at different levels of abstraction and in different perceptual modes.  Immediate post-intervention results suggested that the task analysis intervention had been effective, when student performance was compared to a contrast group of 33 children. Results of an 8-year follow-up study indicated that the task analysis students continued to perform at achievement levels which were average or better for their age group, compared to the contrast group and a current cohort group. The intervention effects appeared to be most salutary upon children who were moderately at-risk. (JDD)",

Then, all of the categories of information from each type of report are combined into a list; the most logical sequence of information for data entry is determined; a data entry form is designed; and sample reports are created to test the process. A prototype of a database design is provided, including a rationale, examples of database applications, and time considerations in creating the databse.

Estimated attrition rates were found to be lowest for the group of programs primarily offering diplomas, with a rate of 59 percent, and highest for those offering Associate degrees, with a rate of 79 percent. Open-ended interviews were conducted with 20 students who transferred from a mainstream postsecondary program to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. Three reasons were identified to explain the students' withdrawal from their first college: inability to communicate with teachers, inadequate support services, and limited opportunities for social interaction with peers. It is concluded that accommodations to meet the special needs of  hearing-impaired learners may not be adequate to ensure their graduation, and a reason for the high rates of attrition may be a lack of social and academic integration of hearing-impaired students into mainstreamed college life.

The 52 children in the curriculum group viewed 10 episodes from the &quot;Inside/Out&quot; series and participated in teacher-led discussions. The episodes dealt with expressing feelings, making new friends, practical jokes, embarrassment, emotional abuse at home, responsibility at home, peer acceptance, coping with bullies, positive thinking, etc. The Teacher Blaming and Peer Inclusion subtests of the Social Problem Analysis Situation Measure were administered as pre-posttests. Other data were gathered through peer ratings, teacher ratings, and observation of problem-solving ability during an arts and crafts activity. The &quot;Inside/Out&quot;  curriculum was not found to be an effective means of changing learning-disabled children's social problem-solving knowledge, peer relations, or behavior. The curriculum-group children were not rated as more popular or less aggressive than control-group children. Several suggestions for improving the curriculum are offered. (Author/JDD)",

Funding was acquired to employ two statewide consultant speech pathologists with expertise in augmentative communication to serve the preschool and school-aged population. The consultants conducted workshops and provided individual consultancies on a collaborative basis throughout Victoria. Prior to each workshop, the consultants visited the facility to observe the classroom program, teacher-student interaction, and the use of augmentative communication, and to assess staff training needs to be covered in the  workshop. Workshops covered such topics as saliva control, mealtime assistance, early communication, augmentative communication, and aided and unaided communication. Lectures were also developed and delivered at colleges to teach residential staff, therapy aides, and educators about the management of severe communication impairments.

By manipulating the existing curriculum and environment, educators can cultivate the skills necessary for success in the working world. Studies have shown that common reasons for employee terminations are tardiness, inability to follow directions, not taking work seriously, poor attitude toward the public, and absenteeism. These abilities, expectations, and standards are areas in which students may need coaching and training. Through mainstreaming into a regular classroom, the student will learn many of the necessary skills to be successful in the marketplace. Important  personality and employability traits include organization, decision-making, proper use of time, ability to work in a group, dependability, sense of fairness, and pride in work. Specific lessons are presented which are designed to maintain the essence of a content area lesson, yet help to build necessary personality traits and work ethics; these lessons focus on reading, social studies, and letter writing.

Organizational management of classroom elements takes into consideration the physical arrangement of the classroom, a consistent schedule of activities, procedures for handling classroom routines, and rules for classroom behavior. Anticipation and re-direction of circumstances that may lead to misbehavior can occur in three ways: through lesson planning and delivery, through the use of specific teacher behaviors, and through knowledge of individual student behavior patterns. Finally,  creating a positive, encouraging classroom environment calls for high levels of student success and involvement in classroom activities, the use of encouragement instead of praise, and an attempt to avoid criticizing or demeaning students when they misbehave or make academic errors.

The role of assessment in educational programs is explored through presentation of three contrasting perspectives: assessment for placement versus assessment for instruction, education for the handicapped versus special education, and bureaucratic form versus educational reform. The CBA approach requires mechanisms for the collection of data and higher expectations of students. Instructional assistance involves motivating the student, teaching to mastery, and practicing until the skill becomes automatic. CBA can eliminate a large proportion of referrals to special education and expensive pull-out programs  through use of more effective instructional strategies. The CBA concept rests on the finding that students learn better when taught at the &quot;instructional&quot; level, where a student already knows 93% to 97% of the material to be read or 70% to 85% of the material to be practiced in drill. An example of applying CBA to reading instruction presents techniques for word recognition, fluency, and comprehension. The appendix contains descriptions of schools that have implemented CBA.

English-speaking diplomats, businessmen, and their wives were surveyed with Likert-type and open-ended questions. Results indicated that Finns have a good command of English grammar, with difficulties in communication attributed to limited vocabulary and inappropriate word choice. Finns are not seen as lacking empathy, enthusiasm, or friendliness, which are necessary elements in intercultural communication, but barriers to communication may be caused by the Finnish culture-related communication patterns that the Finns transfer into English-language communication: Finns are seen as too silent, shy, and guarded in intercultural communication with English-speakers,  among whom great cultural value is given to verbal communication. It is concluded that English-language instruction in school should have as an objective the lowering of these barriers to intercultural communication, by making Finns aware of the barriers and by teaching linguistic strategies to avoid or overcome them. Descriptions of intercultural differences among Americans, British, Canadians, and Finns gained through the survey are also seen as having value for textbook writers and for providing information about manners and mannerisms for use in English-language instruction.

The model departs significantly from notions of metalinguistic performance outlined in previous research, and is derived principally from recent work in category theory. A distinction is made between categorical knowledge and certain ad hoc and contextually variable concepts used to represent such presumed knowledge. Particular emphasis is placed on accounting for the instability of grammatical judgments, even in a single individual. The arguments and evidence are presented as tentative and preliminary in the search for a coherent picture of performance on grammaticality judgment tasks and of the  relationship of this performance to linguistic knowledge.

The specific exchange analyzed was direction-giving, and evidence of use of a &quot;foreigner&quot; register was sought in type-token ratios, t-units, and such interactional features as comprehension checks. Results support the idea that direction-giving is highly conventionalized, with direction-givers making few modifications in the form and content of discourse to non-native addressees.

These LEP students had entered the United States at an average age of 14 years 6 months, and entered the school system at an average age of 15 years 2 months. The population received English as a second language (ESL) and bilingual program services for an average of a little over seven quarters. All were fluent and literate in their first languages. The students achieved gains in English  language proficiency and nearly a fifth-grade equivalency on three reading and basic skills tests. The LEP students graduated in almost the same proportion as fully English-proficient (FEP) students, and several LEP students required more than one additional year of high school to earn their diplomas. Other findings include: entry level placement may be associated with English language gains and academic achievement, and early and intensive ESL instruction may be more effective for non-English-speakers than for students who speak some English on arrival.

The study was used as a basis for the development of composition courses for limited-English-speaking students in these fields, the most popular fields of study among foreign students. Eighty take-home assignments given in 17 courses from 12 subject departments in the natural sciences and engineering fields at the University of Texas were classified according to writing task type and the skills required to complete the assignment. It was found that 75% of the writing tasks were &quot;lab reports,&quot; and summary and paraphrase were the dominant skills needed to write the &quot;lab reports.&quot; Lower division English composition textbooks were then examined to see if  they addressed these skills adequately. One book was found to meet this need, but most textbooks did not. It was concluded that separate composition classes should be provided for foreign students majoring in the natural sciences and engineering fields and that these courses should de-emphasize research paper writing and place greater emphasis on development of summary and paraphrase skills.

A survey of senior business administration students in five geographically diverse universities explored attitudes toward foreign language study, factors influencing decisions to take or not take foreign language courses, and perceptions of the relevance of second language competence to future career success.

The small group of students in the 3-year specialization are chosen competitively from a large applicant pool. While no Japanese language knowledge is required for entry to the program, many students have some experience with the language. By program completion, students have spent at least 3 years in intensive Japanese language study, including 1.5 years in Japan. The language program's five phases include: (1) an 8-week intensive summer training course; (2) two semesters of intensive international business courses and Japanese business language studies; (3) a second 8-week intensive summer program; (4) two semesters of study at a Japanese  university; and (5) use and continued learning of business Japanese through a 6-to-7-month internship. Emphasis is on development of oral skills. The program is rigorous and demanding. The structure and assignments of the overseas internship vary according to the employer's needs, but tend to offer more generalized training than American internships. Companies evaluate the students at the end of the internships. The program has been very successful in establishing good relationships with companies and in placing graduates. (MSE)",

The change was triggered by accreditation requirements and personal interests, and was intended to provide students with information about international aspects of accounting. Initially, modules were developed to supplement the regular course content. At the end of the course, four class periods were devoted to: (1) deciphering foreign financial statements with different valuation bases; (2) alternative methods of establishing accounting standards; (3) international standards and organizations; and (4) foreign currency translation. In general, students responded favorably to the modules and tested reasonably well on the materials presented. However, the students reported that some  aspects of the approach caused concern, including the lack of suitable materials, dependence on lecture presentation, and students' perceptions of the content as supplementary, and therefore unimportant. As a result, the course objective was broadened to include the use of international components to foster an understanding of the nature of financial accounting information and reporting in the United States and comprehension of the degree to which that nature is a function of culture. International components were created to enhance all aspects of course content, and a supplementary text was added to the required materials. The costs were relatively low, and about 6 class hours were allocated to international topics. (MSE)",

Students then assume the roles of people from different parts of the country, and finally, list three stereotypes about the people they love that they do not want others to have. A second exercise has students  compare cultural differences with differences among executives and executive levels in any organization, including a comparison between themselves and their bosses. This addresses the role of power in relationships. Students then discuss ways they have seen American culture transferred to other cultures. The third exercise has students research other countries and businesses. Students then role-play a brief intercultural meeting. These exercises help reduce student provincialism and heighten cultural awareness. (MSE)",

        "description":"As awareness of the need for ethical business behavior increases, businesspeople must address the issue of an ethical standard acceptable for use in international business or, in individual situations, which country's ethical standards will be respected. Ethical absolutes cannot be determined without cultural bias. Legalistic, religious, and situational frameworks all reflect existing prejudices and values. Legalistic ethics occur most commonly in low-context cultures that place great value on the written word. High-context cultures tend to favor a situational approach to ethics. Religious ethics are determined by the individual religion to which one adheres. In each of these cases, culture divides the ground for a universal ethical standard. In international business, the  question arises: at what point should one reject the norms and values of one's own culture to accommodate those of another? The most practical approach to the international businessman is ethical relativity, a willingness to modify one's own ethical views to communicate effectively across cultures. However, ethical relativism in international business does not address the situation in which a society condemns people based on an immutable characteristic such as gender or race. Businesspeople should be encouraged to accept and work with cultural differences but adhere to individual ethics. (MSE)",

This failure has caused concern and heightened interest in training expatriate managers for cross-cultural appreciation and communication skills. The most commonly cited reasons for failure are the manager's and spouse's inability to adjust to cultural differences. A variety of resources for cross-cultural information are available. Components recommended for cross-cultural training include native and target culture communication skills development, culture-specific information, and general cultural awareness training. The design of existing training programs varies greatly. A study shows that U.S. firms and universities lag far behind their foreign counterparts in employee  cross-cultural training, while other research shows that such training is effective in promoting business success. A five-phase cross-cultural communication training module has been designed to provide sensitization to the participant's own concept of culture and to promote appreciation of cultural diversity. The five phases include: (1) dyadic discussions of &quot;outsider&quot; experiences; (2) probing of participant membership in subcultures and subgroups; (3) small group discussion of the role of shared characteristics among culturally diverse individuals in appreciating differences; (4) cross-cultural simulation; and (5) debriefing and discussion.

Student responses to exam questions were evaluated, and the following difficulties were noted: (1) spelling and punctuation errors; (2) organization and logical sequencing mistakes; and (3) deficient sentences. Both groups of students had difficulty with word choice, verbs (especially tense consistency), sentence structure, prepositions, and inconsistencies in person or number. A teaching technique involving frequent practice and feedback was developed. Students were required to  submit a 1-page accounting case analysis each week. Class time was devoted to discussions of various writing skills and issues each week. Samples of student writing were discussed, and group suggestions for revision were encouraged. The amount of initial preparation and class time devoted to the exercises was relatively small, but evaluation of each case was somewhat time-consuming. Benefits of the technique included student appreciation of the value of writing skills in accounting, weekly acknowledgement of student efforts to improve, assistance given simultaneously to ESL and non-ESL students, and improved understanding of accounting issues.

A questionnaire was administered to both native speakers of English (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) of English to determine: (1) their ability to differentiate NS- and NNS-originated texts and to identify the author's intent, and (2) their familiarity with advertising contexts and/or non-native varieties and how that familiarity affected understanding of the content. Both NS and NNS were equally able to identify NS-originated texts, but NS were more sensitive to NNS-originated texts. NS readers were better able to identify  promotional correspondence, while NNS reasers evaluated sales offers less positively than business communications, regardless of the text's origin. Results suggest that readers' ability to distinguish NS- and NNS-originated texts may influence receptivity to cross-cultural promotional campaigns communicated in English. It is concluded that it may not be differences, but attitudes toward those differences, that help determine the acceptance and effect of varieties of English used in cross-cultural contexts. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study compared and contrasted the use of openings, summational closings, and closures in Italian and U.S. business letters to examine the role of culture in international business communication. It is argued that the Italian business letter should be studied in a functional intra-cultural perspective where its meaning creates and maintains social reality. To support this proposition, cultural idioms and genre markers in letter openings and closings are identified as requiring explicit understanding by students of international commerce and by students of Italian who are studying the genre. Three types of Italian business letters are reviewed and classified, and the results are discussed. Analysis of U.S. letters reveals them to be far more formulaic and consistent by  comparison, resulting in a completely opposite tonal quality. Additional research on \"live file\" Italian letters and on Italian-American intercultural business correspondence is recommended. (MSE)",

The unit is intended to teach students how to compile information on overseas markets and competitors. Online retrieval is seen as a relatively inexpensive means of gathering important data from otherwise inaccessible international sources. The required hardware include a computer or computer terminal, a hard or floppy disk storage device, and a modem. Also necessary is communications software that can handle log-on procedures for each information service used, maintain user confidentiality, and allow capture and storage of all displayed text. In a class assignment, students conduct a study of real market opportunities for real regional or relevant hypothetical firms.  The assignment consists of a cultural analysis, economic analysis, and product/market evaluation, with each component requiring extensive secondary research. The objectives are to increase student awareness of the range of information available electronically and to improve students' ability to gather and apply the information to marketing decisions. The variety of available information services is discussed, and the logistic problems associated with online retrieval are examined. (MSE)",

The committee's findings are reported, and the development of the program based on these findings is described. The resulting choice of language and of program design elements and decisions are outlined, including separate language instruction for engineers, an internship  component, establishment of an advisory board, recruitment, and initial course success.

The comparative study was undertaken to determine whether a more rapidly administered procedure than the oral interview would give similar results. College students of French at varying levels took all three tests and were surveyed afterward for their reactions to them. Preliminary results indicate a moderate correlation between the two MLA tests and the oral interview, suggesting that in some circumstances, these tests might be used to replace the interview. It was also noted  that while the MLA listening test is more efficient, some problems of interpretation must be addressed. Results of the student preference survey are still being analyzed.

The core of the unit is the creation of a fictitious company whose operation lends itself to a variety of exercises tailored to the needs of students at various levels of language proficiency and business knowledge. Intense role-playing, class discussions using special terminology, and key concepts of French business are used. The unit requires a minimum of six sessions to complete, and some knowledge of commercial company law is a prerequisite. The class is divided into groups for decision-making as the company is formed, and students discuss ideas for an appropriate business. Then,  four aspects of the company's formation are considered: (1) its legal form; (2) the establishment process; (3) a suitable organization for smooth operation; and (4) a marketing strategy. An example of the establishment of a fictitious business by this teaching method is provided, and the four steps are described.

The situation card can reveal the particulars of grammar, vocabulary, and fluency on which the student still needs work. A pool of business Spanish situation cards can be adapted to reflect and enhance any aspect of course content and reinforce target vocabulary. The cards also provide spontaneity that develops a realistic student flexibility. The situations seem to be most effective when they are presented in English so that  students do not misunderstand the directions and so that key vocabulary words and phrases are not revealed. Cards can be used regularly, perhaps at the end of each class session. Individual performances should be tape-recorded for student review. A selection of situation cards adapted from the ACTFL/ETS model are presented, and the procedure for their use is reviewed. The situations are designed for three proficiency levels (intermediate, advanced, and superior) and contain a variety of scenario types and topics. (MSE)",

Global perspective is seen as having five dimensions: (1) perspective consciousness; (2) &quot;state of the planet&quot; awareness; (3) cross-cultural awareness; (4) knowledge of global dynamics; and (5) awareness of human choices. Concordia's curriculum combines business with foreign language studies, in Spanish, French, or German. Undergraduate course requirements for the Spanish emphasis include principles of accounting, intermediate accounting theory, principles of economics, managerial finance, statistics for economics and business, Hispanic culture and communications, advanced Spanish conversation and composition, business  Spanish, and Latin American views. In combination with the liberal arts requirements, at some point during the course of study, students are exposed to the first dimension, perspective consciousness. This dimension is narrowed and focused for each language area and includes &quot;state of the planet&quot; and cross-cultural awareness in the business language course. Students are then eligible to apply for a semester of internship abroad. Overseas coordinators establish and maintain ties with corporations, locate housing, and advise students during their period abroad. (MSE)",

Events in the classes were found to be related through the teacher's orchestration of student performance. This \"performance\" was realized through five distinct routines for practicing English, which established a common repertoire of rehearsal behaviors and shared knowledge. The routines included: (1) choral practice; (2) complex recitations involving written texts, spoken exchanges, linguistic analyses, and paradigmatic examples; (3) ensemble practice; (4) guided improvisation; and (5) independent practice. The value of the routines is assessed in  view of their potential to foster experiential learning and problem-solving behaviors appropriate to students preparing for academic studies in the second language.

Data were drawn from tape recordings and developmental diaries kept on the two preschool children. Patterns of parent-child and child-child corrections were examined. In parent-child corrections it was found that the father, a native speaker of American English, corrected most often for negative transfer from one language to another, primarily Germanisms brought into English usage. In contrast, the native German-speaking mother corrected primarily the error types monolingual German children make, particularly inflections. Repair was made most often in the turn just following the discrepancy. In  child-child corrections, the older child began correcting his sister at age four years, three months. At first, corrections focused on facts, then on language usage and style, and subsequently on interference. Later he turned to giving explanations or appropriate contexts for the repair. At just five years, he made his first syntactic correction. The younger child did not correct her brother during the study. Overall, the repair patterns parallel those found in other studies. (MSE)",

Rules for positive and negative politeness, which increase solidarity and increase imposition are explained, including (1) the solidarity rule, (2) the option rule, (3) the indirect rule, (4) the deference rule, and (5) the irony rule. The system of politeness  in Japanese is briefly described, and compared and contrasted with English adherence to politeness rules. It is suggested that study of politeness in intercultural interactions analyze only actual, not contrived, interactions, and that analyses not be based on comparisons of the differences in Japanese and American intracultural interactions.

        "description":"The Committee on Education and Labor oversight hearing on historically black colleges and universities focused on their unique role and mission in the United States. Colleges created to serve black Americans have existed for over 135 years, and during this time, they have demonstrated their ability to meet the special needs of black students. There are currently just over 100 such colleges, and they enroll nearly 20% of all black Americans attending college. Though funding problems have made several of these institutions close their doors, recently they have enjoyed a resurgence of strength and popularity. This hearing looks closely at the outcome of the nation's investment in black colleges and universities to better understand what is happening on their campuses today and to  explore their future needs. Statements are presented from Congressmen Pat Williams, Tim Valentine, and Major Owens as well as several members of panels on Financial Assistance for Student and Faculty Development. It is recommended that a commission on black education rather than on higher education be considered. Prepared statements and supplementary materials from 14 representatives of black colleges are included. (SM)",

They served as forums for addressing the role of public colleges and universities in fostering economic development in their communities, regions, states, and the nation. Conference participants included college and university presidents, faculty members, corporate and association heads, and civic leaders. The conferences included more than 60 speeches, workshops, and panel discussions, and selected,  edited excerpts from the conferences are presented. Four chapters look at the higher education and economic development of the midwest, the south, the northeast, and the west. Each section provides an overview of the conference, the agenda, and selected excerpts.

Following a discussion of some aspects of adult needs in the instruction environment, the critical features of control theory, synergogy, and cooperative learning in general are examined. The advantages and limitations of specific cooperative instructional designs are identified. An instructional design is proposed that is intended to maximize the effectiveness of instruction for both the learner and the instructor. It is concluded that for maximum achievement, the cooperative learning design should include such elements as: task specialization for each individual on the team; group study and collaboration; assessment of individual member  performance on a task; a group or team \"score\" based on individual members' performance; and use of specific group rewards based on individual learning. An example of such a cooperative learning design is provided. Contains 10 references. (KM)",

Learning style and the Tinto Model of student attrition are discussed, along with the personality theory of Carl Jung which serves as the conceptual foundation for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality assessment. The TRAILS project positions educators to use the MBTI both in institutional studies and in campus programs. Most undergraduate students complete the MBTI as part of the housing application process or the freshman orientation program. Preliminary TRAILS data are presented pertaining to using the MBTI to  describe academic populations, the relationship of the MBTI and measures of academic aptitude, the relationship of the MBTI and academic achievement, and using the MBTI to understand persistence patterns. It is suggested that certain personality characteristics affect student performance in many ways. The project attempts to meld these pieces in a comprehensive enrollment research scheme. Preliminary data suggest there are no differences between types of learners in upper-class academic achievement in the heart of their chosen curriculum. Also, if certain types of learners tend to score lower on aptitude tests then others, the trend of declining board scores takes on new meaning. Tables are included. Contains 15 references. (SM)",

An Adviser Effectiveness Questionnaire was developed and administered to freshmen in 1981 (the last class advised under the old system), 1985 and 1988. Subsamples of the data including all freshman advisors were analyzed. Statistically significant differences between the 1985 and 1988 groups were found on 15 of the 16 individual  items and on the General Advising Effectiveness Scale. On all separate measures of satisfaction, students in the 1988 group scored in the more satisfied direction than those in the 1985 group. Comparisons of means revealed only two statistically significant differences between the 1988 and 1991 groups, suggesting that generally the improvement in satisfaction with advising and overall gains in advising effectiveness have been maintained. Student gains in satisfaction across the personal, career, academic and study skills areas of advising were associated with increased overall happiness with the college. Data are presented in two tables. (KM)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted of 55 American Association of Universities institutions regarding the guidelines, policies and procedures of their academic integrity systems. Forty-four universities responded, returning 42 questionnaires and 35 guidelines. Examination of the guidelines revealed very little overlap in procedures. Most institutions claimed that their procedures work effectively, but comments suggested some concern. Eleven questions are presented and discussed that will aid an institution in building an academic integrity system that fits its philosophy and mission: (1) What actions should be considered violations of academic integrity? Should academic dishonesty be considered separate from academic misconduct? What constitutes proof of a violation against the academic  integrity code? (2) Should the university establish an Honor Code to cover some or all of the defined violations? (3) What are the rights, protections and responsibilities of the students? (4) What are the rights, protections and responsibilities of the faculty? (5) Should the same procedures be applied to undergraduates in all colleges, or should each college maintain its own procedures? (6) Should academic integrity violations be processed by an office of student affairs, or should such violations be the responsibility of an office of academic affairs? (7) What procedures should be established for deciding and appealing a violation against academic integrity? (8) What sanctions should be applied against violations of academic integrity? And should these sanctions correlate with the type  of violation or should sanctions be imposed at the discretion of the person(s) responsible for imposing them? (9) How should records of violations be kept? (10) Which members of the university should revise the policy and procedures of the academic integrity system? (11) How should the policy and procedures concerning academic integrity be presented to students, faculty and administrators?

        "description":"A South Dakota State University model for developing student outcomes assessment plans in undergraduate family science programs is presented. This model consists of several steps: clarification of the departmental mission, goals, and objectives; specification of desired student outcomes; development of reliable, valid measures of student outcomes; and utilization of assessment data for curriculum review and revision. An exit exam was developed by a departmental assessment team at the university to assess the mastery of a common set of cognitive competence for all students completing the undergraduate major in child development and family relations. It was given to students within this major then revised and critiqued for reliability. Other assessment tools necessary for the  implementation of a comprehensive assessment program are noted, including performance evaluations, senior capstone projects, placement information, practicum evaluations, and student teaching evaluations. Seven recommendations made for developing an assessment plan are: secure funding for the assessment planning program; identify and communicate the goals of the assessment plan; effectively utilize faculty resources; build upon the existing information; take a proactive approach; distinguish between undergraduate and graduate programs assessment; and keep communications open with university administration regarding expectations for and uses of assessment data.

        "description":"From March through October of 1986, 44,453 students took the New Jersey College Basic Skills Placement Test (NJCBSPT) at the 30 New Jersey public colleges and 11 participating independent institutions of higher education. Designed to provide data for summary reports to the Board of Higher Education and to help colleges place already admitted students into first-level or remedial English and mathematics courses, the NJCBSPT has been administered for the past nine years. The system-wide proficiency results in the report do not always coincide with the percentages of students placed into remedial courses because the NJCBSPT is but one of the indicators the colleges use in making placements. For each of the last nine years, test results have been very stable and consistently  disappointing. The proportion of students who are well prepared to begin college work in New Jersey continues to be far below a desirable level. Results are presented by statewide findings, college sectors, recent and non-recent high school graduates, perceptions vs. performance, demographic data, and outcomes of skills-deficient students in college. Five appendices include: a description of the NJCBSPT, NJCBSPT mean scaled scores for 1982-1986, a description of the proficiency levels established by the Basic Skills Council, items representative of those included on the NJCBSPT mathematics section, and a comparison of statewide self-reported student background data for 1982-1986.

A comparison is presented of students who needed and completed remediation; students who did not need remediation; and those who needed remediation but did not complete it. Findings are described for the New Jersey Higher Education System and for individual colleges. Seven outcome indicators reviewed for the student groups are passing rates, retention rates, college credits earned, grade point average, successful survival rates, pre- and post-testing, and performance in subsequent courses. Part-time remediation is  noted. Conclusions include the need for improvement of the quality and completeness of the data on remedial outcomes that colleges collect. and note that New Jersey's remedial programs are successful in raising the skill levels of students who complete remediation. Recommendations include having all public colleges use exit-testing for their remedial programs and making sure all faculty teaching basic reading, writing, and mathematics access the latest research on effective teaching. Two appendices show sample tables (i.e. testing and placement of students, enrollment in and completion of remedial courses, and pre- and post-test results for remedial courses in reading, writing, math computation, and elementary algebra) and a listing of areas of research for future use.

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in federally assisted education programs. A 1984 ruling held that Title IX covers only programs or activities funded with federal money. In March 1988, the Civil Rights Restoration Act ensured that Title IX applies to the entire institution regardless of where federal funds are used. Sections focus on the following: which institutions are covered; exemptions (admissions, military school, and religious); affirmative remedial action; discrimination; how to treat students (admissions, recruitment, housing/facilities, courses, educational activities, counseling, financial aid,  employment aid, health and insurance benefits, abortion, marital or prenatal status, athletics, textbooks and curricular materials, sexual and peer harassment, and sexual assault, abuse, and rape); how to treat employees (recruitment, compensation, job classification, fringe benefits, marital/prenatal status, pregnancy, and pre-employment inquiries); a list of actions for institutions to take (i.e. assuring the government they are complying with Title IX requirements and adopting and publishing grievance procedures); and single-sex organizations/programs (groups whose membership practices are exempt, programs operated by educational institutions, and programs not operated by educational institutions but receiving significant assistance from recipients of federal funds).

The college-readiness programs in eight states (Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas) are discussed and compared. The Tennessee Board of Regents program is considered promising, in that it provides detailed placement and assessment results to high school principals, district and school board administrators, state education officials, and legislators. Differences in the reporting process and type of information reported among the  states with college-readiness reporting programs are discussed.

The study reveals that the rate of increased financial support for public colleges and universities from state and local governments in most SREB states has been below the rate of increase nationwide. Per-student state and local funding has not kept up with inflation in most of the states. Salary increases for full-time faculty have not kept pace with either the rates of increase nationwide nor with the rate of increase in per capita income in most states. The proportion of state budgets going to public higher education has declined in nearly all the states. Students are bearing a growing share of costs in most  states, while tax funds cover less than before. Specific findings are reported in the following areas: actual financial support, relative priority of higher education funding, changes in public higher education funding strategies and methods, states' ability to pay, states' willingness to pay, and the demand for public higher education services. Charts illustrate findings in each area, and a table is appended showing state appropriations for public higher education for full-time-equivalent students, 1980 through 1987. (KM)",

The overlap of innovation in organizations, strategic planning, and program evaluation is important in this development. Administrators, trustees, and faculty members need to understand how institutions are being transformed in today's environment. Suggestions for improving the process of developing new programs include creating and maintaining a climate for innovation, bringing innovative people into the institution, developing a selective strategy, and developing the means to look outward. Four sections look at the following: (1) organizations and innovation (from social change to individual  creativity, the process, people, and product involved in innovation, and strategies for innovation); (2) academic program planning (definitions and delineations, the planning environment, program review, program discontinuance, the development of new academic programs); (3) decisions about the development of new academic programs (major considerations, internal strengths and capabilities, external needs and opportunities, program and priority decisions, and program approval at the system and state levels); and (4) improving the process (the existing vacuum, factors for success, and practical prescriptions).

Four sections focus on the following: (1) peer teaching and the psychological basis for its benefits (cognitive level, affective level, and peer learning); (2) types of peer teaching used in higher education (teaching assistants, tutors, counselors, partnerships, and work groups); (3) strategies for academic planners (public relations, recruitment and selection, training, peer teaching manuals, and systematic approaches); and (4) how the classroom teacher can implement peer teaching (peer teaching experiences and approaches to peer teaching). The importance of further study to know whether different peer groups can be  used consciously to enhance the learner's commitment to academic work is noted. A review of the literature on the subject reveals a need to better study the role of the professor in peer teaching. The fact that evaluation of peer teaching is fairly primitive raises the points that faculty should proceed cautiously in starting new programs, and there is a huge opportunity for evaluation studies. Recommendations from current literature include the following: learning may occur when students work cooperatively, both peer teachers and peer learners learn, and learning may increase with a blend of situations in which professors are present and are not present.

        "description":"The first market-based faculty salary model to be used at the University of Alaska to estimate the extent of a market problem and guide the distribution of a special market salary fund is presented. It addresses critical market-based inequities within key teaching disciplines experiencing difficulty in retaining and attracting high caliber faculty. In July 1988, the Board of Regents authorized the distribution of $1.5 million for faculty market compensation adjustments, contingent upon the lapse of an equal amount from the FY88 budget. The report contains a statement of the problem which led to the development of the market salary proposal, the methodology and analysis utilized in the market study, and the results of the market salary distribution. Results indicate, with varying  degrees of tractability, that each institution implemented the following salary adjustments: University of Alaska Anchorage, $525,000 allocation and $541,065 actual; Fairbanks, $925,000 allocation and $935,754 actual; and Southeast, $50,000 allocation and $50,500 actual. Thus, by the end of fiscal year 1988 more than 59% of the University of Alaska faculty would be below the Alaska adjusted national market salary average for their respective discipline rank. Appended are two tables showing Oklahoma State University and CUPA-AASCU (College and University Personnel Association-American Association of State Colleges and Universities) Faculty Salary Survey market data by rank and discipline.

It is noted that, although the students who attended the program were enthusiastic, the number of applicants was lower than had been expected. It is suggested that the low attendance was due in part to lack of encouragement by teachers. It is also suggested that the program ought to be longer in duration in order to provide more opportunities for hands-on experience. Finally, concern is expressed that the only female students who were interested in the program seemed to be students already considering study in science, technology, or mathematics,  despite the fact that the Sussex program is interdisciplinary in nature and might be of interest to students still undecided about their career paths.

The paper begins with a discussion of consumer copying behavior which summarizes the effects that raise the demand for originals (i.e., stimulation of hardware purchases, network externalities, and purchase of originals to make copies), and discusses the effects of demand on the cost of copies. A strategy for estimating the effects of copying on the producers of originals is then outlined, and a brief discussion of the effects of copying on the  price of originals concludes the paper.

The implications of the research findings for likely marketplace developments in an unregulated environment are discussed, and it is concluded that there is no sound basis to expect that unregulated marketplace mechanisms will effectively limit the amount of advertising aimed at children. Policy alternatives for resolving this issue are then presented and discussed with emphasis on the following key issues: (1) whether the public interest requires the maintenance of advertising guidelines for children's programming; (2) whether children are sensitive to commercialization, and whether they will tend to switch from  one channel to another to avoid overcommercialization; (3) whether competitive market forces will tend to place constraints on commercialization in children's programs, and how the amount of commercial time presented while limits were in effect would compare to the amount presented without such limitations; (4) policies that should be pursued to limit children's exposure to television advertising and how a policy limiting commercial content would affect the number and type of programs available for children; and (5) how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should address concerns about programs associated with toys.

        "description":"Acknowledging the importance of communications in economic development, this paper discusses the rationale behind the decision of the Andean Pact nations of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela to develop a regional satellite communication system to be known as CONDOR. The application of contextual theorizing to the decision-making process is illustrated through a reconstruction of the environment in which the decisions took place, and factors that influenced the process are identified. It is noted that the sources of data used included primary documents from the Andean Pact countries, minutes of board meetings on the project, minutes of Andean Pact ministers of communication meetings, interviews with senior government officials of the Colombian ministry of  communications, and feasibility studies commissioned by the Pact nations. Discussions of the major factors that influenced the decision-making process consider the geographical situation of the five countries, national sovereignty, and geopolitics, i.e., the desire to be independent of extraregional communications organizations.

        "description":"This paper looks at nine states--California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Nebraska, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington--in an effort to find common themes in the processes and outcomes of post-divestiture state telecommunications policies. The possible consequences of current state policies are then discussed, and it is suggested that changes in these policies, which have traditionally favored competition, may lead to two classes of telecommunications infrastructure for the country: (1) an advanced infrastructure available primarily to those who can pay for access, such as large business users; and (2) a less advanced infrastructure, available to and intended for small users such as residential customers and small businesses. It is argued that state policy has often been  designed to encourage competition so as to minimize the flight of large users for the local network. Concluding that the encouragement of competition is both sound and inevitable, the paper advocates the use of competition as the point of departure for telecommunications policy, not as an end in itself.

        "description":"Vendors frequently compete to have their technology adopted as part of a voluntary consensus standard, and this paper reports the results of an empirical study of the factors that influence the choice of technologies by voluntary technical standards committees. Participation in standards committees is viewed as an aspect of the product development process of corporations involved in markets where network externalities are present. The factors hypothesized to affect the technology decision are: (1) the market power of the coalition sponsoring the technology; (2) the size of the firms that make up the coalition; (3) the promotional activities of the sponsors (such as technical contributions submitted); (4) the perceived superiority of the technology; (5) the political skills of the  coalition; and (6) the installed base of the products containing the technology. These hypotheses were tested by collecting data on specific technical decisions that were made in several standards committees in the area of computer communications hardware. Logit regression was used to infer the importance of each factor in the adoption or non-adoption of the technology. The results suggest that the size of the firms in the coalition supporting the technology and the extent to which they support their positions through written contributions are significant determinants of technological choice in the standards decisions studied, although the market share of these firms was found to be only marginally significant. The proponents of both the adopted and non-adopted technologies were found to  have equal belief in the technical superiority of their technical alternative, even after the decision. The installed base of a technology and the process skills of the sponsors were not found to be significant predictors of the committee outcome.

The office is responsible for the development, acquisition, scheduling, and utilization of television and radio resources for grades K-12, staff development, and adult education, which are broadcast over the South Carolina Educational Television and Radio Networks, and for the administration of computer-assisted instruction in the public schools. The staff participated in identifying 56 major objectives for the office's Annual Management Plan, and a calendar of activities was developed so that each staff member could review monthly progress. Primary activities for the year in computer-assisted instruction included revising computer  software advisory listings, providing workshops, and conducting the fifth annual statewide computer survey. The staff of the Utilization Section conducted an annual utilization survey of interactive television (ITV) and radio in order to better manage delivery of consultant services, improve local reception, schedule resources over the network, and place radio and television sets where they are most needed. In addition, a diversified program of staff development offerings was broadcast daily, consisting of 43 ITV and radio series and 99 single-program specials, and 13 teleconferences were held during the year. A statewide survey of computer use in schools and districts was undertaken, and the results are compared with those of previous surveys.

This final report on the 2.5 year project discusses: (1) the procurement of equipment; (2) the backgrounds of the client sectors who participated in the demonstration project; (3) strategic market planning; (4) networking techniques used to create a long-term network; and (5) educating the general public about facsimile technology and its potentials. The statistical section of the report provides  measurements of the volume of use and patron satisfaction; compares differences in sector usage; and reports the turnaround time required to deliver the information. It is concluded that the use of facsimile technology has diminished the geographical barriers separating the state from national power brokers and made information access more equitable to individuals residing in the state. Seven appendixes include a description of the project requirements and an application form for libraries wishing to participate; an outline of the goals and objectives of the project; a statement of system policy on telefacsimile use; an analysis of the costs of providing telefacsimile services; an invitation to a seminar on \"the competitive edge\"; a Montana Faxnet information request form; and a form for  the user to evaluate Faxnet services.

Following a description of the role of academic libraries and a discussion of the need for space for expanding collections and budgetary constraints, the focus of the committee's inquiry is examined by considering alternative solutions to the problem in three general areas: (1) collaboration, encompassing such issues as collaborative acquisitions, shared access/storage; (2) technology, including high density means of publication, e.g., microformats and optical disks; and (3) new storage techniques.  Conclusions and recommendations for each of these three areas of investigation point to a need for highly efficient storage and library materials at lower costs, to a sharing of access to the pooled resources of Ohio's academic libraries, and to the benefits of future technological innovation. Six appendixes contained in 38 pages form the main body of the report. They include a summary of the study of Ohio's state-assisted colleges and universities on which this report is based; reports on site visits to the University of California, the University of Illinois, and Harvard University; a discussion of the book deterioration crisis; a review of available storage and retrieval technologies; comparable information about library facilities; and a proposal for the retrospective conversion of  bibliographic records.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to document the educational activities being offered to citizens of all ages through Indiana's 239 public libraries. A mail questionnaire was distributed to every main library and branch in the state, requesting information on the kinds and numbers of education-related services and programs provided in 1987, and estimates of program attendance, according to age groups--birth through adult, and special populations. The respondents were also asked their perceptions of the importance of their library's educational purpose relative to other purposes--informational, recreational, and cultural--served by the public libraries. Responses were received from 182 main libraries and 101 branch libraries for a response rate of 73%. The report begins with a  discussion of the public library's roles in a community and in society, which is followed by a description of the methodology of the study. Findings are then examined according to the areas of services and programs offered by the libraries to the various age groups and special populations, and data are summarized in a series of 25 tables. It is concluded that a variety of activities are being conducted throughout the state that provide learning opportunities for thousands of state residents from birth through older years. Librarians' perceptions of the library's purposes are also summarized. A copy of the survey and a summary of survey statistics are appended. (10 notes) (CGD)",

        "description":"This exploratory study focuses on the management of decline as characterized by shrinking resources and substantial reductions in operating budgets (retrenchment) in academic research libraries in Canada. The first of four major sections of the report addresses the management of retrenchment in Canadian research libraries, including the design of the study; characteristics of the 523 respondents; their perceptions of the prevalence of retrenchment; committees and policies for retrenchment; retrenchment and surplus expertise; and the centralization, formalization, and complexity of organizational structure in the 22 participating libraries. The second section reviews the literature on retrenchment in libraries and other organizations, and the third reports on programs and  activities that were eliminated, reduced, or introduced in Canadian research libraries in the areas of public, technical, and administrative services between 1972-73 and 1982-83. A discussion of trends in retrenchment in terms of expenditures, enrollment, personnel, and collections in these libraries over the same 10-year period concludes the report. Three appendixes are provided: (1) both English and French versions of the questionnaires used in the survey; (2) a list of participating libraries; and (3) French and English versions of the invitation to participate in the study and follow-up letters.

The paper begins with a list of the 12 features of the system, which is called MicroLIAS (Library Information Access System): (1) build and fully index any number of local databases; (2) access local databases and LIAS using the same body of searching skills; (3) download records from the LIAS online public access catalog into local databases; (4) input/edit records using formatted work screens and a full screen editor; (5) build variable length records with variable length fields; (6) use USMARC tags and subfields or named field tags; (7) select from multiple displays for individual records; (8)  customize indexing for each database; (9) use system-supplied and user-defined function keys; (10) interface with word processing software; (11) configure software to suit individual needs; and (12) produce customized bibliographies and book catalogs. Descriptions and examples are then provided of current MicroLIAS applications in the library's technical services (gifts control, labelling, snags control); public services (new books listing, subject bibliographies, videocassette catalog); and computing services (tracking work-in-progress, inventory control, tracing terminal problems). Also presented is a list of possible future areas of application of the system. It is suggested that the design of MicroLIAS, which treats the OPAC as a source of information rather than as an end in itself,  is an important concept that should be seriously considered in the further development of online catalogs.

After section I provides background information on the creation of a Shared Vision Task Force by the National Council for Occupational Education (NCOE) and the Community College Humanities Association (CCHA), section II describes the Task Force's activities and accomplishments and presents a glossary of terms. Section III identifies ten contributions which the humanities make to student learning outcomes in associate degree occupational programs: (1) an appreciation for what is significant about human life; (2) an understanding of human needs and problems; (3) an understanding of the unavoidable ambiguities, vagaries, and value-laden  nature of human language; (4) an ability to apply analytical skills to problems and dilemmas; (5) an appreciation of the variety of human purposes and values to be realized in solving problems; (6) the ability to approach problems that lack a singular resolution; (7) an appreciation of the importance of responding to change appropriately; (8) the ability to make judgments reflective of human values; (9) a sense of civic purpose and responsible citizenship; and (10) an appreciation of the values of diverse cultures. Section IV presents the responses of 70 business representatives, and faculty and administrators in 191 community and junior colleges concerning the validity of these contributions and their importance to employment. Next, section V sets forth basic assertions and assumptions  used by the Task Force in the development of the 18 curricular recommendations presented in section VI. Finally, section VII discusses the significance of the recommendations. Appendixes contain the Humanities Policy Statement of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, the NCOE Criteria for Excellence, the CCHA Humanities Statement, survey instruments, and a 77-item bibliography.

        "description":"In response to concerns about the loss of effectiveness of the community college transfer function, this paper examines the steady decline in rates of minority student transfer from two- to four-year colleges and offers policy recommendations for facilitating transfer and baccalaureate degree attainment. Initial sections review data showing the disproportionately high enrollment of minority college students in community colleges; trends in race and ethnicity in the U.S. population composition; racial and ethnic differences by age and region; and the decline of the transfer function and the rise of vocational curricula at community colleges during the 1960s and 1970s. Next, rates of high school completion, college entrance, and college graduation are examined to illustrate the  progress of minorities as they flow through the educational pipeline. Several descriptive and theoretical studies of minority student participation in community colleges are then reviewed, focusing on students' aspirations and findings specific to Hispanic, American Indian, and Black students. The final sections suggest alternative solutions that can promote baccalaureate attainment, including the creation of academic colleges to provide lower-division curricula, the establishment of transfer colleges within community colleges, grants and scholarships for minority transfers, state transfer student monitoring systems, special institutional initiatives, and academic partnership programs.

The variables included grades received in required courses; semesters elapsed prior to taking required courses after entering college; semesters elapsed between successful completion of coursework and taking the CLAST; completion of coursework in composition, reading, and math beyond required levels; and participation in a school-sponsored review session for one or more subtests of the CLAST. A random sample of 288 students selected from the 400 students from a moderately sized community college who took the 1984 CLAST was analyzed in terms students' status as first-time  or repeat takers and in terms of students' participation in the review courses. Study findings included the following: (1) students with a grade of C or better in a class usually did well on that respective subtest of the CLAST; (2) among students who did not take a reading class, those who took the CLAST review course performed worse on the reading subtest than those who did not take the review course; (3) for students retaking the CLAST in 1984 without having taken a review course, grades in Composition I and II were the strongest indicators of success on the grammar subtest; and (4) the overall passing rate for the essay subtest was 85.6%, with 92.4% of those taking the test for the first time passing, compared to 27.2% of those retaking the test.

        "description":"Each year, Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC) examines longitudinal data on fall term minority enrollment to identify trends which may be of interest to those involved in planning student recruitment and retention activities. The findings of the 1988 study indicated that: (1) 468 minority students enrolled at PVCC during fall 1988, representing a loss of 16 students from fall 1987 but a steady percentage of 11.1% of the student body; (2) Blacks represented 9.1% of the student population and 81.2% of the minority student population; (3) of the remaining minority students, 46 were Asian or Pacific Islanders, 25 were Hispanic, and 7 were American Indians or Alaskan natives; (4) Black male enrollment declined by 16.1% between fall 1987 and fall 1988, while the number of Black  females rose by 3.4%; (5) between fall 1987 and 1988, the percentage of new Black students fell by 15%; and (6) the percentage of Black students enrolled full time fell from 19.1% to 17.4%. These trends suggest PVCC is not recruiting and retaining as many Black students as it should, and must therefore reexamine its strategies and intensify its efforts to attract and retain minority students.

One aspect of the community college that is particularly affected by external forces is enrollment. Enrollments are influenced by legislation, the decline in the literacy of high school graduates, immigration, changes in the numbers of college-age adults and college-going rates, and employment needs. Another aspect of the two-year college that has undergone major changes is the curriculum. Emphasis on one or another curriculum area has shifted from time to time depending on student aspirations and the availability of alternative educational resources. The curriculum has experienced shifts  toward occupational studies, adult education, and general education, as well as the most recent major change in emphasis towards remedial or compensatory studies. The colleges also face several possibilities in the years ahead if current trends persist or if changes in state and local policies are implemented. Such possibilities for positive change exist in the areas of the assessment of student learning, the identification of common learning outcomes, patterns of funding, the differentiation of curriculum content from student intent, and differential rewards for colleges that achieve certain outcomes. An important prerequisite to realizing positive change in these areas is greater emphasis on educational research that measures the effect of various practices and thus changes  instructional functions.

One of the major projects of the seminar is the development of an environmental scanning database. Each student is assigned specific journals and newspapers to scan for environmental data that will augment the data gathered by students from the previous years and keep the material current. Scanners are responsible for the initial classification of the articles they submit to the database and for appending a brief statement on the implications for higher education. The Instructional Materials Center houses the hard copy of the  articles and a microcomputer to manage the electronic database. Each student is also assigned professional journals to read for pertinent literature on alternative futures, the delphi technique, environmental scanning, forecasting, policy analysis, and other topics within the scope of the seminar. The two resulting databases work in conjunction with Hypercard on a Macintosh computer. The major advantage of the program is ease of searching, sorting, and downloading. The databases are used in conjunction with a planning model that employs a variety of research techniques to develop and describe the most likely future environments and alternatives. These descriptions are then used to develop organizational plans and policies. The seminar demonstrates the possibility of organizing and  developing an environmental scanning/forecasting capability with relatively meager resources. (AAC)",

        "description":"In recent years, the Florida State Legislature has mandated that all students who enter colleges and universities must write one of four test batteries for the purpose of placement and that all students are required to pass an exit exam, the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST), at the end of the sophomore year. This paper examines the impact of mandated entry- and exit-level testing on the curriculum and on the assessment process in general. Part I considers the purposes of entry and exit testing, and questions whether there is a direct link between improving the quality of education and the initiation of standardized testing to ensure that common learning has occurred. The argument is put forth that standardized testing programs for entry-level placement and exit  examinations can effectively assure that students who need remedial courses are adequately placed and that certain basic concepts have been learned before an associate degree is awarded. Part II focuses on exit-level examinations, discussing the nature and function of the CLAST, the exam's development, the overall cost to the state for the CLAST, and the impact of the test. This section also considers the nature and function of entry-level testing programs, including the role of placement testing in the developmental process, and assesses costs and impact. Finally, part III provides personal observations and comments regarding mandated testing. This section argues for greater reliance on departmental examinations and even baccalaureate-level exams to relieve teachers of the  time-consuming, frustrating, and often onerous task of assessment and permit them more time for teaching.

        "description":"In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) implemented a series of academic reforms, including the adoption of minimum academic standards, mandatory basic skills testing, and the establishment of new general education course requirements. In order to assess the success of the reforms in shaping the curricular patterns of MDCC students, an analysis of the transcripts of 1985-86 Associate in Arts (AA) degree graduates was performed. The study sample consisted of 377 transcripts selected from a total of 2,829 AA graduates. Of these, 54% began enrollment since 1982, 33% prior to 1982, and 13% transferred from other institutions. The students attended an average of 10.2 terms, skipping or stopping out for an average of 1.5 terms. The transcript analysis  revealed that the new core general education courses were taken by 99% of the students. It was also discovered that all the students except one took the core courses prior to distribution courses, with 64% of the sample taking four of the five core courses as part of their first eight courses at college.

Current MDCC guidelines require students who score low on the Florida Multiple Assessment Programs and Services (MAPS) entrance examination to complete college preparatory coursework before they enroll in college-level courses. The study focused on 2,416 first-time-in-college students beginning at MDCC in fall 1985, who had taken the MAPS and had persisted for four semesters. Of this group, 40.4% had begun with skill deficiencies in reading, 36.5% in writing, and 38.4% in mathematics. Of the students with skill deficiencies, 40.4% successfully completed college preparatory work in reading,  50.9% in writing, and 44.7% in math. Reading had the lowest percentage of students who registered for, but did not complete college preparatory reading. Of the students who only needed to complete one remedial course, half completed it. In general, as the number of required courses increased, the course completion rate rose, although among students who were required to take all six college preparatory classes, only 5.4% did so. MDCC's placement criteria for 1986-87 are included. (AJL)",

Participants were more than 200 children of 3 to 6 years who attended one of six different types of preschool centers. Findings indicated that more than half of the 5.5-year-old children were able to conserve number, but less than 15 percent attained conserver status on length and quantity (liquid substance) tasks. Children in private kindergartens appeared to conserve earlier than did age-mates at nonprivate centers, but were eclipsed by the preprimary pupils in the senior age cohort. Though nonprivate pupils in the younger cohort appeared to lead in conserving length, private center students soon surpassed them. The preprimary children did not do well on the length  task. Subjects from nonprivate kindergartens did better than private kindergarteners in conserving quantity. On the whole, results on length and quantity tasks were erratic. Use of the child's preferred language during testing supported previous findings concerning the effectiveness of such language use. It is concluded that provision of relevant activities is important in the development of the ability to conserve. Such activities need not be sophisticated or expensive. Practice in verbalization and causal reasoning give added advantage in tasks involving explanation. Numerous charts and graphs are provided, and nearly 50 references are cited. (RH)",

A total of 214 questionnaires were returned. The majority of the respondents were either head teachers, directors, or administrators who were at the top of the career ladder in the early child care field. Participants indicated a need for and interest in additional training. Participants felt that working with a master caregiver or  other caregivers, and visiting other centers and homes would be the most effective modes of training.

Within this non-system, teachers and caregivers who work most autonomously, and have the most extensive responsibilities for the greatest number of hours with the youngest and most vulnerable children, must meet the fewest and least stringent requirements. Research and experience suggest that a systematic plan of personnel development should be implemented. This plan should include five tiers of activity: (1) in-service training and orientation for entry level personnel; (2) training and education during service for teachers and caregivers concerned with improving their teaching skills; (3) professional education and  credentialing in 4- or 5-year programs; (4) specialist preparation for professionals ready to assume leadership roles; and (5) senior leadership preparation for leaders of the profession. Each tier of activity is related in part to the stages of professional development that Karen VanderVen (1988) has suggested, and in part to traditional ideas of academic program levels. All parts of the five-tier system exist, to some degree, throughout the country. What is lacking is unification, modification, and funding commitment. Concluding discussion covers ways in which the tier system might be used to increase the number of qualified personnel, particularly minority group members. (RH)",

It identifies the instructional procedures that seem to contribute to the program's success, and details these procedures so that teachers can adopt them for immediate use in their classrooms. An overview of the program discusses competency-based instruction and mastery learning, visual mediators (schemata), cognitive and academic skills, and direct instruction. Research on the developmental teaching program is subsequently discussed in terms of effects on academic progress, reading comprehension, and math skills. Four major elements of the program that have been shown to contribute to students' improved performance are explored: (1) the emphasis on acquisition of concepts;  (2) the use of mediators, including verbal, visual, and semantic mediators, to enhance students' schema development; and (3) the use of active learning and direct instruction techniques. Implications of the concept development and cognitive skills aspects of the program for the classroom are pointed out. Concluding remarks concern issues to be resolved through further research: the efficacy of the program in promoting students' cognitive skills and the effectiveness of the program with high-achieving students.

Recent research suggests that even 2- and 3-year-old children possess a &quot;theory of mind,&quot; and know that they and other people think, know, learn, remember, and forget things. It no longer seems plausible to suggest that preschoolers are entirely unaware of their own cognitive activities or limitations. An alternative theory of overconfidence suggests that preschoolers overestimate the efficacy of their emerging strategies, not their own cognitive capacities. This possibility was empirically tested. A total of 14 preschool children and 10 second grade students watched as a target object  was hidden in one of 144 identical locations, and then predicted whether they would relocate the object after a distractor task. Results showed that younger children were more likely than older children to overestimate their performance. Both older and younger children used strategies to help themselves remember the target location, but younger children were less likely to use effective strategies. Results supported the alternative theory of overconfidence. (RH)",

The scope of the study is immense, encompassing child data from the preschool years through high school graduation, including multiple perspectives of family demographics and functional indicators of child rearing performance, and focusing on the contribution of a home visitor treatment during the preschool period. The 12 sections of the report discuss: (1) background and overview of study; (2) measurement procedures used; (3) characteristics and meaning of 72 major derived  variables; (4) establishing the construct meaning of indicator variables; (5) inferential studies controlling for socioeconomic status, including academic orientation, parental support of learning, parental generativity, parental nurturance/affection, parental control/dominance, and home environment; (6) nurturance and control; (7) school promotion and retention; (8) graduation, dropping out, and consequences; (9) multivariate analyses of outcomes; (10) personality and social behavior; (11) parenting and school-home relations; and (12) conclusions and recommendations. A summary is provided in the final chapter. It is concluded that HOPE was an effective primary prevention program relative to academic issues for boys and girls. Further, the program prevented unfavorable emotional patterns  and personality characteristics in boys and enhanced the self-concepts of girls. Over 70 references are cited, 34 of which focus on the HOPE program and related work. (RH)",

Topics addressed include prevention of early school failure, prevention of school dropout, program effects on parents, HOPE and school-family relations, as well as children's adjustment, school performance, and HOPE. Findings indicated that participation in HOPE's home visitor treatment resulted in favorable outcomes in parenting, school-family relations, school performance, and children's adjustment. HOPE related to  a larger number of favorable results for participants who had sons than for those with daughters. In the instance of Academic Orientation, however, HOPE's effects were quite similar for boys and girls. Conclusions, implications, and recommendations point to the need for all parents of young children to have opportunities to develop their own effectiveness as mediators of their children's educational experiences over all the years of learning.

The first part of the study used techniques for functional job analysis and content validation to develop information on job duties, skills, and knowledge, and the physical demands made on child care assistant teachers and head teachers. The major part of the study focused on identification of competencies of beginning and advanced teachers. Transcripts of interviews with a sample of 24 teachers from child care centers in higher education in Maine were analyzed to identify competencies. The resulting model distinguished 19 competencies and  their behavioral indicators or ways in which the child care teachers displayed the particular competency. Statistical comparisons of beginning and advanced teachers distinguished between basic and optimal skills. Other analyses revealed few statistically significant differences related to level of education or job role as assistant or head teacher. Although the sample was limited to a small segment of the population of child care teachers, these findings are supported by other research in the field. Data tables, job profiles, and the competency model are appended. Twenty-two references are cited. (RH)",

The guide begins with a list of recommendations for five areas for action in support of quality early childhood and family education. These areas include: (1) the state policy role; (2) national support; (3) coalitions and coordination; (4) program guidelines; and (5) staffing. The guide then presents an overview of the unmet needs of at-risk preschool-age children and obstacles to  the provision of comprehensive coordinated services. The unmet needs and barriers to service provide the framework for the guide. The next section of the guide describes the context within which states are developing programs, and references federal and state initiatives and multi-agency efforts. There are citations of examples from research literature, and experiences of specific projects and states, which illustrate ways in which the unmet needs and barriers have been addressed.

Findings indicate that Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and state caseload and collection data are of questionable reliability and provide limited information about interstate child support. OCSE data cannot be used to determine the relative size of states' interstate versus total caseload. OCSE data indicate that total interstate collections for fiscal year 1987 were about seven percent of total child support collections. Available caseload data show that over half of all interstate case activity is taking place in seven states. States estimate that case processing takes longer and is  less successful for interstate cases sent to other states than for in-state cases. States use varying laws and processes for enforcing interstate child support. New case processing methods are tested in interstate demonstration projects. Insufficient staff, lack of automation, and differences in states' policies, procedures, and laws are identified as barriers to effective interstate enforcement. Officials cite a variety of actions, such as standardizing policies and procedures and establishing performance standards, that could improve interstate enforcement. The study instrument is appended.

Model A implied that conduct problems would decline linearly as moral maturity increased. Model B implied that the lowest as well as the highest levels of moral maturity would be associated with fewer conduct problems, and posited a curvilinear association. Participants were 60 rural Virginia fourth- and eighth-grade students, 33 boys and 27 girls, most from lower-class families. Subjects were assessed for moral reasoning with Kohlberg's interview method and Standard Issue Scoring. Teachers independently rated classroom conduct with the Conduct scale of the Behavior Problem Checklist. Two path analyses  were conducted to test the merits of the respective models. Results did not support Model A, but accorded well with Model B. Higher social class standing, being female, and scoring toward either extreme of the moral maturity continuum all contributed independently to a reduced incidence of teacher-rated conduct problems. When the 28 subjects who exhibited more than 10 percent Stage 1 reasoning were removed from the analysis, results accorded well with the more linear findings of other investigations.

In both conditions, an experimenter introduced each child to the properties of objects while reading a story. In the computer condition, when the experimenter came to a targeted object, she typed its name. A speech synthesizer then either labeled the object or did not, and the object either moved across the screen or appeared in still frame. In the felt board condition, the experimenter moved and labeled objects as the computer did. After all objects were presented, they were removed from sight.  The child then named all the objects that he or she could remember, and the experimenter recorded the child's responses. A total of 40 children, equally distributed among preschool and kindergarten grades, were randomly assigned to a computer or felt board condition. For each condition, the same 24 objects, structured in six sets, were presented. Both action and labels increased children's recall of verbal information, regardless of the medium in which information was presented. Results suggest that action facilitates, rather than disrupts, children's learning of verbal information. (RH)",

The social networks of 75 middle class white children at 3, 6, and 9 years of age were assessed for daily contact and number of contacts with kin, nonkin, adults, peers, and same and opposite sex friends. Data from the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Longitudinal Study were used for the assessment. The data allowed for description of quantitative and qualitative changes in the children's networks as the children, presumably, became increasingly capable of choosing their social network members within the constraints set by parents and society. Age changes in the network structure that reflected the transition from home to school were  expected. Network changes were found to reflect various kinds of developmental functions. Some changes, such as the linear increase in the daily contact with peers, appeared to be gradual. Some changes, such as the shift to very little kin compared to nonkin contact, or the drop in number of opposite sex peers, appeared to occur between 3 and 6 years. Some changes, such as the increase in number of peers and in particular same-sex friends, showed the greatest shift at 9 years. The expectation that the major transition would occur when children between 3 and 6 years moved from home to school was only partially supported. (RH)",

Examined were students' daily experiences, wishes, aspirations, likes, and dislikes. Data were obtained through interviews with 396 Chinese and 720 American students from the 1st, 3rd, and 5th grades. Students attended 11 schools in Beijing and 20 schools in the Chicago metropolitan area. On the average, children of all grades in both cities said they liked school, math, and reading, and had high self-evaluations. Chinese children in all grades liked school in general more than their American counterparts did. American children were more positive than Chinese children about all abilities except for getting along with others. Chinese children reported being  engaged in academic activities, clubs, art lessons, and chores after school more often than American children. A total of 81% to 90% of Chinese children thought about things related to schoolwork on their way to school; in comparison, 46% to 73% of American children did so. When asked about their wishes, more Chinese children mentioned education-related wishes than did American children. References, tables, and graphs are included. (RJC)",

        "description":"Examined were relations between concentrations and variability of hormones (testosterone, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, and leutenizing hormone) and mood intensity, mood variability (within and across days), energy, and restlessness in early adolescent girls. The study also considered the issue of whether hormones have effects on mood outcomes independent of the effects of perceived pubertal status. Hormone and mood measures were obtained 3 days a week for 4 weeks from 25 girls 9 and 10 years of age. Self-reported pubertal status was also measured. Findings indicated that follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were positively associated with mood variability during the month, even when controlling for perceived pubertal status. FSH concentration also showed  positive relationships to variability of energy and restlessness during the month. Lower estradiol concentrations and higher variability of estradiol and FSH predicted more &quot;within day moodiness.&quot; Although FSH was positively related to intensity of moods, these associations disappeared when controlling for perceived pubertal status. Possible explanations for the relationships are discussed, as are models for understanding the associations among perceived pubertal status, hormonal activity, and mood and behavior outcomes.

        "description":"In an effort to implement a program of reciprocal teaching dialogues, 6 first-grade teachers orally presented third-grade biology lessons to a group of 6 students, most of whom were identified as at risk for academic difficulty. Teachers aimed to teach students ways to approach learning from text and increase students' understanding of biological principles embodied in several themes. Results from classification and comprehension tasks showed that in comparison with controls, children in the reciprocal teaching discussion groups improved their ability to understand text and identify the gist of passages read. They also improved their ability to recognize and apply analogical information in the texts. It was found that reciprocal teaching strategies provided a means for the  children to try out their ideas. The strategies also represented language in the form of tools to be used in a public manner to solve the problems of understanding texts and their themes. Successful teachers used, with varying effectiveness, a broad array of conversational devices and opportunities to support children's discussions. The formation of a community of learners in the classrooms was promoted by two situations: (1) students worked with texts that constituted a usable and coherent body of knowledge; and (2) the texts represented a common knowledge base.

        "description":"Initial difficulties in the process of teaching 6 first-grade teachers to use reciprocal teaching in their classes, and the disappointing outcomes of the instruction, led researchers to several conclusions. Researchers realized that the beliefs teachers held about the nature of knowledge and the process of knowledge acquisition had a powerful role in determining the design and outcome of collaborative learning arrangements in class. It is argued that unless researchers attend to such beliefs and the educational practices that are shaped by them, they will be stymied in their attempts to implement findings regarding the benefits of collaborative learning in class. A second attempt to implement reciprocal teaching in the classes of a subset of the teachers resulted in outcomes that  were in line with the positive outcomes of a pilot study. In this attempt, researchers took care to collaborate with teachers. Discussion begins with an exploration of beliefs and practices espoused by advocates of collaborative learning, and their relation to the beliefs that drive normative practice in today's schools. Concluding discussion focuses on three issues: (1) selecting collaborative learning tasks; (2) structuring collaborative interactions among students; and (3) grouping students in collaborative learning arrangements.

It was considered important to explore factors related to identifying students who were most in need of the program. During the first semester of the project, teacher recommendations, attendance, age, and a variety of perceived competence measures were used as predictors of failing grades, grade point average, and frequency and severity of discipline referrals. The study took place in a small-city school district in North Carolina which had a dropout rate above the state average. Contrary to national trends, the typical dropout in the district was a white male. Subjects were all 334 sixth-grade students. Findings confirmed that it was  possible to predict with a fair amount of accuracy which children were at risk of receiving failing grades and what their grade point average might be. The number of failing grades appeared to be a theoretically strong outcome indicator. It is concluded that teachers can identify early in the semester students who are at risk of failing, and they can do so with measures that are easily accessible and fairly accurate. (RH)",

Results supported none of several stereotypes of mobile children, including those that suggest problems with making friends and behavior, social maladjustment, low self-confidence, and extensive disruption of lives. Findings suggested that although there were significant changes in the children's activities, the best predictors of activities after the move were the levels of time  spent in activities before the move. Mother's adjustment was a significant predictor of a child's attitude toward having moved and the new neighborhood. Number of moves was found to be a significant and positive predictor of children's attitudes toward moving before the move occurred. Age of children had no impact on adjustment.

Their performance did not improve in the second session. Results of the second study, which concerned 14 preschool, 14 kindergarten, and 14 second-grade students, provided support for a hypothesized developmental sequence in the acquisition of message evaluation skills. Children's performance suggested that at first they evaluated all messages as  informative, even those that did not describe the target referent, because they did not distinguish the information in the message from their own knowledge or beliefs about what the speaker intended. Subsequently, children began to understand that the message was a source of knowledge and evaluated its quality apart from what they knew or believed to be true. Over 30 references are cited. (RH)",

In both groups, students' knowledge of child development, and beliefs about appropriate child rearing practices and the extent to which parents influence the development of their children, were assessed at the beginning of the semester and when coursework was completed. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences that favored students in the parenting course. These students were more knowledgeable about child development than were control students. Students in the program were less likely to believe that infants  are spoiled by responsive and affectionate care, and more likely to emphasize the importance of talking and reading to children. Students in the program were also more likely to believe that infants should be given considerable leeway in exploring the home environment, and less likely to be authoritarian in their views on discipline. Finally, students in the parenting classes were more likely to believe that parents exert considerable influence on the developing child.

        "description":"The thesis of this paper is that systematic research approaches must be developed if the study of play is to avoid a short-lived &quot;in&quot; period before another 30-year hiatus, such as the one that occurred between 1940 and 1970. This paper reviews the present status of research on play, drawing examples from studies of the past 10 years that have addressed motive and content questions through the use of a number of theoretical paradigms. The major methods used in this research--naturalistic observation, experimental manipulation, and self-report or performance measures--are reviewed, as are related studies that used similar methodologies that have promoted strong inference. The present state of the art is described, future directions for play research are suggested, and questions for  future research agendas are offered. The development of a research replication and collaboration network that could bring together university researchers of varying levels of experience, graduate students, and early childhood practitioners, is proposed, and the rationale for this approach is explained. Over 50 references are cited. Tables list characteristics of various research methods and questions for further study. (RH)",

        "description":"A 1985 mail survey of 97 rural schools and 53 coastal (urban/suburban) schools in Queensland, Australia, investigated teacher characteristics, problems, and needs. Respondents included 504 rural teachers, 215 rural parents, 405 coastal teachers, and 179 coastal parents. The results confirm many previous findings about teaching in rural Australia. Compared to coastal teachers, rural teachers were younger, less experienced, more mobile, and less satisfied with their teaching appointments. Greater proportions of rural teachers taught in multigrade classrooms and perceived their students to be poorly motivated and low achievers. The difficulties of teaching and living in rural areas included inadequate knowledge of the local situation, inadequate resources, professional isolation,  social and cultural isolation, being more in the public eye, and being expected to participate in community activities. Almost all respondents saw a need for special in-service and induction programs for rural teachers; about 25% of rural teachers felt that such programs currently available were not in touch with reality. This report contains 41 references and 80 data tables. Appendices include the questionnaires used, lists of participating schools, and 40 additional tables that break down rural teachers' responses by gender, marital status, primary versus secondary level, government versus private school, years in present school, and school size.

A profile of the region and overview of the effectiveness of implemented programs are presented. Interviews with Area Development District Directors show a concern for the image of Appalachia. The data indicate that Kentucky has a division in its economic structure, where prosperity and high employment are primarily concentrated in certain metropolitan centers such as the Louisville-Covington-Newport area in the north-central part of the state. The western counties also have problems, but none as serious as those in the eastern Appalachian counties, which are in critical economic condition. The report raises the question, &quot;Is  there a more equitable way to distribute Kentucky's tremendous wealth?&quot; This report and accompanying data may be useful to educational planners and policymakers in assessing training needs and economic trends that affect education. Suggestions for additional research to address the issue are listed.

        "description":"Information is the framework connecting technology, leadership, and the common work of education, namely, responsive situational decision making. Decisions are based upon some form of information perceived, taken in, and acted upon. The ways that administrators and teachers process information is the variable associated with effective educational leadership. Schools are effective to the extent that they provide access to information at the time and place it is needed. Psychologist Edwin Deming's premise that the quality of a product is directly influenced by the frequency of informed interaction between a caring worker and that product can be applied to education. Feedback about the effects of previous decisions is probably the most valuable information in educational  decision-making. Isolated practitioners (one teacher in a classroom, one principal in a building, one superintendent in a district) have restricted access to such data for self-correction. Ways to help generate and gain access to these types of information are being explored to help individual decisionmakers generate learnings from their own experiences, to orient and align their decisions to those of others in the organization, to break down the invisible limits on what is perceived as acceptable and possible, and to facilitate self-correction. Technology can provide ways to make needed information more comprehensive and accessible. Practical non-futuristic methods are available to provide this access through telecommunications and computer technologies. (ALL)",

        "description":"The Nebraska educational system is experiencing internal turmoil even though its students are highly ranked nationally on standardized tests and show a higher ratio of graduating high school than those in most other states. This report was commissioned by Nebraska education officials who were concerned that their state was not taking a large enough role in new, innovative methods of rural education. In the form of a discussion of the &quot;Rural Education Debate&quot; in Nebraska, the paper suggests that school consolidation is an uncreative and inefficient ways of solving service delivery problems. It also questions once-popular views linking teacher performance and overall school quality to school size, number of courses, and amount of materials. This document argues that the limited but  focused curriculum in rural schools should be able to compete successfully with larger systems. For example, Nebraska's rural districts have relatively fewer dropouts compared to non-rural districts, and their rural schools also match larger ones in standardized test performance. This document discusses the relationship between school size and efficiency, concluding that comparisons of per-pupil expenditures inherently discriminate against all rural school systems, which are small by necessity but are not therefore inefficient. Socioeconomic influences at work in Nebraska result in a widening of the rural-urban political rift. This report recommends a thorough overhaul of the school financing system and calls for creation of appropriate educational standards, not standardization. It  closes with a discussion of rural and urban differences and the implications for their respective educational systems. (TES)",

Extensive work on reauthorization legislation, planning for a national forum on youth-at-risk issues, and preparation of migrant education research were IMEC's major achievements during the period. IMEC's members, representing 16 states with 85% of the nation's rural migrant youth, were engaged in activities aimed at increasing the awareness of migrant students' needs among legislators, educators, and business leaders. Dialogue continued among specialists who, without IMEC, would not have had the vehicle to exchange ideas. IMEC's overall goals are aimed at increasing public awareness of the needs of migrant students, facilitating  interstate cooperation among migrant education programs, and developing unique means to minimize difficulties faced by migrant students. Major IMEC achievements include: cooperation on recommendations for reauthorization of the Education Consolidation Improvement Act Chapter 1; planning and preparation for the National Forum for Youth At Risk in Washington, D.C.; publication of &quot;Migrant Education: A Consolidated View,&quot; a comprehensive research effort; coordination of efforts with major education organizations; maintenance of linkages with federal programs and agencies; coordination with other migrant programs; participation in state-based workshops, conferences, and so forth; and publication of articles on migrant education. Plans for 1988 include focus on migrant demographics, the  effects of the changing economics of agriculture on migrant education, and problems migrant students face in making the transition from secondary to postsecondary education.

Anecdotes and statistics are employed to define rural problems and to urge educators to participate in government policy development. Next, June Gabler, representative from the American Association of School Administrators discusses public relations and offers management tips for rural school administrators. Following this, Jon Wefald, President of Kansas State University, discusses the historical contributions of rural America, emphasizing values of equality, private enterprise, decentralization, agriculture,  and the potential for economic and educational development in Kansas. Next, Tom Hansen, of the Boeing Military Airplane Company, discusses socioeconomic trends in Kansas and the nation. He emphasizes the importance of linkages between educators and business, suggesting that they have many areas of mutual interest. The last paper, by Roy Forbes, director of the Rural Education Institute in North Carolina, discusses the ways technology has changed rural communities and the world marketplace and stresses the importance of combining existing rural strengths with new technology to foster a developmental &quot;restructuring&quot; of rural areas. Topics of the abstracts, which are arranged alphabetically by title, include: school athletics, drugs and alcohol, assessing educational quality, career ladders,  school administration issues, recruiting teachers, rural teacher education programs, an assessment of North Dakota's public attitudes toward education, sex education, rural enrollment trends, partnerships in education, and the need for educational equality between the sexes.

        "description":"The idea that education is connected to economic development and that the economy can be strengthened by strengthening education has become a cornerstone of the 1980s educational reform movement. The basic idea linking education and the economy is not new. Americans have invested in education with the expectation that it would yield substantial financial returns, for a well-prepared workforce is more productive and innovative than an undereducated workforce. The current educational emphasis of raising academic standards to produce better graduates equipped to make more productive contributions to the economy will be useful to students able to cope successfully with expanded demands; however there is a downside. Raising standards without improving the attractiveness or holding  power of schools is likely to increase the dropout rate. A policy designed to promote economic growth may exacerbate current economic problems in specific places like Appalachia. Having to complete a greater number of harder courses will produce more dropouts, making economic matters worse. In Appalachia, the existing connection between education and development seems negative. Taught to be passive and deferential, Appalachian youth have been treated as not especially bright, and they have been trained not to expect bright futures. Another negative connection between education and economic development in Appalachia is the inadequate financial support for schools through low property taxes. Schools are an undervalued resource for Appalachian development, but in fact they have great  potential for community revitalization. Programs which make a positive, appropriate linkage between rural education and rural development are needed. (ALL)",

The results of this modeling effort were released for review and discussion. The model estimated the poverty rate from surrogate social indicators that are expected to systematically vary with poverty. The model was first calibrated on 1969 data for all counties of the state, then used to estimate the 1979 poverty rate for all counties based on the 1969 model coefficients. Results were compared with the poverty rates estimated  from the 1980 census. Then the model was recalibrated using the 1979 data, and the 1979 coefficients were used to estimate the poverty rates for subsequent years. When tested against the 1980 census of the 1979 poverty rate, the model's average absolute percentage point error for 1979 was 2.4 points. The maximum error was 12.5 points and 13 of the state's 120 counties had errors exceeding 5 percentage points. Over half the counties were within 2 percentage points of the 1980 census estimate. The estimates indicated that poverty had increased in Kentucky since 1979. The estimated 1986 rate was 18.2 percent, slightly above the 1979 rate of 17.6 percent. The number of people estimated to be in poverty in 1986 was 678,000. Eastern Kentucky continued to have the highest number of counties with  high poverty rates. This document details the model's calibration and contains three maps and six tables. (TES)",

        "description":"The Education Commission of the States' (ECS) survey of state initiatives for at-risk youth was conducted during 1987. The goal was to identify programs and planning efforts in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 3 ECS member territories addressing needs of at-risk youth from preschool through high school. Descriptions of over 650 programs, task forces, and other state initiatives for at-risk youth were collected. The survey identified 190 programs directly related to dropout prevention in 46 states. Most of these programs have been implemented since 1983; others were finalized and implemented in 1986. States are responding to the school dropout problem by either adding programs tailored to specific problems, needs, and community resources; or systematically changing  the way services are provided. The strategies states choose to respond to the problem reflect two points of view: either the child is viewed as deficient or the system is viewed as deficient. The first point of view results in a safety net design while the second results in attempts to build flexible broad-based programs. Ten strategies appear frequently: (1) definition and identification; (2) networks; (3) academic support; (4) special curricula; (5) incentives and rewards; (6) counseling; (7) school policy changes; (8) alternative schools; (9) restructuring; and (10) comprehensive state plans. Typically a state employs 5 of these 10 strategies. Outlines of each strategy and the states that use it are included, as are issues and questions emerging from the survey. (ALL)",

IMEC's members, representing 17 states with 85 percent of the nation's rural migrant youth, were engaged in a variety of activities aimed at increasing the awareness of migrant students' needs among legislators, educators, and business leaders. The overall goals set by IMEC are aimed at increasing awareness of the needs of migrant students among all sectors of society, facilitating interstate cooperation among migrant education programs, and developing unique means to minimize the difficulties faced  by the migrant student population. A host of activities over the past project year resulted in major achievements by IMEC, including: planning and implementation of the National Forum for Youth At Risk; collaboration with the National Association of State Directors of Migrant Education on recommendations for Chapter I reauthorization; distribution of &quot;Migrant Education: A Consolidated View,&quot; the most comprehensive research effort yet undertaken by the IMEC; coordination of efforts with major education organizations; maintenance of linkages with federal programs and agencies; coordination with other migrant programs; participation in state-based workshops, conferences, and meetings; and publication of articles on migrant education. Two states, Kansas and New Mexico, were added to the  membership in 1987-88. Priorities during 1989 will include early childhood services, the transition from secondary to post-secondary education, and migrant education funding. (TES)",

        "description":"This report is a summary of deliberations and strategy development at a forum focussed on the problems of youth at risk of not making a successful transition from school to adulthood. Twenty work groups came up with three priorities in dealing with the problems of at-risk youth: (1) address a child's education, social, health, and other needs together, rather than individually; (2) administrators, parents, teachers, and students must begin to solve problems cooperatively during the child's early years; and (3) curriculum and instructional approaches must be directed at helping all children succeed, including students who have different backgrounds and strengths. Suggested approaches to these problems varied, but adequate funding was seen as one requirement for any successful  recommendation. Excerpts from 21 major speeches are included. Speakers included leaders in government, business, education, and labor. Several students who had been at risk of dropping out of school offered insight into the positive and negative elements of their educational systems. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, and a North Carolina schools superintendent described educational problems and programs in their states. Author Jonathan Kozol and Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman linked U.S. education problems to poverty issues. Several federal officials discussed the changing demands for U.S. educational systems. National Education Association President Mary Hartwood Futrell discussed possible roles of administrators and business  leaders in the dropout problem. Corporate officials offered ideas regarding the roles of technology and innovative programs in education. This document details five areas for helping at-risk students: early intervention, parental involvement, one-on-one mentoring, school restructuring, and interagency collaboration. (TES)",

NACIE, which reports to the Department of Education, is the sole Indian organization designated as an executive agency of the federal government. Reauthorization of Public Law 92-318 (Indian Education Act of 1972) was one of two major legislative issues for NACIE in fiscal year 1987 and is among the recommendations to Congress in this report. The other issue was a Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposal to transfer certain BIA schools to tribal, state, or local control. In 1987, NACIE submitted a list of nominees for the open position of director of Indian Education Programs  (IEP). NACIE makes recommendations to Congress concerning funding, administration, and operation of the IEP office. It also advises the Secretary of Education on administration of Indian programs, evaluates projects and assistance applications, and assists the Secretary of Education in developing criteria for evaluating and administering grants. Beside listing NACIE functions and fiscal year 1987 activities, the report also explains components of the Indian Education Act (Title IV), offers abstracts of ten exceptional Title IV school programs, and profiles seven fellowship recipients. The exemplary projects, all in elementary-secondary Indian education, show high degrees of parental participation, support by the school superintendent, and creative management of available resources.  Appendices include the NACIE charter, the distribution of Title IV funds on a state-by-state basis, and responses to this report's recommendations by the U.S. Department of Education. (TES)",

        "description":"The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 (also know as Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) recognized that the educational needs of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students could not be met by traditional, English-only instruction. This legislation provided funding to state education agencies and local school districts to encourage development and implementation of bilingual education programs and has undergone revision in 1974, 1978, 1984, and is part of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments of 1988 (PL 100-297). The purpose of this paper is to increase school social workers' knowledge about bilingual education and to generate ideas about how they can promote bilingual education for LEP students. Growing evidence in longitudinal studies supports the claim that  early positive school learning experiences result in lower retention and dropout rates. Making use of the LEP students' home languages in initial contacts with school will increase their chances of having positive learning experiences. Success in school will enable LEP students to break the cycle of poverty and ease their entry into mainstream America. The paper presents: (1) an overview of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments; (2) a case for bilingual education for Hispanic LEP children; (3) pro and con positions on bilingual education; (4) a synthesis of recent research findings; and (5) the role of school social workers in bilingual education.

The book was originally adapted from his dissertation and influenced by Polya and Popper. His discussion of the Euler conjecture is summarized. Three purposes for choosing the dialogue form for the book were that it helped to achieve the polemical intent, that it accurately reflected the role of criticism in the growth of knowledge, and that it modeled how mathematics education might be conducted. One disadvantage of the writing style is that the book evokes an emotional reaction from readers, such as delight or disgust. Another disadvantage is that the dialogue itself often veils Lakatos's own position. (YP)",

        "description":"This resource manual was designed to enable teachers to help students: (1) solve problems and to grow in their capability to deal with new or different situations; (2) use mathematics as a tool in the pursuit of personal goals and aspirations; and (3) develop a positive self-concept and a positive attitude toward mathematics and lifelong learning. The content of this manual is divided into six strands: problem solving, number systems and operations, ratio and proportion, measurement and geometry, data management, and algebra. The skills and concepts within these strands are sequenced over three grades taking into account the developmental nature of mathematics and of the learner. Five contexts are used in this program: (1) critical and creative thinking; (2) language of  mathematics; (3) computational facility and estimation; (4) technological process; and (5) relevancy and application. In each objective, clarification or example, effective suggestions and integration of problem solving and technology are described. Evaluation strategy, time allocation in each grade, usage of manipulatives, and grade 9 curriculum specifications are appended. (YP)",

        "description":"The Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS) was administered to 667 students in grades 9-12 who were registering to participate in a regional science Olympiad on a southern university campus in February 1988. Each student's score on the test was correlated with subsequent performance in one or more of the 11 Olympiad events. Of the 667 students who participated in the Olympiad, 404 had usable scores on the TIPS. Five of the 22 events produced Spearman rank-order correlations with TIPS scores which were significant. These events were Bio-Process Lab, Designer Genes; Measurement Lab, Periodic Table Quiz, and Science Bowl. An additional three events (A is for Anatomy, Topographic Map Reading, and The Pentathlon) produced significant correlations. Descriptions of scoring criteria  for events which produced significant correlations provide limited support for the predictive validity of the TIPS in forecasting student performance in skills based science competitions such as the Olympiad. Results indicate that type of school, number of previous Olympiads attended, and number of science courses completed produce significant correlations with rankings in some Olympiad events. No significant correlations were found between age, race, grade level, and student enrollment in school with rankings in any Olympiad events. (Author/MVL)",

This is particularly a problem in open distance education where laboratory practicals, due to philosophical and logistical reasons, must be kept to a minimum and where their implementation must be both effective and efficient. Many feel that laboratory experiments do not usually justify their costs because they are all too often used to achieve the wrong goals. They often focus on the illustration or affirmation of the substantive structure of science, whereas their strength lies in the teaching of the syntactical  structure of that same domain. Three common but faulty motives for laboratory experiments were rejected and three new, more valid ones were presented in their place. Finally, three types of laboratory experiments were introduced and paired, on didactic grounds, to the three valid motives. (Author/MVL)",

Skills associated with planning, conducting, and interpreting results from investigations were delineated, and six objectives encompassing these skills were identified. There were 21 items judged to be the best measures of these objectives chosen for inclusion in the test. The POPS test was constructed in order to assess the process skills dealing with identifying experimental  questions, identifying variables, formulating hypotheses, designing investigations, graphing data, and interpreting data. The readability of the test was assessed and an average grade level index of 6.8 was obtained. The POPS test is a reliable instrument for diagnostic and/or summative assessment in science classes or research studies. The test may be a useful means for classroom-based research, evaluation of instruction and learning, and curriculum validation in evaluation as well as assessing process skills competence of middle school students.

A total of 17 preservice teachers were used as subjects. The subjects were required to present four lessons based on lecture/recitation, general inductive model, general deductive model, and a laboratory activity. After each presentation, each student received three types of feedback: informal verbal from peers; formal written from course instructor; and videotape. Students' self critiques and  questionnaires were collected as data. The qualitative analysis of data yielded a total of 12 categories of concerns for self and students. The subjects viewed planning as a two component process: the physical act of writing a lesson plan, and the subsequent mental rehearsal of that plan. The study found a transition state of focus among the subjects from \"concerns for self\" to \"concerns for students.\" Several implications for science teacher education were discussed. (YP)",

In an effort to contribute to the knowledge base for elementary science teacher effectiveness, this study was undertaken to build upon the procedures and findings of previous intensive instruction research by providing a framework for the investigation of the effects of intensive instruction upon the thought processes of preservice elementary science education teachers engaged in inquiry skill tasks. Fourteen preservice teachers enrolled in education courses of a major mid-western university were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Treatment subjects received intensive instruction in cue attendance. All subjects were assessed for their ability to observe  details, ask questions and to generate hypotheses on inquiry skill tasks. Intensively instructed subjects performed better in inquiry skill tasks than those subjects receiving no intensive instruction. Intensive instruction appears to have enhanced the treatment subjects' ability to consider and report a greater number of alternative relevant cues while engaged in the observation of details. (YP)",

A series of statement pairs (positive and negative exemplars) were designed to elicit teachers' responses to the issues of technology and quality of life, technology and employment,  technology and health care, technology and food production, and technology and social well-being. The responses indicated that the teachers in this sample described and critiqued technology from an artifact perspective, that they were evenly split on whether technology improved employment prospects, that medicine was the example most often cited as an example of beneficial technology, and that a technocracy was favored by half the respondents. These results were indistinguishable from the responses of graduating high school seniors. A copy of the survey is included. (MVL)",

Data were collected in the form of teacher anecdotes, audio and videotapes of lessons and student interviews, teacher developed instructional materials and student products, and were subsequently discussed and conceptualized by the joint investigators. This rather unique collaborative research model effectively blurred the more typically distinct boundary between theory and practice seen in many other research methodologies. The blurrier the distinction between theory and practice, stereotypically assigned to researchers and practitioners respectively,  the greater is the relevance one has to the other. Collaborative research involving school teachers and university personnel has great potential for mutual benefit as reported from the work of this project. (MVL)",

It was hypothesized that for some unsuccessful problem solvers, their problem representation could be improved by structuring the process of problem solving to prevent premature implementation of procedures before the problem had been understood. A second aim of the study was to elucidate the performance of unsuccessful problem solvers attempting novel problems in a computer-based environment that imposed a structure on problem solving and provided feedback during the process of problem solving. It was hypothesized that obligate translation of  given data should facilitate the disembedding and elaboration of relevant information from a problem statement, and so enhance a student's problem representation. Difficulties in getting started on a problem were identified as due in part to inappropriate or missing declarative knowledge, and to a failure to access and use this knowledge. The study showed that a computer-based setting can provide information about the declarative knowledge base of unsuccessful problem solvers. (MVL)",

        "description":"Locus of control, a generalized belief about causality in one's personal life, was identified as a potential variable impinging upon the acquisition of science-related attitudes in classes of high school students from 10th grade biology, and 11th and 12th grade chemistry, and of college elementary education majors. Correlations of the Internal-External Scale with the seven subscales of the Test of Science-Related Attitudes revealed that subjects with an external locus of control did not have as positive attitudes towards science as internal students and that the relationship between locus of control and science attitudes strengthened with age.

        "description":"This study was designed to investigate the influence of a diversified instructional strategy to overcome misconceptions held by freshmen undergraduate students with respect to the nature of a scientific theory. The theory of evolution was selected because it is the most significant unifying theme within the discipline of biology. Two classes were pretested for background knowledge of evolutionary biology concepts, attitude regarding evolution, and an understanding of the nature of science. Intact groups received instruction from independent biology faculty members, both of whom agreed to make use of the same course outline and sequential introduction of topics. After having been exposed to an introductory lecture on the unit of evolution, the investigator provided the  experimental group with an opportunity to discuss their positions regarding the theory of evolution. Discussion groups were asked to resolve potential conflicts arising among themselves and present a consensus opinion. The investigator further provided an interactive lecture/discussion to resolve misconceptions arising as a result of the small group discussions. Both groups were posttested using the same measures administered on the pretest. The analysis of between group posttest scores revealed no significant differences for evolutionary concepts; however, with respect to an understanding of the nature of science/attitude toward evolution, a significant difference was found for the experimental group.

These subjects were chosen because they had received no formal instruction in projectile motion, yet through typical life experience, had encountered the phenomena associated with the concept and therefore could assume to be novices. Flight protocol is composed of a problem sequence presented as a structured protocol during which the subjects individually participate in a clinical interview lasting about one hour. Questions are asked which involve the subjects in making predictions. The predictions are represented as graphs. Their prediction is then compared with the  computer representation of the same problem on the monitor. Flight protocol is divided into four phases: intuitive or background knowledge; pattern matching; transformation; and post experimental. The results suggested that there was no significant difference in the performance of ninth grade female and male groups on the flight protocol. Findings suggest teachers should focus on the critical features of graphs rather than surface features, and encourage all students to similar levels of competency. (MVL)",

The problem was investigated for one semester with experimental subjects in their junior year, enrolled in elementary science methods classes. Non-equivalent control subjects were an intact class of seniors who had previously taken the same class, but with different emphases. Phase one consisted of pretesting 81 experimental subjects and testing the non-equivalent control subjects. A group test was used to assess the initial level of logical reasoning development. Phase two consisted of coursework whereby the experimental subjects  systematically performed tasks designed to teach them skills in basic and integrated science processes. In the final phase, the test was administered again to the experimental subjects. Also, a group test of science processes was given to the experimental subjects to assess their mastery of the science processes. The findings provided evidence that preservice elementary teachers did grow in their development of logical reasoning when exposed to a one-semester course in elementary school science methods which emphasized mastery of science processes.

        "description":"Previous research has shown a relationship between formal reasoning ability and science process skill attainment. It has been hypothesized that an increased emphasis on teaching process skills might enhance the formal thinking abilities of students. A variety of strategies have been proposed to better accomplish this task, most notable, the learning cycle approach. There has been little research in science education on the use of modeling strategies for promoting process development and/or logical thinking. This paper deals with the overall relationship of Piagetian theory to science process development and with strategies for promoting more effective learning, teaching, and assessment of science process skills and/or logical thinking. The purpose of this study was to determine  which of two teaching strategies would promote higher achievement of integrated process skills with urban middle school students. Furthermore, growth in the logical thinking of students was also measured. The two teaching strategies tried were a systematic modeling approach and the learning cycle approach. Students of both the modeling teachers and the learning cycle teachers outperformed those of a nonequivalent control group on integrated process skills. Modeling was found to be significantly superior to the learning cycle for promoting this achievement. (MVL)",

        "description":"Most secondary science courses in North America are designed to use textbooks as the primary or exclusive source of information about the content or processes of science, and most science teachers focus their instruction on a single text. Although there are many serious issues raised by the overwhelming reliance on text-based teaching/learning in science, the text-based approach is likely to remain a dominant instructional method in most secondary science classes. Furthermore, while a large variety of approaches are possible for teaching with science texts, until very recently, little has generally been done to prepare science teachers regarding effective uses of textbooks and for teaching content reading skills in the science classroom. This study attempted to: (1) describe a  desired image for science reading instruction and effective use of science textbooks based on current reading research results; (2) describe the current profile of science reading instruction and use of science textbooks in secondary classrooms; and (3) propose the first steps for planned changes in secondary science reading instruction and uses of science textbooks.

        "description":"Contemporary researchers often refer to the information processing paradigm to exlain the relative ineffectiveness of contemporary instructional techniques for modifying incorrect scientific concepts that students often bring to a learning situation. As a result of this research, instructional procedures have been developed that maximize the chances that conceptual change will occur. It is within the context of this conceptual change framework that this study takes place. Commonly accepted conceptual change strategies identify specific basic conditions that need to be met before students' existing mental constructs are changed. The document contends that the attention to imagery inducing procedures would make these strategies significantly more effective. The major hypothesis of  this study is that, particularly for abstract concepts, the imposition of a mental image by the presentation of a dynamic model would result in higher achievement than the presentation of a verbal or static model representing the concept. The laser videodisc was used to generate the appropriate images in this study. The technology affords the ease of presentation that makes the results of this study potentially more generalizable.

The program's purpose is to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to understand that there are choices are  available for achieving world peace. This paper describes the study's methods, procedures, and results. The findings indicated that use of &quot;Choices&quot; tended to reduce teachers and students' fears and sense of futurelessness and powerlessness and increase their optimism about the possibility of preventing nuclear war. Both students and teachers moved toward the political left in that they showed an increased understanding of other countries' viewpoints and favored a policy of freezing, reducing, or eliminating nuclear weapons.

        "description":"Arguing that the benefits from borrowing abroad exceed the costs recently imposed on countries through debt-servicing difficulties, this paper defines debt as an engine of growth, forcing the borrower to produce goods efficiently, export them, and function competitively in the international market. Debt-servicing difficulties of developing nations have a complex history and the assessment of the 1986 conditions seems no less complicated. Countries continue to gain access to foreign resources even as recent growth trends and long term borrowing plans cause problems. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's contribution to the lending and debt management processes continues as does the discussion of direct U.S. investment in developing countries. Developing nations must reduce the  growth of debt relative to the rise in exports and economic creditor confidence is crucial in managing the external debt over the long term. External debt and foreign borrowing cannot be regarded as foes of the development process if foreign resources are considered as important contributions to the growth of developing nations. Instead, mismanagement of external borrowing and debt is the problem, stemming primarily from poor overall management of the economy. The future will likely present a continued shortage of external assistance measured against the investment needs of development. Successful policy making for development will include the effective management of foreign borrowing and external debt. (GEA)",

Seventeen group exercises are presented in the form of research questions dealing with diverse subjects. Students working in groups of four or less rely upon information from the audio-visual programs as well as their regular textbooks and other materials about India provided by the teacher. Emphasizing cooperative study and learning, most exercises require written documentation of group work and, if desired, group presentations or debates. Topics addressed include Indian geography, culture, art, village life, and population growth. Several exercises require students to compare life in India with that in the United States. One uses local and foreign newspapers to teach about Indian culture. Other questions deal with the caste system and the policies of  Gandhi. (GEA)",

While the economic planning of the national government in Beijing (China) dictates what will be emphasized, the school curriculum includes instruction in ideology, Chinese language, calligraphy, fine arts, mathematics, science, and physical education. The lower middle school students are divided into five educational tracks that include academic or pre-college, vocational, technical or factory production, minority education, or computer technology. The teachers for these schools hold a two-year certification received after middle school. A typical classroom contains 55 to 60 students, and school is in session 6 days a week for 11  months a year. Only 30 percent of the students enter higher middle schools for ages 16-18, and only 3 percent attend a college or a university. A national achievement test determines a student's major field of study, profession, or occupation and which institution will be attended. The instructors who teach six hours a week with an additional three hours for political studies, generally have only bachelor's degrees. Funding for education is received from the national and local ministries of education, and in the case of Liaoning Province, where Shenyang, the fourth largest city in China is located, funding also comes from the ministries of agriculture, construction, and health.

        "description":"Two hundred sixty-six college students from four Indiana colleges and universities completed a series of surveys to determine gender differences in attitudes toward rape victims. The instruments adapted and used included the Rubin and Peplau Just World Scale (JWS), the Burt Sex Role Stereotype Scale, the Attitudes Toward Rape Victims Scale (ATRVS) developed by Chinese college students in Taiwan, and an attrition scale. A literature review examines attitudes toward rape victims and rapists. Each survey instrument is then described, and the results are given by individual scale. A close look at the itemized JWS reveals that only three items showed significant gender differences and, overall, males believed in a &quot;just&quot; world. Significant gender differences appear on the SRSS with  males more accepting of sex role stereotyping. The ATRVS indicated that females are more accepting of rape victims. Almost one-half (49.6%) of the students responding on the attrition scale believe that rape victims were &quot;too trusting in people&quot; as a major cause of rape, while one-fourth believe that behavior was another major cause. The instruments are also reviewed for correlations. Six tables and a 49-item bibliography are included. (DJC)",

One reason might be that women may not receive the same response from the media as do their male counterparts. The research study explored this possibility by investigating: (1) differences in the methods used by the mass media to portray male and female U.S. Senate candidates; (2) whether these differences influence peoples' evaluations of candidates; and (3) whether a candidate's gender influences peoples' evaluations of them. Content analysis of 26 senate races, the development of four prototype newspaper articles representing coverage patterns for male and female incumbents and male and female challengers, and a questionnaire were used to determine perceptions of candidates'  competence and traits. Findings indicate that people's evaluations of candidates appear to be affected by the sex stereotypes they have about male and female candidates and by the type of coverage candidates receive. Media coverage effects are especially strong for incumbents. Five tables, 26 references, the newspaper articles, and the questionnaire are included. (JHP)",

It is suggested that elementary students perform poorly on economics achievement tests due to inadequate economics knowledge possessed by their teachers. This study is designed to assess  preservice elementary education teachers' knowledge of economics. Form A of the \"Test of Economic Literacy\" was administered to 113 students enrolled in social studies methods courses at a southern university. This 46-item test was subdivided into the following seven content areas: the basic economic problem, economic systems, microeconomics, macroeconomics, the world economy, economic institutions, and concepts for evaluating economic actions and policies. Student performance was evaluated and presented in nine tables detailing the percentage of correct responses by content area. Using 70 percent as the cutoff for a passing grade, only three students passed the test. The relationship between teacher knowledge and student achievement is discussed, and additional economics training for  teachers is recommended. A 17-item bibliography is included. (GEA)",

There have been two periods of major population expansion since 1750 with the first lasting almost 200 years and the second surge occurring after World War II. Growth rates in industrialized countries are now very low with fertility below replacement levels. High growth rates persist in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Latin America and South Asia, but indications exist that these regions will soon follow the world trend toward lower growth rates. The fact that the projected increase in the world population growth will come in less developed countries (LDC) raises the possibility that population growth will restrict efforts to raise living conditions among the LDCs' poorer  populations. Organized efforts to increase access to family planning information and supplies are associated with significant increases in contraceptive prevalence and declining fertility in LDCs. Since organized interventions to increase family planning awareness involve basic and often conflicting human values, population policy remains a controversial area. Graphs, charts, black and white photographs, and a 20-item selected bibliography are included. (DJC)",

Representations of subject matter (activities, examples, analogies, materials, etc.) used in teaching are the products of weaving understanding of the specific academic discipline together with knowledge of learners, learning, and the context. This paper describes the sources of representation and the knowledge on which teachers should draw in judging their appropriateness. Suggestions are made on what prospective teachers need to know about  learners and learning based on research on learning in specific disciplines. Methods teachers should clarify students' views of teaching and learning, increase students' understanding of seminal topics and ideas, get students thinking about the kinds of understanding their pupils are likely to bring with them, evaluate various representations with their students, and model good representations.

Although the primary focus of the project is the improvement of the university training of preservice teachers (PSTs) in mathematics, there are two important collaborative aspects to this project. The first is the development of a close working relationship with a school district to jointly sponsor and supervise early field experiences for all PSTs. The second is the establishment of support mechanisms to help practicing teachers in the school district in broadening their views of the nature of mathematics and in utilizing innovative teaching techniques for improving mathematical thinking skills and use of  problem-solving strategies. Thus, local teachers should eventually be able to serve as role models in the teaching of mathematics using a problem-solving approach. (Author/JD)",

Assuming that students are not standardized and teaching is not routine, teachers must be capable of making judgments using learning theory and pedagogy, child development and cognition, curriculum and assessment. Teachers must know their subject areas as well as the principles of teaching and must be practiced in the making of sound teaching decisons. The suggestion is made that the \"knowledge base\" needs to be reconceptualized, moving away from a sense that it is something to learn about, or simply content to be delivered or covered. There is also a need to focus on certain life-long learning skills that will make it likely that teachers will continue to learn after they  leave college. It is important as well that teacher education students have the best possible role models.

Sequential learning solves problems by arranging small amounts of information in consecutive and linear order. Simultaneous processors solve problems by integrating and synthesizing parallel pieces of information at the same time. This study investigated whether methods of instruction interact with students' processing strengths and weaknesses. The question specifically addressed was, does the learning of vocabulary words increase when a method of instruction (sequential or simultaneous) is matched to the student's more efficient processing modality (sequential or simultaneous)? The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC) was administered to 55 first and second grade students  to determine their processing styles. Each subject was tested on the vocabulary words from the primary reading curriculum, and those words that were correctly identified were eliminated from the word list. The children were instructed by the two different instructional methods for eight consecutive week days. The study demonstrates a methodology that tests the utility of the KABC for making educational decisions. While some success was obtained, practitioners are advised to consider alternative assessment procedures that have empirical support, such as interventions that integrate systematic formative evaluation with instruction.

A central philosophy and set of teacher competencies was developed out of the recommendations to guide subsequent changes. A new model master of arts in teaching program was developed, and the old preservice and inservice sequences were modified to reflect the common approach. An extensive assessment  procedure was installed to monitor the move towards more effective teacher preparation and provide direction for continued improvement.

The program (commonly known as PROBE) requires students to participate for one academic year of study in a full-time integrated program of study and school experience. When the students are not engaged in student teaching, the majority of their work is organized around study in a tutorial group. When the student teaching experience is completed, students engage in more intensive study and  reflection. This final report contains several facets: (1) major questions addressed in the assessment of the program; (2) a description of the program and its several components; (3) a sample upon which the assessment is based; (4) the methodology used in the assessment; (5) instrumentation used in the assessment; (6) results and findings; (7) discussion of the results; and (8) implications for improving teacher education. The appendices contain selected portions of an ethnographic assessment of the program, a practice profile, and a discussion of reflectivity in the progam. (JD)",

The more successful student teachers were elementary or secondary majors and male or female who were good learners (high earned GPAs) with low anxiety about teaching, who perceived themselves as having a rather high  degree of (internal) control over their world, and who were likely to display a (Meyers-Briggs' judging versus perceptive attitude) preference for a planned and orderly rather than a flexible and spontaneous life style.

Particular focus is on the effects of state policies and on the role of college and university leaders in bringing about change. The study describes and explains changes in the way prospective teachers are readied for teaching, but does not assess the value or consequences of those changes. Two types of questionnaires were sent to all 189 four-year public colleges and universities in the 15 states that comprise the membership of the SREB, and to 56 private colleges and universities in these states that graduate significant numbers of certified teachers. The first questionnaire dealt with information about changes in the  admission or retention standards, changes in curriculum, changes in philosophy or demographics, governance structures, and other information about the change process. A second questionnaire inquired into the role of the arts and sciences in the preparation of teachers. Key conditions contributing to effective change processes are analyzed and the role of educational institutions on changing teacher education and the formation of public policy is described. (JD)",

        "description":"The undergraduate education of teachers--improving their general education, the content of their majors, and the professional education course--must become a priority for more college, university, and state leaders. State-mandated standards have produced some significant changes, but these alone are not sufficient to stimulate all the needed improvements in what and how future teachers are taught. This study shows that little substantive curriculum change has occurred over the last five years, and that all too often college presidents and academic vice presidents have not been actively involved in supporting or promoting change. On those campuses where change is taking place, creative academic leaders are seizing upon state mandates and interest in teacher education as  opportunities for change. Arts and sciences and education faculty need to rethink curriulum, and state and campus policies should call for and provide incentives for faculty action. Policies for strengthening teacher education programs should be joint efforts of campus and state leaders because of effects beyond the campus, such as quality and supply of teachers and costs of programs.

The students were questioned about their career expectations, their perceptions of teaching as a career, and current incentives for entry into the teaching profession. Findings indicated that only a small percentage of the students were interested in becoming teachers. Most students reported being discouraged from teaching by their own teachers and by parents who are teachers. Even for those students who possess altruistic career orientations, teaching was an unattractive career choice given the occupation's poor working conditions. Most of the students were generally oblivious to recent reforms in the teaching profession and underestimated  teacher salaries. The first section of the report reviews relevant literature related to teaching as a career choice. Section two describes methods, including the overall approach, sampling and site selection, and data analysis. In section three, cross-site findings are delineated, including career expectations of the focus group, their views of teaching, and their views of particular incentives for entry into teaching.

Analysis is also provided of school board and system-wide provincial data. Data are presented based on analyses of returns from surveys, interviews, and other information gathering. Teacher supply and demand projections are investigated using both quantitative and qualitative data gathering techniques. Total population surveys have been conducted of Ontario school boards and teacher education institutions, as well as a micro-study of a single board's complete set of  teaching applicants to a large south-central Ontario school board. Trends in teacher demand are considered in terms of a cyclical model, the basic structure of which is generational. It is noted that an approximately 20-year period of teacher shortage, from the late 1940s to the late 1960s, was followed by a period of about equal duration in which there has been a teacher surplus, from the late 1960s to the late 1980s.

The paper is divided into three sections, which correspond to three features of questions. The three features are the \"context\" of questions, the \"content\" of questions, and the \"responses and reactions\" that teachers and students have to questions. The goal is to demonstrate that research on questions must minimally consider these three features, and identify ways of describing each of the features. Each of the three sections of the paper is divided into two parts, which discuss process-product and sociolinguistic research separately. The division enables keeping the assumptions and world-views of the  paradigms distinct. Although the two paradigms concern themselves with different problems, they can inform each other. Sociolinguistics can suggest some of the facets of discourse that a process-product student should consider. Sociolinguists of education should consider the lessons of process-product research as well. (JD)",

Measures of anxiety, attitude, concerns, and confidence about teaching were administered to a sample of 153 prospective teachers before and after their student teaching experience. It was found that as these prospective teachers progressed through teacher training they became less concerned about their self-survival as a teacher but more aware of the complex demands of the teaching profession (task concerns), became less anxious about becoming teachers, and became more assured about the decision to become teachers. They maintained high and relatively stable scores related to their: (1) self-ratings of probable success as future teachers;  (2) positive attitude about teaching as a career; and (3) concerns about their impact upon their future pupils. These findings were found to be generally predictable and consistent with theories of teacher development such as Fuller's stages of concerns model. (Author/JD)",

This automated system of information management was designed in response to requests for demographic program information from governing agencies coupled with a concern for awareness of student progress in the program. A performance-based teacher certification system was instituted statewide which motivated numerous changes in the professional preparation program. A key component of the project was a process standard requiring training to a common teaching evaluation model for university and public school teachers involved with the student teaching experience. To govern  progress in the program as well as stimulate retention of key information, a quality assurance program was structured around an automated approach for performance monitoring. This report discusses the rationale for developing the program, details its evolution, and provides a description of the program.

It is noted that more attention must be paid to the way schools are organized, that state actions should be avoided that add to an already bureaucratic quality in the schools, and that the quality of teacher education institutions must be improved. The booklet ends with a list of ideas,  points of departure, and suggestions for improving schooling. (JD)",

        "description":"Teachers' uses of and concerns with various assessment procedures were surveyed in the Parkrose School District, Portland, Oregon. All 229 district teachers and student service staff were asked to complete a questionnaire. A total of 211 questionnaires was returned for a response rate of 92%; however, all but one of the analyses were based on the responses of 102 elementary school teachers (ESTs) and 100 secondary school teachers (SSTs). The questionnaire, a modification of an instrument developed by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, examined teachers' uses and concerns regarding five categories of testing: (1) teacher-developed objective; (2) textbook embedded; (3) standardized achievement; (4) curriculum-referenced and district-developed; and (5) teacher  observation and development. In the classroom, teachers used observation and judgment more than any other types of tests, and teacher-made tests were the second most popular type. Standardized achievement tests were used the least. SSTs used more teacher-made tests, and ESTs used more observation. Teachers were most concerned about improving the quality of observation and objective tests that they developed. ESTs were more concerned about the conflict with instructional time and student reaction to standardized testing. It is recommended that the district formulate and implement a district policy on testing. Two tables present survey data. Appendices provide the philosophy and proposed testing policy, teacher targets on testing, and a teacher target sheet on test construction.  (SLD)",

Our economy currently under-rewards the achievements that are measured by these tests. Consequently, economic incentives to study hard in high school are minimal, and this absence of incentives has contributed to the low levels of achievement in mathematics and science. Alternative measures of academic achievement include: (1) diplomas; (2) competency profiles; (3) hiring based on high school grades; (4) job tryout and promotions based on performance; (5) job knowledge tests; (6) intelligence tests; and (7) broad spectrum achievement tests. To maximize incentive efforts, students, parents, and teachers must  be aware that local employers are using tests for selection and must know what kind of material is included on these tests. Employers should publicize their use of broad spectrum achievement tests. Greater use by employers of tests measuring competence in reading, writing, mathematics, and problem solving will inevitably increase the economic rewards for having such abilities.

Thirty-nine statements, letters, and supplemental materials are presented. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement's proposal concerning funding for a center on the study of the education of disadvantaged students is discussed. Educational R&amp;D efforts by the House of Representatives, and the Administration's commitment to educational research are considered. Shifts away from basic research between 1980 and 1985 toward dissemination have undermined the research enterprise across the entire Department of Education (DOE). Issues  discussed include: literacy and reading, school improvement and effectiveness, bilingual education, accountability, school finance, the business community's role, educational achievement, education for poor and at-risk populations, dissemination, education information, demonstration research, educational testing and evaluation, coordination, communication, cooperation, and excellence in education. Enhanced federal education research programs, research laboratories, centers, and information bureaus are needed. Educational R&amp;D efforts must be conceived within the context of the interdependent nature of the research/development/dissemination triad, since the impact of R&amp;D knowledge depends upon how effectively that knowledge is delivered to educational practitioners and policymakers. It is  recommended that the DOE needs to establish a National Education Information Dissemination Policy. (TJH)",

        "description":"This article addresses the role of perceived self-efficacy during self-regulated learning--learning that occurs from students' self-generated behaviors systematically oriented toward the attainment of learning goals. Self-efficacy refers to personal beliefs about one's capabilities to behave in ways necessary to attain desired performances. A central premise is that attributions (perceived causes of academic successes and failures) are important cues used by students to assess self-efficacy for learning. A theoretical overview of self-efficacy and attribution theory is given, along with a model highlighting their role during learning. Research evidence is presented on how providing students with attributional feedback affects their self-efficacy and achievement. The importance of  self-efficacy and attributions during learning is highlighted with research on comprehension strategy instruction with remedial readers. The use of learning strategies is a key feature of self-regulated learners, and evidence suggests that strategy instruction promotes self-efficacy and achievement in part through its effects on attributions. The implications of attributional feedback and strategy instruction for self-regulated learning are discussed. A 44-item list of references and a diagram of the self-efficacy model of achievement behavior are included. (Author/TJH)",

Different methods were tested by splitting the pretest sample of 220 public schools and 75 private schools into five treatment subsamples and using a different methodology in each subsample. The different methodologies addressed the following questions: (1) Should the principal designate a school coordinator to coordinate collection activities or should the survey assume that the principal would do this? (2) Should the coordinator be paid for time spent coordinating collection activities? (3) Should telephone or mail  prompts remind the coordinator of follow-up? (4) Are there differences between public and private schools? (5) Are there differences by questionnaire type? Focus was on selecting the treatment that will provide a high survey response rate. Results indicate that the designated coordinator was important. Responses to telephone prompts were higher than for mail prompts. Returns from the public sector were higher than from the private sector. Paying coordinators did not significantly improve return rates. The different questionnaires did not produce significant differences in response rates. The full survey will utilize telephone prompts to unpaid coordinators. Eleven tables present pretest data.

The MSDTs' validity, method for deriving test scores, reliability and other statistics, test content, and test norms are discussed. These tests--given in grades 3, 6, and 8--assess an individual's strengths and weaknesses (degree of mastery) in reading, language arts, and mathematics skills necessary for successful performance at the next grade level. The MSDTs form the second phase of a state program that begins with the California Achievement Tests. Those who perform at or below an established cut-off score on the MSDTs receive remedial instruction during a state-funded summer program. There are two forms (Forms A and B) of the  MSDTs, each of which contains three subtests corresponding to the three subject areas. Each subtest consists of 99 items in objective sequence, with the exception of grade 3 mathematics, which has 104 items. After the summer program, students retake the MSDTs (Phase III of the state testing program) in long or short versions to show improvement in the mastery of standard objectives. Thirteen graphs give comparisons of Forms A and B. Nine tables present item difficulty by item number, and three additional tables give state norms. Three appendices show the item content and item representation by objective for the tests. (SLD)",

Suen and P. S. Lee (1987) for the generalizability analysis of autocorrelated data. According to Tiao and Tan, if time series data could be described as a first-order autoregressive series with parameter &quot;p&quot; (rho), unbiased estimates of random error variance could be derived via a Bayesian process. Suen and Lee's two-step alternative procedure combines both Box-Jenkins time series analysis and a random-effect ANOVA process. The autocorrelated component of the data can be removed through the Box-Jenkins procedure, and then the residual or white-noise data can by analyzed via the ANOVA process to produce unbiased  variance estimates. Theoretical advantages and limitations of the two approaches are outlined, focusing on autoregressive integrated moving averages. Three analyses of the methods are presented. Results from application of the methods to numerous data sets show that autocorrelation has a negligible or no effect on the systematic variance across observers. The Suen-Lee method is superior to the Tiao-Tan method in applications to generalizability assessment of observation data. Based on 28 behavioral observation time series, the Suen-Lee method seems to be applicable only when the relative systematic observer variance is small.

Focus was on evaluating the effectiveness of AIDS education in the secondary schools in one metropolitan area of a midwestern state. Individual inventory items were tested for significance by the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test. Twenty of the 40 items were answered incorrectly by a significant number of the students. Although most students knew the general definition of AIDS, they did not know  specifics (i.e., the name of the virus, number of victims, and projected number of cases). Most students knew that AIDS is transmitted by blood or semen, through sexual contact or blood transfusions. They knew that AIDS may be carried by apparently healthy individuals and that risk is increased by sexual promiscuity. Nevertheless, the students held misconceptions regarding transmission, specific effects of the disease, and social implications. Results indicate that: (1) in general, students are informed about AIDS; (2) anxiety levels are high; and (3) beliefs that AIDS can be transmitted in the schools must be countered.

Focus was on assessing the use of concrete materials in mathematics instruction, comparing the perceptual preferences of mathematically-deficient and average/above average elementary school students, and using this information to make recommendations for instruction. Results indicate that the regular students preferred an auditory or visual mode of learning, and the remedial students preferred a kinesthetic mode.  There was no difference in preference for tactile mode. A survey of 24 teachers indicated that 83% used concrete materials (visual or auditory instructional methods) only sometimes.

Five desiderata are provided to underpin the type of testing proposed: (1) tests should emphasize learning and thinking; (2) tests should require generation as well as selection; (3) tests should be integral to learning; (4) tests should serve multiple purposes; and (5) tests should be valid with respect to all their purposes. These desiderata are considered critical for a new, more benign learning and testing environment. In the first scenario outlined, intelligent tutoring systems become devices for administering problem-solving tests to students. The second, more radical scenario for an integrated testing and learning environment, is  implicit in an analysis of learning in the LISP tutor. In this scenario, the computational medium enables evaluation to be conducted on the process of learning; rather than taking tests, the student is tested in the course of teaching.

        "description":"That the jackknifing technique is superior to traditional techniques for assessing the external validity of statistical results of discriminant analysis is defended. Traditional approaches assessed include: (1) the empirical method, in which the discriminant function coefficients (DFCs) obtained in a given analysis are applied to predict group membership in the same sample used for deriving the DFCs; (2) the &quot;holdout&quot; method, in which statistical results are cross-validated by random splitting of the original sample into a group for deriving the discriminant function and a group for cross-validating it; (3) the Monte Carlo method; and (4) the random assignment method, whereby discriminant functions are computed based on repeated random assignment of actual cases from the original  sample to groups. The jackknife statistic (JS) is similar to the &quot;U-method&quot; and focuses on the stability of the DFCs obtained in the original analysis. One case or subset of cases is eliminated from the original data set, and the discriminant function is computed using the remaining observations. The procedure is repeated, with each individual observation or unique subgroup, in turn, omitted. At each step, pseudo-values are computed, based on computation of the original and cases-minus-one DFCs. The values are averaged to provide a jackknifed estimate of the DFCs. A data set shows the JS's value and is used to assess the stability of the jackknifed DFCs for three predictors of teachers' (N=69) level of experience. The JS may be used to reduce bias in an estimator that is attributable to  artifacts of the sample used. Since jackknife methods minimize sample splitting via sample omission and reuse, they are particularly useful with small samples. Four data tables are provided. (TJH)",

Internal structure analyses of the tests indicated that the following worksamples had moderately high reliabilities: (1) Maze Tracing; (2) Hidden Patterns; (3) Drawing; and (4) Concealed Words. The experimental tests considered jointly  were found to measure three distinct factors: (1) one represented by Gestalt Completion, Snowy Pictures, and Concealed Words; (2) a second measured by Hidden Patterns, Hidden Figures, Drawing, and Tactics; and (3) a third represented by Maze Tracing. The perceptual ability factors studied were not measured by the JOCRF standard battery. The Concealed Words Test, the Hidden Patterns Test, and Maze Tracing Speed Test were found to be the most suitable perceptual abilities measures; they may be useful additions to the standard JOCRF battery. Twenty-two tables and 16 figures present study data. (SLD)",

Three experimental tests--the Incomplete Open Cubes Test, the Guilford-Zimmerman Spatial Visualization Test, and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices--were added to the JOCRF's test battery and administered to between 2,199 and 2,814 clients using the JOCRF's aptitude testing services. Complete measurements were available for 917 males and 801 females. Tests from the regular battery also analyzed were: (1) measures of structural visualization, the Wiggly Block and Paper Folding Tests; (2) Analytical Reasoning; and (3) Inductive Reasoning. Scores from item response theory methods were measured for the tests. Results suggest  that: the Wiggly Block Test contains a small non-spatial component, attributable to the use of a distinctive feature-extraction strategy; and the Paper Folding Test contains a large non-spatial component, attributable to the use of a distinctive feature-extraction strategy and general reasoning ability. Overall, the results show that the relative independence of spatial measures from verbal and reasoning measures is no longer characteristic of many spatial tests currently in use. Ten figures and 17 tables summarize study data. A 65-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on the nature and effectiveness of elementary transition classes (TCs) used by the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) as an alternative to retention to improve low achievers' achievement. Data were examined concerning the number and nature of TCs operating in the AISD during 1987-88; achievement progress of students in TCs at Langford, Casis, and Oak Hill elementary schools in 1986-87; and achievement progress of students in a TC at Metz Elementary School in 1983-84. Goals for first-grade TCs, criteria for selection of students and successful completion of the transition program, parental involvement, and reading and mathematics achievement were analyzed. Focus was on transition from grade 1 to 2. 1987-88 TCs included 13 first- and 4 second-grade  classes meeting all day, 2 first-grade classes for language arts, and 1 first-grade class for language arts and mathematics. There were 225 first and 57 second graders in the TCs. Results do not provide any strong support for the notion that TCs are any better for low achievers' long-term achievement than are transitional retention programs; short-term progress may be greater, but long-term progress is quite similar. TCs might be more effective if they are designed to: be 2-year packages; lead to promotion; promote a higher percentage of students; and provide students with supplemental help throughout their school careers. Six data tables and six graphs are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"The validity of various procedures for rank ordering school districts throughout a state on the basis of statewide test results was studied. Data were drawn from the 1987 administration of the Kentucky Essential Skills Test (KEST), which is given each spring to all children enrolled in public school grades kindergarten through 12 in 178 school districts in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. With the data, school districts were ranked, first using different aggregates of achievement scores and then using achievement scores adjusted for different combinations of demographic factors. The demographic factors and school-based indices included: percent economically deprived, percent local revenue, assessed property value, cost for instruction, current expenses, percent local education  agency support, local financial index, teacher/student ratio, and attendance and dropout rates. Achievement variables included: total battery normal curve equivalents score (TBNCES), grade 5 TBNCES, grade 10 TBNCES, reading comprehension NCES, and mathematics score. These rankings were compared, and differences were noted. The various ranking procedures yielded widely varied ranks for most of the districts, regardless of whether non-adjusted or adjusted scores were used. Thus, any ranking procedure is likely to create inaccurate public and governmental perceptions of variation in educational programs, and may lead to misgiven conclusions regarding the programs' quality. Seven data tables are provided. (Author/TJH)",

The West German sample was then compared to an American sample. It is believed that West Germans and Americans develop different beliefs about the causes and consequences of intellectual functioning and different reactions to the presence of authority. The samples included 115 male and 135 female Germans and 100 male and 100 female Americans, most of whom were college students. Attributions selected included: mood, skill, knowledge, chance, effort, competence, help, ability, task, bias, and luck. These 11 attributions obtained from previous research were placed on separate pages of a  questionnaire; each attribution was followed by five 7-point scales on five dimensions: (1) external-internal; (2) stable-unstable; (3) predictable-unpredictable; (4) controllable-uncontrollable; and (5) specific-general. Two sets of 3-way analyses of variance with one repeated measure were performed. Results show that the semantic meaning of attributions varies somewhat between Americans and Germans. This variation has implications for educational settings involving multicultural and multiethnic populations and for motivational strategies used by students. Two data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "author":["Broadfoot, Patricia"],
        "description":"Some of the assumptions underlying educational assessment policies in England and Wales are discussed in terms of contradictions in the aims of those policies. Two key initiatives--the national &quot;bench-mark&quot; testing and records of achievement--provide the focus for illustrating the potentially fundamental change of emphasis in the nature and role of educational assessment that is currently taking place. Via a brief socio-historical analysis of the emerging role of assessment in education, the significance of current contradictions in each educational assessment is examined. The evolution of evaluative language, the trend toward &quot;humanization,&quot; and student-centered teaching and evaluation are outlined. The central emerging contradiction involves the simultaneous use of education as  an instrument of social control and its potential to act as a force opposing such control by equipping learners with the power to reflect upon and challenge the prevailing power. Comparisons to assessment approaches in France and West Germany are provided; and the Great Education Reform Bill of 1987, which calls for testing of all children at 7 years of age, is critiqued. Far from educational assessment provoking a legitimation crisis, it may be reflecting the emergence of a new form of disciplinary power into which the post-enlightenment abstract language of account, which made psychometric testing and self-surveillance possible, is combined with the pre-modern disciplinary code of direct surveillance of the person as a whole rather than as the occupant of a series of  contractuallly-defined roles.

        "description":"Confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL VI) is the method best suited to the comparison of measurement models when those models are based on a priori assumptions. Traditionally, positive and negative item stems were mixed on affective scales to reduce response set bias since the item pairs were considered to be parallel. Recent studies indicate that positive and negative item stems may form separate factors, implying that they represent different constructs. In this study, the differences between positive and negative item stems were assessed using two forms of a computer anxiety scale to ascertain if the negation of an item produces a parallel item and to compare the factor structures and measurement errors to determine if factor invariance can be claimed. Three forms (Forms A, B,  and C) of a computer anxiety scale were administered to a random sample of students (20 homerooms) at a small city high school. Reverse scoring was used for all items on Form B and for appropriate items on Form C. The results are consistent with those of other researchers, providing more evidence that the use of reverse scored items on an affective scale can alter students' responses to an item. One should view results with caution when the instrument includes mixed item stems, since the negation of an item tends to lead to an increase in the error variance related to the item. In general, positive and negative forms of this scale do not meet the criteria for factor invariance or for parallel tests. (TJH)",

School districts in New York City have developed collaborative programs with health care services, youth agencies, neighborhood family service centers, community organizations and parent groups. Critics argue that schools compound their academic ineffectiveness by attempting to meet their students' non-instructional needs. Supporters argue that schools have no choice because effective teaching and learning is impossible when students' pre-instructional needs remain unattended, and that schools are the only institutions societally positioned to mandate and achieve the daily attendance of all children. Advantages include the following: (1)  provision of more extensive student services; (2) focus on school improvement; (3) reduction of the gap between school culture and home-neighborhood culture; and (4) development of a new comprehensive community-based institution with the local school and its instructional focus at the core of a wide range of services. Problems include the following: (1) district-level management's lack of experience; (2) a tendency to work only with traditional agencies to the exclusion of minority group organizations and agencies offering controversial services; (3) power struggles between administrators and collaborators; (4) disparities between school-level implementation and district-level decisions; (5) institutional rigidity; (6) a too narrow focus on vocationalism; and (7) the danger of creating an  atmosphere of clientism.

Among the findings are the following: (1) 41.3 percent had dropped out of school; (2) 7.2 percent had graduated or passed a General Educational Development (GED) test; (3) 7.5 percent had been discharged from the school system either to local private schools or to schools outside of New York City; (4) 39.7 percent were still enrolled in school; (5) 4.3 percent were of unknown status either because of data-entry errors or because no official admission/discharge transactions had been recorded for them; (6) 49.5 percent of students who met AIDP's attendance eligibility  criteria, but only 30.5 percent of those who did not meet the criteria, had dropped out of school; and (7) 58.7 percent of a comparison group of non-participants, but only 10.5 percent of the rest of the school, were listed as dropouts.

These reports provide data on Local Education Agency (LEA) and State Agency Neglected or Delinquent compensatory education programs, in terms of the size of the population of educationally deprived students served, the characteristics of that population and its achievement rates, staffing utilized, mix of services provided, and funding. Two major changes are reflected in this year's reports. First, as a result of the impact of the Aguilar v. Felton decision, there has been a dramatic drop--31 percent--in the number of nonpublic school students served by the LEA programs, from over 184,000 the previous year to 127,922. This decrease covered every grade span nationwide.  Aggregate declines were reported by 46 states and the District of Columbia, and in 16 states dropoffs of 50 percent or more were reported. Second, all public participation and staffing figures for the years 1978-80 through 1985-86 have been revised to account for California's inclusion of data on students enrolled in the state's own compensatory education programs. Despite Aguilar V. Felton, the total number of Chapter 1 participants increased slightly. Information on the following aspects of Chapter 1 are provided: (1) services rendered; (2) staff; (3) participant composition; (4) achievement; (5) funding; and (6) State Agency Neglected or Delinquent program participants. Appendices discuss the methodology and provide additional data. Data are presented on 63 tables and figures.  (BJV)",

The report focuses on only those procedures and practices that affect households once they have contacted the local food stamp office for assistance. Reviewed were application procedures and 664 case records for fiscal years 1984 and 1985 in California, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Texas. It was found that, under certain circumstances, procedures adopted by these states prevented or delayed eligible households from applying for food stamps and participating in the Food Stamp Program. In addition, households with the same income can receive more food stamps in some  states than in others because Food and Nutrition Service regulations permit states to calculate a household's monthly income in two different ways. Recommendations are offered. Data are presented on two tables. Appendices provide the following: (1) comments from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, and from state agencies in California, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin; (2) a list of the 33 local offices where the review was conducted; and (3) a list of the major contributors to the report, grouped by the Federal office in which they work.

VisionQuest was one of several organizations selected in the early 1980s to assist the Federal government with the influx of Cuban refugees by providing services to adolescents and young adults who had been institutionalized in Cuba for mental illness and/or criminal offenses. In the past five years, most of VisionQuest's funds have been awarded through a cooperative agreement with the Refugee Mental Health Program (RMHP), operated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Federal funds awarded--by NIMH and the Community Relations Service in the Department of Justice--from July 1981 to March 1988 totalled about $18.8  million. During that period, 245 Cubans participated in VisionQuest programs. There were deficiencies in NIMH's administration of the VisionQuest program. NIMH did not carry out its overall administrative and monitoring responsibilities, such as enforcing the requirement that VisionQuest arrange for independent audits of its Federal projects at least every two years and submit financial status reports on time. Also, NIMH did not maintain much of the required documentation concerning the award of Federal funds to VisionQuest. Recommendations are offered. Data are presented on four tables. Appendices present comments from the Department of Health and Human Services, and list the major contributors to the report. (BJV)",

It explains how TJTC has been used in three major urban areas with large disadvantaged populations: Baltimore, Kansas City, and St. Louis. After a summary of the history of TJTC and of the findings of other studies of wage subsidies in Part I, Part II reviews the origins of current employment problems of disadvantaged persons in Maryland and Missouri. Part III reviews income experiences of TJTC participants in the two states 5 years after hiring. Part IV examines changes in use patterns from 1985 to 1987 to determine the impact of the hiatus period (after TJTC expiration and prior to reenactment) on job seekers and employers. Part V reviews the significant changes  in the TJTC summer program and relates the changes to efforts to direct more employment and training resources to solving the problems of at-risk youth. Part VI examines the experiences of employment and training agencies with TJTC. Employer use of TJTC is reviewed in Part VII. It focuses on the institutionalization of TJTC within the business community and the implications of current employer use for the design of employment subsidies. The conclusion includes recommendations for modifications of TJTC and an analysis of the role of TJTC as an employment strategy in urban areas with significant unemployment. Notes and a 10-page bibliography complete the report. (YLB)",

Data were collected from 475 blue-collar employees at four leading manufacturing plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Survey results indicated that nontraditional students may not be completely aware of the support services and basic procedures and requirements of most colleges and universities. Some students indicated that they would need some type of educational assistance in mathematics, English, writing, and reading. Findings were used as a tool in developing a proposed Industrial Education Degree Program that unites the technological demands of the labor force with the educational needs of blue-collar employees as  nontraditional students. The model educational program is intended for use by industry and higher educational institutions as a guideline in revising the general education core of a four-year degree program. The proposed degree has three purposes: it could provide the opportunity for four-year institutions to join forces with business and industry to help combat educational deficiencies of employees in the current work force; it may provide a new pool of students for certain institutions in higher education; and it could meet the educational needs of blue-collar employees.

Chapter 1 gives an overview of the volume and tells how to use it. Chapter 2 identifies who caregivers are, what they do, and what changes have taken place in their lives since they became caregivers. Chapter 3 begins with a discussion of the sources of stress, its symptoms and stages, and its consequences and then describes techniques to reduce stress or its effects. Discussion in chapter 4 focuses on communication in the family, including such topics as information sharing, changing nature of relationships, need for support systems, and patterns of communication. Chapter 5 focuses on techniques for aiding communication with those with impaired hearing  or vision, stroke, or neurological deficits. Chapter 6 describes important changes in the body and major age-related diseases. Chapters 7 and 8 provide information about the changing nutritional needs of older adults and about different types of exercise. Topics in chapter 9 concern the psychology of aging. Chapter 10 describes the various types of living arrangements in terms of the needs of the older people they accommodate. Chapter 11 covers legal and financial matters. The final chapter introduces a variety of agencies and their services that may be helpful in meeting the needs of caretakers and their older relatives. Recommended readings and references for each chapter are listed. (YLB)",

        "description":"A research study explored how a group of adults who have had limited schooling (and therefore, would be expected to be nonparticipants in adult education programs) view their educational experiences and the opportunities open to them as adults. As an exploratory study, a focused sample of 40 members of the Northern Hotel Workers' Union in New Zealand were interviewed about their work and family life, schooling experiences, and adult education. The study found that school had been a varied experience for the respondents. Most considered schooling something to be endured and had few expectations. As adults, many regret their limited time at school, but these negative feelings do not appear to be related to their nonparticipation in education. Although most feel they have been able  to achieve what they want as adults despite their levels of schooling, they see this becoming more difficult as they age and the job market becomes more competitive. Most respondents are aware of at least some form of adult educational provision and see these programs as filling two roles: providing recreation/leisure and providing &quot;second-chance&quot; opportunities for social mobility. There is a strong level of interest in and respect for education among the respondents. About half are interested in educational opportunities for themselves. Four types of nonparticipants were inferred from the research, and strategies for involving three of these types were suggested. The questionnaire, interview schedule, and a bibliography are appended. (Author/KC)",

The elements identified were leadership, networking, legislation and funding,  training and technical assistance, and community education identity and support. As a result of the project, needed reinforcement and revitalization of existing community education networks were provided, and the stimulus to expand to other groups with related concerns was generated.

        "description":"A study examined the role of the state in providing adult literacy services. Questionnaires were sent to state adult education directors, state library directors, and state literacy commission directors in the 50 states and five territories, with a varying rate of return approximating 75 percent. Each questionnaire sought information about budgetary matters, program criteria, demographics, needs assessment, program management, and evaluation. Some of the results of the surveys were as follows: (1) states are increasing their monetary commitment to literacy services; (2) state library directors estimate it costs approximately $260 to keep one adult in a library-related literacy program for one year, whereas keeping one illiterate adult in an adult-education-sponsored program for  one year costs about $514; (3) adult education directors estimate that about 700,000 adults 16 years and older need literacy services in each state, but only 9 percent are receiving them; (4) state library directors estimate that for 1986 and 1987, 55,000-65,000 persons received literacy services through state and local public library programs; (5) 42 percent of the states have conducted needs assessments; and (6) insufficient funds, followed by lack of student motivation, were perceived as the greatest barriers to providing literacy services.

The population studied was all nonvocational 11th-grade students in the Southwest Ohio Region Personnel Development Center during the 1987-88 school year. Five schools were randomly selected from the population, resulting in 633 nonvocational 11th-graders. Two of the schools were in urban areas, and three were in rural areas; the socioeconomic status of the schools was similar. Students were about 80 percent white, 17 percent black, and 3 percent other races, and about half male and half female. Students completed questionnaires; a random sample of 15 of their parents were interviewed by telephone. The study showed that the most often cited  reason students did not enroll in vocational education was that they wanted to go to college and that vocational education would neither prepare them for college nor offer the right graduation credits. Students also had a negative image of vocational education courses and vocational students. The study also found that mothers/female guardians, followed by friends, were the most important influences on student curriculum choice. The study concluded that vocational education should seek ways to become more integrated with the academic curriculum in order to offer college-bound students credits for college. It also suggested marketing the vocational curriculum to mothers. (KC)",

These studies indicate that 27 million adult Americans have left school either unable to read and write, or unable to read sufficiently well to understand the most basic newspaper articles or official forms. These problems have prompted some groups to look to the federal government for solutions, especially increased funding. However, there is no evidence suggesting that additional federal spending is likely to solve or even reduce significantly the number of people lacking basic reading and writing skills. Instead, the way to win the war on illiteracy is to spur action by local communities, private organizations, and state and local governments. The federal  government can best help these efforts by coordinating current federal programs, by creating a data bank listing successful local and volunteer efforts, and by keeping attention focused on the problem. In addition, a back-to-basics strategy is needed in the schools, with more emphasis on reading, writing, and mathematics skills. Temptations to increase \"technology\" education and vocational education should be resisted, and phonics should again be taught. Only when the issue is focused on local schools can the problem of illiteracy be solved. (KC)",

FEDP was developed as part of the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) 8% State Plan. Its major focus was to provide a coordinated service effort for families in Michigan who were dependent on public assistance in an effort to promote the economic independence of the families. Ten new sites implemented the model during the second year. Program providers had little difficulty in recruiting participants. Facilitators identified existing assets and barriers to employment for the family unit. Barriers were characteristic of hard-to-serve families. Each model that was implemented contained these key components: family  identification and recruitment, assessment of family and individual attributes, family problem-solving and goal setting, case conferences with other service agencies, meetings with the family to monitor progress, and follow-up. FEDP facilitators engaged in these types of activities: direct contact, advocacy, administration, family intervention, in-home visits, counseling, and family interviews. Outcomes included completion of various levels of education and training programs, increased employment, and greater self-esteem for individuals and families. (Instruments and findings are appended.)

After two years (1986-1988), 64 of the initial 124 families who participated in the project were off public assistance (52%); 39 percent of the families were in training; 6 percent of the families were working and  receiving reduced aid; and 3 percent of the families were in FEDP counseling only. A total of 411 persons was served, with a positive impact rate of 95 percent. About half of the families were headed by a single head of household, and most had several barriers to employment, such as lack of training, poor education, and lack of child care. The program aimed to address these needs on a case-by-case basis. Full-scale implementation of the program was recommended if its uniqueness can be preserved in a large-scale program.

        "description":"A project was conducted to improve and expand academic upgrading, job readiness, and special skill training for adults in the Keewatin Region through the implementation of computer-assisted learning (CAL). It was intended as a response to the special needs of unemployed Inuit who were not reached in the past by traditional training programs and methods. The presence of CAL increased the numbers of students in programs, resulted in better student retention rates, and caused more registrations by employed persons in special work-related CAL courses. Improved student work attitudes were attributed to some degree to CAL. Acquisition of greater academic skills and credentials was regarded as prima facie evidence of greater employability. Interviews and questionnaires administered to  students and staff indicated strong support for CAL as a component of upgrading, as a tool for enhancing computer literacy, and for specialized applications. Both adult educators and students identified needs for courseware development. The project was evaluated as being a successful example of the use of technology to overcome barriers to access for adults learning in Canada's remote areas. (YLB)",

A narrative that precedes the abstracts lists generalizations and conclusions that are representative of the studies presented in the report. It concludes that the studies reviewed confirm that feedback improves the performance of subordinates. The suggestion is made that providing interpersonal communication skills to supervisors and managers should be highly valued, but only if those skills involve how to recognize feedback opportunities and how to deliver feedback to subordinates. The following generalizations are made: some feedback is always available to employees in the work setting; feedback promotes more efficient acquisition of new job tasks; feedback affects  motivation; the more specific the feedback, the more rapid the improvement and the higher the level of performance; the longer the delay in giving feedback, the less effect the feedback has on performance; when feedback is decreased, performance level drops; and when feedback is removed, those who maintain their performance probably have developed some substitute source of feedback. The research abstracts are arranged in this format: author(s), year, title, source (publication or journal) and volume number, and pagination; purpose; participants; method; results; and discussion.

        "description":"As educators become more interested in the use of qualitative methods, a major concern is the management of the large amounts of textual data during analysis. The efficiency and possibly the effectiveness of manual systems, i.e., color-coded index cards and wall-mounted systems, are reduced as the amount of textual data increases. An emerging family of text management programs, such as ASKSAM (Access Stored Knowledge via Symbolic Access Method), may help address this concern by automating aspects of the analysis and, thus, facilitating the process. A case study example that compared results achieved through the use of ASKSAM and through a file card analysis indicated that the data analyzed via the computerized approach yielded essentially the same result as had previously been  obtained through the traditional analytic approach. These results suggest that the use of a computer-based text management program can increase the efficiency of the data analysis process without significantly altering the interpretations made from the data.

        "description":"This document reports the oral and written testimony of a large number of witnesses who testified at Congressional hearings in April 1988 on the topic of employment by the year 2000. The four days of hearings were convened to assess the nation's ability to respond adequately to the changes in domestic labor markets, projected employment opportunities, increased international trade competition, and projected skill deficits in the labor force through the year 2000. The testimony showed that this nation must use its collective resources to invest in the technical competency and intellectual capacity of its people. Economists, labor industry experts, academicians, local government officials, and representatives from varied public interest groups had one principal concern: that the  employment prospects of a large share of the future labor force are seriously threatened with too few and inadequate training opportunities, a decline in low-skilled jobs, illiteracy, criminal activity, drugs, and a growing underclass. Testimony showed that by the year 2000, the pool of potential workers will be mostly composed of persons who lack basic job readiness skills and meaningful commitments to the labor force. Finally, according to the witnesses, the United States will face an unprecedented socioeconomic challenge. The country must enable itself to step forward toward the cutting edge of technological and economic change. It can do that only with sound investments in education and training. (KC)",

(Pay-for-knowledge is an innovative compensation system that bases salaries, not on particular job classifications, but rather on the repertoire of skills that an employee possesses.) A four-pronged research design was developed: (1) an extensive literature review; (2) interviews of a national probability sample of 154 corporate personnel officers; (3) a mail survey of 19 plants using pay-for-knowledge; and (4) analysis of employee attitudinal and behavioral data from three plants using pay-for-knowledge. The study found that pay-for-knowledge plans are in use in about 8 percent of major U.S. corporations, primarily in manufacturing industries.  Although the plans vary widely, they are similar in terms of using pay-for-knowledge in conjunction with a team-based managerial approach, an emphasis on performance appraisals, skill rotation, the wage structure relative to local wage markets, and the kinds of employees covered. Among the major benefits of pay-for-knowledge are work force flexibility, employee development, and improved productivity, work force stability, employee attitudes and behaviors, and labor-management relationships. Some problems in logistics occur, with no effective ways yet developed to solve them. The study concluded that pay-for-knowledge plans will continue to be used and might become more widespread as more organizations learn about them. (Six-page reference list.) (KC)",

The exclusiveness theory proposes that educational requirements and the educational levels required for employment continually increase, not in response to the actual requirements of jobs, but so that the professions can maintain exclusivity and social status by excluding those with lower levels of education. Education is seen as a means of continuing or bettering social class rank rather than as job preparation. In the study, a sample of 392 students from a population of 1,604 at a open university were administered a questionnaire, with a response rate of 74 percent. The questionnaire asked about students' reasons for obtaining higher education and about their perceptions of  their social class. The study did not support the hypothesis that elevation of social status was a significant factor in students' reasons for studying at the university. (KC)",

        "description":"As schools begin to form partnerships with industry, many of the differences in the cultural values of each institution have not been explored or considered within the partnership agreements. A lack of knowledge and preparation about cultural differences between the partners can lead to unintended consequences. As teachers begin to work in industry through school partnerships, such as the &quot;Valued Instructional Program&quot; in Minnesota, the strong residue of traditional industrial cultural values and the current upheaval caused by societal and economic forces acting upon industry may subtly influence their conceptions of and confusion about industrial goals, educational goals, and classroom practice. In preparing for partnerships, the history of industrial goals, management, and  values should be considered. Such influences as Frederick Taylor's ideas about scientific management are pervasive, and new influences such as a focus on external competition, deregulation, and new technology are also active in the industrial culture. Teachers going into industry as industrial trainers for the first time may be influenced by the pay scales and treatment, not realizing that for industrialists, they are a supply of cheap labor. Teachers returning to the classroom may dispense with teaching the &quot;nice to know&quot; in order to facilitate a fit between students and industry, at the expense of students' personal development. Although educators and industrialists have a great deal to learn from each other in solving the problems of industry and education, they must be sure that the  exchange is really beneficial to all--teachers, industrialists, and students.

The committee members, relying on their own knowledge and experience, and with the guidance of a DACUM facilitator, identified the duties and tasks that were considered important to them. They also reviewed existing instructor task lists. The tasks identified by the DACUM committee formed the basis for developing a verification instrument, which was submitted by mail to 5 to 10 expert instructors in 13 utilities. The verification respondents rated each statement on: (1) the importance of the task; (2) task learning difficulty; and  (3) frequency with which the task was likely to be performed, using a six-point Likert scale. A total of 120 instructors responded to the task inventory by the cutoff date. The results of the survey are summarized in this report in terms of mean scores or percentages for each question about each task. The separately published &quot;competency profile,&quot; which duplicates the duties/tasks contained in the first 10 pages of the &quot;summary,&quot; lists the following 12 duties of instructors, with tasks identified for each duty: develop and maintain technical proficiency; develop and maintain instructional proficiency; assess training needs; develop/revise instructional material; prepare for instruction; coordinate and schedule training; operate and maintain instructional equpipment; deliver instruction;  supervise trainees; and evaluate trainees. Members of the electric utility industry DACUM committee are also identified. (Author/KC)",

Conducting curriculum searches for vocational and technical education clients continued to be a major function of the network. Another important function was the systematic dissemination of curriculum and instructional materials from their lending libraries. The CCC network continued to develop and maintain linkages with professional organizations and resources that help to enhance the effectiveness of vocational education services nationwide. The annual meeting held in Beaverton, Oregon, was a highlight of CCC networking during the year. In summary, the CCC network continued to make a positive impact on the vocational education community during 1988. Three attachments list the CCC's and a  sample of curriculum products developed by one state and adopted or adapted by another, and offer, in chart form, the CCC impact statistics for 1988. (KC)",

The first part identifies and discusses major areas of weakness in the field. It covers the essence of social science research, the evolution of comparative adult education methods, and selected events and activities in comparative adult education. The section concludes by acknowledging strong evidence of growing new internationalism and of the need for global exchange of values across societal systems and ideologies. A 44-item reference list is provided. Part II, the resource guide, is organized into three major categories, which indicate resources in and related to comparative adult education. Category A  presents two types of annotations: items related to comparative education as a field of study and items related to comparative adult education as a field of study. Category B deals with specific studies that compare principles and/or practices and people involved in adult education. Its five sections are international education, comparative adult education at the intranational level, comparative adult education at the international level, comparative education other than adult education, and comparative adult education at the national level. Category C consists of bibliographies and terminologies. Each abstract is preceded by a listing of which countries and themes the source covers. (YLB)",

Second, course content should be directly related to learner, labor market, and community needs. Third, partnership efforts should be expanded and strengthened. Fourth, programs must have a system that ensures accountability. If each adult education program addresses these principles, major strides will be made in responding to the needs of the U.S. economy and the individuals served. The current interest in adult education is the result of efforts of public and private groups; media support is crucial to these efforts. The national adult education program, begun under the authority of the Economic Opportunity Act,  has been continued through the Elememtary and Secondary Education Act and, most recently, the Adult Education Amendments of 1988. The adult education field has also responded to findings of large numbers of functionally incompetent adults by developing and using life skills curricula. The emphasis on functional competence has also raised the issue of what literacy or illiteracy is. Findings of literacy studies indicate that by any measure or definition the number of adults in need of higher level literacy skills is large. Application of the basic principles for adult education is one key method of guaranteeing more effective programs. (YLB)",

        "description":"Worker displacement is more closely related to structural features associated with firms than to the characteristics of the individuals who lost their jobs. Despite economic growth, large numbers of displaced workers continue to experience difficulty in making labor market adjustments. Programs to retrain and reemploy displaced workers exist at all levels of government and in the private sector. The most successful programs in the private sector are those that emphasize reemployment rather than retraining. Two common elements of successful state-level programs are active cooperation of labor and management and a broad range of services. Recommendations to strengthen the capacity of educational institutions to serve the needs of displaced workers include the development of  programs that are comprehensive in design, are closely linked with private and public agencies, and have program administrators who work closely with local employers and who are aggressive in promoting and marketing services. Program leaders should encourage employers to give advance notice of impending layoffs or plant closures, aggressively seek opportunities to provide training services to companies, and establish a fast response mechanism. Programs should include a strong job development component and establish mechanisms for early linkage with companies and postprogram follow-up linkage with displaced workers. (YLB)",

CT may overcome barriers to student participation in adult education, enable career educators to provide a higher level of career guidance to greater numbers, and facilitate currency in vocational preparation. Delivery modes include video, audio and audiographic, and computer. Examples of CT uses in adult, career, and vocational education are the AgriData Network, Instructional Television Fixed Service, Ohio State University's Cooperative Extension Service's microwave transmission to operate a television classroom, and several electronic networks. Various studies have researched the instructional effectiveness of CT. Findings indicate that  instruction involving CT is most effective when the instruction is &quot;high touch&quot; and interactive, students are prepared in advance, students understand supplemental materials, and the instruction does not imitate face-to-face teaching. CT can increase access to learning opportunities and more and better information sources, be individualized to meet student needs, and enhance immediacy while saving time and money. However, concerns about the effects of CT include equity of access, ethics, quality of instruction, effect on learning, and accommodation of different learning styles. (13 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Malcolm Knowles is attributed with developing the most cogent model underlying the assumption that teaching adults should differ from teaching children and adolescents. His andragogical model is based on the premise that adult learning differs from preadult learning. Two studies have examined whether teachers do actually use a different style when teaching adults. Respondents in both studies reported they spend less time on discipline and giving directions, provide less emotional support, structure instructional activities less tightly, and vary teaching techniques more. Follow-up classroom observations in one study did not verify the self-reported differences in teaching behavior. That study did find that a nontraditional, less-formal room arrangement did lead to the use of a  more student-centered approach; teachers with more formal training in adult education tended to use student-centered approaches the least; and the more flexible and responsive teachers were less experienced, female, secondary-level, and those who taught personal enrichment classes. Some considerations for practice emerged from the studies: determine the purpose of the teaching-learning situation, provide opportunities for teachers to practice learner-centered methods, and select teachers on the basis of their potential to provide learner-centered instructional settings.

        "description":"Much of the evaluation of vocational education at the state and local levels has been conducted in response to federal legislation. Although some of the evaluative information has been useful for program improvement, much has been collected only for compliance with federal and state mandates. The educational reform movement has prompted school officials to turn to evaluation to answer questions about redesigning their vocational programs despite criticism about the usefulness of evaluation strategies and results. Research on school effectiveness and program improvement indicates that if desired change or redesign is to occur, school culture and stakeholders' needs must be considered in the evaluation. McKinney's model for evaluating vocational education includes these main  activities: framing evaluation problems, interpreting dynamics of problems, and overcoming problems. Starr's evaluation method increases the relevance of vocational education offerings in meeting employment needs of students, employers, and labor market areas. This model incorporates the use of both quantitative data and explicit value judgments for comparing and ranking ongoing programs. According to Sirotnik, valid information about the ongoing schooling process should be collected. Microcomputers have added to the evaluation process the advantage of ease in storing, analyzing, and reporting the information collected. (12 references) (YLB)",

The federal legal framework governing expenditure of funds under the Perkins Act and JTPA is voluminous and cumbersome, but no effort has been undertaken to maintain a coherent legal resource covering both programs. Increased interaction between the two programs in the delivery of services to the disadvantaged is inhibited due to conflicting rules on matching, inconsistent definitions of &quot;disadvantaged,&quot; excess costs requirements, and dissimilarity in audit resolution procedures. Recommendations include development of a resource guide cross-referencing all legal requirements in each program; publication of all new policies in the  Federal Register; Congress's reconsideration of the need for the 50-50 match in the Perkins Act; a common definition of &quot;disadvantaged&quot; in both programs; and the elimination of the excess cost limitation.

Alternative work schedules for permanent employees frequently are advocated as a solution to the problems faced by women in the work force. Job sharing, permanent part-time employment, work-at-home options, and flexible full-time work schedules offer employees an opportunity to modify work hours while maintaining the benefits of regular employment. Among other reasons for implementing flexible scheduling plans, employers cite cost effectiveness, flexibility, employee morale, and productivity.

Students indicated they were interested in marketing education because of future opportunities available to those who possess the skills taught  through the marketing education program. It was recommended that: (1) research be conducted to determine what students know about marketing education programs before they enroll; (2) coordinators develop an intensive program for recruitment; (3) Distributive Education Clubs of America officers and members become actively involved in the future of their chapter; and (4) a positive image and attitude be created in the community.

        "description":"The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act seeks to: (1) provide vocational education to underserved groups; and (2) encourage program improvement and modernization. Although the General Accounting Office (GAO) believes that Perkins Act funds are being used appropriately for the most part, a number of potential problems were identified regarding program targeting to economically depressed areas (EDAs) and disadvantaged students and the adequacy of program data. GAO's review was conducted in Arkansas, California, Kansas, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. One finding was that there was less program improvement spending in EDAs than in other areas. The study also found that allocation mechanisms can direct funding to more affluent school districts and away from poor  communities. Finally, according to the survey, complete and reliable data on vocational education enrollment and spending, which might have aided the GAO in reaching more definitive conclusions concerning the implementation of the Perkins Act on a nationwide basis, were unavailable at either the national or state levels.

        "description":"In contrast to the view of the elderly as helpless and handicapped, some older adults may engage in helping activities and place considerable importance on this involvement. This study examined the characteristics which may distinguish those elderly persons engaged in the highest amounts of altruistic activity from those reporting lesser degrees of involvement. Respondents were 400 persons between the ages of 65 and 100; 200 were randomly selected from the general community, and 200 came from age-homogeneous apartment complexes. Subjects were classified as high helpers or low helpers based on their responses to altruism scales. Three stepwise discriminant function analyses were performed to predict membership in the two helper groups--one for the entire sample and one for each  residential subsample. A general finding was that the altruistic respondents, in contrast to less helpful subjects, expressed a high degree of willingness to incur costs or risks. Elderly altruists were more likely than the less helpful elderly to perceive themselves as healthy; they possessed personality and motivational characteristics associated with altruism in other age groups, including social responsibility and internal locus of control; and they appeared to experience high degrees of psychosocial well-being. Results of the separate analyses indicated that the study variables accurately classified 87.9% of the cases for the total sample, 92.8% of the senior residents, and 83.4% of elderly respondents in the sample of persons in independent living.
